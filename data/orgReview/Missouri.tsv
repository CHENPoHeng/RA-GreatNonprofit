Callaway County United Way Inc	153434		/users/profile/204237	LTUW	Board Member	5	04/08/2013	I am proud to be a Board Member of the Callaway County United Way, our board takes business seriously and we do our very best to be good stewards of the monies donated to the United Way. We have an awesome director who goes above and beyond her role to make sure our United Way stays connected with the community. We also reach out to work with the agencies to collaborate efforts amongst agencies to ensure our dollars are most effective. 
Callaway County United Way Inc	152909		/users/profile/69460	CCUWBdMbr	Board Member	5	04/06/2013	As a long time board member and volunteer, I can't say enough good things about our organization.  We have hard-working agencies that strive -- and succeed -- every day to serve the needs of our community. We have a great Executive Director, and a truly engaged board, that cares deeply for this community.  Use of funds are scrutinized to ensure they are used per agreement/needs.  We are always looking back to our mission statement to be sure we are on target, and thinking outside of the box regarding fundraising, security additional volunteers, and making sure our messages and info about programs and services available are being heard by those that need it the most.  Because of the caring people in Callaway County, we are successful in getting the job done!
Callaway County United Way Inc	63530	1	/users/profile/69460	CCUWBdMbr	Board Member	5	02/04/2011	I have been involved with this United Way for approximately 13 years  as a donor, and for the last 5 as a board member and volunteer. We are constantly working to improve our organization -- whether it be through establishing goals, a strategic plan, re-working our mission statement, revising our application and process, trying to "think outside the box" in terms of fundraising, and more.   It is amazing that we are able to accomplish so much for our agencies and community -- and the true reason why can be attributed to the dedication and skills of our one employee.  Not a day goes by without another idea or suggestion is mentioned for ways we might look at our organization differently, or something new we might try in order to reach out both to those in need and those that can help. There is much more that we can do, as the needs of the community are great.  I am happy to be a part of such a dedicated group that is trying to find the best practices - the HOW - to meet these needs.
Callaway County United Way Inc	152531		/users/profile/203504	missy959	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	The Callaway County United Way cares deeply for the people they serve.  There is only one paid member of the board and the pay is minimal.  There is essentially no overhead as there is no rented space and all postage and materials are generally donated.  The board members put in a lot of their time and personal finances to try very hard to make as much money as possible to help the community as well as possible.  The programs and services that the Callaway County United Way help to make possible are numerous...from helping the homeless to find shelter to helping the hungry to obtain food.
Callaway County United Way Inc	152466	1	/users/profile/203457	UW-CCUW	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	The greatest thing about the Callaway County United Way is the number of programs and services made available to our community.   The United Way closely monitors their partner agencies, their programs and services, to make sure the most people are served in our community possible.   The are careful that services are not duplicated.    Working together was can accomplish so much!   
Callaway County United Way Inc	141051		/users/profile/187275	blessed65251	Board Member	5	11/18/2012	When I was asked to serve as a board member for the Callaway County United Way, I was humbled and felt very fortunate to be able to do so.  My life story is not a rags to riches drama, but there were times I needed financial assistance and utilized many of the services offered by the United Way.  As I have matured and started making better decisions for myself and my family, our financial status has improved.  How awesome that I can now give back to a program that I use to receive benefits from. I take being a board member very serious.  I know the importance a donated scout scholarship can make to a struggling family.  I realize what it means to have your utility bill paid during the coldest month of the winter.  I know what a bag of groceries mean to a family in need.  The Callaway County United Way funds 14 agencies that touch so many lives.  The amount of research, care, planning and hard work is not measurable.  Our Executive Director, hundreds of volunteers, agencies and their employees and volunteers are so important to our community.  They are true representatives of the heart of Mid-Missouri.  
Callaway County United Way Inc	135424		/users/profile/181287	whitworth	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2012	I am now retired, but have worked for Callaway Social service agencies for about 20 years...now a volunteer.  I am so proud of Callaway United Way and all the board and directors do to support local causes.  The generosity of the citizens and the enormous effort the volunteers put into the programs brings a tremendous benefit to all who are served.  We are a large rural county, with a small population as compared to many....but do a fantastic job serving those in need.  Thanks to CCUW!!!

The CCUW helps fund 14 local agencies -- from the American Red Cross (Callaway County Branch) to SERVE, a local food pantry, transportation system, senior volunteer placement agency, and thrift store.  Each agency we partner with provides much-needed services within our community.  Services include providing basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing, providing counseling, crisis intervention, disaster services, healthcare, housing, senior services, support groups, volunteer opportunities and much more.  Vital to our community, the Callaway County United Way is there to help throughout the year.  
Callaway County United Way Inc	134879		/users/profile/68608	LoriT	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	I am so privileged to work with such a dedicated, creative, fun group of people on the CCUW Board! They account for and spend every dollar as though it were their own, working continuously to find innovative ways to raise funds to continue to support the 14 Callaway County United Way Agencies; twelve months a year. We have an awesome Executive Director and because of her we keep our Administrative costs to minimum. 
Callaway County United Way Inc	62753		/users/profile/68608	LoriT	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	The Callaway County United Way's involvement and support continues to grow in our small community. It is an organization that strives to see to it that their campaign dollars go directly to member agencies that support children, senior citizens, the homeless and hungry in our local community. Each year we look for more ways to grown to help us reach out and touch even more individuals in need within our community! 
Callaway County United Way Inc	134753		/users/profile/180630	Zip1966	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	The Callaway County United Way funds 14 essential local agencies in Callaway County.  Without funding from the CCUW many of our agencies would not exist.  The programs and services provided by our partner agencies are utilized by nearly 20,000 people each year.   
Callaway County United Way Inc	81231		/users/profile/88846	Boudro	Volunteer	4	03/05/2011	I am a Red Cross Volunteer, and while not currently not actively involved in Disaster Services, I have work with members and agencies supported by the Callaway County United Way.  Until  you have done this type of work you may not have the comprehension of just how important the United Way is and how it helps the local community. Additionally, I am not sure the general public realizes the need that exists locally since larger more global issues generate most of the news.  This is a very important and critical agency that provides extremely needed assistance to a vast number of people every year. I hope it can continue to thrive and be supported in the future!
Callaway County United Way Inc	80774		/users/profile/88168	HeatherVod	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I am a Red Cross volunteer.   The Callaway County United Way continues to support our local community.   Keep up the good work!
Callaway County United Way Inc	80771		/users/profile/88163	tjguese	Donor	5	03/01/2011	Callaway County United Way Inc.  is a charity that has helped many people of the community.  It is a part of a large support network that helps those in need and brings this community together.  Without the United Way as a part of the that network the network would not be nearly as effective in helping the people of Callaway County as it is now.  They do a great job in outreach and communitication to make sure memebers of this county know exactly how they can be better neighbors to each other.  And that is an invaluable skill.

They provide assistance with single family fires with food, clothing and sheltering and planning to help disaster families get back on the road to recovery. For many years, they have helped the community be prepared and educated for fires, ice storms, winter weather, floods and other disasters. They teach classes in CPR,First Aid and AED's, train the community with swim lessons and life guarding, pet first aid and baby sitting.

Callaway County United Way Inc	78673		/users/profile/85957	dale	Donor	5	02/27/2011	 I dont have to decide which charity is the most important. They ALL play a vital role in our community and one gift to the United Way will help all the agencies to deliver services to people in need.Payroll deduction makes giving both easy and affordable. For as little as $1 a week, I can change someone's life.

(or something similar to that), and just because it sounded admirable, we would answer, "Give some to charity." 'When the list of charities in our community is presented to us, it can be complicated to keep up with what charity serves what purpose.

Our family donates because of the positive impact all of the agencies and initiatives supported by CCUW have to the health and well being of the people of our county; all people, every age group is on the receiving end of its funding efforts.  I have referred people in crisis to Our House, SERVE, CARDV, the dental initiative, 2-1-1, the Red Cross and know of the benefits they have gotten from those efforts and agencies. A decade ago we often transported residents in need across county lines for services. Agencies like the YMCA and senior center focus on maintaining the well being of county residents, which is equally important. There isn't a wasted dollar; the annual campaigns help all of us to focus beyond our own lives and jobs to the good of the county as a whole.

What would our community be without the services of the Red Cross, Senior Center, CARDV, Kindgom Projects, Serve, Our House, Scouts, 4-H and the YMCA?  These entities are the heart of our community; they provide life changing experiences for their participants. I can't imagine what Callaway County would be like without these programs.  We are blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity for personal growth through them.  Thank you United Way, keep up the good work.  You are making Callaway County a better place to live.

Through 4-H and their shooting sports program, my son has been able to participate in the tryouts for the state shooting teams and for the last few years he has been able to make those teams and go to the national competitions. These national competitions are a wonderful learning experience and they are something that my son will never forget in his lifetime! In addition, my husband and I are instructors for the county. The money that the CCUW gives to the 4-H program helps us fund our program. In the last 3-4 years, our shooting sports program has grown from 15 members to 100+ members. We would not have the recources to support this many kids without them! That is why I am enthusiastic in my support of the CCUW and always encourage others to support them as well.

Callaway County United Way Inc	68165		/users/profile/74485	Concerned Volunteer	Donor	5	02/14/2011	I have seen what United Way support can accomplish.   In the past we never had a way to help the homeless in Callaway County.  Our only resource then was to put them in a local motel.  With the continued support of the United Way, we now have Our House.  Our House provides for the shelter of Callaways homeless when there is no other support left for the homeless.  Wiley House is there for the shelter of individuals, while Haven House provides for the housing needs of families.  The limited dollars of donors can now go much farther because of the lower costs from these programs.   Without the funding that United Way provides, these two programs would not be able to help those at a most crucial time in their life.

As a former administrator for the local senior center, I really dont know how we could have helped so many homebound and hungry senior citizens without their help. So many seniors need help and the CCUW has tirelessly been there! We are a very large county and have an increasing population of the elderly and with the cost of living rising and the state of the economy many seniors would go without a nutritious meal, if not for the CCUW and the fact that people are not just numbers to them , but human beings with a need ,it  is truly heartwarming and a testement to the folks who serve in this fine orginization, Thank you just doesnt seem enough,

Callaway County United Way Inc	65747		/users/profile/71853	Bill J.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I totally support the efforts of the CCUW.  By donating to the United Way I know that my donations will be divided to assist several very worthy organizations.  The CCUW determines the funded organizations needs and there by relieving me of trying to determine how much to give to each one.  I have volunteered many times to each of the following CCUW activities, the radioathon, breakfast with Santa and as a celebrity waiter,  Callaway county is special in that the citizens of Callaway county will step up and take care of those in our county.  Callaway is our home and the residents are our friends and neighbors.  We take care of each other and by donating and volunteering to the CCUW, it allows us all to have a positive impact on many, many people, and I know that if I should find myself in need, the organizations benefiting from the CCUW will be there to help me. 
Callaway County United Way Inc	65638		/users/profile/71750	carol	Donor	5	02/09/2011	The CCUW supports all areas of our community.  Their support of those in need is extremely valuable.

Callaway County United Way Inc	64722		/users/profile/70765	RevDavidMueller	Board Member	5	02/08/2011	I have lived in Callaway County for 17 years.  During all those years I have encouraged members of our church to contribute to various agencies supported by our United Way. For 16 of those years I have been a volunteer with SERVE, particularly with the Adopt-A-Family program before Christmas. For the past 6 years I have served on the SERVE board of directors, now in my second year as Chairman, also having served on the Property committee. I am constantly amazed at the dedication of staff and volunteers of this and other UW agencies, and at how much is accomplished with limited funds. But the need in our community is always greater than our resources, so we constantly strive to encourage more donations. 
Callaway County United Way Inc	64644		/users/profile/70685	Jolson84	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/08/2011	As the Community Engagement Director at Westminster College, I am constantly striving to connect our campus volunteers with positive community agencies. CCUW is one of those agencies that provides so many services to our community and it stands as one of our campus volunteers' favorite and "go to" volunteeer programs. The fundraisers are fun for the volunteers and the volunteer opportunities offered to our students at their 13 different agencies are always fruitful and positive. Thank you CCUW for making my job easier and for providing so many services/programs to our community!

I can't say enough how much the local director, Kathy R. Liddle,  the entire Callaway County UW Board of Directors'  AND the generosity of local businesses, individuals  contribute in not only monetary gifts but their time and effort..SERVE, Inc.'s CALTRAN System's success has in part been due to the positive efforts of the UW fund drives and this has spanned over several decades!!

Callaway County United Way Inc	64344		/users/profile/70350	BobF	Board Member	4	02/07/2011	This not for profit organization touches the most people in the Fulton and Callaway County community.   I have worked as a volunteer and board member for many years for this organization.  The United Way takes donations from our community and reinvests them directly into the community where they are needed the most.  Everyone has a need at some point in their life for services provided by one of these organizations that are funded with these local donations.  These organizations funded by the Callaway County United Way are the backbone of community service in our community.  
Callaway County United Way Inc	64326		/users/profile/70333	g123	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	The Callaway County United Way has a tremendous impact on the residents of our community.  The funding generated from this organization serves various age groups addressing a variety of social, developmental and life needs.  I am impressed with the committment the CCUW has generated from individuals who volunteer, serve on their board and those who give generously each year, including many businesses.  This support would not be present if the organization was not efficient.   
Callaway County United Way Inc	64322		/users/profile/70325	threattd	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	With money being short for so many people the assistance that United Way gives 4-H allows programs to be funded that we might lose.  4-H is a qualilty program for our youth to guide them and build character and confidence in our future adults.  It is a good investment in the future.
Callaway County United Way Inc	64305		/users/profile/70305	Musgrove	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	The CCUW is such a wonderful program, it supports our local 4-H program. I feel that 4-H is very important to our youth, it gives the kids an oppotunity to experience traits hands on, that will help them later on in life when it comes time to choose a career path. The kids are able to do woodworking, welding, cake decorating, sewing, crafts, knitting, livestock, shooting sports, gardening, computers, business adventures, how to be leaders and how to work together as teams. Without the United Way supporting our 4-H program, our children would not be able to have the experiences that they get at county fairs, and learning responsibility. The United Way helps in so many way, but we are so grateful that they help support the 4-H program. Thank You United Way.
Callaway County United Way Inc	64303		/users/profile/70304	Connie	Board Member	4	02/07/2011	CCUW serves a number of agencies within our community.  I see the direct benefits through a number of agencies and organizations I am affiliated with.  Without the financial support and advocating this United Way provides, many fine organizations would suffer both financial loses but also fail at meeting our community needs.  I am proud of the fine work that CCUW does in our county.
Callaway County United Way Inc	64302		/users/profile/70303	Sharon H.	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I have been acquainted with CCUW for 4 years now via the 4-H program.  I have seen first hand what a difference the program has made in several kids, including my own.  The support 4-H receives allows us to help kids grow and become more productive and go out and help more people.  The kids are given a great gift with the support of CCUW and they work to repay it in our community and beyond.I have served as a volunteer, a club leader, a coach and now have taken 4-H to the university level because I feel so strongly about the work done.  Without the support of CCUW none of this would be possible.  We would see a dramatic decrease in self-esteem and an increase in disruptive behavior in our youth.

Callaway County United Way Inc	64279		/users/profile/70273	animaluvr	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	CCUW has provided much assistance to various agencies in our community, but the one I am most familiar with is the Callaway County 4-H program. I am a volunteer within this program and my children are all 4-H members.

I currently am the president of the board of Our House, Callaway County's only homeless shelter.  If the United Way hadn't backed this organization with finances, skills and volunteers we would never have gotten the shelter open.  As a result of their support we have continued to build support in the community and we have been able to help numerous Callaway County person's who have loss jobs and lost their place to live, subsequently find jobs, save enough money for a housing deposit and move into their own living situation.  With increased financial support from the community we have increased our operating hours and during our recent blizzard and frigid temperatures we stayed open 24 hours a day for four days to provide safe haven for the homeless.

In these hard economic times the  United Way works with its member agencies to support those in need. The United Way, it agencies, board and volunteers work tirelessly to increase donations, search for new and innovative fundraising ideas, and make sure that the dollars pledged get to the people in need. I have attended their various fundraisers and the enthusiasm of the board and volunteers, makes me proud to know my dollars are working to better the lives of those in need, right here in our little Mid-Missouri community.   There are a few other questions about your experience and involvement. I would just say your involvement has been just as a participant but you are ready to step up.   And where it asks how you participate  I would say by supporting fundraising activities in the community.   Thanks!

As a student from a big city studying in Fulton you can actually see the fruits of the United Ways labor have a direct impact on the lives of the citizens of this town they don't just collect money they help out the entire community.  Whether it is the Serve buses running to help people without cars get where they need to go, to campaigns to help lower medical costs at the pharmacy.  The people involved with this organization selfishly do so much good and have such a profound impact on the community I live as a whole.  It is quite amazing.

We have had the pleasure of watching a number of kids grow and graduate from the program. Children International does a wonderful job of keeping you informed about your sponsored child, as well as keeping you connected with them thru letters to and from them. They are also very easy to contact with any questions or concerns and prompt in replying. It's very rewarding to know that you are able to help disadvantaged children in the world, and their families, have the necessities that they wouldn't have had otherwise. It's also wonderful that you can provide a better future for them.

I currently sponsor two girls, one in Zambia and one in the Dominican Republic.  I can't say enough good things about how this organization has enriched my life by providing some basic necessities to these children.  The CI staff is absolutely amazing.  In my 27 years as sponsorship, I've received two personal visits from the staff when they were working in the area I live in, just to thank me for my support.

Children International	278397	2	/users/profile/368335	Writer	Donor	5	01/30/2016	I've been sponsoring several children with CI for almost a year now.  Their "Care Team" always answer my questions and so far they have been a pleasure to deal with. To date, I have received updates about the children's living conditions, new yearly photos, educational reports (which I requested) as well as several letters from each child. I have also sent a few "Extra Gifts" (donations that go directly to my sponsored children and their families), which they can use to buy the things they need) and received a report telling me how the family used the money (with photos) as well as a letter from the child expressing their thanks. I plan to stay with CI for a long time to come. Also, to anyone who wonders how their sponsorship money is used - it's all on their website. Click on "About Sponsorship" at the top of the page and then "Benefits of Sponsorship" to learn what the children get and/or "Where Your Donation Goes" to learn how the money you donate is handled.

Children International	272366	4	/users/profile/361397	Writer	Donor	5	11/18/2015	I have been with Children International for over ten years now and couldn't be happier! I began sponsoring Cindy when I was 22 years old and living in Chicago. I decided that I spent the amount that they would need from me to help provide basic needs to a child on coffee every week! So, I gave up going out and buying coffee and instead donated that money to Children International. I receive regular updates that give information on where she lives & housing, her parents and other members of her family, her schooling and health status. I get new pictures and get to send and receive letters too!! Cindy has grown so much since I first began writing to her... She is now a senior in high school and has plans to attend college!! I am proud of her and the beautiful young woman she has become and would have never known her without Children International. I would definitely recommend this charity as a way not only to help provide basic necessities for a young child living in poverty but to get to know them and be a part of their family! 
Children International	268553	3	/users/profile/357285	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	10/28/2015	This Charity harasses women in the street in order to "fund raise", including physically stepping in front of your way to block your path, screaming at you "you look nice"  followed by "I guess you're not", as well as following you up the block while you are trying to go about your business talking about how "pretty your dress is" and other physical attributes.  As far as I can tell, they are paying people to harass women.  And I mean women, because this sort of hyper aggressive "sales" never seems to be happening to the men that walk by.  Supporting them is supporting a culture of inappropriate behavior and harassment.

Children International	265091	1	/users/profile/353836	Writer	Donor	5	10/19/2015	Like most people on this one particular day in downtown Seattle, i was in a rush. For me it was a rush to get to work on time. At first i was hesitant to talk to the guy on the street with the clipboard asking if i wanted to sponsor a child overseas. But being a guy who's interested in foreign cultures, i stopped for a few minutes. Then chatted with the guy and decided to sponsor a child in The Philippines. So here i am nearly 5 years later and i can tell you it's worth it and not just monetarily but spiritually. Even if you can only sponsor a child for 2 years it's worth it. Just in the time that i sponsored my child, i saw him go from a young boy to nearly a young man starting his first year of college. It's nice to know i could help him in some way for a while even though i have a small income myself.

I've received two letters from my sponsored child in DR.  And the staff always seems willing to help me out if I have any questions.  Though that's rare, they always come through.   I've been encouraged to visit the child and I've been made aware of ways to look up the work they're doing by either requesting information directly from them, going to this website and others including BBB.org

Children International	261883	3	/users/profile/350526	Writer	Donor	5	10/06/2015	Over a period of 25 years, we've sponsored children through Children International. We always looked forward to receiving personal letters from our child along with an updated picture. We always received them on a regular basis, plus a letter explaining what our gift monies were spent on (birthdays, holidays etc.)  Having a sponsored child helped us to be more aware of happenings around the world and it also helped the world to seem like a smaller place. We are all connected to each other. Very positive experience the entire time.

Children International	259310	2	/users/profile/347830	User93	Donor	1	09/24/2015	I have to say that my experience with this org has been frustrating and uninformative. I was sponsoring a child in the us and to date I have no idea how my money is been used or how the child is doing. I am unclear how much of my money is going to fund the large apparatus and complex website that the org seems to have, and I have never received an answer as to how specifically my money is being used to help the child engage in various programs, or what those programs even are. 
Children International	253401	2	/users/profile/341586	samaybury	Donor	5	08/19/2015	I was sponsoring my child for 11 years, from aged 8 until she left the program just last month aged 19. It was a very emotional journey and even more so for meeting my child, a few months into my sponsorship. That experience totally changed my life and made me a better person, and all of the money through those 11 years of sponsorship were worth every penny for that experience alone. Nothing can prepare you for the joy and emotion of sponsoring a child, and I implore anyone who can afford that little extra to do so. It also changes the life of that little girl or boy in ways you cannot begin to imagine, and the happiness it brings to them and their family is irreplaceable. There are so many things I could say but there are no words to truly express the feelings involved in such an experience. It is a magical journey from start to finish... but there is no real ending because those memories stay in your heart forever!

Children International	247692	6	/users/profile/335291	Beggsrw	Donor	5	07/07/2015	I have been sponsoring Dorisel for 7 years, and wanted to learn more about her family, their true living conditions, and her.  The local representative sent photos of their home.  I then asked what would be the most important improvement she and her family would like to have made.  A more private and sanitary bathroom and shower enclosure was the answer.  Children International proceeded to develop a plan and cost.  As a General Contractor, the number came back as reasonable, not very detailed, but I trusted them.  At the end of the project, a full report was sent to me with a detailed cost breakdown, and a complete set of photos of the finished product with the family guiding a tour.  A wash basin and water storage was included that I didn't realize was in the plan.  It was terrific to see such a great addition to their lives.  They even brought the project under budget, and were able to purchase cleaning products for the family with the extra $68.  Who could ask for a better, more caring, and trusted partner as Children International.  They far exceeded my expectations.  I look forward to further projects in the future.
Children International	246283	2	/users/profile/333575	jds8535	Donor	5	06/25/2015	Great nonprofit with friendly volunteers.  Hopefully I can sponsor more children in the future.
Children International	246272	1	/users/profile/333560	lsj1210cn	Donor	5	06/25/2015	Via Children International, I've heard a lot of stories of the children who really need help. By donating just a little money every month, I became a sponsor to provide my  sponsored child with some financial support. I am very excited to read his letters, and so happy to know that my donations change his life! I feel very so special to have such great impact on someone's life!
Children International	245199	6	/users/profile/332318	Karen338	Donor	1	06/13/2015	A couple of months ago, I sponsored a brother and sister. The demographic information listed on the computer reflected they were the only children of a family living in the Dominican Republic. This lead me to believe I was the only sponsor for this family. The computerized demographics also reflected the father was a daily worker earning $100 dollars per month and that they lived in a 2 berm house with only 2 beds which lead me to believe the siblings slept together. Based upon this information, I believed the family needed some immediate relief and could probably use some extra money for food and essentials such as another bed. Subsequently, I gifted several hundreds of dollars allowing Children's International to supervise the needed items to the family thinking the monies would be used for basic necessities for the family. Now, I am receiving pictures, correspondence, and information from Children's International that their are 7 children total with 4 other sponsors for the family. Additionally, I have received documentation and pictures advising me that my hard earned money went to buy bicycles for both children, multiple toys for not only my sponsored children but for other children in the household that I did not sponsor nor was I made aware of their existence at the time of sponsorship. Very few groceries, to include a pack of diapers, were purchased and given the size of the household, such groceries would last only a day or two. I consider them token groceries intended to justify the allocation of the monies. I have contacted Children's International to basically ask them what the heck is going on here. They did did acknowledge there are more children and more sponsors for the family. They are checking into the reported 2 bed situation and hopefully the reported income. I seriously doubt either is accurate and if they are, why were my monies used primarily for toys. I want to know who is responsible for this bait and switch. Is it the family providing false information or the Children's International office who input the data into the computer. I am glad the children liked their toys; however, I do not appreciate the bait and switch or the abuse in the spending of the funds I provided for what I was lead to believe would go primarily for basic necessities and not toys. I wish I had not paid in advance for a years sponsorship for both children. I am seriously at a loss as to what to do as I have already established a relationship with the children and they are not responsible for the bait and switch scheme being perpetrated here. I wish I had donated my monies to the local food bank where my funds would have been used better.

They truly connect you with your children, one to one, by providing you with extensive information on your child's progress. The impact it affords the sponsors is as rewarding as that it is for the children. I've experienced other charities in the past. Children International exceeds all. I'm blessed to be a part of this organization.
Children International	238350	1	/users/profile/323562	alnover	Volunteer	5	02/22/2015	We have been sponsoring two children from the Philippines for the past 5-6 years, and just agreed to sponsor a third child. We love the letters the children send us. They are so thankful for the assistance needed to stay in school and for the very basic amenities that $32 a month provides. It's a great teaching tool for my own 4 children to see first hand what a little charity at home can do for other children who are not so blessed as we are. I absolutely love the program, and hope to be able to continue supporting my kids after the age out at 18 so that they can go to college. Please check out this wonderful organization. You will not be disappointed .Al Nover Bedford NH

I love the letters & pictures of the progress, growth, & resources that my sponsorship furnishes for her. It is wonderful to be able to communicate directly through letters & pictures. I just had the blessing of sponsoring another child. This time I choose an older child, in a different country, that had been waiting a while. It is exciting to know that one person CAN make a significant difference in the world. One child at a time.
Children International	234580	4	/users/profile/300826	n23foster	Donor	5	11/27/2014	I started sponsoring 3 children in the Philippines in March, 2013, after researching several similar programs.  I have been so impressed by the work that Children International does, and the responsiveness they have demonstrated after terrible typhoons hit the Philippines in 2013 and 2014.  When I saw the incredible benefits my 3 sponsored children received for the modest monthly payment, I added 4 more children this year.   And I can honestly say that sponsoring these kids has been one of the most gratifying things I've ever done in my life.  From their letters, I learn about how their lives have been changed by these benefits.  The kids have great hope for the future, and are working hard in school to achieve the dreams they'd never dared to dream before Children International.
Children International	234460	1	/users/profile/299374	Diana79	Donor	5	11/25/2014	My husband and I have been sponsoring a child through Children International (CI) for 5 months now, and it has been such a positive experience for us that we decided to sponsor a second child. I chose this organization because it had one of the lower sponsorship fees ($28/month) and we felt we could afford this amount. I also liked the fact that CI is a secular, not a religious organization  I believe that a person's spiritual beliefs are very personal, and would not want our sponsored children to have an organization's religion forced upon them in order to receive benefits. Children International encourages letters between the child and the sponsor, and makes it very easy for the Sponsor to write a letter "online" and attach photos if desired. CI then prints out my letter and photos and delivers them to our child! It is such a thrill to receive a letter from Paola or Luis, and feel our "heart connection" across the miles! CI also encourages visits between the child and Sponsor, and we hope to visit our sponsored kids in Mexico in the next year or two. It's important to me that an organization provide not just a "handout" but a "hand up" to a child in poverty. Children International has Community Centers in each of the areas it serves, which allow it to provide many services to the kids, including nutritional, medical, dental and educational programs. As the children grow up, CI offers an array of programs for youth/teens to help them break the cycle of poverty, and to become leaders in their community: https://www.children.org/youth-development A program CI offers that benefits me personally is a social networking site for sponsors called My Social Center, which allows us (the Sponsors) to communicate with each other, sharing letters and photos from our sponsored kids, asking questions of each other, encouraging each other, and meeting new friends, who share our values, care and concern for children and their families over the world. Choosing to sponsor a child through Children International is one of the best decisions we have ever made - we am happy and proud to be part of their wonderful work!
Children International	234390	1	/users/profile/298605	Molly39	Donor	5	11/24/2014	My husband and I sponsor three wonderful children through Children International.  We have found the organization to be nothing but helpful and courteous in every way, shape, and form.  Watching "our" kids grow and knowing the difference we are making in their lives is so rewarding!  And it's not just "knowing" the difference, but it's "SEEING" the difference!  Our kids write to us, send us drawings and pictures, we have been able to help out with several projects for them to make their lives easier (by our own request, not by CI's), and someday, we plan to visit all three of them.  This has been just a remarkable experience and is one that I wouldn't trade for the world.  I highly recommend!
Children International	233236	1	/users/profile/296947	faddy	Donor	5	11/08/2014	Barely a month before my trip to visit family in New Delhi, I learned about the Children International's Teresa Tilden center during a CI SF Bay area luncheon meeting. Being a part of CI for the last 2 years, I have always wondered how CI worked at the ground level and this was a perfect opportunity to find that out! I met up with the CI staff in New Delhi and was immediately struck by their warm personalities. As we walked around on a tour of the community center, I was pleasantly surprised by how well planned and organized everything was: the nutrition center, the health clinic with the orderly health checkups, the well stocked library and an up to date computer center. The thing that struck me the most was the genuine passion and caring nature of every one who worked there. The center acts like an oasis of hope to the community (which we visited later) where children run bare foot in a neighborhood overwhelmed by poverty, chaos and garbage. I also took part in some of the activities that the center hosts for the children. The first was the computer literacy class; I was highly impressed by the smart kids, who haven't touched a computer before in their lives, showing me how they use MS paint! In the library session that followed, 7-8 year olds read out loud from books, some with confidence, some with sheepishness; but all of them incredibly adorable! Then I had a career counseling session with the youth of the community; discussing their ambitions as they looked for jobs, hoping to break out of poverty. It was heartbreaking to see the teenagers coming to terms with the reality of the outside world, but also heartening to see how CI has provided them hope where they now feel they can achieve their dreams. The true enormity of the task on CI's plate hit me then: helping children break out of the circle of poverty can't be done with education alone. I was very encouraged to see CI taking steps to address the fact that the children need support and help in all aspects of their lives: physical and mental health, a stress free social environment and support from surrounding communities. The whole staff is passionate, dedicated and employ ingenious ideas to solve problems; tie ups with local medical centers and job agencies provide the much needed support. All in all, I came back with optimism, a sense of pride to be associated with CI and an overwhelming feeling of gratitude to all the people involved in this effort. I am signing up to sponsor another child soon.
Children International	214758	2	/users/profile/278052	kalwarov	Donor	5	09/11/2014	I sponsor two children with Children International. This experince has been everything that I could hope for. The difference that one can make with auch a small effort is amazing.  I know that people can spare 30 dollars a month to make sure that kids can just eat food and drink clean water. It blows my mind that the issues Children International has to deal with are still even issues. The fact that I'm writing this review from my Ipda while some kid is currently fighting to find clean water is upsetting.  It really boils don to selfishness,  people can justify why these issues are happening all day long but when it comes down to it if more people gave leas people would die and that's the simple truth.

It is astonishing that for such a tiny amount of money I can make such a big difference in couple of lives.I am impressed at the scale at which they operate and how comprehensive their help is. The children are definitely given a great chance at having a normal life that we take for granted.CI has opened a new chapter in the Silicon Valley and I am extremely impressed with the energy, commitment and excitement shown by the CI folks, particularly Maria Elena Franco and Lianne Heller.  I wish them luck and will do my best to help them succeed.

I have currently started sponsoring my third child. The organization is run efficiently & I receive letters & pictures of my sponsored child on a regular basis. It makes me feel good to know I am helping a child & family in need. There is so much sadness & need in the world, people that have the resources to help others should do it. This is a way you can help others & yourself to feel better & send love into the world. We could all use a little more of that, right?
Children International	211922	2	/users/profile/274875	tstamm	Donor	5	08/22/2014	We have been sponsoring "our child" for a number of years and though we will likely never meet face to face know we are doing our part to make her life better.  We know Children's International to be  honorable in their efforts and a great resource in improving the lives of many children through their efforts.   Members of our church family have visited the facilities in Haiti and met with their children.  They've seen first hand where the funds go, and how they are used.  Give generously and know, it is money well spent.  
Children International	211857	1	/users/profile/274798	Lorene D.	Donor	5	08/22/2014	The connection with children in another country is both interesting and rewarding.  We have so many blessings and it is another blessing to be able to help these young folks to thrive and succeed.  Children International is a trusted and valued organization that allows us to do this important work.
Children International	211753	2	/users/profile/274689	Linda288	Donor	5	08/21/2014	I like receiving letters from family members of my sponsored child and the coloring or number pictures. I have been pleased that I get an updated picture of my child.
Children International	211305	1	/users/profile/274212	karenjmenell	Donor	5	08/20/2014	It is a wonderful experience sponsoring a child.  I know that everything I can give will give him and other children a better and more joyful life.  It brings me joy to hear how happy he is when he hears from me or when I am able to provide more help in times of need.  He is so grateful.  It is the second child I have sponsored and I will sponsor children as long as I am able.
Children International	211190	2	/users/profile/274082	ddezube	General Member of the Public	5	08/19/2014	We sponsored a child from the Dominican Republic from the time she was 5 until she graduated from high school this year. She is now headed off to become the first person in her family to attend college. Her tuition is remarkably small -- about the cost of one class at a US community college. It's uplifting to be able to change a person's life so dramatically just by making sure she had enough money to pay school fees and for supplies.  We hope to repeat the cycle with a new child this year.  If you're thinking of sponsoring a child, please go for it!
Children International	211056	1	/users/profile/273905	Carol158	Donor	5	08/18/2014	I sponsored a child, and I sponsored another child in my sons name and he is so excited to see the letters arrive in the mail. I have my child's picture on my wall and every one asks if she is related to me and I say yes and no because even though I don't write letters to her as I would like I still consider her family.

Children International	210727	2	/users/profile/273516	Judith Z.	Donor	5	08/14/2014	I've sponsored a child since 2011. I've recently been notified that her family (and many others in Chile) have been lifted out of poverty and my sponsor child has graduated the program...early! I was thrilled to be her sponsor and loved getting letters from her.  I appreciate what Children International has done to bring Chilean children out of poverty.
Children International	210684	2	/users/profile/273471	angkan1	Donor	5	08/14/2014	I have been a sponsor for children.org for over 7 years.  It has been so rewarding seeing my sponsored child grow and flourish.  My own children look forward to getting the new pictures and letters from our sponsored children and it teaches them about other cultures and teaches them what a great thing helping others can be.  Its also so easy to do.  You can just set up a monthly payment and never have to be bothered with sending a check etc. every month.  And when you consider how quickly in our every day lives we can spend $25 on things we don't probably need,  this is the best $25 per month spent.
Children International	210635	2	/users/profile/273406	AmandaKStallings	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	I've been a sponsor for my child for 9.5 years.  I wanted to help and I knew that as one person I was limited to how much I could do, but joining forces with Children International I was able to do so much more.  I am a working mother and between those two jobs, I don't have any spare time to volunteer.  But for a very minimal amount every month, I can make someone's life better.  And it's not just better, in some cases it could mean the difference of surviving.  I love knowing that I've made a difference in my child's life and also his family's life too.  Now his parents don't have to worry about how to make ends meet.  If every person who was financially able would donate to just one child, it could mean the end of world hunger.
Children International	210569	3	/users/profile/273340	p_jaffke	Donor	5	08/13/2014	I have sponsored children through CI since 1987, 27 years!  I can personally attest that the money I donate goes directly to the children.  Once, when a hurricane hit Honduras, I didn't know right away how my chiild was impacted.  Just in case, I donated extra money to pay for any possible damages they may have endured.  CI sent me pictures of all the materials, cookware, etc, that my donation bought.  They had it itemized down to the penny.  A few years later I visited my child.  I can truly say it was one of the most emotional experiences of my life.  And, yes, I saw first hand all the items that I had bought.  By the end of the visit, I don't know who was crying harder, me or the mother of Jessica. CI is doing some incredible work, nurturing the child physically, mentally and emotionally.  Education is stressed throughout their sponsorship.  Leadership is encouraged and taught so their work can grow exponentially.  If you want your donation to be used wisely and efficiently, I strongly suggest donating to CI. 
Children International	210358	2	/users/profile/273119	Tatiana2	Donor	5	08/12/2014	Children international is an open book with where your money goes. In addition if you have struggles at all they can set up breaks in payment etc. 
Children International	210325	2	/users/profile/273086	Nubia	Donor	5	08/12/2014	I sponsor three girls now. I started just with one  three years ago but I saw that Childrens International is a great charity and trust them. The management, the organization, the employees make CI  a charity that you can trust and be sure that your money is getting to the right place. If you can, please do not hesitate and sponsor a kid. You will make a difference in  their  lives and in this world.
Children International	210055	3	/users/profile/272796	galinda410	Donor	5	08/11/2014	I currently sponsor 15 children through Children International. Throughout the years I've been a sponsor, I've enjoyed receiving letters and photos from the children. I feel that Children International is a trustworthy organization to contribute to. Their partnering with companies like TOMS has made special gift giving affordable to the donor and allows children to receive what they need. 
Children International	209609	2	/users/profile/272366	Jason73	Donor	5	08/08/2014	I have been donating to this organization for over 5 years and through their communication and photographs I have been able to see the impact of my funds towards my sponsored child. It's very gratifying to know that such a small amount can make such a huge difference!
Children International	209457	2	/users/profile/272220	delolymarion	Donor	4	08/08/2014	I am very satisfied with the organization and recommend them to any person willing to donate.
Children International	209029	2	/users/profile/271788	dhickman77	Donor	5	08/06/2014	This is by the best organizaion  i been sponsoring from children international for 6 years now i love sporing children from Children International
Children International	208983	2	/users/profile/271742	Kevin J.	Donor	5	08/06/2014	This is by far the best organization for helping & sponsoring children through out the world.
Children International	208866	2	/users/profile/271617	Yamil N.	Donor	4	08/06/2014	I have always dreamed of helping kids. I have tried and done voluntary work in my country, which has been really rewarding. However, I feel I have done things in a especially gratifying way since I started sponsoring a child with CI. For one thing, you can sponsor a child through CI, irrespective of the country you live in.Also, CI helps lots of kids all over the world and shows you who these children are in a myriad of ways, even in the stage when you are deciding whether to sponsor or not. Then, while thinking about sponsorship, you can browse through this long list of kids that need help. You're presented with a picture and a short profile of each child's situation and general needs. Having the opportunity to let a child's face or story transmit something to you in a very personal way --in such a way you tell yourself, I want to sponsor *this* child-- is something I truly appreciated of CI, and which is not possible in my country, wherein --for one thing-- you cannot sponsor individual children. Sponsoring a child is such a special experience, and CI helps you make the best of it: you are allowed to write to your child as much as you want, and you'll be sure getting a letter from him/her once a year, as well as a picture (to see how he/she is growing). And you'll probably get more letters too, if you write often or send them special gifts (which you can pick yourself and send, or donate money to CI so that they buy what your child needs).I emphasize on letters and pictures as they are the highlight of the sponsoring "benefits" for me. I get to see how my sponsored child grows, how he bonds with me, and knows about me. And I can see, from the stuff he gets from CI (and from seeing, for example, he has braces in a picture), that my money is indeed allowing him to go to school, receive medical care, have a (better) chance in life...CI also offers a great customer service. Every person you talk to on the phone or chat to (you can do that, and it's great if you are not within the US) is extremely nice and helpful. They try to make your sponsorship experience the best for you. That is something else I truly appreciate.Another perk of sponsoring with CI is the chance to visit your child. I have to live that experience to comment on how CI handles it, but I've read marvelous accounts from fellow donors, and the fact that they offer you the chance to go to the community your child lives in, discover further needs and advantages of the program and give a big hug to that kid that holds a special place in your heart is just wonderful.All in all, even though sponsoring in dollars from Argentina is hard, and sometimes I wonder whether my child would be better off with a wealthier sponsor, I cherish my experience, try to do my best and, of course, thank CI deeply for letting me enter the life of my sponsored child and make a difference.
Children International	208651	2	/users/profile/271386	nesharps	Donor	5	08/05/2014	I have been sponsoring a child from the Philippines for about 3 years now and it is truly remarkable what CI is doing for children across the world. I started donating when I was a college student (yes, a very poor college student and it was still affordable), and I will be increasing my donations soon. CI makes it easy to donate, is thoroughly supportive with the process, and allows me to have a great relationship with my sponsored child. This is truly a great non-profit. 
Children International	208370	1	/users/profile/271050	got_angel	Donor	5	08/01/2014	This is a great non-profit organization. It awesome because you can write to your sponsored child and get to know them personally. Children International  mission is to provide youth educational, nutritional & medical support and skill building to successfully join the workforce. 
Children International	208194	1	/users/profile/270869	Maria98	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I began sponsoring with CI when I was in college and then once my sponsor child, Nilton, moved away from the CI community I felt disconnected and supported other organizations. I proceeded to earn an MA in International Conflict Resolution and worked abroad in poverty alleviation for the next 3+ years. When returning to the US, I met an incredible woman and major donor of CI. She and her husband were extremely passionate about the work being done in developing countries and invest very generously to ignite youth empowerment. I began volunteering and developing the local San Francisco Chapter of Children International. Then after visiting the field/ 8 community centers in Dominican Republic, selecting a child from the community, and sponsoring a young man named Juan Pablo,  I now work full time for CI. I have never had such an amazing opportunity to see my daily work translate into a meaningful impact on tackling poverty. 
Children International	208170	1	/users/profile/270846	sssshogan	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I've been involved with Children International since the late 80s.  I started off with a single child for many years, then began sponsoring multiple kids about 9 years ago.  With a total of 27 kids, I can say that my experience has been very positive and life-changing. The one-on-one relationship is what I find attractive.  It's not simply cutting a check to a faceless agency that may or may not do something meaningful with the funds. Better yet, I have had the pleasure of traveling to seven countries (they have a presence in 11) and meeting each child and her family in person, most of them several times now.  I view them as part of my extended family and they feel the same way about me.   If you're looking to make a positive difference in the life of a child, I highly recommend you take a look at Children International's program.  You'll be glad you did.
Children International	207820	1	/users/profile/270505	bfranco	Donor	5	07/30/2014	My wife and I are currently supporting a young girl in Central America. In light of the current flow of people from Central America to the southern border of the U.S.  I'm very heartened by our direct support for this one child. We need to grow this one-to-one support exponentially as it seems formal governmental systems are stuck in stuck. I'm confident Children's International is building the infrastructure for this exponential growth.
Children International	207663	1	/users/profile/270339	Jmendez	Donor	5	07/29/2014	Im a three years donor in Children International. I never even figurate how much impact are going to be in my life the moment when I meet my sponsored children. Definitely I recommend to be a sponsor with CI and contribute to have a better world helping a child. 
Children International	207646	1	/users/profile/270321	liannefhaller	Volunteer	5	07/29/2014	I'm 21 and I am the proud sponsor of 2 CI kids.  My father has been sponsoring children with CI for over a decade and this year, I sponsored my own two children (a little boy in India and a little girl in the Philippines).  I've grown up being skeptical of this and that nonprofit my father decided to sign up for because they never really addressed the basic issue of poverty that the children lived in.  Children International is the only one I've found that really does lift children out of poverty using education as their instrument.  It's an instrument that took my mother out of poverty and now, she's the idol for my cousins on the maternal side of my family.  This year, I interned for the CI Bay Area Chapter - a huge success!  I saw the inner workings of how CI really works and what they achieve all over the world.  I'm proud to say that I will support this organization no matter what hardships they face; they will persevere and continue to uphold a long-standing tradition of educating youth and empowering them to become facilitators for real change.

Children International	194214	1	/users/profile/253738	TeriVanGoGo	Donor	5	02/12/2014	I love Children International!  I sponsor two girls here in the USA and have for several years.  Everything from the new website layout, which provides a lot of great information about the children you sponsor, to being able to send gifts through the year, they make sponsorship easy and fun.  I love receiving letters from the girls I sponsor and I love getting messages from Children International letting me know what exactly me donations provided, such as new shoes for school, new books, school supplies, etc.  I sponsor a girl in the USA for each of my grandsons.  I am happy that I am able to support children in our country, to help them know that they are valued and an important part of our society.  I hope that my sponsorship makes them as happy as it does me.  I love this organization and all of their hard work.  And I've never regretted a penny.  Thank you!
Children International	194058	1	/users/profile/253524	JennyP79	Donor	5	02/10/2014	This is the sponsorship organization of choice for me, for the last 8 or 9 years I have sponsored a number of kids in various countries and I love their pictures and the ability to communicate with them.  CI does a great job keeping me inform, they impact the child live, family and the community and they are very accountable with the use of funds.  The greatest thing that I get is how big is the impact of my contribution, a great ROI.
Children International	193865	3	/users/profile/253258	TeresaKeller	Volunteer	5	02/06/2014	I've been sponsoring children since my college days, but it wasn't until I visited my child and volunteered for CI in India for a month that I truly understood the depth of their impact. It's not just about food, clothing and shoes, it's about a holistic system that empowers youth and their community not only to get out of poverty, but to become the ones who then gift back to others. I've spent my career managing non-profits, and this is the most effective organization I've seen for true child and community development.
Children International	192316	2	/users/profile/251095	adrian0214	Donor	5	01/09/2014	Children International is one of the few non profit organizations that I have talked to my family and friends about because they have actually stood by their mission as far back as I remember. I am a proud sponsor of an eight year old in the Philippine Islands and I am looking forward to continuing to support Children International in their future endeavors!
Children International	192146	3	/users/profile/250837	mackymack	Donor	5	01/06/2014	I have been sponsoring kids with Children International since 2008. My family currently sponsors 17 children through this organization. We have sponsored (and still sponsor) with other programs, but we prefer Children International because of how this organization encourages sponsors to be truly involved with their children. We visit our kids frequently, and Children International has always gone above and beyond to make the time spent with our kids an extra special experience. The organization is willing to work with sponsors to facilitate special fundraising projects that will benefit our individual children - such as paying for medical procedures, home improvements, income generation, etc.  The Children International staff are friendly and qualified, both at their U.S. headquarters and in the countries they service.  By visiting my children at their homes, I have been able to see first hand all the benefits that they receive through their sponsorship and how much these benefits are appreciated by the families. Even if a sponsor is not able to visit, we are kept informed about our child's progress through regular reports, letters, and photographs. One of the great features of Children International is their Youth Programs - which help teens make the transition into adulthood and provide them with opportunities that can assist them in breaking the cycle of poverty.  I am very impressed by this organization, and I will continue to sponsor kids through Children International until the day I die (and beyond, thanks to life insurance). 
Children International	188260	2	/users/profile/245588	smw51	Donor	5	11/10/2013	I have 4 children with this charity and am able to stay in touch with all 4.  When one young man aged out I sponsored his youngest sister.  I have also sent extra money to help the family during crises such as typhons  The $100 dollars was well spent on repairing thier humble home and getting food and garden supply. I recieved pictures of the donation with my sponsored child  His letter later confirmed he had recieved my gift thank you for doing a great job  Sue W
Children International	178279	1	/users/profile/234891	Teesa	Donor	5	10/16/2013	I have been sponsoring a child now for 18 mos. and recently started sponsoring his two sisters as well. I can't say how impressed I am with the amount of good this non profit does with so little. I now donate $30/mo per child, and the children receive health and dental care, help with education, clothing, school supplies, etc. And the whole community benefits as well.In addition, I am able to send "special needs gifts" which are monetary and used for that child. The field worker takes photos of the children and of the gifts and the kids write wonderful letters. In addition, I have been able to donate what's called an "income generating" gift to help the family start a small business. The reports I receive are detailed and business like. Whenever I phone the organization with questions, staff members are so helpful! There's also a website where I can connect with other sponsors and learn about them and their children--we can share experiences and ideas. If I were able, I'd even be allowed to visit my sponsored kids in person. I always wanted grandchildren but never had any--now I feel as if I have three! I worked for 30 years as a non profit fund developer and know first hand the challenges in supporting such a program. I'm amazed at how little of the donation goes to overhead and how much to helping the children and the communities. Years ago I donated to another child sponsorship organization and it was good, but can't compare with Children International.
Children International	178051	2	/users/profile/234670	Pushpa T.	Donor	5	10/16/2013	I have been a donor/sponsor for over 2 decades with Children International. They have always been very good and I have not had any complains. I have sponsored kids that have graduated out of the program.  Currently I have a 10 year old girl from Kolkata, India. This year on my visit to Kolkata I requested to meat my sponsored child. It was a wonderful visit. The staff in Kolkata were really wonderful. They knew the family, they were very mindful of Priyanka, my sponsored child and knew her family. We went to lunch and took Priyanka shopping. The staff were very helpful and took us to places where the family and Priyanka were comfortable at. There was no pressure to give anything more. My daughter who is also 10 became friends with Priyanka and they drew pictures and talked. I asked a lot of questions and got direct responses. On the whole it was a wonderful experience. I was really pleased about the services that were being provided to the kids and to the community. Next time I visit, we will go to Priyanka's village. The family invited us and the staff assured us that it could be easily arranged.The staff was so dedicated to the work and it was such a pleasure and honor to meet the people that do this great work!!Congratulations to Children International and best wishes for all your future projects. Pushpa
Children International	172359	2	/users/profile/228114	jct20042000	Donor	5	09/29/2013	I have been sponsoring children for 17 years.  I am currently sponsoring 2 children, a little boy in Honduras and a young man, who recently graduated high school, in the Philippines.  I will be sponsoring one of the siblings of my young man in the Philippines when he graduates from the program.  I adore my sponsored children, and the letters and pictures they send me give me a lot of joy.
Children International	170863	2	/users/profile/226309	babslizzie	Volunteer	5	09/20/2013	I have been a sponsor of Maria for about 8 years.  She is now 13 years old, and I have enjoyed watching her progress, through annual pictures and letters that she now writes herself.   When she was very young, her mother wrote the letters. Children International is a very worthwhile non-profit, where your contributions make a big difference in the lives of children.  
Children International	170755	1	/users/profile/226178	moca	Donor	5	09/19/2013	We have sponsored children through Children International for over a decade and have been very pleased with the way it is run. We get detailed letters telling specifically what our donations have purchased for our sponsored child as well as updates on our child, his family, his country, etc. Best of all, we receive hand-written notes from our child and are able to write back. It is a truly rewarding experience!
Children International	170440	2	/users/profile/225805	Betsydavis	Donor	5	09/18/2013	I started sponsoring one young woman in India when she was 17 years old. When she graduated from the program at age 19 I took on a younger girl in Mexico. I also joined LiftOne - a social website for CI sponsors to share information. I discovered that I had been missing out on a lot of the sponsor experience. I now sponsor 2 young girls in Mexico, and 2 girls in Guatemala. The things I like about Children International :- They are not religious based - the children are not required to belong to a, or any religion in order to receive help - they get enrolled into the program based on need.- the sponsorship experience is GREAT! You get back more then you put in. I receive letters from all my girls on a routine basis. Also I have mailed packages of gifts to the girls and gotten back thank you letters with pictures of the things I sent. I have also sent extra money for the children and their family to improve their lives - such as purchasing materials to repair a leaking roof. I received back heartfelt thank you letters along with pictures of what the money had been spent on.- when I have contacted the service reps at the Kansas City office the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful.- you are allowed and encouraged to visit your sponsored children if you are able to. I am going to be doing just that in November of this year- CI follows all the regulations of world organizations to ensure the children are protected and kept safe. Every time I interact with CI staff I have no doubt the staff believe that the children are their first priority.- I know that I am able to impact a child's life in a positive manner - not only do they learn that someone they don't even know cares about them, but in many more tangible ways too.
Children International	170099	1	/users/profile/225394	TimP	Donor	5	09/17/2013	I don't have any kids but wanted to help children with few opportunities.  I've traveled a lot and know that some situations are so heart breaking and hopeless.   I am so happy and gratified that Childrens International is there to help and provides a way for people like me to help. Thank you so much. 
Children International	169143	1	/users/profile/224171	namalada	Donor	4	09/11/2013	i have been a sponsor with Children International for many years.   I do not have any complaints with my dealings with them.  I always get a quick response to  my questions.  The website is very easy to use and I am able to write my sponsor children very easily.  
Children International	168155	2	/users/profile/223045	Sharon's S.	Donor	5	09/07/2013	I love being a sponsor at Children International. I sponsor with several child sponsorship organizations and Children International is my favorite. I have sponsored with CI since I was in high school and there are so many good things about this organization that I don't know where to start! Here are some special things that I love about it:  1. Sponsors are able to build relationships with their children through letters, photos, visits, donations and this relationship will last a lifetime for the child and for the sponsor. CI encourages this and as a result, the children blossom under the care of a caring sponsor. 2. There are many ways to interact with other sponsors and communicate with the staff. Most of my interactions with the staff have been very pleasant and helpful. One Senior Staff member is charge of my account because I have so much go on with various sponsorships and she does her best to answer my questions and give me requested information. Sponsors are able to communicate with other sponsors on LiftOne, a wonderful community where we can share photos, letters, thoughts on blogs, message boards that are there to answer questions.  3. CI provides many opportunities for sponsors to help their sponsored children through many kinds of donations like basic things that a child gets from sponsorship like clothing, shoes, birthday gifts, Easter and Christmas gifts. Sponsors are able to send funds for special needs to help families and sponsors are also able to send packages to their children and receive thank you letters and photos.Sponsors are also able to work together to help each other with special fundraisers for our children. 4. Communication with the sponsored child is very good as sponsors and children exchange letters. Sponsors can write letters or communicate through emails on their personal accounts and there is some cool stationery that can be used. The children love to receive letters from their sponsors and often keep them in special locations in their homes. 5. CI provides opportunities for sponsors to sponsor more than one child in a family and there are opportunities to do group sponsorships. This is where a group of sponsors may work together to sponsor a particular child and raise funds to provide for special needs. 6. CI provides opportunities for sponsors to visit their children and this is one thing that I really love about the organization. It is easy to set up a visit and the staff at the field agencies in each country are competent, caring, and work very hard to make sure that visits are a success! 7. Sponsors have the opportunity to provide for a child's further schooling when they graduate from the program if the child wants to pursue an education,  and the sponsor and child can continue to maintain contact once a child graduates from CI, if the child wants to. CI offers scholarships for children and provides programs which help them develop leadership skills,  personal and civit responsibility, and other skills.  8. Sponsors can receive news and updates on the CI website, Journey's magazine, newsletters from their child's field agency. If you are looking for an organization that  really makes a difference in the life of a needy child,  provides good communication and accountability, is flexible and efficient,  provides opportunities for sponsors to interact and share ideas, really cares about helping children, then CI is one that you will definitely want to be a part of!!
Children International	168056	2	/users/profile/222947	lindarevey	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2013	Nothing gives me more satisfaction, than knowing I can at least help one child through school. He also gets birthday and holiday gifts and acknowledgements from me and I get to write to him and it warms my heart to receive letters back. I also get to help his family with gifts once in a while too, and if it helps, then I am happy to do it because I know it is something they can use like dishes or blankets.  I love and care for this child as if he were my own grandson. I have sponsored him for almost 3 years now, and as long as I am able to do so, I will continue. Thank you
Children International	167969	2	/users/profile/222858	Lynne16	Donor	5	09/06/2013	My experience with Children International from the start has been extremely satisfying. The staff are consistently helpful and good at addressing concerns and questions. For the past two years since signing up as a donor I've sent a packet of clothes as a gift for Daniela in December and have been rewarded with delightful snapshots of my Daniela in her new duds both times. I plan on visiting her there in Honduras some year in the future.

Children International	166889	3	/users/profile/120273	John Prendiville	Donor	5	09/04/2013	I have sponsored  with Children International since 2005.  I've sponsored 8 children, mostly from Central America. The experience has been fantastic. Most charities take your money and your next contact is the junk mail. With Children International, the size of the relationship is in your control.  The small monthly expense is a minor part of the potential experience.  Immediately, you begin a letter and photo exchange. You begin to know your child and her family. You can ask that CI do an assessment of the family's needs. If you wish, you can give the family additional help, such as beds, building materials, plumbing, or just a trip to the grocery store.  You can also work with CI to ensure that your child receives a proper education. You fill in the missing pieces that kids in the developed world take for granted, such as food and school. You can provide them with their best opportunity in life. And my experience is that they drink it up. They know the value of what you are offering and they appreciate it so much..   I have a continuing relationship with two of my CI graduates. One is in a University Business Administration program, and the other is finishing her second year in a four year Registered Nursing program. I'm very proud of each of my kids.  Starting sponsoring through CI was honestly the best decision I've ever made. It's enriched my life as much as my kid's lives. Directly giving back to one person is what I needed. And it's probably the only shot this kid will have. And the staff at CI is top notch. They make it easy and guide you through everything. I can't recommend this charity more highly. 
Children International	99626	6	/users/profile/120273	John Prendiville	Donor	5	10/22/2011	I've come to sponsor 8 kids. CI has worked with me to develop great relationships with them. They go to their homes and find their needs. They help them into schools. They work with contractors to improve their homes. They work with utilities to keep their electricity on. They take them to the dentist and eye doctor. They do whatever I request of them. They're great. To those obsessed with the CEO's income, Dante Dante defined Envy  as "a desire to deprive other men of theirs." Envy can be directly related to the Ten Commandments, specifically "Neither shall you desire... anything that belongs to your neighbour".  Aquinas described envy as "sorrow for another's good".  I suggest you get a life and stop hating others for what have failed to accomplish. 
Children International	166703	2	/users/profile/221460	yingand_yang	Donor	5	09/01/2013	I have been sponsoring children through this organization for almost ten years.  I did my due diligence by checking out Children International (CI) through several rating agencies and found them to be very reputable.  More than 80% of the revenues received by them are used to help impoverished children and their families.   The one on one sponsorship with each child has been very rewarding and watching them grow-up is truly an amazing experience and you can see the impact sponsorship has given the children as well as their families who are very grateful.  You get letters, yearly pictures and you are encouraged to visit if you want too.  I did visit my first child I sponsored and I am planning to visit the five I sponsor now in the near future.  CI also has a social network called Lift One where other sponsors share their experiences and updates on their children.  Jim Cook the CEO is very smart and all the staff at CI are very caring and helpful when the need is there to contact them.   
Children International	166556	1	/users/profile/221281	lacey.althouse	Donor	5	08/30/2013	I found this organization at a time in my life when I really needed support.  I found happiness through giving back in a positive way.  Sponsoring a child has been very personally rewarding, and my experience with Children International has been terrific.  
Children International	166470	3	/users/profile/221145	avershynina	Client Served	5	08/29/2013	Being a scientist myself, I did a lot of research when I decided to sponsor a child. The biggest issue for me was to be sure that the help reaches the child I choose to sponsor and that I get the regularly updated information about him/her.Currently I am sponsoring two girls with CI and the experience is so much more than I could ever dream about. The staff in the main office in Kansas and in the regional offices go beyond their duties to ensure that all your questions and concerns are answered. They are always available and answer emails right away. One of the girls I sponsor has a difficult situation at home and the staff did everything to help her improve the situation meanwhile communicating with me about what is going on. CI also gives a possibility to help a child beyond your regular monthly payments and the donation goes directly to the family (the staff buys the things the family want, the money itself are never given to the family to ensure its proper spending, which I really like). If a sponsor makes such an extra donation he/she gets photos, letter and the report of the things bought and why they were chosen. It's really incredible to see how the child (and the whole family) life in gradually improving.But the most rewarding part is that CI makes you fell like you are right there with a child and his/her family talking, helping, asking questions, but without spending much time doing it yourself.The website CI uses is incredible having all the information you want and choices you need. The website LiftOne where all the discussions happen is helping me a lot to learn more about the organization and to share the lives of the children I sponsor.  
Children International	166454	2	/users/profile/221110	Sharon79	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2013	When I decided to sponsor a child I spent so much time talking to people to get thoughts on agencies. I went to the internet and researched. CI  had the most information.  I called CI and spoke with them.  They explained so much.  I ask them to mail me info and I must sponsor a young boy on the USA. So, last February 14, 2013 I started sponsoring my first child. Just what I ask for. A young boy in the USA.  I started sponsoring my second 3 year old in Guatemala last July.  Sponsoring is a life changing,  rewarding experience. When I get my letters  sometimes they leave me crying or laughing!  I can call CI  and they are always there for us. They are great.  We have LiftOne. A site for sponsors to share pictures, artwork,  anything  about our kids. I have many friends on  LiftOne.  We discuss things about  everything.  We help each other with advice. There are discussion boards and. We can blog. My 2 boys have a chance for a better future because of CI.
Children International	166413	2	/users/profile/221052	chatpeace	General Member of the Public	5	08/28/2013	When I decided to sponsor a child,,[ about 3 years ago] I studied  almost 20 0r 30 of them.Yoi must read their history and all about what the do. The percent of you money that goes directly to the family and how it is controlled .I spent days on this. I decided on CI for all those reasons. I picked my own child and country, also age and a few other things. CI has a sponsors site called "Lift one " which you can talk to hundreds of other sponsors, exchange child pictures and letters. At this time I have five children I sponsor, I am not a bit sorry for this, the letters,pictures and info I get is outstanding. I have actually cried when I read a couple of letters from my children. I cant say enough how CI has made my life a more beautiful thing, I will forever be grateful to them,   You will not find a better organization than CI. go for it right now.
Children International	166385	1	/users/profile/221024	beach lover	Donor	5	08/28/2013	I had a young gentleman knock on my front door telling me about Children International and asked me if I would like to sponsor a child. He told me all about the program but  I was very hesitant at first because the way the economy is and being a single mother and wanted to know if the program was reputable.  I was leery with giving him a check for the first month but very uneasy of having an automatic with drawl from my checking account and having access to my account information.  As promised by the representative the monies were taken out on the 26th of the month (1) time only for the month. Once I received a picture and letter from my child Kevin my heart swelled.  Kevin is adorable and I am glad that I can help him and his family. 
Children International	161143	1	/users/profile/202810	Liz999	Donor	5	06/21/2013	I have found this agency just great!  (I have found it to be more communicative in general than any other agencies I dealt with in the past.)  Accounts have always been accurate - no problems in the financial area of things.  They do send out (from time to time), brochures or cards with a request for additional donations for things like the Scholarship Fund, Parasite Fund, etc., BUT these requests for additional donations ARE OPTIONAL.  I called the 1-800 # and asked that I not receive these extra requests for donations as I can only do the basic monthly amount (and I like to contribute to the "4 gifts a year" program - which is completely OPTIONAL as all of these funds are combined to provide practical holiday gifts for ALL sponsored children).  CI was just great and they discontinued sending me the extra requests for $$ immediately.  Now I just receive yearly photo, yearly report on child, CI annual report, yearly report on my child's area and, of course, a thank you letter and pictures if I happen to very occasionally send an extra amount of $$ for a Special Needs Gift.  Really enjoy sponsorship with this agency - and I believe they are the best! in terms of making a change in these children's lives. I plan to sponsor more children in the future as I go along in life.
Children International	151878	3	/users/profile/202810	Liz999	Donor	5	03/31/2013	I recently sent a Special Gift to Children International for my boy in Honduras.  I was very happy with the pictures sent back to me of him with lots of food, clothing and a quality toy.  Children International you always do it right! (If anyone is wondering about sending a Special Gift, the CI Reference Guide mentions the Special Gift option. It also mentions the optional Holiday Gifts program (and that all funds are combined for this program). It also says you may send a package to your child under "Packages." See the section titled "Gifts".)
Children International	161070	7	/users/profile/213562	alswilling	Donor	2	06/20/2013	I have been sponsoring two children in Ecuador since April 2011. When i signed up as a sponsor, I indicated that I would be contributing twice the monthly sponsorship fee per child, plus I signed up to contribute extra funds for each child's birthday, Christmas, Easter, and "Special Days" when the children are given extra gifts "just because".  I set up the "automatic withdrawal" so that the funds would come out of my bank account each month to cover the monthly sponsorship fees plus administrative fees and withdrawals for birthdays, holidays, etc.  Shortly after I began sponsorship, I received notice from Children International (CI) that, because of an increase in administrative costs, I would be charged more per month for sponsorship. I agreed to pay the extra rather than having to deduct the administrative fees from the monthly sponsorship fees. Since I signed up for the automatic withdrawal, the correct amount has always been automatically paid to CI from my checking account. Recently I retired, which means that I will henceforth be on a fixed income. However, I decided to continue sponsoring the two children, Milena and Angel, for as long as I possibly can.  I also received notice from CI that they needed additional contributions from me to pay for protection of my sponsored children and their families from parasites. They recommended $50.00 per child, but did not indicate if that was an annual fee, a quarterly fee, or a monthly fee. Seeking more information, I visited CI's Web site and signed in on my account.  What I found was perplexing, to say the least.  Under my account, CI was showing that I was only paying the basic monthly sponsorship fee for each child, yet under "Contribution History" it was showing that I had been contributing from 2 to 3 times the amount that i had actually been contributing.  In other words, for every $100 that I contributed, my contribution history was showing that I contributed anywhere from $200 to $300. I was also credited for having paid only the basic sponsorship fee for each child, but $168 per month for "All Children".  That raised questions in my mind, so I logged into my account at my bank to check the withdrawal history.  My bank account showed that the correct monthly amount plus special contributions had been paid to CI, not the huge amounts that CI was showing that I had contributed. That brought to mind the fact that I had been paying twice the monthly sponsorship fees for each child and raised the question, "What is being done with the extra sponsorship fees that I'm paying each month for each child if they are not receiving it, and why am I being sent a solicitation for more money to cover the cost of 'parasite protection and education?'"  With that in mind, I contacted CI through their "Contact Us" form page and asked them where the extra money that I'm paying each month is going and why I am being credited with having made contributions that I have not, in fact, made.  I am currently awaiting a response from CI. 
Children International	157634	4	/users/profile/209054	Richardthompsoncars5923	Donor	5	05/11/2013	I rarely post on these sites as they tend to be too overwhelming for me with mixed opinions. I recently googled children international as I was looking for the site and this site came up. I have been sponsoring for several years, even after my wife passed away in 2009. The experience has been good and seeing the letters and photos makes it all real for me. I feel like I am making a real difference in this child's life.  The organization has been great and all of the volunteer workers make it a good experience. I highly recommend them.
Children International	157236	4	/users/profile/208517	Heididc	Donor	4	05/07/2013	I do not have any children and sponsorship has given me a sense of hope that one person can make a difference. Children International has made this all possible and I'm quite satisfied with the quality of service. I am a health care worker and my profession is about giving back and helping others. I get the same feeling with sponsorship. Thank you.
Children International	157024	4	/users/profile/208254	robinsnest74	Donor	5	05/03/2013	Children International opened my eyes to sponsorship and how I'm making a difference in our child's life. My partner and I have been sponsoring since 2008, and we enjoy getting letters from our child and seeing her progress.  I would like to get more involved and hope to see her some day. Highly recommend it.
Children International	156603	3	/users/profile/207734	bhershfeld56	Donor	5	04/29/2013	Both my husband and I are sponsoring a girl from Ecuador and the experience has been wonderful. We get letters from her and we can see the progress she has made over the past few years.  Children's International has been great and I hope to visit her in the future.
Children International	155465	8	/users/profile/206384	sdalphin2001	Donor	2	04/20/2013	I will continue to sponsor my two children until they age out; however, I will not automatically accept "replacement" children (as I have in the past) when that occurs. My reluctance is primarily a reaction to the excessive salary drawn by the CEO. There are similar child sponsorship programs with higher ratings than CI. I will likely consider one of them.
Children International	153254	12	/users/profile/204085	Lynn Lennox	Donor	2	04/07/2013	I have been sponsoring a child in Columbia since 2001.  I am appalled at the salaries made by the personnel of Children International.  I intend to see my child through to age 18, but I plan to write a letter to this organization as to why I won't sponsor another child.  A half million dollar salary for the CEO?  Do you know how many children could be served by cutting that salary in half?  How many Americans make $250,000/yr let alone a half million?  I find this unconscionable.
Children International	151530	9	/users/profile/35403	nature	Donor	2	03/23/2013	It was Christmas, and we received a solicitation from Children International for a Christmas gift for our sponsored child.  We donated $50 in addition to our monthly support payment.  Later we were notified that our sponsored child received pajamas.  $50 for pajamas.  We were not happy.  When we wrote Children International, we were informed that they pool the extra Christmas donations so every child they sponsor can get at least something, even if their sponsor did not donate extra money for this purpose.  We sort of understood but were annoyed we were not informed upfront.  Now it's our sponsored child's 15th birthday...very special in Latin America.  Basically, we were told the same thing.  They did add that, if we donated $100, we could specify what we wanted her to get and receive a picture of her with her birthday gift.  We feel this is just another fundraising tactic, that birthdays should be handled differently than Christmas and that $50 should be quite sufficient to get her something special for her 15th birthday.  We are dismayed at these turn of events and are unsure of our future with Children International.
Children International	151217	2	/users/profile/201816	swaney	Volunteer	4	03/18/2013	Best of all the child sponsorship programs.  I have sponsored children for several years.  Big organization, but their system allows wonderful personal attention to the needs of each child.
Children International	150177	4	/users/profile/200279	Emgertner25	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2013	We have been sponsoring for several years and the experience with Children International has been wonderful. We have two girls from the Philippines and one boy from Ecuador and we love to see the progress they have made over the years. The volunteers at this organization are good people and we hope to travel to see our kids next year. 
Children International	150023	1	/users/profile/200034	M Stone	Volunteer	5	02/25/2013	I have been a sponsor through Children International for 5 years. I have sponsored one beautiful girl in India from the age of 15 and she is now attending college thanks to us. Children International helped facilitate this special arrangement, because we were willing to help and she and her family were so extraordinarily eager to work hard and take advantage of the opportunity we could offer her. Now I sponsor another little girl in India, age 5. I cannot express how vital and rewarding it is to help these deserving children, who, with their families, are so grateful. It is a miracle to help them achieve a better life and, sometimes, even their dreams. It is a testament to Children International for how smoothly this all works. I have found Children International to be thoroughly reliable, trustworthy, and professional. They work hard to create real relationships between the sponsors and the ones they aid. It's clear this is a mission with them. I am in awe of their achievements. I recommend this charity highly! If you are considering this charity, try it--you will be blown away by how quickly and how importantly your mere dollars can affect a child's life, health, education, well-being, and future. There are few things I do more important than this.
Children International	145582	1	/users/profile/192082	intrepidtraveler	Donor	4	12/01/2012	I sponsor two children through this organization, both of whom I've visited. The money you donate goes to programs that the kids and their families utilize and directly benefit from. I have been impressed all the way around.
Children International	142644	2	/users/profile/162714	aharvey123	Donor	4	11/26/2012	I've been a sponsor of several children through this organization for five years.  I appreciate the communication from my sponsored children but also from the local group where they live.  The background information they provide about the family's situation really helps me to see that my donation is impactful.  They also send pictures of my child with the items they have purchased with my donation.  That's particularly nice.  I can see they are grateful and my funds are not just going to cover overhead.  I will continue to support Children International and recommend it to friends and family all the time.  I have pictures of my sponsored children on my fridge - it usually sparks a conversation.
Children International	142181	2	/users/profile/188627	prettypeachfront	Donor	5	11/23/2012	Through Children International I have been able to form stong relationships with the children that I sponsor. Their letters are filled with love and thankfulness. And I know that many of the childrens' greatest needs are being met by my donations. (It  is very rewarding sponsoring when you can read in the childrens' own words how much they are being helped.) I have sponsored with many other organizations,  but Children International is my favorite of them all.
Children International	140424	1	/users/profile/186602	nothguoh	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	We have been sponsors for quite a few years and cannot say enough about this organization.  I was concerned about how much of our sponsorship actually went to the children and was totally amazed.  We have been lucky enough to have visited our sponsored child, John, in the Dominican Republic on a vacation there quite a few years ago.  The agency set everything up and was terrific.  We are again planning a visit and have been in touch with the staff to have them arrange our visit.  It is amazing to watch John grow over the years and turn out to be a fine young man.  We stay in touch through the year with letters and though he is of little words when we visited it was like we were there with him always.  The yearly photo and updates are great and when I was worried about him they followed through with a check on his welfare and let me know.  Even though times here have made us tighten our purse strings we will always find a way to take care of our 'son'.  It is a special gift to be able to help someone and Children International makes that very easy and safe.
Children International	139656	1	/users/profile/185774	Saddare	Donor	5	11/15/2012	I have been a sponsor with Children International for sixteen years. I knew very little about the organization when I first started--I was only fourteen, and researching things on the Internet wasn't nearly as common then as it is nowadays--but I knew that my grandmother had sponsored a little boy for years. I chose a child in Colombia and began sponsoring Gisel, who was only five years younger than me. Over the years, the number of children I have sponsored has fluctuated up and down depending on my own financial situation, but even at my poorest I never considered dropping from the program entirely. The services Children International provides to the children is truly life-changing, and I am grateful for the opportunity to take part. I currently sponsor ten children--nine in the Philippines and one in Guatemala. I am planning to go visit them in the next year--I love that Children International not only is willing to work with sponsors who want to visit, but they actively encourage it! Other reviewers have commented about extra money for birthdays and holidays being divided among all the children--this is clearly stated in the communication from the organization. If you want to send a donation specifically for your child, they are happy to accommodate you--all you have to do is specify that your gift of $50 or more is "child specific".  It's simple. Another concern voiced by reviewers is that the letters sound like copied, form letters. With younger children, it is true that this is sometimes the case--younger children are assisted with their letters or sometimes write them as a group activity--but you will find that as your child grows older and more independent, their letters become longer, more unique, and more personal. It's a real treat to be able to watch your child grow and progress in this way! All in all, I couldn't be happier with Children International, and I plan to continue sponsoring with their organization for a long, long time to come.
Children International	138589		/users/profile/184661	Laura96	Donor	5	11/13/2012	Children International has made donating a breeze and so very rewarding!  I have been sponsoring a child, through Children International, for six years.  I sponsor a little girl, named Kakhasha, who lives in India.  I know that I am making a difference in her life because Children International takes the time to translate letters that Kakhasha and I exchange.  I hear about her life- we have a friendship.  The monthly support that I send her goes to help with living expenses and school expenses.  The special money that I send at her birthday and Christmas is discussed between the local volunteer and her parents, and then used to buy something special for her (one year she received a new pair of shoes and a sweater).  I am then notified by letter what item was picked out.  I love that I am kept so involved and informed about what the money is being used for.  It is not a faceless exchange; I know who the money goes to, and it is someone I care about because they've given me the opportunity to build a relationship with her.  The Children International website is very user friendly and makes being a donor SO easy.  I can write a letter to my child (as easy as email), make a special donation, check my child's profile for information (language spoken, birthday, family income, photo, etc), or even browse photos/profiles looking for additional children to 'adopt' with the click of the mouse.  I also can update my billing information so that there's no interruption to the automatic billing that I signed up for to make donating SO easy.  (For the first few years I donated, I did not exchange letters, and there was no pressure, and I still received the regular updates on my child and how the money was being spent, so if you are interested in something less involved this is still a great charity!)  EASY AND REWARDING!
Children International	137927		/users/profile/183954	Melanie19	Donor	5	11/13/2012	I have been with children international for 5 years now and have absolutely loved it! Not only do I receive personal messages and pictures from my little girl, the agency regularly sends me information on how my funds have been used (what she is getting for Christmas/birthdays, what services she is able to access, etc). It is very easy to stay in touch with my girl through the easy online letter sending. They also send cards with prepaid envelopes so all you have to do is sign and put it in the mailbox. It's an easy way to let your child know you care. I've also sent her some pictures of my family, which she has hanging on her wall. The agency also sends me an annual report of my contribution for my taxes so I don't have to worry about figuring it out. They occasionally send letters asking for extra donations/to increase your donation, but they have never called me. I have been unable to increase my donations and am therefore still paying my original contribution. I have automatic payments set up so I don't even have to think about it. Overall, it's been a great experience. It's easy to get started, you can have a personal relationship with your child, and you can see the difference you make in your child's life.
Children International	136484	1	/users/profile/182408	Jenny Pa	Donor	5	11/09/2012	I have been sponsoring for seven year children in India, Zambia and The Dominican Republic.  I am delighted by the work and services that this organization delivers.  While it is true and obvious that they deliver the health, dental care and material benefits, they also engage in development projects that impact entire villages as water, sanitation and education projects.  I am convinced by reading the annual reports, their collateral and other comparative materials that this organization has sound and competent management.  It also has major impact in transforming lives and communities which is ultimately what matter the most to me as a donor.
Children International	135823		/users/profile/181712	Wendy Reingold	Donor	5	11/08/2012	This is an extraordinary organization. I have been lucky enough to see first hand the important work they do for the children, families and communities they serve. Medical and dental care, education and social services are provided that will ultimately help these people break out of the cycle of poverty they are trapped in. I currently sponsor 6 young girls who will now have a brighter future because of CI's work. It takes so little from a sponsor to accomplish so much!
Children International	135805		/users/profile/181693	Carl Weinberg	Donor	5	11/08/2012	We first sponsored a child through CI in 2007 and our experiences with the group have been so positive that, since then, we have sponsored one after another child until we now sponsor six children in four countries and I have taken the opportunity to visit and toured its operations in Guatemala and Colombia, as well as the group's headquarters in Kansas City, so I can say that, based upon personal knowledge and experience, CI is without question one of the finest, most efficient and dedicated non-profits I have ever had any experience with.
Children International	134563		/users/profile/180405	dvdlagr	Donor	5	11/06/2012	After considerable research, I selected this organization to receive much of my attention and financial support. I continue to be interested in Children's International because of their dedication to helping deserving children around the world while keeping administrative costs relatively low (considering the breadth of their activities). I was reminded that I have been a donor for 5 years now; and they will continue as a priority in my giving. I believe that children - especially in significantly depressed Hispanic countries, deserve to have an opportunity to succeed and fulfill THEIR dreams - yea, even surpass those dreams!
Children International	123297		/users/profile/167929	Gcamp	Donor	5	09/26/2012	While planning a business trip through Central America I realized I would be in the same country (Costa Rica) as our sponsored child, Georgina.  I had no idea whether she lived near where I would be (she did), whether the agency would encourage a visit (THEY DO!!!) and whether the logistics would be manageable.  One phone call to the headquarters in Kansas City was all it took to get the ball rolling.  Not only do they encourage such a meeting, but they make it extremely easy to know what to do, how to act, etc...  Because of my tight schedule, CI picked me up from my hotel and brought me to their offices where they also brought Georgia and her mother.  CI even brought me to the airport after my visit.  My time with Georgina was extremely pleasant and comfortable, due in no small part to the gregarious nature of Gill Kelvin who hosted the visit and translated our conversation.  The visit made Georgina (and her plight) all the more real to me, and renewed my commitment to help her and others if possible.  Her picture is always on our fridge, but now it is also in my office where I can be reminded daily of her beautiful smile and gracious personality.  A side benefit of the visit was meeting the many other dedicated and friendly staff who do such tremendous work (despite their cramped quarters) to meet the needs of so many.  If you will ever be even near where your sponsored child is living I strongly encourage you to reach out to the main offices in Kansas City (or if not in the US, whatever is the local office) and just explore options.  You may very well end up with a visit scheduled!
Children International	121943	1	/users/profile/165967	Ricardo F.	Donor	4	09/05/2012	 What made this story remarkable is the fact that I planned over night a trip to visit my sponsored child in Honduras and although I gave Children International a few days in advance notice ; they try hard to accommodate the schedule and they went the extra mile to make the meeting possible;  and that's what makes the difference: going the extra mile !!! . So thanks Children International and its staff for your effort !!! 
Children International	121760	1	/users/profile/165674	Ricardo G.	Donor	5	08/31/2012	It was an amazing experience personally and as a family not only meeting our sponsored child but the entire family and see both the different benefits they receive as part of their program as we had opportunity to meet Community House as well as the home of our sponsored child. Since beginning of pre-planning everything worked perfect with the organization, communication and spirit to make our experience really pleasant. We recieved good advices during the visit and the scort going with us was great and always taking care for us and the sponsored family. We enjoyed the visit by looking at the needs of the family, seeing how they liked the little gifts we took with us, the enthusiasm to meet us and the joy to visit the amusement park and enjoy entire day with us. At the end; going to super market and make a grocery shopping for the family was superb. It was fantastic and really I was not aware of the beenfits they received at the Community House where they have annual doctor review, dentist care, nutrition & psycological care if needed, access to computers and internet and so others. What they do with our monthly contribution of $23 USD exceeds our expectations. For sure; we will do it again!!!
Children International	121569	1	/users/profile/112300	Christine23456	Donor	5	08/28/2012	I sent a gift of money (Special Gift) to my sponsored child in the Philippines and was delighted with the items that CI bought for my child and the family.  Food, including a very large bag or rice, a backpack for school, mattress and also they completed an incomplete wall of the house. I have also gotten lovely pictures of my child with a couple of small packages I've sent in the past.  I would recommend anyone send an extra $ amount or a small package.  It's so fun to see the results when you receive the pictures.
Children International	99243		/users/profile/112300	Christine23456	Donor	5	10/12/2011	I am delighted to have just begun to sponsor a young girl in the Phillipines.  When I saw her picture on the Children International website, I knew she was the one I wanted to foster. I am so happy to be able to assist another child with their various needs as they grow up.  Many of us are so fortunate, and if more of us shared our wealth in this way, an even bigger difference could be made than is being made.  I have already sponsored 4 other children with this agency and look forward to doing it again.  I have always received documentation that gifts and letters were received and received letters from the children.  It is such a respected organization and I have much experience with it and so I know it will be fulfilling.  Also, importantly, because it is Children International it will be a "direct benefit" type of sponsorship rather than "community centred". I prefer this type of sponsorship. I don't mind the fact that approximately 1/3 of 1% of my donation goes to the CEO's salary, as this is an effective and valuable charity which achieves its goals.
Children International	96422	1	/users/profile/112300	Christine23456	Donor	5	08/23/2011	This is really an excellent charity.  I've been a donor for many years and will continue and hope to add additional children to my sponsorship.  It seems that people wiritng negatiave comments are not really seeing the big picture.  I like their "all encompassing approach", i.e. having community centres and using youth leadership to assist to keep costs down.  Regarding the amounts donated for gifts that someone wrote in about, this amount is not just for birthday gifts, it is for 4 gifts per year, Christmas, Easter, Birthday and Special Hug Day.  Their administrative costs are within the acceptable range and they meet all the BBB criteria.  I would urge anyone to explore their webiste and think about sponsoring through them.  They are really efficient and I've found they really know what they are doing when it comes to spending my  extra amounts that I send on  my children (called special gifts).  There are other wonderful organizations such as World Vision, SOS, Plan, etc., but I prefer Children International.
Children International	119803	1	/users/profile/162860	Lisa Ward	Donor	4	08/01/2012	I have enjoyed sponsoring 2 children over the past 12 years through Children's International.  They send yearly photos/updates and letters from the sponsored child a couple times/ year.  I hope they are using the money to help the children/families as promised.  I too am saddened to hear about the CEO making so much money for an agency helping some of the poorest of the poor, supported by hard working Americans who make no where near that salary.  I want to continue my support for the children, but hope the agency looks at how they can be harming themselves in making such decisions. 
Children International	118814		/users/profile/161549	Alec3	Donor	5	07/18/2012	17% of the budget goes to fundraising and admin. I sponsor two children. I get an updated photo once a year, and two or three letters a year from both of the kids. It's only $25/month and you get to inspire a little kid. I occasionally get action updates in the mail (like once a year) and get little things to sign for the kids. I also opt to give an additional $20 or so per child for their birthdays and for Christmas. I get a letter telling me what was purchased for them with the money. Awesome. I know people who have gone to see the work that this organization is doing first hand, and their expectations were far exceeded. All kinds of amazing programs happening. If you don't want to feel like you're making a difference in a kid's life and don't want to be reminded of that every once in a while with a new picture or letter, then don't sponsor. They have never asked me for more money... ever. I opt to spend more, without being hassled. Awesome charity.
Children International	117673	11	/users/profile/159974	SharpLady	Donor	1	07/04/2012	I sponsored a child for about three years. Children International just seemed like a obvious choice because I live in the Kansas City area. I got so much mail and e-mail from them, though. It was just a river of requests and "news" or whatever, I couldn't tell you what it all was because it started feeling like junk and just went straight in the recycling. But worse, after a while the child letters felt really generic. They felt like they were written by the parents or whomever because they had to, like a chore. I started wondering if they were really receiving help from me or that was just an act to make me feel more obligated. So I started asking around, and I talked to someone who had left there. They said the headquarters in Kansas CIty is disorganized and wasteful. This site says almost 20% go to "administrative" costs. That's almost 1 out of every 5 dollars I gave to them! And your money doesn't go to the child, it goes to the company first and then they distribute it however. The child doesn't actually receive anything at all from me unless I follow some complicated rules about amounts. The person told me several other bright people were leaving, because there was too much incompetence. They said there were a lot of people working at the headquarters who had been there forever and basically spent a lot of time and money making simple things complicated, and smart people got frustrated and left quickly. They said management didn't hold anybody to any kind of quality standard, just give people offices who couldn't get a job anywhere else. I know it could have been just sour grapes talking but the person I talked to seemed very down to earth. I should have known. Just look at the website, it is old-looking and messy. I don't know how they can spend that much money on "administration" and still look like a mom and pop operation. If the whole place is like that then it reaally is a mess. It sounded like a lot of money was just being sponged up there that should go to the people who work with the kids in the field. I really want to help kids, but sorry, I am taking my money somewhere else.
Children International	114448	3	/users/profile/155751	Barbie11	Donor	3	06/09/2012	I sponsored two children in Ecuador.  The first child left the program.  The second child was graduated from the program at age 19 in October 2011.  I participated as a sponsor for over 10 years.  I enjoyed receiving my child's letters.  But much has changed in the organization since I had started to sponsor a child.  The monthly price for sponsorship is too high.  Sponsors are no longer encouraged to send gifts to your child due to problems with customs.  And you now are asked to give $50 so the child can receive special gifts.  The amount was $25 when I first started. I had sent my child (a girl) alot of gifts through the years.  I may sponsor a child again but not right now. 
Children International	111269		/users/profile/151492	Grayson34	Donor	5	05/02/2012	I have been fortunate to sponsor 3 children from Ecuador and the experience has been wonderful.  I donated for an extra pair of shoes and clothing.  Great customer service and I like the fact that I can see where my money is going and read letters from my kids.
Children International	111258		/users/profile/151478	SK4121	Donor	5	05/02/2012	Great company doing great work!  As far as the comment about the salary that someone else made please think about the fact that company is doing work in several continents, not just one country or city. The usual plight of non-profits is that you don't have good talent because you can't pay for it. A CEO making 500 grand when he's focusing on several continents really isn't a lot when you think about it. This means intense work, energy, coordination, and stress. In the private world this would easily equate to at least double if not triple income.  I support them and you should consider it too. 
Children International	102875	11	/users/profile/136137	caring person	Donor	3	01/04/2012	It is so sad to read about the CEO's salary. I would like to continue sponsoring the 2 children but not if this is true. It will be worth looking into it.
Children International	100896	1	/users/profile/125571	dcluke	Donor	5	11/21/2011	I have supported Children International (CI) for the past nine years and I currently sponsor seven children. I selected CI because I wanted to give to a reputable, non-sectarian organization that respects the children's native cultures. CI is a fantastic organization that truly makes a difference in the lives of families living in poverty.  I have had the good fortune to meet four of my sponsored children and hope to meet the others in the future.   I appreciate the transparency with which this organization operates.  As a nonprofit administrator, I see nothing outrageous about Mr. Cook's salary.  He would be making a LOT MORE if he were running a similarly sized international organization in the corporate sector.   Running a nonprofit is hard work and successful nonprofits need highly educated leaders with special skills.  Quality leadership is money well spent. 
Children International	99150	11	/users/profile/118622	dalessioluca	Donor	1	10/10/2011	I was approached by a fundraiser on the street in Seattle and became a donor. Later I found out that the CEO, Jim Cook, has a salary of over 400K. I think this kind of salary is INCOMPATIBLE with a charity organization. I am sure there are very dedicated people working for this organization but I feel I CAN NOT TRUST an organization runned by a guy that thinks it is ok to enrich himself with the money that donors around the world donate for the well-being of children. I  discontinued my contribution.  I am sorry for my children. I hope that my action will help "children international" to change for the better. 
Children International	97923	15	/users/profile/100802	crt65	Donor	1	09/22/2011	a website claims that Jim Cook was paid  over 475.000 in 2010.   Its obvious that all of  us have to make a living but this mans salary is  disgusting ;   especially  when it deals with poverty stricken children around the world.  The Board Members at Children International  feel its Okay to pay Jim cook that large sum of money ( YOUR  MONEY ). any one with a conscience would work for less money. For example ;  If a new CEO worked for 100.000 dollars per year . the remaining 375.000 could sponsor an additional   ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY  CHILDREN PER YEAR .  paying extremely high salaries to members of non profit organizations has to stop  and it begins with YOU.
Children International	97462		/users/profile/114415	Adam L.	Donor	5	09/14/2011	Jim Cook should step up or step down!! I keep getting requests to voluntarily increase my monthly contribution. Fine. What I DON'T get from him is a specific breakdown of what costs they have that are increasing, or most importantly what he as the President is doing to reduce these costs before cavalierly begging the sponsors to pony up in a bad economy. My customer's wouldn't put up with that crap why should we? There's got to be someone more worthy of the $400K salary this clown's pulling down.. I still give the organization a 5-Star rating even if I don't like the current leadership..  
Children International	97186	1	/users/profile/113797	steve c	Donor	3	09/05/2011	I have been sponsoring a child through Children International since 2004. It appears the child is receiving benefits and services and the photos that I receive each year are showing a child that looks healthy. Letters and pictures are received-there is some personal info in the letters but some of the content is like a form letter-I have no reason to believe that the letters are not authentic. It appears that the services and the child are real, and there is benefit being received by my sponsored child. I do share the concern of some reviewers about the CEO's very high salary. They do spend 80% of revenues on programs, but even so, $400K+ a year is exorbitant for a nonprofit executive. I think $100K would be more appropriate. I would ask that the CEO take an immediate pay cut, and ask other highly paid managers to do the same, and put the money saved into the children's programs. A CEO is largely a figurehead anyway. You have to have a CEO of some sort to be accountable but no reason they can't find one that is cheaper, if this guy won't take a pay cut. So I hesitate to sponsor any more kids, until this is resolved. I will keep supporting mine until she ages out (she is 15 now so 3 more years)-I owe that to the child at least. 
Children International	95913		/users/profile/111604	Nicole23	Donor	5	08/17/2011	I have been sponsoring with Children's International for over 3 years and I support several children. I have been very pleased with the staff response to questions or to problems. I receive regular yearly updates in a timely fashion, as well as regular letters above and beyond the child required letters. I have developed an excellent relationship with the children. I have contributed to the special hugs and birthdays which go to a general fund that allows all children in the program to receive a gift ( someone mentioned if you calculate it doesnt add up- did you consider the cost of purchase, shipping to the country if not readily available, as well as transport to the actual centers and then to pay staff to handle the distributions, notifications so that all thechildren show up for the distribution) The other issue is this, the children receive regular check ups but CI also pays for emergency medical care, medications, will treat the entire family if it is a contagious disease such as tuberculosis. I was very pleased with the use of special needs gifts taht were given to my sponsored children in assorted countries. I got lovely pictures and it was obvious that the money was stretched to help the family to the max. Yes, the CEO makes a lot, but he is no where near being in the top 25 highest paid charity CEO's, he receives a moderate salary for a CEO. I am an average worker making $32,000 a year, but I understand that he is growing the charity which is the same as a company, it can not continue to help children if it does not grow and is not productive, you can not do that with a worker making barely above the poverty level in this country. I also suspect that he regularly puts in more than 40 hours a week.  I think that we all need to step back and evaluate if we are jealous or if we think he is doing a poor job. I believe he is growing the company. If i want to donate for an extra campaign I do, if i do not want to, then i thrown the request into the recycle bin.  I believe in this charity. I have sponsored with it off and on for the last 25 years. I will sponsor a child through them as long as I have the ability to due so.. i have always supported three of the charities that are on the top 25 highest paid ceo's and some have far worse than 3 stars.. i will reconsider before assisting some of those again, as for CI i will continue to provide support, It is an excellent charity.
Children International	93386	10	/users/profile/107382	m c	Advisor	2	07/05/2011	We know  Children International is doing a great job in providing support to thousands of children across the world. And, we are proud to be associated with CI as  its staff.  We regret, though, to mention that  Regional Director for Asia, Appu is very unprofessional person.  He is harassing everyone in Asia Region.  Personally, if he doesnt like someone, he harasses him so that the person resigns from CI. How do you want to run a company? An organization is a team and not an individual. CI can not support over 100 thousand children across Asia with just one person. We dont know what is the design in his mind. He thinks that organization is run like a small store and he thinks he can run it on his own.  He is a two faced man. He is very nice with everybody at Kansas City and acts like a dictator with every one in Asia region. Is that how Children International work in other regions?  He is a  glorified peon who is just not doing anything in Asia. His only job is to keep Kansas City happy and the field goes through hell where unnecessary pressures are created on field staff, unnecessary demands are made on them to deliver results that are not practical. And, when you ask him for direction, there is a total SILENCE.  He demotivates the staff.  There are some points that  we would like you to know:- 1.    He is indecisive (lots of issues take a long time for its resolution). It requires continuous follow up with Appu for his decision. 2.    He is biased. He is good with some people  and provide them extra protection.3,    He takes things personally and not professionally.4.    He usually doesnt respond to any phone calls.  He  acts in a very strange manner.5.    He is not a director who can be looked up to for direction, advice, help and support to resolve issues. It always appears as if he is only trying to save his own skin. Everybody else remain in miserable condition.  He is smart in one thing -  to keep CI Kansas City EXECUTIVES in good humor all the time. How do we work with such unprofessional person? A man with no direction, no conviction, no integrity, no trust.   Nobody is happy working in the region. All want to resign from their job. Unfortunately, they cant afford to due to global recession. There have been some resignations from some people who havent been able to cope with him.  How would you want to run the organization to support thousands of children in Asia? Do you think Ramdas Pai alone can assist CI in helping these children? It requires a serious change in the management in Asia before Appu destroys all the SOAs in Asia. We work for upliftment of poor children. We need your help and intervention in helping the company to do the good cause.   Please help.
Children International	88970		/users/profile/100694	Christy Elsbury	Donor	5	05/20/2011	I have been a sponsor since June 2010 and am currently sponsoring 11 children. This is a wonderful organization where the money goes to the children. You get an updated photo each year, plus AT LEAST 2 letters a year from your child. If you correspond with your child, you can get a new letter from your child every 90 days! You can send extra money gifts for your child, you can send them packages, you can even visit them!
Children International	88964		/users/profile/100687	Dorothee Clinton	Donor	5	05/20/2011	I have been part of this organization for over 9 years, and I find that like most things in life the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. And I don't mean money. For the uninvolved sponsors it can still be satisfying with 2 guaranteed letters a year, and an annual photo. For people who want to be more involved liked my, the sky is the limit. I get more letters from my children because I write them back (CI has a policy that if the child hasn't written in the past 90 and gets a new letter then they're requested to write back). The children receive many privileges from program such as tutoring, medical and dental checkups, after school programs, nutrition edcation, emergency feeding programs, etc. But I can also choose to do more for my kids. The key is to really learn about the program. Someone else on here mentioned that they give money to the general distribution and not to the kids - that is incorrect, they do both. If you contribute to the christmas, easter, birthday, special hug funds, those are general funds and say so in the handbook they give in the beginning. But if you have enough to hit a certain minimum (currently $50) you can have it sent specifically to your child...that's a special gift, not a contribution to one of their quarterly celebrations. You can also ask about specific things you notice on the child's report and fix. Some of the items I've bought for my children are: a floor(there's was mud), a latrine, tutoring money, a bed, an addition on to the house. The sky really is the limit with how much you can help. How do you know it's real? Well, with each of these larger gifts I got pictures! I also have several friends who have gotten to visit their children (there's an open invitation for this) and they can promise every bit of it is real. I also love Children International because it's got an extremely high percentage of funds that goes directly to the children. You can also see by the number of volunteers in each community center, that the communities really love the program as well. CI has an individual approach to poverty - "one child at a time" where other groups tend to do more of a community approach (neither I think is better in general, but I really wanted to form bonds with the children and this afforded me the opportunity). I have even mailed packages to my children, which once again come with a thank you letter and photos - genuine as can be! They also have a great community for members on the site Liftone.org. It's for sponsors to talk to each other and learn more about the program. Lots of newer sponsors find out things through the site that they didn't even know they wanted to know. Overall I'm extremely pleased with this organization and the many other sponsors I've run into contact with.
Children International	88465	1	/users/profile/99601	Carol	Donor	4	05/07/2011	I have sponsored children through this organization for more than 20 years. I am confident the information I receive on the periodic updates is consistent for the children. Several years ago I needed to contact the agency directly for an error on my part for my donation, and the agency worked with me to correct my error in a very satisfactory fashion.  
Children International	86087		/users/profile/96240	Brooke Morris	Donor	4	04/17/2011	I sponsor children through this organization and have for many years.  The children I currently sponsor I've sponsored since 2006 and contrary to other posts, the pictures I've received are all clearly of the same child and in checking the metadata (I'm a photographer) have all been taken around a year apart.  I've sent special gifts and received photos of my child with the gifts also.  I receive several letters a year from my children as well.  I'm planning to go visit my children and the organization encourages sponsors to visit the children, so I'd say that is all above board.  I saw another sponsor upset about how gifts are used.  The materials clearly explain that gifts under $25 are accumulated and used for all children and that gifts given for birthday, Christmas, Easter, and Special hugs also go into one pot and all children receive the same items (varies by area is all), so that children with sponsors who can't afford or don't send money for those still get gifts.  You can do a special needs or income generating gift and those DO go completely to your child if they exceed $25.  It bothers me when people dock an organization for doing something that is clearly outlined in the material they send.
Children International	85009	6	/users/profile/94553	ANGELA REYES	Donor	2	04/07/2011	I have been a sponsor since 2008 & I chose it because it was the most renowned org. so I assumed legitimate as well & because it was the only org. I could find that offered sponsorship for children in Guatemala, where I preferred. I don't know about several photos being received by sponsor children, but I DO receive 1 a yr. I also receive a letter from her @ 3 times a year. I consulted Charity Navigator because some of my experiences with this org concerned me & motivated me to research further. First, in the beginning of my sponsorship, I was told my child was still unable to write when she was 8, mind you, & that her sister was writing her letters for her that I received, which went on for a couple years, then I started receiving letters that said my sponsor child was now writing them, but the handwriting had not changed 1 BIT & for a child just learning to write: that was something very unexpected. I contacted the org. & they said that it was definitely my child writing the letters & that perhaps she had similar handwriting to her sister because they were related, which sounded really far fetched to me. There was nothing else I could do then. Also, I had an issue a while back where I was sending a sizable amount for special contributions (holidays, etc.) & I was receiving letters that my child only received something so trivial as a backpack or a sweater, etc. while I'm thinking if I can buy tons more of those items in the US w/that amount of $, wouldn't they be able to purchase even more in Guatemala with that same amount? I consulted the org. about this & was told the $ from the contributions was divided amongst the sponsor children to esp. help out the children whose sponsors did not send a special contribution, which I sympathized with, but at the same time: if I'm sending $50 for example, I expect the entire amount to go to my child for gifts that are worth that amount, not to hear she ended up with a sweater worth $5 because other kids didn't have sponsors. I just think your $ is not viewed as much of a gift to your child when they receive something hardly worth anything, esp. when you sent so much more! I still have found no recourse regarding these issues so have just decided for the sake of the child & her family to finish my sponsorship until she's of age (because she shouldn't suffer because of the org.) & find another sponsor child org. And now after seeing the CEO's salary on here: I agree with others that that is DEFINITELY uncalled for. There isn't that much work in the world that a human being should get paid that much PERIOD unless he's moving MOUNTAINS. If anyone can give me advice based on experience with the aforementioned issues with this org., please do & thx.
Children International	84979	1	/users/profile/94503	Alice Stevenson	Donor	4	04/07/2011	We began sponsoring a child in Guatemala in 2004, and I had the opportunity of visiting him and his family the following year.  I saw the Children International center in his village as well as visiting his home.   We have been exchanging letters since the sponsorship began. In 2009 my husband and I added a sponsorship for a little girl in Chile, because we were planning a trip there a few months later.  We were very impressed with our visit to the Children International office for the area and the small office that served the village where our sponsored child lives.  Staff showed us around and answered all of our questions.  Then we were taken to the home of our sponsored child, where we met the family before spending the day on an outing with the little girl and her mother.  The day's activities were chosen by her, and we also got to visit her pre-kindergarten classroom at her school.  It was a wonderful experience, and I was so glad that this time my husband was able to witness Children International in action. We believe CI is a very worthwhile organization, since they focus on health and education services for sponsored children.  We understand that the money we send for gifts for our sponsored children also helps provide for children whose sponsors do not contribute beyond the basic monthly amount.  Gifts include needed items for the household as well as for the child.  When I visited my sponsored child in Guatemala, we sat on a stools in the kitchen that had been purchased for the family with one of the special contributions that we send for Birthday, Christmas, Easter and Special Hug Day.
Children International	83307		/users/profile/92237	Markus Egger	Donor	5	03/25/2011	I do not have any particular background information or hard research facts, but I have supported this charity for years (several children at any given time) and have not had any bad experiences. I receive letters from the children, as well as photos and other frequent updates. Can I vouch for the efficiency of this charity? No. (In fact, I came to CharityNavigator.org to research that aspect...). But as best as I can tell, it seems to be a well run charity. I also find myself disagreeing with the 1-star reviewers here. Birthday card money not going 100% to the child? Well, first of all, where is the data to back that up. But even if that is the case, I have no major problem with it, as long as the charity's overall funds end up with the children. Sure, dock them a star and move from 5-star to 4-star. But drop to 1-star?!? It seems there are bigger issues at stake. Also, who cares if the CEO of an organization of this size makes $400k a year?!? That is just naive. $400,000 a year and a company car isn't exactly a stellar top executive salary, and it seems to me that most people who are serious about donating money to charities like this one should probably be aware of that. I would have in fact expected the CEO to make more, especially if he does a good job, which all the facts I have been able to research about this charity lead me to believe. I rate my experience with this organization 5-star. I am not sure if their financial efficiency is 5-star, but my experience certainly is.

He makes over $400,000 a year and the organization is rated only 3 stars. I will continue to sponsor the child I have there until she is grown up, but then I will sponsor instead at Sarnelli orphanage in Thailand where a priest takes a megar salary. You also receive letters and pictures from the child.
Children International	81345		/users/profile/89028	Amanda Lucas	Donor	5	03/07/2011	I have been a sponsor through Children International for the last six months and I could not be more delighted with this non-profit. They do so much good for impoverished children and their communities, and all of this is reflected through letters, pictures, and reports. Their representatives answer any questions quickly and efficiently; and there is even an excellent forum that allows one to connect with other sponsors to share stories and photos. 
Children International	81277		/users/profile/88927	Child Sponsor	Donor	5	03/06/2011	I absolutely love Children International!  I am currently a graduate student studying engineering and I still prefer to donate money when I do not have too much of my own.  It is very rewarding and when I began sponsoring about 1.5 years ago, I chose several different organizations and Children International far exceeds any of the other organizations that I have encountered. My relationship with my children that I sponsor is really developing and I truly feel like I know them in only one year.  I plan to visit them once I finish school and the sponsorship blog site www.LiftOne.org is extraordinary.  I spend a lot of time on this site reading letters from other sponsors and watching videos from their visits and pictures they have sent.Children International is so incredible, that it is addicting.  My sponsorship family grows and grows especially with the ease of group sponsorships where you have 12 sponsors so you each pay for one month a year.  Without the assistance of all the sponsors on LiftOne, it would be too difficult to find 11 other sponsors for your group.I cannot explain how amazing Children International is and also their staff every time I call or email is incredibly helpful.I have not bee completely satisfied with the customer service of the other organizations either.
Children International	74460		/users/profile/81353	wellwaters84	Donor	4	02/24/2011	I started to sponser a little Girl in india in october 2008 and i still sponser her. i feel good about doing what i do to help some one that needs help.i have read some bad reviews of the company and i dont know if its true but it seems like a good charity. people need to understand that not all charitys are bad and not all people are out to get us.i believe its a real charity and everyone is allowed to have their own opinion. so far i have not had any bad things come from the company of children international. i had felt a little unsure when i read some other peoples reviews but just cause some one says some thing to you dont make it true. if you dont trust a company dont send money to them. i like doing my part and i like being able to think of the child as ''my child'' so to speak. i gotten letters and pictures thruout the 3 years since i started and until some proof comes out im gonna stay doing what i do. it makes you feel good if you have a heart to help those in need.
Children International	67528		/users/profile/73802	lindseyrieder	Donor	5	02/13/2011	I started sponsoring a child through CI in 2004. After visiting her in India in 2005, I was so impressed that I added another child, and my parents began sponsoring their child. I am now sponsoring four children and just visited them again, as well as a child sponsored by a group of friends, and my parents' sponsored child. It is amazing to see all that CI does for the children and the communities that they live in. My oldest is now 17 and a smart, hard-working high school student with her eyes set on college next.   There various programs and campaigns make a big difference for the children and their families, provioding them with school needs, medical and dental check-ups and care, extra food for kids in need, youth group programs, and places to study and play, and much more-- such as the option to help families with income-generating projects or home improvements.   Many people are suspicious of sponsorship organizations, but in the past 7 years, I have had nothing but excellent experiences and countless evidence that they are an effective, legitimate organization. I am extremely pleased and thrilled to be a part of it. I have donated extra funds for tutors, family needs and so forth and have always found the organization to be consistent and transparent.  I greatly enjoy the exchange of letters with my sponsored children and over time have built a good relationship with them. 
Children International	61031		/users/profile/66559	Lisa L	Donor	5	01/25/2011	I have been sponsoring a girl in the Dominican Republic for about 5 years.  Recently my husband and I traveled there to visit and we met her.  Every aspect of the visit met or exceeded my expectations.  The field office people there showed me around their office in Santo Domingo and a translater was with us and the child and her mother.  We had a wonderful day getting to know each other in person and we got to see what a difference we had made in her life.  She may not understand it yet, but she has made a difference in my life too; the joy I got from seeing her excitement and hearing about her school and her dreams for her future is immeasurable.  I would recommend this org. to anyone - truly wonderful people doing inspiring work and changing lives - one child at a time. 
Children International	58393	5	/users/profile/62123	Sleuth	General Member of the Public	1	12/02/2010	After doing some research on Children International, I dicovered that their CEO makes over 450k a yr. This does not include company perks such as company car, company credit card, private jet, and other so called "ADministrative cost". Now include their other executive officers and board members who are likely making over 350k, we have a problem on our hands. Non-profit means money does not go into the company, but to the cause.  In this company it goes into these fat cats pockets. 
Children International	55915	7	/users/profile/58171	shertam	General Member of the Public	1	10/29/2010	My beautiful 23 year old daughter, a recent college graduate was recently hired by Children International marketing department.   They required her to stand on the City Streets of Denver all day long and pander for sponsors.  She was physically and verbally assulted by a number of homeless men and others.  When she tried to report this to her supervisor she was told he  did not have time to talk to her as he was busy hiring others.   I  have seen young people used to get money in the streets in 3rd world countries.  Shame on Children International for doing this to my daughter!   
Children International	48437	5	/users/profile/49470	andrea16	Donor	1	07/19/2010	It appears that the organization uses most of the children's birthday contributions for purposes other than birthday purposes. If you were to do the simple calculation of converting american currency to that of the currency of the country in which your sponsor child lives, then compare that difference to the approximate price of the reported gifts, as I did, you would realize that the numbers do not add up nearly to the amount of your contribution. A big part of your contribution would be missing.
Children International	25036	10	/users/profile/26028	TierneySTL	Donor	5	12/27/2009	I have sponsored a child through Children's Internation for about 10 years. My wife also sponsors a child. I have not seen anything that would make me suspicious about this organization and I truely feel my support of this little girl in the Phillapines, and her family, has been beneficial to them. The positive is that for my minimal annual support  ( $264/year ) and an additional $175 a year on special days ( which is optional ) Carmela seems to get a lot a valuable benefits. They give the child the materials, clothing and medical treatment they need to attend school as well as Christian based emotional support. In addition to individual support Carmela gets the benefit of CI's local support center. I get annual updates on Carmela's progress, a letter and a picture of Carmela and the gifts she and her familiy receive from my once a year donation at Christmas. She is now 15, still in school and seems appreciative.Negative is the letters I recieve from Carmela are very generic and could be written by anyone. CI's site says you can bond with child through the letters but I don't see how. The one letter a year I get says she likes her teachers, playing with friends and helping her mother with chores and thanks me very much for her support. I thought it would be more. Realistically she is a poor young girl who doesn't speak or write english who I am trying to give a chance to. She does not need to write great letters and Children International shouldn't have to go to great expense to write them for her.Overall I feel comfortable that Carmela is recieving a significant benefit from my support. I'm glad I've done it and will support another child when Carmela turns 17.

I was able to experience how the foundation impacts lives of others first hand during our donation process with St. Luke's Hospital. One of my favorite parts was how appreciative and extremely grateful the staff members were as they repeatedly told Janell and I thank you for coming to them with the donation lifting patient's spirits. I was inspired by how many lives the foundation's work is able to touch around the world. It's simply amazing. It was our pleasure to help spread the work of the foundation through social media while both Janell and I were more than willing to help Elaine with whatever we could. Thank you, Elaine, for continuing to give students a fantastic opportunity to work along with the foundation.

Through this opportunity, I've gotten to see first hand how much of a difference this foundation can make in the lives of others. During the hanging process of the photos at St. Luke's Hospital, there were countless patients commenting on how beautiful the art looked and how the photos really caught their attention. What I love most about this foundation is how such a small organization can make such a big difference all around the world. I also felt very appreciated throughout this entire experience working for Elaine and her foundation. Even doing the simplest things such as posting on social media goes a long way, and Danielle and I can both agree that it was our pleasure helping Elaine with whatever we could. I'd like to thank Elaine for giving Danielle and I the opportunity to work for her Foundation this semester and thank you for continuing to make a difference!

What Elaine does is really amazing- placing beautiful nature photographs from around the world into hospitals around the world to brighten the walls, the spirits of patients, caregivers and their families.

This helps to enhance healing by lifting the spirits of patients, family members and all the wonderful staff who work in these settings.  By offering healing art for free to these hospitals, it becomes possible for there to be beauty on the walls where none has existed before.

Sometimes we lack the means or simply don't know how.I have found that it is the small things that often make the difference. Simple gestures we overlook and don't think about on a day to day basis.For the ones who are lucky enough to go about the world and capture its beauty with a photo the Foundation offers the easiest way to share that moment with people who are less fortunate and dont have the same opportunity.I am honoured my photo can be shared and hopefully bring some joy to anyone who sees it.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	292545		/users/profile/383079	Heather252	Donor	5	06/09/2016	It is an honor to be a contributing photographer to Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals. Patients and their family often feel nervous, vulnerable, and uncomfortable in hospitals. The sterile environment is cold and uninviting. Nature art allows the patient to escape momentarily, and brings a sense of calm and comfort. As a patient and a family member of a patient, I can attest that beautiful nature art is a much appreciated feature in a hospital. It brings me much personal satisfaction to contribute this wonderful cause. My hope is that one day my art will bring a sense of comfort to someone in a hospital. The concept of this Foundation is novel, and important to hospital patients worldwide. Elaine the president and curator of the Foundation is fabulous. She was quick to respond to my emails, and she works tirelessly to support the Foundation. My entire experience with this organization was positive, and I would recommend working with the Foundation to both photographers and hospitals.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	264931		/users/profile/353660	Writer	Donor	5	10/18/2015	I contributed a photograph of the Mediterranean Sea from the cost of Giglio Island to be used by this foundation. I am a firm believer in the power art has to heal the world, and this nonprofit is doing just that. If you close your eyes and visualize the interior of a hospital, I'm sure you'd see plain white walls and floors accompanied by sick and depressed individuals. This foundation is changing that! Imagine walking into what you'd expect to be a dreary and cold atmosphere, and instead you're greeted with warmth and comfort by the colorfully decorated walls. Your environment does play a vital role in your emotional, and even physical, well-being. Beautiful art hung along the walls of hospitals would surely ease the anxiety of patients young and old, as well as loved ones and care givers. My hat goes off to this idea by the Foundation For Photo Art In Hospitals Inc., and I am proud to be a contributing photographer for their cause!

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	258568	1	/users/profile/347069	Bepa	Donor	5	09/20/2015	The Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals, Inc. is a wonderful, non-profit organization dedicated to the act of healing through the use of visual art.  Healing is not just a physical process but also involves mental quality / state of mind for the patient, family and caregiver. Visual art stirs emotion, and in the case of this organization, in a positive, relaxing, and therapeutic medicinal purpose.  The art that is chosen by the foundation not only depicts a soothing and restorative sense, but can rebuild a peaceful recovery. By placing art in facilities world-wide, not fortunate enough to obtain art on their own, the foundation can help heal those who would not be able to have a tranquil and serene environment to begin or complete their recover.   I am truly grateful to able to say that I belong to such a great establishment and hope that if my art helps just one person mend I have been blessed. Michele G.

I was very excited to have found an organization where I could donate my photography artwork that would benefit a lot of people in a much needed area such as a hospital. Can you imagine being very ill and looking up and seeing a gorgeous photograph that is soothing, relaxing and peaceful? It would have to put a smile on a face. 
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	241928		/users/profile/328646	diblum	Volunteer	5	04/30/2015	 I was so excited to find this organization. Donating photographs to a hospital or hospice is very much needed. I can say this as a patient, as a volunteer at a hospital, and as a family member visiting a sick patient. At age five, I was rushed to the emergency room at White Plains hospital. I was there for one week, and then was transferred to North Shore - LIJ hospital. I found this experience to be noisy, stressful, cold, sterile, and full of unwanted needle-pricks not to mention a spinal tap. As a result, these two weeks felt like two months to me. There were no beautiful photographs to view. There was nothing to bring me joy there.  My mom slept in a cot by my bed.  My dad visited every day.  I think this experience may have been tough for them to bear. As a hospital volunteer, I found Saint Agnes hospital in White Plains to be very sterile. Patients did not have any nature scenes to look at.   When my grandparents were hospitalized at the end of their lives, I wish that they could have viewed peaceful pictures of nature scenes. I am an amateur photographer and look forward to contributing more photographs to this organization. I think that the Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals provides a necessary service to patients, and also improves the environment for visitors and staff. Thank you for all of the work you do.Deborah I.

Research has shown that views of nature can help patients heal faster, require less pain medication, reduce perceived waiting times, etc.  By providing these views in the form of nature photography does a great service to patients and families in hospitals that may not otherwise have the means to supply this valuable resource.

"We at the African Health and Hospital Foundation have been working with Healing Art Photography for several years now, including these wonderful photos with our shipments of equipment and supplies to hospitals in East Africa. Seeing the photos in the hospitals not only reassures us of the value of beauty in otherwise difficult facilities, but makes us proud that we contribute through Elaine to individual beautiful experiences of patients in dire need of medical and spiritual support. What a wonderful way to contribute to the happiness of people in a small but highly significant way!"

We have been active since 2002.  I have met so many people and created amazing friendships through the years with patients,their families, volunteers, doctors, nurses, hospital auxiliary members, and hospital adminitrators.  It was been very rewarding for me to see how my photos and the photos of our Contributing Photographers have made a difference in the lives of these people.  I can't think of anything that I would rather be doing!
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	215181		/users/profile/278554	Rafael3	Donor	5	09/16/2014	A wonderful non-profit that has identified a unique need in hospitals/clinics for art and has developed a cost effective way to get it there. Elaine has collected an incredible selection of photos from individuals around the world and it's impressive to see how she has spread these works around the world to benefit those who are most in need of hope and inspiration. Keep up the great work!

Then imagine there being none....  It's a somewhat subtle but very real influence on how you feel in that environment.  This is a truly unique and creative contribution to the mental health of people in the most remote and depressed areas of the world.  When I first heard about it I was unimpressed considering the other more tangible needs.  But when I heard the founder's story first hand and started thinking about it as I had occasion for some hospital stays I realized it even affected me and I'm not even very observant of my surroundings.   Truly it's an inspired and one of a kind effort.

She went to great lengths to create a display of photo art in memory of my father that had to be specially framed for the unit where it was placed.  And as a contributing photographer, I am so pleased that my photo - my small contribution - is lifting spirits and making a difference for patients and staff because of this foundation and her efforts.

She always encouraged and supported me, especially my musical endeavors.  When she became ill, Elaine was her main support, present with her mother at every moment even though it meant leaving her home in Italy for months at a time.  From this painful experience came this wonderful foundation, whose art provides encouragement and support for what can be the hardest time in people's lives.   I'm grateful for Elaine's work and efforts, and I feel that she is keeping the spirit of her mother alive through this.

I have always believed in the healing power of art. Both in the process of creating it and, for those feeling less than best, viewing artful beauty. I believe in what the Foundation is accomplishing - calming anxiety in patients, whisking people away to another land for only a brief but important and restful moment, and filling an otherwise necessarily sterile environment with the beauty of nature.

For those who are hospitalized and unable to experience the beauty of  God's creation; as well as those who visit these hospitals, can experience the next best thing to being there. Someone once wrote" By just looking at a photograph of the outdoors / nature, you can still experience the same peace and tranquility." This amazing imagery donated by photographers world wide, should give us a sense of pride that our work is being used in this manner. What better gift can there be to help contribute to someone's healing and recovery from illness. Keep up the good work Elaine! Jim Stracensky

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	146469		/users/profile/153253	Dawn Runge	Board Member	5	12/11/2012	I have known Elaine Poggi all my life, as she is my cousin.  I watched as she cared for my Great Aunt Leona battle for her life to survive cancer.  Elaine worked tirelessly to provide a peaceful place for her Mom so that she could savor her time left on this Earth.  The conversations, memories, and time shared during that period transformed both women.  When Elaine needed to meet with doctors, run errands or get respite herself, she placed some of her photographs on the walls so that her Mom could transport her mind to another beautiful place.  After my Great Aunt Leona passed, Elaine knew that the quality of life given to her Mom during that time had formulated her path to creating this Foundation.  In fact, I distinctly remember the day in 2002 when she stated she was starting a Foundation to place photos in hospitals, in order to create a healing environment for all patients.  Who knew--over a chicken salad lunch of all things!!  While I knew she was a wonderful pianist, I was not aware she was an inspirational and talented photographer.  I cannot begin to convey the untold joy I have experienced as I watched her reach beyond her grief to place thousands of photos in hospitals all over the world--all for the benefit of people she will never know in this life.  It has been a privilege to have served on her Board of Directors for ten years, leaving only to address professional commitments.  Elaine is a rare soul, truly dedicated to the simplistic beauty of a sunrise, the peaceful presence of a baby's sigh, and the power of holding someone's hand.  And, she strives to capture these breathtaking moments and share them with the world--all in the name of nurturing their souls to optimum health.  I am VERY proud of her and her selfless, generous work to make the world a better place--one photograph at a time.  I love you Elaine--may your soul always be directed by the very hand of God.  Always My Love & Best Wishes - Dawn Runge, Ph.D.
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	112592		/users/profile/153253	Dawn Runge	Board Member	5	05/22/2012	My cousin, Elaine Poggi, did everything she could to help her Mother fight her battle.   She diligently learned all she could about the disease, associated tests, personally knew all clinical caregivers, and even tried to put up her own photos to brighten her Mom's room.  Several of the caregivers begin to comment on the photos and how they not only helped her Mom, but they all wanted to be her Mom's nurse since the photos cheered them up as well!  And, if you know anything about health care, being a nurse is a difficult job to say the least.  Hence, Elaine continued to not only post the photos, but change them on a regular basis to keep things interesting for everyone.  Sadly, in the end, Elaine's Mom (and my Great Aunt) lost her battle.  Yet, a idea was born!  Elaine knew her destiny was to create beautiful, yet serene photos for patients all over the world can enjoy.  For maybe a minute, patients can transport themselves to a better world where there is no pain, no worries and they are part of the beauty surrounding them.  I served on the Board for 10 years, diligently  working with Elaine to help fulfill her dream.  And, the honor has been all mine.  I am humbled to know that in a small, yet extremely powerful way, I am making a difference to patients all over the world.  I love my cousin and I am VERY proud of her and her work!!

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	146235		/users/profile/192952	Ksmithsimonton	Board Member	5	12/08/2012	I am honored to be part of an organization that takes an active role in changing the environment in which health care is delivered. Elaine and the Foundation's work provide a sense of beauty, comfort and distraction from the sterile, impersonal aspect of hospitals that patients usually encounter. Having the Foundation's art in a hospital setting creates a calmer and more natural setting. This can dramatically reduce fear and anxiety for patients and by doing so, has the ability to  improve the mental and physical state of patients and medical staff alike. This is an important, necessary and overlooked benefit. My wish is that many more medical centers will make the changes that this Foundation helps to provide, as a part of improving the way medical care is delivered. Elaine, as founder of the Foundation, is dedicated and committed to this vision. It is inspirational to work with her.

I love knowing that somewhere one of my pieces might be giving a brief moment of beauty and peace to busy, stressed people. I also like to know that an intimate view of my part of the world is being shared with people far away, and that they are only getting to experience that perspective because of the efforts of this foundation.

As a clinical psychologist in Florence, Italy I often encourage my patients to make their own original drawings or go out in the city and take photos of whatever may stimulate them. This allows them, especially the patients with depression to express their own feelings and to discover their own creativity. Also in my office I have many paintings and sketches, some given to me by former patients and others by professional artists both well known in Florence or novices in the art community. I frequently ask my patients to carefully observe a painting or a photo and to tell me their first impressions, their reactions, emotions they may feel while looking at it. This helps to open up some new areas of importance that might have been unconscoius or repressed before.

It creates additional stress and fear, with little comfort or distraction. Creating a welcoming environment in hospital settings around the world is a wonderful and humanitarian mission. Elaine Poggi knows this from vast and personal experience and her founding of Healing Photo Art is a testament to her ability and her commitment to creating a healing environment to patients and hospital staff throughout the world. We are delighted to have benefited from her art work and know first hand that it brings joy and calm to an otherwise impersonal environment. Karen Simonton  Executive Director Simonton Cancer Center

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	112743		/users/profile/153451	J Michael C.	Donor	5	05/23/2012	As professional fine art photographer/artist, Ii came across Elaine Poggi and her wonderful Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals serendipitously and jumped at the opportunity to be a contributing photographer. Ii know the Healing Power that is so dynamically present every moment in Nature, and how deeply it resonates with all of us the instant we come into contact with Nature. Ii am passionate about bringing that Light and Energy message to as many people as possible. Thank You Elaine,  for your foundation expands this potential dynamically and precisely where Healing is most deeply needed! Ii became intimately aware of the transformational power in my own photography at the time of my Grandma's passing (of age 92y) a few years ago. While she was in hospital during her last days, Ii made a collage of Nature images for her to have at her bedside wall while she was being treated. While under heavy sedatives for pain control, she slipped into a state of panic and fear, and began exclaiming and crying that she had been left alone and abandoned in a vacant part of the hospital overnight! While this was untrue, in her current state-of-mind this is what she believed had occurred, despite the reassurances from the attending staff that this could never have happened. Suddenly she looked over to the wall and saw the Nature images Ii had given her, She boldly exclaimed: "Oh, there's my picture!" ~~~ "Yes" everyone reassured her. ~~~ "Then Ii could Not have been left alone all night!" she said. ~~~ Immediately this event had calmed her and pulled her mind out from a nightmare of personal anguish at the glance a single image.  Ii was recounted this story by her son, my Dad and his wife, who witnessed this just days before her passing. "WOW" Ii thought to myself as Ii was moved to tears, that such a simple thing as a picture could have so much "instant" Healing effects. Nature is Love & Love is Nature. My Passion. Thank You again, Elaine. ~~~ "AMAZING BEAUTY SURROUNDS US AND EVERY MOMENT, AND THE MIRACLE IS: WE ARE PART OF IT" J. Michael Christophre | jchristophrephotography.com

Seeing a display of Elaine's photos in a hospital setting immediately made me remember the power of a beautiful photograph.  You immediately become relaxed and most of your fears drift away which is important in a hospital setting.  They are all so beautiful.  After seeing her displays, I came back and finished hanging photos in my office. I now have a more relaxed atmosphere where I spend a lot of my time.  Keep up the wonderful work Elaine.

She told me about her placing the artwork in hospitals all around the world, and I have been interested in it ever since.  After spending many months in a hospital setting with my Mother, I realize how art can inspire and comfort people who are hurting .  The gorgeous photography which Elaine provides is absolutely beautiful and adds so much warmth to the environment of a  hospital.

By having beautiful artwork in hospitals the atmosphere becomes less sterile and more comforting to the patient, bringing a sense of calm in a otherwise nervous setting.

I was honored that a photo I took was sent to a clinic in a very rural, dire strait community, in another country. It filled my heart, knowing that any patient, under any circumstances, may fall upon that photo and find solace, in their need for strength, easing anxiety perhaps. This foundation is changing how we perceive a "medical" arena to be. May it continue to grow, for it's vital that we bring beauty, nature, art into such an environment that is trying to heal those in need. A vital tool for all our healthcare institutions, worldwide.

They were so beautiful and brought a sense of peace and comfort in the midst of Mom's struggles.  After Mom passed away, I talked with Elaine about donating some of her photos to the nursing home where my father had stayed and to the hospital.  Elaine was so helpful and the whole process of donating the photos helped bring peace and a sense of closure to my grieving while at the same time bringing a promise that others would now be receiving the same peace and comfort we received from them.  I have been blessed many times when someone who sees the photos and who they were donated in honor of, comments to me about what a blessing the photos were to them.  I smile every time I see the photos and am so thankful for Elaine's foundation and her dedication in using her photos to bring healing and peace to all those who see them.

I readily agreed because I know first hand what an important role art can play in the healing process. As a young child I spent many days "stuck" in a hospital with long stark hallways. Relief finally arrived when the Occupational Therapist allowed several of us the opportunity to paint a mural on a roll of paper. The mood of the whole pediatric ward brightened when that "mural" was taped to a wall. The image donation was an easy process and I am hopeful that my photo will soon brighten the hallway or room of a healing center somewhere in the world. By providing framed vibrant photo art , the Foundation provides an oasis of comfort and relief to patients and caregivers.

By involving the staff of such places and patients she gets everyone excited about the art and about the importance of bringing art and joy to hospitals. I work in hospital as a doctor and know the difference an art piece can make to the recovery (or sadly, even when the recovery cannot happen) of a patient and their family. With Elaine's art, suddenly, the patient is no longer alone in a hospital room but rather they are transported to an exotic beach or some other amazing place. She has a vast selection of photographs to choose from and many people have also donated photographs. Last but not least, Elaine is one of those people who is genuinely wonderful and caring, at every level. Her enthusiasm and love for Healing Photo Art is inspiring.

The efforts have grown immensely and Elaine Poggi, the principle inspirator, travels to many places and has an eye for beauty. She thinks of this Foundation many times a day I think, taking pictures of beautiful moments, hanging them on walls where sick people can focus on such beauty. I am sure this helps distract patients and give them a moment's peace of mind amidst difficulties with bad health. Elaine is very generous with her time and her funding, it certainly seems an expensive affair printing out such large photos and acquiring excellent equipment to take them. I know they are appreciated immensely by both patients and visitors of hospitals.

This became evident to me when I attended a dedication of photographs on an adolescent psychiatric unit.  The photos had been chosen through discussion with the young patients and each one of them came alive when they spoke about their favorites.  We don't often appreciate the small changes we make in individual lives but this foundation can take pride in how it salves the wounds of those suffering both physically and emotionally.

Inspired by the extended hospital stay of her Mother, Elaine Poggi has worked tirelessly to bring beautiful art to hospitals around the world.  Not only actually placing Art in the hospitals, she is doing research on the healing powers of art.  I have had patients in a cancer program tell me it is nice to show survivor's pictures on the wall, but with Elaine's art you actually can gaze at it over and over and find something new each time you view it.  This gives the patient something different to focus on each time they go for a treatment.  This is a well deserving organization.  Please consider donating to this wonderful cause.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	28237	7	/users/profile/29307	silvia	Volunteer	5	02/13/2010	I have been involved with the Foundation since it's conception in 2002. and I have to admit, when my mother had the idea to start this Foundation, I was a bit skeptical. She had always taken, in my eyes, beautiful photos for as long as I could remember but I just didn't think any health care facility would want HER photos. Moreover, how was she going to approach them and get hospital executives to listen to her?Was I wrong! Her confidence, optimism and positive attitude combined with an extraordinary vision and mission got her very far. thousands of her photos are now in hundreds of health care facilities all around the world and are having a comforting and healing effect on thousands, maybe millions of people! Through the years, many people from around the globe have shared in my mother's vision and have volunteered their time, energy, photos and funding in incredible ways. It is comforting and gratifying to see how people are so enthusiastic about helping others in need.But the most rewarding moment, the reason that makes you want to keep on going on and do more, is when you get feedback from people that are directly affected by my mother's photos. They write about how a single image of nature hung in front of their hospital bed gave them beautiful dreams, gave them hope and helped them get through the dismal days and months during their sickness and care. When these photos touch a heart, and give the person a sense of hope, a love for life, then the Foundation's mission is achieved.It gives me great honor and pleasure to be able to help in my little way, from Tokyo, Japan, by giving advise on marketing strategies and designing marketing materials for the Foundation. I also helped coordinate two projects for two different hospitals in Japan and since 2009 have also become involved as a participating photographer.

As we expected (and hoped), the photo art was very well received by our patients, etc.  Many asked questions about the photographer and where were some of the pictures taken, etc.  This photo art is truly "healing art".
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	30154	3	/users/profile/31152	fady-charbel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2010	The foundation for Photo Arts is a wonderful project conceived by Elaine Poggi who has traveled the world taking gorgeous life-like pictures of spectacular settings and arranging for them to be housed in hospitals. Ms Poggi felt that patients who are ill would benefit from looking at pictures of real places depicting natural beauty. There is no doubt in my mind about the therapeutic effect of these works of art. At the department of neurosurgery of the university of illinois at chicago, we have had the good fortune of receiving some of these pictures and they have been extremely well received by all who see them. Thank you Elaine for the wonderful contribution you have made the the life of so many people. Fady T. Charbel, M.D.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	30056	7	/users/profile/31047	ovidio	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2010	Abbiamo sempre troppo poco tempo per guardarci attorno. Viviamo di corsa, il lavoro ci assilla, a  volte manca anche il tempo per la famiglia. Ma quando ci si ammala allora tutto cambia. Le giornate sono lunghissime e ogni dettaglio dell'ambiente in cui ci si trova diviene interessante. Purtroppo gli ospedali oltre a essere luoghi di sofferenza spesso sono anche squallidi. Elaine con le sue foto apre fantastiche finestre su quel mondo che non ci siamo mai fermati abbastanza a osservare e le pone in luoghi dove c' tutto il tempo per apprezzarle.
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	29857	10	/users/profile/30845	katakel	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	The FOUNDATION FOR PHOTO ART is dear to me because much like Elaines experience, my mother also spent a few months in hospitals until passing away in a 2002 in a hospice in New York City. For the months I essentially took residency in these hospitals, I too noticed how bare the walls were and wondered how a place like this could be made less cold. When I met Elaine and learned about what she did with the foundation I was very moved. I was even happier when she asked me to donate one of my own photos, which I did, proudly. I truly believe that these photos bring a ray of joy and inspiration into the lives of people who really need it. I am grateful to Elaine for giving me the opportunity to participate even if in a small way. Keep up the amazing work!

Their mission is a noble one: to place nature art in hospitals to give comfort and hope to patients. Their leadership is passionate and professional.

I have worked with the Executive Director, Elaine Poggi, and am sincerely impressed by her passion for helping advance healing through photo arts in medical settings and her generosity as staff.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	29260	7	/users/profile/30290	giorgio	Donor	5	02/19/2010	Elaine presented her Foundation to me a few years ago. I spent some time understanding and becoming sensitive to the messages she wants to deliver to humanity through her Foundation: we need to share our love, we need to give back, we need to appreciate the most simple things in nature, we need people and we need to love people. She is amazing! Thanks Elaine. After various discussions and after listening to her personal experience of the death of her mother, I decided to help in my small way so I visited a hospital where my wife and I donated some of Elaines pictures. The sight of the corridors where the patients with cancer wait before entering for their treatments, the sight of the seats and machines where the patients have to stay during their sessions made me partially understand what she meant. I feel lucky everyday for having the chance to breathe fresh air, to see beauty around me, to smell the fragrances of flowers, to swim in blue seas, to touch nature, to project my dreams into the sky, to listen to the sound of life, to feel free, to move...To feel light...To love my family and my friends. Elaine dedicates her time, her energy, her life to give hope to people. To give them hope and strength to fight their illnesses. To see beyond the cold and hard walls of life. Forza Elaine!

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	28805	7	/users/profile/29865	flo76	Donor	5	02/17/2010	I was deeply in pressed by the idea of improving the atmosphere for those who are hospitalized either as outpatients or those admitted for extended periods. I have seen the photos and the way they transform stark, depressing areas into pleasant places. Photos are not just images - they often trigger a good memory and /or pleasant thoughts. They mean different things to different people. They can give hope in times of despair, not only for the patient, but the family members as well.Through the donations of its supporters and the efforts of the founder and board, photo art has been installed around the world in big and small hospitals, for adults and children.

Two suggestions:  research and follow through on (1) which med schools are studying the effects of attractive environments on patient outcomes, and  (2) which corporations, USA and abroad, involved in digital photography would consider requests for major gifts. Then submit relevant proposals.The Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals is an important project and deserves our generous support.

Ed  questo che rende la Foundation for Photo Art in Hospital una iniziativa davvero speciale: nasce dal cuore di una donna come noi, che ha sofferto nel profondo la malattia e la perdita di una persona cara e che ha saputo trasformare questo dolore in un cosa bella e positiva per il prossimo. In questo modo di oggi dove l'individualismo e l'idifferenza sono ormai all'ordine del giorno, l'iniziativa personale di qualcuno che si occupi di sostenere, senza alcun profitto, l'animo di persone malate e di coloro che vi sono intorno  cosa rara ed unica. Sono fiera di aver avuto l'opportunit di entrare in contatto con la Foundation ed in particolar modo con la Signora Elaine perch toccare con mano tanto impegno sincero e genuino scalda il cuore e fa sentire meno soli.Auguro con tutto ilcuore lunga vita alla Foundation ed a tutti i volontari che mettono ogni giorno un p delle loro energie affinch essa vada avanti e continui un'opera immensa di beneficio in tutto il mondo.

Elaine's views of nature offer people suffering and in pain a window onto the beauty of God's creation and provide hope to many in need.  The Foundation has collected testimonies of their effectiveness which will be presented at a symposium in Florence this Spring.

Elaine has a passion for bringing art, and thereby bringing stimulation and comfort to those in hospitals. We remember seeing the cold, dreary hospital room that Elaine's mother occupied during her lengthy illness. Elaine hung her own photos to bring her cheer.We know that her photos are in many parts of the world and commend her efforts. We hope she continues her great work.

Having worked in third world countries, I know the impact these photographs are having with the hurting & sick. There is nothing more powerful that an inspiring & colorful piece of artwork in what would otherwise be a cold & stark atmosphere. Elaine's passion for her foundation is absolutely extraordinary, and has humbled me both professionally & personally. I am looking forward to taking her, along with her contributing photographers, artwork to a small village in Kenya next month.
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27784	8	/users/profile/28868	niccolo1	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2010	I've seen photos for the first time on the wall of an Hospital in Florence and it gave me a good feeling about all those beautifull pictures in such a sad environment. Later I made a donation to the foundation and helped placing photos in a Rome Hospital. I think that this foundation has a strong power giving happiness and hope to get out of the Hospital to all recovered people. Keep doing that Elaine is such a beautiful thing!!!
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27678	11	/users/profile/28760	country-mouse	Donor	5	02/10/2010	Even though Elaine Uchtmann Poggi and I grew up on neighboring farms in Southern Illinois, we lost touch with each other after high school. I occasionally saw Elaine and her mother at a restaurant in Sparta where my parents and I ate. I knew Elaine lived in Italy. And thanks to the local paper, I was aware that she had a foundation for art in hospitals and had donated photos to the Sparta Hospital.But it was only after my mother was hospitalized for several weeks at the Sparta Hospital, that I became acquainted personally with Elaines photos and their peaceful presence in a sick room or waiting area. In each of Moms rooms, there was a photo of Elaines, gracing the wall. As I would sit by Moms bed, Id see those photos and feel Gods presence through the beauty of His creation. Both Mom and I felt as if our friend Elaine was sitting there with us. I find comfort in the fact that Mom had those photos to keep her company when I wasnt there, especially on the night that she died.Seeing those photos in Moms room prodded me to contact Elaine and renew our friendship. AND get involved with The Foundation for Photo/Art in Hospitals, donating additional photos to the Sparta Hospital and the Randolph County Care Center in honor of both of my parents. The simple act of looking through the photos on the foundations website is a healing activity by itself. But seeing the photos up close and personal is so very special. They convey peace and comfort and beauty. They help a person rest in the presence of God through His beautiful world. They provide a respite for patients and family members in the midst of sickness, pain, and even death. Working with Elaine and sensing her passion for her foundation was an act of healing for me.  It encouraged me to share with others the impact these photos had on my life (and my mothers) and how they can get involved with the Foundation for Photo/Art in Hospitals.  And whenever I walk in the hospital or care center and see the photos, I smile as I remember the peace and joy they have brought to my life (and the lives of others who see them).Im thankful for the foundation AND Elaine for offering to a hurting world a glimpse of the peace, comfort, and healing only God can provide in His awesome and beautiful creation.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27296	4	/users/profile/28344	cada83	Donor	5	02/08/2010	My husband, Donald and I donated money to this organization.  We feel it was money well spent as we recognize a very real unmet emotional need of patients who may be experiencing potentially life changing situations such as surgery, chemotherapy and/or long term assisted living.  Photo art can and does allow the individual to focus on something positive and calming during such stressful times.  Don and Carol Ashley

These photos are hang in a clinic in one of the poor remote areas of the Central Region of Malawi called Mtunthama, Kasungu District. The clinic is run by the Anglican Diocese and is helping the poor and needy who would have no opportunity to the other parts of the world and its beauty and help them appreciate God's beautiful creation as result begin to think and thank God for that is beautiful in the middle of pain and difficulties.The feedback is that the personnel at this Clinic were greatly touched that some people would think of decorating a place of healing and cure like theirs free of charge.The generosity shown through Foundation For Photo Art in Hospitlas Inc. has helped transform lives and attitude towards non profit organisation that sometimes have spoiled the reason for their existence that they use the images of the poor, needy and vulnerable to become famous and find a way to raise financial contributions in Malawi.For me persoanlly it touched me because the gift was freely given with no strings attached. There was no hidden agenda in the giving. It was to help the weak and poor see the beauty of God's creation around the world.I am very grateful to Elaine for this foundation.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27227	1	/users/profile/28273	sandra-breeding	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/06/2010	Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals is a remarkable group.They are providing beauty not only to people who are sick but also to the people who work with them and their families.  Placing beautiful artwork in hospitals creates an environment of hope and healing and enables people to let go of fear.  The impact of the arts in the process of healing was recognized early on by Hippocrates, who understood the importance of uplifting his patients' spirits. Similarly, Galen would set his patients outside in the marketplace, enhancing their healing through contact with the sights and sounds of daily life. The value of a rich and uplifting environment to healing has since been documented in such research as Robert Ulrich's study: "Effects of Interior Design on Wellness: Theory and Recent Scientific Research" (Journal of Health Care Interior Design, 1991), which demonstrated that patients whocould view nature through their windows had shorter post-operative hospital stays, made negative comments less often, needed fewer doses of narcotics, and had fewer post-surgical complications. I am very proud to be a part of this organization.  This organization promotes healing through beauty!
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27226	11	/users/profile/28272	sophia1	Volunteer	5	02/06/2010	I have been in the hospital too many times in my life....so when I came across this exciting website that shares photos with hospitals around the world I just had to find a way to be a part of spreading the joy, peace, tranquillity and healing that is offered by the Healing Photo Arts Foundation. I love taking photos and have had the honor of becoming a contibuting artist which means when a hospital wishes to choose photos for the walls of their facility my photo is included with all of the many photos available on the site for them to choose from. Just recently I was informed the my photo was chosen to become part of the healing for many in Australia. I can't say how excited I am that my photo may bring a smile to someone on the other side of the world! This Foundation is bringing Hospitals around the world an opportunity to fill their walls and hallways with color and views across the globe just for the asking.....I hope to find a way to get more involved to make sure they continue to grow and prosper!! Hospital funding for art is nill and the walls need to be filled with healing arts so please support Eliane Poggi in her dream to send these photos around the world.
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27222	7	/users/profile/28267	harry-and-patti	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2010	From the first time Elaine Poggi opened the trunk of her car to show us her beautiful photographs and shared her vision for the Foundation of Photo Art in Hospitals, we have been fans. Our local hospital has benefitted from the Foundations work and we have observed the difference colorful photos make when they are introduced in the monochromatic, sterile hospital environment. Far more remarkable, however, is the difference made in the lives of people. The patients, their friends and family, and the hospital staff can all escape the worry and pressure of the hospital atmosphere when they see the colors and images on the walls. The photos add beautiful points of focus that help patients to think of places or things beyond themselves and hope for a better time. The Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals is truly making the world a better place and its doing it one photo at a time.

Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27164	4	/users/profile/28208	fatma	Volunteer	5	02/05/2010	I volunteered to distribute photo arts donated by this group to hospitals in Ankara - Turkey.  The Foundation mailed through the UPS some (36 framed 53X72 cm) photographs that I chose from their website to my home address at no cost to me and here is the list of hospitals that I distributed the photos:The first hospital that I gave some photos was dedicated to rehabilitation of soldiers who lost basic body parts to mine explosives or deliberate gunshot.  These young men are locked inside their wheelchairs; they lost their future and their numbers reach to thousands.  There were also some patients who walked around with white canes.  They could not see the photographs, but must have heard the cheerful voices of other youngsters around them.  Just like thousands of other civilian day patients, I go to this hospital from time to time for physiotherapy treatment on my aging knees.The next hospital that I donated some of these photos was the Oncology Hospital in Demetevler district of Ankara.  They hang these photos to the large saloon where hundreds of patients receive treatment each day.   Since many patients came from nearby villages, they  spend with their care givers long hours at the very large waiting room, so I donated a second batch for that room - mostly farm and nature scene photos.The childrens ward of the Social Security Hospital received my next batch of photo donation.  They had recently renovated the building, so they cheerfully hang the photos on the freshly painted walls.  I also gave another batch to their old age section.I gave another batch to the cancer floor at the womens ward of Ankara University Hospital.  While I was inspecting the walls suitable for the photos, a young new patient arrived to check into her room carrying a small suitcase.  I cannot explain the feeling I had, during the nice conversation I had with her.   The whole experience was therapeutic for me too  a mother trying to overcome the loss of her young daughter.
Foundation for Photo Art in Hospitals Inc	27097	2	/users/profile/28138	nancy1	Volunteer	5	02/04/2010	As a donating photographer, healthcare professional and family caretaker, I was astonished when I learned about this organization. To be a part of this non-profit is very, very dear to my heart. Elaine Poggi's vision is beyond measure, as is her heart. To be providing clinics and hospitals worldwide, with donated art, in order to help improve the poor conditions patients endure, speaks volumes. So many countries and their facilities are in need. Whether it's a birthing ward, cancer center, dialysis, these patients are given a visual means of comfort and peace, love from strangers, hoping to make their experience better. She has found a way to help the world's sick, that's beyond the dollar bill. It goes much deeper. Giving of her talents and others to clinics in need, on an emotional level, streaming feelings of peace, hope and beauty has and will continue to give strength and love to all that see this amazing organizations work. So many clinics are poor, rural, cold sterile places..their patients left with barren walls, or worse. There are no limits to this organization and the movement to change what we can, for all our people, wherever they live, whatever their plight. Through her foundation, we will reach out and give our brothers and sisters HOPE/LOVE/PEACE through our art.

She expressed to me that one of the most rewarding times of her life was when she was able to work with CSI on the ground directly affecting the lives of those in need.  One of the most important aspects of CSI's operations is how they get people on the ground involved in areas they can assist with.

I am praying that God will continue to lead this fine organization.  I am proud to be part of this giving community of believers.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304570		/users/profile/352220	Dawn118	Donor	5	09/14/2016	The staff at CSI is always helpful and answer questions in a timely manner. I can always be assured that my donation money is going where it is supposed to go, it is not being eaten up by corporate salaries and unnecessary expenses. Great people with a great heart and burden to help others!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263517	1	/users/profile/352220	Dawn118	Donor	5	10/13/2015	Compassion Services Intl. is lightning fast in response times. They are excellent with accountability and followup. I know assuredly that when I give money to CSI that it will go to the needs requested and not be diminished by a lot of corporate overhead, etc. I am privileged to work with CSI, the hands and feet of Jesus on the globe today! 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304546		/users/profile/395729	1972chevy	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I have seen CSI do great humanitarian work around the world and here in the U.S.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304540		/users/profile/395720	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	It means a lot to me that I can trust them as a donor to make wise decisions with the money I donate. Not every nonprofit is as trustworthy as Compassion Services International, and I am glad to know that my donations will have global impact.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304534		/users/profile/395714	MNoelleMeiser	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2016	CSI is quick to respond to both local and foreign disasters and health care needs. I hope to work with them in the future!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304533		/users/profile/234115	Kenneth9	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I'm thankful for the work Compassion Services is doing.  My greatest feeling is trust.  I can be sure that the funds are going for the need that has been presented.  I can also be assured that the people on the scene that are helping to give out the funds are godly people that will be great examples of Christian living.  God bless you in the work you are doing. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177551		/users/profile/234115	Kenneth9	Donor	4	10/14/2013	I am thankful for the great work Compassion Services International is doing.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304529		/users/profile/395708	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I'm a supporter of Compassion Services International. They do a great job reaching out to those in need both at home and abroad. We can't always go, but we can help those who do.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304528		/users/profile/395707	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	In the times of greatest need Compassion Services is on sight and available to make a difference.  We are thankful for their willingness to serve.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304521		/users/profile/395701	Jaime15	Donor	5	09/14/2016	Always on the front lines lending a hand where the needs are greatest!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304520		/users/profile/233898	protocal59	Client Served	3	09/14/2016	This is a charity well worth contributing to. Every dollar you give goes to the cause for which you give it. That is comforting. So many charities expunge administrative cost that can run anywhere from 8-15%.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263157	1	/users/profile/233898	protocal59	Donor	5	10/12/2015	I'm usually weary about donating to the various charities and causes. This is due to the fact that I have asked many of them what percentage of my donation goes to the actual cause. You would be amazed at the answers that you will receive if you have never asked. CSI is the only charity that I donate too without hesitation. 100% of every dollar goes to the cause. Besides this, their name says it all. "Compassion" truly defines who they are and what they do.Whether it's earthquake relief, flood victims, other natural disasters, or food shortage, Compassion Services International can be trusted to connect your heart with the cause. They are relentless in their follow-up and provide stories, pictures, and successful result orientated stories that gives the donor a pure sense of compassion.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177348	2	/users/profile/233898	protocal59	Donor	5	10/14/2013	There are so many organizations soliciting for our donations. Sometimes we find out after the fact that these organizations do not use our donation to the full extent that we expected. Other times we find out that more of our donation goes to administrative cost than to the actual cause.  CSI is an organization that will take 100% of your hard earned dollar and give it ALL to the purpose that they are appealing to you for. I know that when I give to CSI, there is no doubt that my money will go to that cause I wish to support. And best of all, the name says it all, "COMPASSION" services.Pastor Kevin Horne
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304515		/users/profile/352143	kencan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/14/2016	We are missionaries in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Compassion is readily available to help in times of crisis. For example, we are the third poorest country in the world, most of our villages suffer for lack of grain. Compassion as send funds on regular basis for distribution. They are integral, professional and compassionate. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263440	2	/users/profile/352143	kencan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2015	We live in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Being the 3rd poorest nation in the world there are many humanitarian needs. In May 2015 we were experiencing extreme drought in our villages. Cattle and other livestock were dying and the people were suffering. There was nothing to eat as the ground turned completely to red clay and sand. Compassion acted immediately sending the much needed funding to buy grain. They were efficient in their paperwork and expedited the funds professionally. They simply, "saved lives". 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304501		/users/profile/395679	Haylee M.	Donor	5	09/14/2016	My review may not be the most detailed, as I have only been blessed to give on occasion, not to join any of the missions, but I have met those in charge and let me tell you, they are genuine people. I gave a donation to their cause at a booth set up at the last NAYC (national american youth congress) and before I ever gave I had many questions and they were so kind and willing to answer all my questions.After giving I was automatically subscribed to an email newsletter (I could unsubscribe at any time) showing what CSI does and how they do it and what my money helped with.They are an on the scene kind of charity, asking for volunteers to go on mission's trips to give medical aide in disaster areas.Earthquake? They're there. Tsunami? They're there. Flooding? They're there.They are currently seeking donations to help Louisiana flood victims rebuild their homes. Most charities are kind of shady, you're not sure how much of what you give actually goes to help people, but I believe in this charity. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304500		/users/profile/395678	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	This team goes around the world offering aid after disasters. I have seen raw footage of staff members offering medical treatment and providing food--a tremendous cause. Their donation process is easy to use and the staff is dedicated to a noble effort. This is my favorite of all the charities I support.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304498		/users/profile/395675	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	CSI does a fantastic job with the resources available to them and is exceptional at keeping donors updated re the progress of their various projects.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304494		/users/profile/395670	awt1963	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I've been on a few mission trips and the JESUS film is the most productive at winning souls. The miracles that happen prove GOD has His hand on them. and still works miracles today.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304491		/users/profile/395667	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	Members that serve in this nonprofit really are humble and sacrificial 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304490		/users/profile/234061	mdennisjohnson	Donor	5	09/14/2016	We feel secure knowing our donations go directly and quickly to those needing help.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263120	1	/users/profile/234061	mdennisjohnson	Donor	5	10/12/2015	Compassion Services notifies us instantly when disasters occur and gets relief to points of need quickly. We feel great about giving through Compassion Services because we know our contribution goes entirely, or almost entirely, to those in need rather than administrative overhead. Compassion Services provides a rapid and direct channel to truly help victims when and where they need help during times of tragedy. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177501	1	/users/profile/234061	mdennisjohnson	Donor	5	10/14/2013	Compassion Services International is structured in such a way as to allow donations to go quickly and directly to those needing assistance. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304488		/users/profile/395664	chucky111	Donor	5	09/14/2016	Amazingly low overhead, almost all of your $ gift gets to the place you are looking to give, this is practically unheard of! CSI also collects and delivers other types of material donations to specific needs in specific areas. They have often been able to get into places and help during a natural disaster where no one else can. Thank you for all you do!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304487		/users/profile/395663	A.J. D.	Donor	5	09/14/2016	We love supporting worthy causes through CSI. They are trustworthy and reliable.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304483		/users/profile/395655	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	I love working with CSI because almost every dollar goes to the prupose rather than a lot of administration expense. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	304482		/users/profile/395654	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2016	Great group that makes an impact on the ground in real situations. I appreciate their commitment to maximizing their impact by minimizing their administrative costs. I'm confident when I give, that the people who need help are going to receive it.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	264733	1	/users/profile/353455	Writer	Donor	5	10/16/2015	CSI sponsors worthy projects around the world while maintaining low operating costs.  I love that they have smaller projects that you can contribute to and make a big difference in an individual's life.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	264559		/users/profile/353278	Linda382	Donor	5	10/16/2015	This organization is truly worthy of recognition. They embody their name Compassion. Whether it is assisting with a domestic or international disaster or assisting with an individual, they show compassion. They also keep donors informed which helps us know how the money is spent. I trust this organization to steward the money donated wisely.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	264365		/users/profile/353085	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I went with this group to the Dominican Republic. The trip changed my life. We worked very hard and treated around 600 people. Missionaries were great to work with. Our directors and leaders of the trip were motivational and inspiring. I will go on another trip with this organization. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263900		/users/profile/352603	Writer	Donor	5	10/14/2015	I cannot go into the countries that have been hit with disasters.  But, my brothers and sisters in the Lord are going and have been doing amazing things with mine and other folks charitable donations.  They are helping and doing what God would want us to do.  This is why I love to support Compassion Services International
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263623	1	/users/profile/352328	Writer	Donor	5	10/13/2015	I like to donate to CSI because I know my money is actually helping the cause I'm donating for.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263541	1	/users/profile/352246	Writer	Donor	5	10/13/2015	Compassion Services International is just as it's name states, full of compassion. they respond to emergency situations sometimes sooner than a government agency, making a difference in many lives during vulnerable times. It a nonprofit that I choose to support financially because I know that my money is wisely vested, and overhead costs kept as low as possible.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263498	1	/users/profile/352202	Writer	Donor	5	10/13/2015	CSI enables and equips individuals to be a part of major opportunities to show compassion and love, in a transparent and dependable way! 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263468	1	/users/profile/352170	Writer	Donor	5	10/13/2015	Great organization which assesses and assists the needs in times of tragedy.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263453	1	/users/profile/290552	jameskellstrom	Donor	5	10/13/2015	Effective Organization for getting the resource you give to the need without wasting the resource unnecessarily on top heavy bureaucracy.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	226817	1	/users/profile/290552	jameskellstrom	Donor	5	10/26/2014	Hands down the best charity group of this kind out there. Getting your money where it can do the most good for fellow man. This is not a hype based organization, but a service oriented effort making a real difference. Keep up the good work.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263400	1	/users/profile/328344	Will_Sackett	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	Absolutely the best charity, everyone truly cares about people. From the leaders to all the workers, everyone does it because they want to help others not because they have too. I got to see how much they care first hand, when i volunteered with them a few years ago. Also they are top notch, and very professional.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	241718	1	/users/profile/328344	Will_Sackett	Volunteer	5	04/26/2015	I worked with CSI in Haiti, summer 2012. Yes even 2 years after the disaster, they were still working to help the many people in need. A true VOLUNTEER organization, that anyone can be proud to be a part of. Whether volunteer, donor, or involved in another aspect of CSI, you won't be disappointed. To this day it remains the one time I really felt I made a difference. Coming home at the end of my time was hard, knowing there was still so much to do. Thankfully CSI continues to send teams there, and around the world, to wherever they are needed.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263375	1	/users/profile/352082	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	I believe that Compassion Services International (CSI) has helped in many critical situations in providing disaster relief in many countries. They give freely and work unselfishly.  
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263365	1	/users/profile/352072	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	Disaster relief and medical missions - reaching out to others.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263276	1	/users/profile/351977	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	Very happy with their services.  Notices to donate are clear and helpful.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263269	1	/users/profile/351969	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	I have given to worthy compassionate causes several times through Compassion Services International.  They have exceptional performance with low overhead.  I highly recommend them!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263254	1	/users/profile/351956	Writer	Donor	4	10/12/2015	Since I cannot go, it's good to have an organization that I can contribute to that will go and help those who have experienced such tragedies and calamities in their lives.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263219	1	/users/profile/351925	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	Worked with them to bring relief to tornado victims in Moore, OK and South OKC.  They assembled a great team of people to give supplies and to help with storm clean up
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263213	1	/users/profile/351919	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	When there is a crisis, compassion is quick to send email alerts with links that show how I can help. They make it easy to give and later give updates on situations. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263212	1	/users/profile/351918	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	CSI lends great help through disaster relief, and it is a pleasure to be able to assist them through donations. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263202	1	/users/profile/234627	Rosie O Day	Donor	5	10/12/2015	CSI is great about keeping me updated about  how  the  funds  are  used.  They send regular e mails and video stories that are very inspirational.   They  communicate about  the   teams  that are leaving  for  what  countries and what   goals  they set out to accomplish and later how those goals were met;  great feedback!CSI is also prompt  in responding to  questions  about  donation receipts  and  providing  a tax statement at the  end of the year.I can tell  that  these people are very compassionate about  what  they do for others and are accountable to the people who contribute to their cause !  I am happy  to donate to such a great  organization! Thank you CSI for all you do to  count  for  Christ in this present  world!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	178020	1	/users/profile/234627	Rosie O Day	Donor	5	10/16/2013	The reason why I am confident to donate to this organization is that  I know the people that are helped by my contributions--the services and money given to people in need  are real and relevant.  I really liked the  ON-SITE video update about the  tornado victims in Oklahoma--this video  was so  well done  and allowed contributors to understand  the situation,  and real needs of people  in Real- Life situations.   It is COMPASSION IN ACTION  --true reaching out  to  another in need--a hand up, not just a hand out. Another  example that gripped me was the story of  how one family in the church in Greece had not eaten  any meat  in over a year.  Due to the economic depression in the country, any food was scarce.  To hear the NAMES of  families and individual people,--  to see A FACE and a need  before me, made giving to this cause  a natural and reasonable  inclination. The stories  helped me to know the people--they became like family to me, but living  on the other side of the world.  I felt like  I was sending a personal package to someone I knew.    To hear the words  from  this organization  that I could send:    'whatever I could contribute'....helped me to realize I could make a big  difference with even a small  gift.  This attitude of giving what I could, helped me  to feel good about  what I could do, and NOT  bad about  what I could NOT do.   I did not act  out of guilt, but out of relief  and compassion, joyfully knowing that funds would get to where they needed to be, quickly and efficiently!  I trust  this organization. I will confidently continue to contribute to Compassion International through the United Pentecostal Church.  I look for, and depend on CSI to let  me know where  the needs are in the world;  both here in the United States  or  abroad, all places are equally represented. I want  to  help  those in need around  me , close and far , and I know  this organization will direct  my  funds into the most appropriate  avenues to help the most people possible. Thank you CSI for  helping  me to GIVE ! 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263199	1	/users/profile/351906	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	They make it easy to donate to a wide variety of causes, and are on top of crises as they arise.  CSI also has a very personal feel to their organization making me feel like I have a voice and helping me know that I can trust them.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263191	1	/users/profile/351898	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	I have the highest respect for Compassion Services International.  They are the eyes, ears and hands of help for the hurting and they bring relief to the suffering.  They are the connection between those that care and those that are in need.  I appreciate their work and the opportunities they provide for compassionate giving.  May the Lord continue to bless and use them.  Russell
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263181	1	/users/profile/351888	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	This organization is one of the few who truly use all funds for the need they are promoting.  They are real people making a difference and I am proud to give to this organization.  Keep up the great work you are doing , for you are impacting the lives of many for the kingdom of God!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263173	1	/users/profile/351880	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	With many non profits out there, it can be hard to know who to support.  I have tremendous confidence in CSI both as good stewards and in their effectiveness of meeting the desperate needs of so many people.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263168	1	/users/profile/351876	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	I like it because I'm able to help financially as well as physically traveling there.  Many people who are married have to travel together when doing missions work but my husband isn't able to travel at this time and this gives us an opportunity to not only go by giving but I'm able to travel without that restriction. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263156	1	/users/profile/351865	Writer	Board Member	5	10/12/2015	CSI does a great job of helping provide relief to those who have suffered loss.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263148	1	/users/profile/351858	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	My wife and I started an adoption agency and helped set up an orphanage in Nepal five years ago.  After the earthquate they sent teams twice to help our children and others in the region.  They even provided the resources for them to have provisions should there be another earthquake.  
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263147	1	/users/profile/351857	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	CSI is a wonderful ministry that provides help and hope to those in need around the world. I know several people who have traveled to these different areas with CSI and have listened to their experiences...always tremendously positive.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263121	1	/users/profile/351830	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	Compassion Services International goes where the most current needs are ... whether domestic or international and funds appear to be wisely allocated.   People you can trust.  
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	263118	1	/users/profile/233941	ronphillips	Donor	5	10/12/2015	Great organization doing excellent humanitarian work around the world wherever major disasters strike.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223696	1	/users/profile/233941	ronphillips	Donor	5	10/16/2014	Grateful for the response of CMI to the OK City tornadoes, especially in view of the fact that our daughter and family live there. Appreciate the work of this organization.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177386	1	/users/profile/233941	ronphillips	Donor	5	10/14/2013	Provided much needed help in aftermath of Moore, OK tornadoes. Our daughter and her family live in Moore, and though they personally had little damage, we were all impressed and grateful for the response of CSI to their fellow towns people who greatly needed help and were assisted by CSI.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	245692		/users/profile/332902	N.Burke	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/19/2015	As a clinician working in Nepal, I observed volunteers from this organisation engaging in risky behaviour, they mean well, but they are not fully trained in disaster relief. Its volunteers are hospital staff, with no experience in the field, going along on a trip, to feel useful. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	235243		/users/profile/315822	denimskirt	Volunteer	5	12/10/2014	I have been in Haiti with CSI. They are all about serving those in need! There are no 6 figure incomes for executives or any such foolishness. They put together teams of willing health professionals who finance their own way. Donations made to them go to providing direct needs such as medicines for those served.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	233255		/users/profile/296976	Jkeel	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2014	I am confident in CSI to inform me where there is a need to help the hurting,  whether in our own nation or on the other side of the world and in their use of donations they receive to do exactly that to the fullest of their ability. It is truly their mission and calling.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	225757		/users/profile/235163	Ceetcha	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	I usually find out about various disasters and needs through their correspondence before I hear about them on the news.  They are informative on the needs of others and will let us know how they were able to help.  
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	178533		/users/profile/235163	Ceetcha	Donor	5	10/17/2013	CSI is an organization that helps a wide diversity of people.  They help on international and national levels.  Whenever there is a natural disaster CSI is there to help. They communicate a need and follow up with newsletters showing how they were able to help.   
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	225048		/users/profile/288820	Joy_23	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2014	This organization has low overhead and high impact.  They are doing great work state-side and internationally.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	224452		/users/profile/288212	als_79	Donor	5	10/20/2014	I feel confident when I donate to CSI that my money is being put to good use for the exact purposes it was solicited for.  This is a wonderful Christian based organization that does much good around the world!  I'm always happy to donate when I receive word of a need CSI is focusing on.  They are also prompt in sending donation receipts for tax purposes.  
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	224451		/users/profile/288211	xtinea.tanecia	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I was privileged to take a trip with CSI in 2011 to Haiti. I was able to experience service to others like never before. This non-profit works tirelessly to see that a positive impact is made wherever they go. I appreciate their constant effort to make a difference and change lives.  If you have the opportunity to be a part of the work CSI is doing, please do so. Changing lives through service and monetary gifts never grows old.  Thanks CSI for all you do! 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223979		/users/profile/231804	HANKsy	Donor	4	10/17/2014	Notices from Compassion still grab my attention because of the desperate situations they address. I am thankful for the opportunities to be a small part of ministering to those in the midst of tragedy that this organization makes possible. Whether it be the Ebola crisis, devastating floods in Serbia, or refugees fleeing religious persecution, I'm confident that CSI is using donations to be God's hand extended to the "least of these" around the world. Therefore, I love being able to give more to this crucial work through AmazonSmile now.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	175457	1	/users/profile/231804	HANKsy	Donor	5	10/08/2013	I always feel a sense of security that my donations to CSI are used wisely for their intended purposes. The kind of work done by this organization is demonstrating God's heart in helping those in greatest need around the world. I am impressed with how well CSI utilizes its limited resources and its overall level of outreach.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223972		/users/profile/287727	swentw1997	Donor	5	10/17/2014	Worldwife, charity,  onsite assistance, hands-on!!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223899		/users/profile/287651	Krista12	Donor	5	10/17/2014	CSI is a wonderful way for people to be able to help those who need it most. I love how they allow small donations, which is perfect for people like me, who want to help but do not have a lot to share. Every little bit contributes to the whole, and it makes me feel like I am truly helping out. Plus, they share where my money is working. I donated for tsunami relief and for tornado relief over the past couple of years, and CSI shared the hope and peace that I was able to help give to those who needed it most.  Truly, CSI is a Godsend. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223771		/users/profile/287518	cdjacts238	Donor	5	10/17/2014	Thankful for Compassion Services International.  The organization keeps me up-to-date on high-priority needs around the world.  I am comforted that the money I donate helps the victims.  Compassion is quick to share updates and communications about how our donations are helping others.  Thank you Jesus for Compassion Services International.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223754		/users/profile/287502	N8Guin	Donor	5	10/17/2014	I LOVE getting the email from CSI that says will you help us in this need or crisis... and I get those often. And that tells me that CSI is on top of helping in a lot of major catastrophes that happen, not just here in the states but world wide. They are always sending some type of relief to a situation. It's like they are just hungry to help anyone that needs it. I appreciate CSI's devotion and dedication to the cause! 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	223718		/users/profile/287462	McQuinns	Donor	5	10/17/2014	We have supported CSI from it's very beginnings.  As a young couple with small children we faithfully gave each week into  CSI  through our home church, and were so grateful knowing that the funds were being well used. Watching the changes within CSI over the years has not changed our deep regard  for CSI we still give as we can afford (we are now church planters and help our local assembly with most of our giving dollars) and only wish we could give more and with more regularly.  CSI is always our first choice for gifting our side out local assembly. Rev and Mrs. Lois McQuinn

It's always designated and I really enjoy giving money that way.  We can't control what happens in our world-disasters, disease, depravity...but we can control how we give to alleviate the pain of these situations.  Thanks so much Compassion Services for providing a venue to give!

COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177735		/users/profile/234314	Pastor Anthony	Donor	5	10/15/2013	As the pastor of a church, we look for organizations that will meet the immediate needs of people experiencing tragedy and not use donated funds to cover the cost of their operating expenses.  CSI acts quickly to get funds, services, or materials into the hands of the people who need them most.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177733		/users/profile/234313	home-ward	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	My husband and I are volunteers in the Medical side of Compassion Services International. This organization goes beyond the call of duty and meets the needs of many individuals, some of whom might not receive care otherwise. I remember working with the CSI team in Haiti after the earthquake- a small child was brought to our clinic because of an earache. Green, oozy puss was draining from the affected ear. My assistant and I were able to clean the ear, inspect the eardrum and make recommendations for healing. If we had not been in that particular village at that time, the child's hearing might have been lost. CSI is truly making a difference in lives! My husband and I are eager to volunteer more!
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177605		/users/profile/234171	emilyjewell2012	Donor	5	10/14/2013	I love compassion services international and have donated twice and will definately be donating again.

COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	177407		/users/profile/233960	Pastor-Wilkerson	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	As a missionary in Haiti from 1989 until 2003 I was privileged to see Compassion Services International in its infancy.  During our 14 years there they provided help for schools, feeding programs and clinics.  When the 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 I was a part of an emergency response team sent by CSI to asses the situation and make preparations for supplies and medical teams to come in.  I was contacted by CSI just a matter of hours after the tragedy.  We were on the ground within 48 hours of the earthquake.  In just a matter of days CSI was able to get medical teams and supplies to the hardest hit areas.  CSI with its staff and volunteers has proven over and over again their willingness to put themselves in harms way to bring help to the hurting both around the world and here in the U.S.

On many occasions I have donated funds because I truly believe in their trustworthiness of delivering the services and help needed in many disaster zones.  I rank them on par with  Samaritans Purse and World Vision.  Deeds aren't done for recognition but simply to care.
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	155473	2	/users/profile/206396	Becca10	Volunteer	5	04/20/2013	Last year, I had the opportunity to travel to Haiti with Compassion Services International. During that time I was able to help at different clinics and orphanages. I will never forget the looks on the faces of those as we helped then, but I will also never forget as they paid us back in their friendship. Compassion Services International gave me the opportunity to not only help those in Haiti, but to get to know the people and the culture. 
COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	152086	4	/users/profile/203161	icaroo	Volunteer	5	04/04/2013	This organization helps not only fellow North Americans, but also the people in need around the world.

COMPASSION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL	152079	4	/users/profile/203150	Amber34	Volunteer	5	04/04/2013	I went to Haiti with a group of young people and CSI, and I was amazed at how giving and loving this organization is. I know that each treatment, bag of food and toys were such a blessing to all of those people who would usually go without. It was a blessing for me to be a part of that, and without Compassion I wouldn't have been able to do that.

From groceries to hair cuts to shoes to clothing to ears to listen to people's stories and shoulders to cry on....COH is the real deal.
Convoy of Hope	216762		/users/profile/280274	edb541	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I served as a volunteer at a Convoy of Hope outreach in Dallas.

Convoy of Hope	216676		/users/profile/280175	Shelly24	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	We started volunteering a few years back on Tuesday nights helping to sort food.  I would being my whole family, wanting my children to understand how lucky they are to not worry about the source of their food, but also to help those who aren't so lucky.  The children's schedule got us away from that, but last Saturday my daughter and I were able to help with the 5k race.  We had a wonderful time and met some great people.

Convoy of Hope	216534		/users/profile/280030	Ally L.	Donor	5	09/23/2014	Convoy of Hope is everywhere!  From their 3rd world feeding initiatives, to disaster relief aid, to community building, I have seen my donations help literally thousands of people.  They were there after the Joplin tornado and are still there rebuilding over 2 years afterwards.  There is not a natural disaster that Convoy of Hope isn't involved. I  proud to support them!
Convoy of Hope	216467		/users/profile/279961	Shenae S.	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	Convoy of Hope was so well organized! We were continually reminded that the people coming were our "guests of honor" and should be treated as such.  That phrase kept ringing in my head as I served and hopefully this made me a much better volunteer.  I love that they are so quick to the scene of a tragedy.  As a victim of a tragedy before Convoy of Hope was founded, I can see what a blessing this group is to those in need!
Convoy of Hope	216458		/users/profile/279954	Nicole100	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	I had the opportunity to volunteer with Convoy of Hope a week after the tornado hit Joplin.  They were very organized.  They mobilized quickly.  They provided for the needs of the people.  It was a life-changing experience.  I would definitely volunteer again with Convoy of Hope.  
Convoy of Hope	216449		/users/profile/279941	CElizabeth	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	I volunteered with the Convoy of Hope Summer Internship program a few years ago and had a great experience. I learned about the impact of service and how to think critically about a plan to serve. Some programs are about giving handouts. Convoy taught me about sustainability and empowerment.  They were also intentional about identifying what the community perceived as a need (not just what outsiders think is needed). Convoy worked directly with local churches to connect people, instead of providing a one-time need. I was personally challenged to grow as a person of faith, to be active in the community, and to give strategically.  I will never forget seeing 3rd world poverty firsthand, and my internship with Convoy of Hope gave me this opportunity. Although it's been over 4 years, I still think of my Summer with Convoy often and how it changed me. I currently work in a community agency to combat poverty, in part as a result of this opportunity to serve!

Convoy of Hope	216445		/users/profile/279933	Silvia S.	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2014	I would love to work for Convoy Of Hope. I have seen them in action numerous times. Not only in the 'big' disasters, but in the local community. I live in Springfield MO, where their home distribution center is. I was also very involved with volunteering with my church in Joplin after that horrific tornado in 2011! One of the first big trucks seen parked on Rangelne Rd. was Convoy's, already set up and helping victims who had lost everything. Several people that work there go to the same church I do(James River Church) and I know they have a true heart for missions and meeting people's needs. Convoy of Hope truly reflects the heart of our Savior!!!
Convoy of Hope	216435		/users/profile/279923	Kearsten J.	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I have volunteered with Convoy of Hope on several occasions. Each time I am struck with the compassion and devotion that comes from this organization. Convoy of Hope is made up of individuals who have a true passion for serving, not only those in our community, but people around the world as well. As a volunteer, I knew exactly what my efforts were supporting and I felt the appreciation that came from the people at Convoy of Hope. This is an amazing nonprofit organization and I am so proud of all of the wonderful blessings they have brought to people from every walk of life all over the world!
Convoy of Hope	216430		/users/profile/279917	Melissa215	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I heard of Convoy of Hope many months ago through our church and decided this would be an awesome way for our family to get involved. My youngest two daughters and I decided to volunteer for the Coeurd'Alene event. We showed up nice and early and spent about an hour packing about 5000 bags with groceries. We were the ones who carried the bags to the tables so we worked up a good sweat while having fun.  My youngest daughter went off to volunteer at the kids tent and my other daughter and I worked in the shoe tent. I have never seen so many happy children with new shoes in my life. Being able to meet their needs in such a basic way while showing the love of Christ was a real blessing to me. We even had bags of food and some shoes left over to donate to our local food bank and charities, something that is very needed around here. It was a blast to be a part of from the night before volunteer rally with excellent music to the cleaning up the next day. We will most definitely be involved again if it comes to our area.

Because of Convoy of Hope so many people who needed home repairs, items, or complete rebuilds were given hope. The Convoy team is compassionate and genuine in the kindness and love they show others. When they do a project they don't just take care of people's physical needs, but they feed then spiritually and emotionally. Thank you for all you do!
Convoy of Hope	216406		/users/profile/279890	Brandon16	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I was honored to come alongside Convoy of Hope in Long Island this past summer!  Their team is purposeful in what they do and passionate in who they care for.  It was amazing to be part of a winning team that showed real love to so many people through a job fair, giving out groceries, praying for those in need, and blessing children in the Kids Zone with inflatables and many other games.

Convoy of Hope	216394		/users/profile/279880	Carlos17	Client Served	5	09/22/2014	This organization has help our ministry a lot, their generosity and their dedication to help the poor and to feed the hungry children around the world is beyond expectation, Personally Our church membership  have grown in numbers and the children are very excited to go to school everyday because their stomach are full and not hungry, compared to the past when these children we're not yet enrolled in the feeding program they only go to school twice or once a week and sometime they don't go to school  for the  whole week  just for them to look for food to eat in exchange for their education.CONVOY of HOPE Philippines's  response also during the calamity/disaster is superb, if there's any one who comes first,  its the convoy of hope Philippines, before any other NGOs & Government relief comes, The CONVOY of HOPE Philippines have already distributed relief to the need people who are victim of the disaster. Thank God for CONVOY of HOPE, May God bless this org. more and more and all  those donors and volunteers, in deed your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Rev.

Convoy of Hope	216386		/users/profile/279873	Rhonda28	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I volunteered at a local event.  I helped setup and take down as well as a non-profit booth giving info out.  This group is totally organized and friendly.  People attending didn't just get food, but haircuts manicures, hygiene items, and access to other community organizations.  The kids had playtime and balloons.  Also for those in need of prayer there is a prayer tent with area ministers and individuals who pray over  needs.  Great organization to volunteer for and to support with funds!

Literally hundreds of people turned out and no one was turned away! I was (and still am) proud of what was accomplished for the people in need. THIS is what Christianity is all about!!! 
Convoy of Hope	216363		/users/profile/279850	Daniel81	Donor	5	09/22/2014	When at the World Conference for the Assemblies of God as a band member backing the 1000 voice Teen Challenge choir in the year 2000, I saw the Convoy of Hope semi truck in the RCA Dome. I've been impressed with the integrity and scope of all that Convoy of Hope has done over the years. And now the Feed One Missions outreach is impacting lives in impoverished areas. We continue to support this God ordained ministry and are expecting even greater things to come from this great outreach.
Convoy of Hope	216357		/users/profile/279844	Gojugurl	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	Just got back to Springfield from Haiti yesterday. Very eye opening trip! Saw two orphanages, a school and the agricultural plots. Convoy is helping that country and many others become self sufficient and learn about Christ. 42 orphanages and 180,000 fed a day with 9O% of the donation going into the community. Amazing. 
Convoy of Hope	216355		/users/profile/279842	Summer3	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	This was by far the most amazing experience of my life! Volunteered for the Las Cruces,NM 2013 Convoy and I can't wait to do it again.  I spent 8 hours in the rain and 34 degree weather and I'd do it again in a heartbeat! 
Convoy of Hope	216354		/users/profile/279827	dsbarclift	Donor	5	09/22/2014	Convoy of Hope is a top-rate compassion organization that my husband and I have supported for yrs.  They feed children, train families to grow/make their own crops/goods to be self-sufficient, provide simple means for clean water, are first responders for natural disasters and join with local US cities to reach out and offer a "Day of Hope" to the needy and hurting.  Whether in the States or abroad, Convoy of Hope is an incredible organization!
Convoy of Hope	216352		/users/profile/279840	Jim_113	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/22/2014	I have been a high school teacher for over 19 years. 16 of those years I have served as faculty advisor for Key Club, a volunteer service club sponsored by Kiwanis. I also served as an adult member of the MO-ARK District Board of Key Club International for 10 of those years. I have led students in many service projects, but our service during a Convoy outreach in Springfield, MO back in 2004 stands out as one of my favorite and most memorable. It was a real joy to carry groceries out to people's car and visit with them along the way and to see the tremendous difference Convoy was making with just this one event. My wife now works for Convoy and is excited to go to work each day. The work atmosphere is so pleasant and she loves her coworkers. What a class act and what a blessing Convoy of Hope is to so many people!

Convoy of Hope	216327		/users/profile/279813	Jan_48	Donor	5	09/22/2014	Convoy of Hope seems to be everywhere that people are in desperate need! They are a right on time group, not a "we will access  this situation, have a board meeting and then maybe decide to help" kind of group.I have been a victim of a tornado and these kind of people often need immediate help. I have also read Relentless and have become informed on the background and huge hearts of the founders. GOD BLESS CONVOY OF HOPE, Jan Eoff

They are usually the first, or one of the first on site when these disasters hit.  We keep up with what they are doing, and are behind them 100%. 
Convoy of Hope	174509		/users/profile/230787	ValC	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2013	What an amazing ministry!  I had the privilege of visiting Convoy of Hope coincidentally during a preparation to go out to a tornado devastated area.  It was like a beehive in the warehouse!  Everyone was busy collecting all they needed to pack the trucks and get to the area as quickly as they could.  It's a "well oiled machine" to say the least!  If I lived in the area I would definitely be a volunteer!!! 
Convoy of Hope	174430	1	/users/profile/230705	Charissa K.	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	I have worked with Convoy on sevdral events over the past year and a half. I've been to Haiti twice with them and also done a few community outreaches. Convoy has completely amazed me in their dedication to the service of others. The staff has always gone above and beyond everytime I've worked with them. Proud to be a volunteer with them.
Convoy of Hope	174424		/users/profile/230699	Mary210	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2013	Although I have never had need of their services, I know these people really care about those they are helping and would be there for me if the time comes.
Convoy of Hope	174416		/users/profile/230691	Tana H.	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	I have helped in their warehouse with other volunteers - always respected and thanked.  I have seen first hand how many people are positively affected by their help.  Working along side of them in Joplin, Mo, working wih their back to school outreach, and helping them with Rural Compassion  is a blessing   And I can't help but thank them enough for the blessings that have been returned to me.   I especially love the fact that every Wednesday morning,  the staff gets together to share and pray together. 
Convoy of Hope	174410		/users/profile/230685	toyshopper1	Client Served	5	10/06/2013	We are so thankful for Convoy of Hope's help when our home flooded in 2002.  They served so many with many necessities that were unable to us (them).  God bless you and all your volunteers!
Convoy of Hope	174350		/users/profile/230619	Darla L.	Donor	5	10/06/2013	Convoy of Hope always up front and open with how my donation is spent. Very VERY little goes to management. By depending on volunteers and buying in bulk, they are able to make my donation stretch a lot further than if I just went to the store and bought things off the shelf. I appreciate the fact that they share the love of Jesus as they help people with tragedy in their life! I love that Convoy of Hope is not tied up in government red tape, and usually have those big trucks headed out within just a few hours of disaster!! There's nothing like a "Convoy" of hope!
Convoy of Hope	174341		/users/profile/230611	Sylvester J.	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	We served with this organization to hand out over 5k bags of food needed for people in a community in Orlando, FL this summer. There organization of the day was exceptional from setup and e execution even to response and compassion to some late comers after the event was over. It was all about serving the people in the community with the loving heart of Jesus. No judgement or expectation but to serve people in need. That was refreshing and an honor to be apart of. We also washed kids feet to fit them with new tennis shoes for going back to school. Again their montra of service with an open heart and smile with all the love and compassion you can muster up at all times no matter what level of service you are assigned. 
Convoy of Hope	174321		/users/profile/230590	Kaye B.	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2013	I've not had any direct contact with this organization, but I am a member of the Assemblies of God Church. I am always impressed with the reports I read regarding the haste of their response following a tragedy and the thoroughness of their meeting every need of those affected. I regret to say that I have not taken an opportunity to contribute financially to their cause due to my restricted budget. However, when my financial situation improves, I can assure you that I will support them. It is an honor for me to take this moment to express my admiration for Convoy of Hope, it's staff, and volunteers. 
Convoy of Hope	174316		/users/profile/230584	Sherie D.	Client Served	5	10/06/2013	My children and I were stuck in an ice storm a few years back.  We were forced to leave our home and head to the local elementary school.  Convoy of Hope came to the rescue with food, water and cots.  Most of the people they served that night were single moms with small children.  My husband was a truck driver and he was out on the road, so I was essentially alone with my children as well.  We put our children to sleep that night safely and assisted the Convoy driver in unloading the supplies they brought to us.  We were very appreciative.  Many of the folks had to stay there almost 2 weeks before their homes had local stores and gas stations had power.  I thank them for myself, my family and my neighbors.  I have praised them ever since.

Convoy of Hope	174310		/users/profile/230578	Connie C. Cline	Donor	5	10/06/2013	This is a local NFP in my hometown and they are the best.  They use their donations for what the donor intended for them to be used and not for high administrative salaries.  They are a Christian based organization that can be trusted to do what is right.  They operate their programs with integrity.

Convoy of Hope	174298		/users/profile/230567	mikphire	Client Served	5	10/05/2013	When Hurricane Sandy struck us in Long Island, our church- Full Gospel Church of Island Park, our congregants and neighborhoods were devastated. It looked like a war zone in Island park and Long Beach, no electricity, no communication, no heat, no water... two days after, Convoy of Hope pulled into our church's parking lot, which was filled with destroyed vehicles and boats. It was like a shining beacon of hope, a link to the outside world. They delivered water and supplies and love. I believe they were one of the very first forms of help and relief on the scene after the devastation. We were first introduced to them when they came to ask for donations soon after the Haitian earthquake. We had no idea we would have been on the receiving end of their help. Truly a blessing, especially after a disaster
Convoy of Hope	174292		/users/profile/230557	Tammy51	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	Convoy of Hope is such a great nonprofit organization. Anytime there is a crisis they are always so quick to send out supplies and teams of people to help.  Plus whatever monetary donation you make they can  make it stretch so much further with the supplies they buy than if you were just to go out and buy supplies and donate them. I am so thankful for Convoy of Hope. Anytime I see one of there trucks traveling on the road I know great things are being done!

Convoy of Hope	174282		/users/profile/230545	savedsinnr	Donor	5	10/05/2013	Convoy of Hope steps up as soon as there is an emergency and a need.  My first experience with them was them collecting cleaning supplies for clean-up after a local area was hit by a tornado.  From then on, from Joplin to Colorado, to Alabama, to Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, Oklahoma ... ANYWHERE there is a need!  Even around the world.  We know that the funds we donate to Convoy does not have a high overhead to cover administrative costs.  They are there for the people, not to make money for their organization.  I know the money we give goes to help those in need, and we are proud to help any time we are able !

Had Hal Donaldson speak at our missions banquet and the best speaker ever!!  Been a consistent giver and volunteer!  Drove 100 plus miles to do an outreach at Cheyenne where I directed traffic for over 9 hours straight and would do it again in a heartbeat!!  Then drove over 470 miles one way to help at one in Omaha!!  Hope to do more and maybe even bring one to our town. Hope someday I could do even more work/volunteer for them. Best group I have ever worked with in over 35 years of service to the King!!

They are not only passionate about what they do, they are experts in their field.  There is no doubt in my mind that Convoy of Hope loves people and are excellent stewards of the resources they are given.
Convoy of Hope	173219		/users/profile/229358	nashn	General Member of the Public	4	10/04/2013	When something terrible is happening, I have had nothing hopeful to tweet.  Then I see a message calling out for prayer by Convoy of Hope and I have retweeted that.  It may seem trivial, but giving someone hope in what seems like an impossible situation is anything but trivial.
Convoy of Hope	173145		/users/profile/229280	TheLindaLe	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I went to Convoy of Hope to organize and package Toms Shoes to be shipped around the nation. It was the most valuable volunteering experience I've ever had, and it was so great getting to know their staff. They were welcoming, helpful, courteous, and everything in-between! Convoy of Hope is passionate about what they do and stand for, and I'm so glad I was able to be apart of this great movement and plan to volunteer many, many more times in the future!
Convoy of Hope	107939	3	/users/profile/146616	mmurry	Volunteer	5	03/16/2012	Had not heard of Convoy of Hope until I went to help with disaster relief after the tornado outbreak in southern Indiana on March 2, 2012.  I have worked disaster relief after floods in Missouri and Indiana, after tornadoes  in Wisconsin and Indiana, and the Haiti earthquake.  I was impressed with their organization of volunteers, their compassion for those affected by the tornadoes, and their down-to-earth interaction with all those they came into contact with.  They took "work orders" from those who needed help, matched them with teams to accomplish the task, sent out meals to both workers and residents, and helped maintain a free "store" to get needed items directly into the hands of those in need. I will definitely be volunteering with this organization again.
Convoy of Hope	107743	2	/users/profile/146292	Big Jon	Donor	5	03/09/2012	I have seen & heard of Convoy of Hope over the past decade, but as a Joplin resident, seeing their response to our disaster was eye opening. I've helped with Convoy of Hope distribute food to the needy in Fontana, CA. But seeing their disaster response, was truly moving. They were one of the first charities on the scene within hours of the devastation. They were well organized & were able to mobilize quickly & efficiently to help not only feed people, but clothe people, help in the recovery process & stayed on with the rebuilding process. Its been 10 months since the tornado & I still see Convoy of Hope big rigs rolling through town as well as Convoy of Hope affiliated personnel still helping to pick up debris. As a donor, I'm happy that they give timely communication with updates on projects & events. Thought Convoy of Hope was a good organization prior to the tornado & seeing their operation up close & personal gave me an even greater appreciation for all they do. Excellent organization. 
Convoy of Hope	91300		/users/profile/104391	NJPT	Donor	5	06/18/2011	Convoy of Hope is a fantastic charitable organization meeting the needs to those that needs life essentials.

We are full time disaster relief missionaries who focus on homeowners who need funding and materials and volunteers to rebuild their homes.  Convoy is priceless in what they do and are experts in the field.  Lives are changed daily, by the thousands, due to their generosity and hearts of service.We are honored to count the folks at Convoy of Hope among our friends!
Convoy of Hope	85624		/users/profile/95587	Rick S.	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	I had the opportunity to serve on a mission trip to Albania coordinated by Convoy of hope Europe,  We participated in their "adopt a community program".  Their team worked closely with our church to plan and setup multiple events and activities so that we can have a lasting effect on people from a very poor community.  COH's dedicated staff did the advance work needed to maximize our efforts when our team hit the ground.  They helped us to develop close relationships with Missionaries in the area, local Albanian pastors and most importantly with the people in the community.  The  logistical support they gave us help us to accomplish a tremendous amount of work which we did side by side with the community that we were serving. This developed lifelong bonds with our Albanian friends.  Our church is looking forward to returning in Sept. of this year to take on a new project and see our friends again

You are so courageous to get 'right in there', anywhere in the world where people are starting to lose 'hope', the only thing that might sustain them 'till the calvary arrives' (if it ever does!)  Bless you for your powerful faith.  Your every action speaks of the love of a very powerful Lord.  Thank you!
Convoy of Hope	85567		/users/profile/95519	chuckw62	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	I'm a youth pastor in Bonner Springs Ks. and my wife and I took our kids to youth convention in Wichita. We were in charge of the "prayer tent" and food distribution areas. We got to pray with many people in need and see souls saved. We were so blessed to be apart of this ministry. God really moved in the people that came trough. At the end of the day and we still had lots of food left over so we went tto the parking lot to some people that were getting ready to leave and had them pull their car over by the truck. This lady pulled up and we started litterally filling her car with bags of groceries. She got out bawling and hugging the necks of the youth loading her car. She told us that some of her family had moved in with her and she didn't know how she was going to feed them. She prayed that morning "God help me feed my family" She was driving by and decided to see what was going on at the church we were at. GOD ANSWERED HER PRAYER!!! 
Convoy of Hope	85543		/users/profile/95490	Sherry W.	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	I had the opporunity to serve in a community outreach event in rural Missouri and what an awesome experience!  Convoy of Hope organized hundreds of workers, supplies, resources, and logistics to efficiently and effectively minister to thousands of families.  The range of services included personal care, health screening, social services, nutrition/food, spiritual, and family entertainment.  It was a blessing for both the workers and the recipients!  
Convoy of Hope	85527		/users/profile/95464	charblev	Donor	5	04/13/2011	I've seen Convoy of Hope grow from a samll start up to the organizaiton that exists today.  They provide disaster relief both domestically and internationally, as well as outreaches to often poverty-stricken areas.      
Convoy of Hope	85516		/users/profile/95450	bassmanjhegyi	General Member of the Public	3	04/13/2011	Convoy of Hope is truly a blessing from a living God. They are all about meeting the needs of the less fortunet people of our world. May God continue to use and bless the folks that make C of Hope a great service company!!!! I know that my contributions will be used in my name for the greatest good of the people who are helped. They go in my place.

Convoy of Hope	33061	1	/users/profile/33886	kayla4	Volunteer	5	03/12/2010	I served as an intern with Convoy of Hope in 2009 from June-July and still continue to serve with them when I can. Convoy of Hope is truly blessed by the hand of the Lord. Learning about their organization and those who began it was truly a life changing experience. I know first hand that they are financially responsible non-profit organization, and they are very trustworthy. Each dollar donated is stretched to around seven dollars of product. They reach out to their community in the Ozarks, as well as around the entire United States. Though they are not limited to the USA. They have served through outreaches and distributions across the earth, and their disaster relief team is top notch! I could go on and on...
Convoy of Hope	32119	4	/users/profile/32922	brentw	Volunteer	5	03/01/2010	It was a great time. I was out of my comfrot zone most of the day, but put the day in God's hands. Praying for the people who came through was fulfilling and to see how gracious they were even in this time of need was amazing. It makes my problems seem like nothing.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	286570	1	/users/profile/376640	Sydney_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Giving isn't a single solitary act. Giving is a conversation.Over the last few year's I have donated my birthday to charities. I started a five year long commitment to donate each birthday, from 26 to 30 to the most effective charities I could find. I did this in hopes of opening a dialog with those around me about charity work and where we choose to donate. Often we think of our philanthropic work as secret or something we shouldn't or can't talk about because it would be seen as boastful.Sadly this means that many of us don't get to celebrate each other and ourselves for the fantastic work we do in the world. It also means that we don't always talk about how we choose the charities and causes we donate to. Because we regard our philanthropy as so private we loose out on the opportunity to share notes and compare stories around giving. We loose out on the opportunity to learn about new programs, and think critically about our giving decisions.This year I am donating to the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is a preventable disease that still kills thousands around the world, most of whom are children under the age of five. AMF has continuously been shown to be one of the most transparent, through and life saving nonprofits around, which is why I choose to support them.As a way to encourage people to donate, and a way to be able to talk about these causes year round, I agreed to get a tattoo to commemorate each charity I raise money for if we reach our goal. Each tattoo in the series is an element and the complete set covers a wide spectrum of giving opportunities. The main symptom of malaria is a high fever so this year's elemental tattoo is fire. http://www.sydsbirthdaychallenge.com/We have already raised nearly $2000, all of it from friends and family who likely would not have donated this money otherwise. Another friend has even decided to match every $27 donation in our fundraising efforts, as a way to encourage everyone to donate more. I have spent a lot of time talking with friends, family, acquaintances, and even people I barely know about how and why I choose the charities I do and why I spend my birthday asking other people to give. My interactions are almost universally positive, and people usually as insightful honest questions. Opening the dialog about our giving has inspired many to give, or give more, and has inspired them to talk about their choices with others.Giving isn't a single solitary act. It isn't something we do just for ourselves in the dark. It is something we do to make the world a little brighter and the more we shine a light on it and celebrate great philanthropy the better and stronger we will be.

Against Malaria Foundation (US)	235498	1	/users/profile/319087	ludwig.van.drewsberry	Donor	5	12/15/2014	Great clarity; they tell you exactly where your money has gone and what it's been used for. Great for making sure your donated money is being maximally used for the greatest good possible.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	233869	1	/users/profile/297862	Chris175	Donor	5	11/18/2014	For me there's two big reasons I support Against Malaria Foundation. The most important is that the work they do  distributinginsecticide-treated nets to prevent kids dying of malaria  is incredibly effective at saving lives for a very small cost. The second is that the organisation is very transparent, and great at communicating with donors as well as auditing its own activities. So you can be sure your donation is actually helping.Chris
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	233158		/users/profile/296844	M.A.S.	Donor	5	11/07/2014	The Against Malaria Foundation delivers help most effectively in a most transparent way. I know that the money I give makes a difference.Markus
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	232920	1	/users/profile/296558	sallyr	Donor	5	11/05/2014	A small amount of money goes a long way with the Against Malaria Foundation... kept up to date with details of the charity's spending and how the nets are making a difference.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	232479		/users/profile/296019	ts.mccrone	Donor	4	11/01/2014	Proud to be associated with the  Against Malaria foundation. Regular detailed insight into the how and where of net distribution helps the feeling that your donation is well spent and makes a difference. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	232413	1	/users/profile/295948	pauldavidb	Donor	5	11/01/2014	AMF are highly rated by Give Well, Giving What We Can, etc., so you know that your donation is making a real difference. AMF are also very transparent about what they spend money on, sending regular updates about where they have provided mosquito nets. Highly recommended.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	232410	2	/users/profile/295943	veraschoelmerich	Donor	5	11/01/2014	Against Malaria Foundation is one of the best charities to give to if you want to create maximum impact with the money you give. And with impact I mean real impact - not just based on lofty evaluations, but based on sound research. Being a professor and working in this field and I can really appreciate that. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	231808	1	/users/profile/295372	cramer.tracy	Donor	5	10/31/2014	I have often been reluctant to donate to organizations doing good work because I did not want what very little money I have to donate to go to that organizations overhead, (even as I understand that overhead is a necessary expense as well.) However, knowing that 100% of my meager annual donation of $25 to AgainstMalaria.com goes to the purchase of mosquito nets, makes all the difference for me. And receiving periodic updates on how donations have a direct and immediate effect on the lives of the recipients, also makes a big difference for me. All I can say is keep up the good work AgainstMalaria.com! 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	231592	1	/users/profile/295167	LeilaGamaz	Donor	5	10/31/2014	I spent a while doing some research online, hoping to donate to a legit, cost effective charity, and AMF is the one I chose. They are very transparent about where the money goes, and inform you via email about the nets which your money has purchased. I'm delighted to have found them. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	231236	1	/users/profile/294839	Lloydo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2014	I found out about Against Malaria Foundation through an organisation called Giving What We Can, which assesses the cost effectiveness of charities working in the developing world and rates AMF as the most effective. Rob Mather, AMF's founder, later came to speak at a Giving What We Can event and I was extremely impressed by his dedication, knowledge and honesty about fighting malaria through distributing bed nets. I got further insight into AMF when I did an internship for Giving What We Can and continued to be impressed by the very high standards that it operates by. I think the model that AMF operates by - of ensuring that 100% of public donations go directly to buying bed nets and all administrative costs are covered through private donations - is a great one and means you know exactly where your money is going. If all charities were as efficient and effective and devoted to as worthy a cause as AMF, the world would be so much better off!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230927		/users/profile/294539	ChrisRendell	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I started giving to Against Malaria Foundation because I wanted to make sure that my money went towards saving, or improving lives in the developing world, and that it was used efficiently. I carried out some careful research through Giving What We Can, GiveWell and The Life You Can Save, and it appeared to me to most efficient in terms of saving lives by providing mosquito nets to people in areas prone to the disease. Your money is spent directly on nets and they send you regular emails telling you where nets you have purchased are going. If you want the feeling that you are saving lives through your donation, then this is a great charity to give to! A nice personal touch in that the director took the time to email me when I made a significant donation. This also suggested to me that they are not wasting money on employees they don't need, I understand they have very few paid employees.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230765		/users/profile/294387	somers10	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Your money goes direct to the cause. The research from experts says so, and over 2 years I have no reason to doubt that fact. Simple charity, does exactly what it says it will do, and a superb project.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230752		/users/profile/294376	dnkc24	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2014	I know the leaders of Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), Rob Mather and Andrew Garner, professionally through my role as Executive Director of The Life You Can Save.  I feel that AMF uses proven techniques in the most cost effective way possible to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets.  These strategies have been demonstrated by the most rigorous scientific standard (randomized controlled trials) to save lives.  AMF follows-up to insure the nets are used and distributed properly (not all organizations do).  The organization is exceptionally efficient and stands out even when measured against other highly effective charities.  My wife and I feel that our personal donations to AMF, as well as those that come through The Life You Can save, is the best use of our money we could possibly think of.  We are personally grateful to both Rob and Andrew for their amazing work.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230566		/users/profile/294193	chelsea.sky.link	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I'm so proud to support the Against Malaria Foundation. They're providing a simple, affordable, and effective solution to a huge problem. I'm confident in them because of their consistently excellent reviews from organizations like GiveWell.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230491		/users/profile/294118	Iason G.	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I came to support the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) because I read strong reviews of the organisation praising its work and overall cost-effectiveness. Public health interventions to combat malaria continue to be underfunded and represent one of the best ways to help people living in the developing world. AMF is an excellent organisation, staffed by conscientious personnel, and they send me a monthly update on the project that my funds will support. For an excellent overview of giving to this organisation see the following summary prepared by independent researchers at Oxford University: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/against-malaria-foundation Contributing to AMF really is one of the best ways to do most good!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230280	1	/users/profile/293925	peterrsherratt	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	It is a privilege to be associated with AMF as a Trustee, and help set new standards of transparency, accountability and efficiency. The fight against malaria deserves nothing less.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230272		/users/profile/293919	Telofy	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Over the past several months, two fund-raising groups Im part of, Your Siblings and Bronies for Good, decided to make the Against Malaria Foundation the prime beneficiary of their campaigns. Naturally we want to squander none of the donations we solicit but rather use every dollar to do the greatest good we can. Hence we knew we would choose one of the highly effective charities that GiveWell has found. After a longer debate we agreed that it should be the Against Malaria Foundation. When I started to research their program in depth in order to summarize it for our donors and had a few questions that my own searches had left unanswered, I contacted the founder and CEO, Rob Mather. His answers could not have been more comprehensive, knowledgeable, and prompt. But AMFs responsiveness is just one facet of their transparency. The amounts of data they publish on their website for everyone to peruse are enormous as well. The Against Malaria Foundation is surely one of the most effective charities in existence, and thus one of the best ways to put money to use.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230242		/users/profile/293893	Alex36	Donor	5	10/30/2014	A wonderful charity - it's good to know that your donations are being used effectively towards a worthy cause. Thank you to the team for all their hard work. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230211		/users/profile/293860	Markelmer	Donor	5	10/30/2014	As someone who suffered with Malaria twice in my life, I feel more keen to help to prevent others (especially children) from becoming infected. What I enjoy about donating to Against Malaria is being informed about how my donations are being spent and particularly seeing pictures of where the nets are being delivered to.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230136		/users/profile/293793	elenaandreeva	Donor	5	10/30/2014	"The ultimate goal of any charity should be to shut down - the sooner the better." Wait, what? I was speaking with Rob Mather, the founder of AMF, over Skype, and that was not what I expected to hear.  "Of course," he confirmed. "That would mean that they problem they were addressing has been solved." I was amazed to have found a charity that did not have the mindset of a sprawling big business. Rob approaches charity operation with such a critical eye, it is no wonder that AMF has become known for its cost-efficiency, transparency, and rigorous self-assessment. And in fact, the accomplishments of AMF speak for themselves: after distributing a quarter of a million nets in Malawi to protect over half a million people, the malaria rates in the region decreased by 40-50%. As a co-founder of the Swiss chapter of Giving What We Can, I am very happy to have a charity to regularly donate to that I can be certain is making a real impact in the developing world. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230109		/users/profile/293766	moiracreak	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I read about this charity from the Giving What We Can website.  It is very cost effective, its work is high impact and donors are kept regularly informed as to where and what their money is doing.  Furthermore, one can alter  your monthly donation online, if necessary, without any hiccups or involvement of your bank.  I rate is so highly that it is one of the charities which will receive a legacy under my will.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230079		/users/profile/293739	markroulston	Donor	5	10/30/2014	When deciding which charity to donate to I realised that the worthiness of the cause is only one factor to consider. The other factor is the effectiveness with which the charity pursues the cause. As mentioned by many other commenters the Against Malaria Foundation is rated as one of, if not the most effective charity by organisations like Givewell. I regularly donate to AMF knowing that there are very few, if any, ways that my donations could be used more effectively to reduce suffering and save lives. Hopefully within my life time this will cease to be the case because malaria will have been eradicated but until then I will keep donating.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	230060		/users/profile/293718	myffical	Donor	5	10/30/2014	AMF does very effective, high impact work. It has top notch financial transparency and accountability. The team is great at communicating with donors.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229804		/users/profile/293450	grace.alice.potter	Donor	5	10/29/2014	 I decided to donate to Against Malaria after reading their profile on Giving What We Can, a site that rates charities by cost-effectiveness and transparency (https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/against-malaria-foundation).  Unlike many other charities, for instance, Against Malaria is committed to monitoring its own work with surveys carried out before and after nets are distributed, and posts the results of these online. It's a good choice for someone who can only afford a small recurring donation, as you know that the money is making an effective difference. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229602		/users/profile/293251	James151	Donor	4	10/29/2014	Against Malaria was flagged in Peter Singer's Practical Ethics MOOC as being one of the most cost effective charities it is possible to support. If my meagre donation buys 5 or 6 insecticide loaded nets a month I have a genuine chance that lives will be improved or saved; hard to know how many opportunities there are for that. I like the monthly emails telling me where donations are headed, although the lag-time can be disconcerting (my April 14 donations are still TBA in November 14), but that is doubtless  often the case in a large organisation.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229497		/users/profile/293148	Martin_R	Donor	4	10/29/2014	I am very pleased with the transparency and great detail on what happens to my donations.Martin RUnited Kingdom 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229392		/users/profile/293043	jonathan.courtney	Donor	5	10/29/2014	Simply one of the best charities that exists today.  Transparent, efficient and effective.  Most importantly, they are providing an intervention which research (Giving What We Can, GiveWell, ect.) shows to be one of the very best in the world.  If you want your money to go the furthest in helping people in the developing world, this is the charity for you.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229302		/users/profile/292953	edney80	Donor	4	10/29/2014	The AMF are a charity that do exactly what they aim to achieve- the provision of mosquito nets for the prevention of malaria.  When you know that 5 million children die yearly from this terrible disease you tend to appreciate the work of AMF.I am grateful to be able to contribute in a small way to help their cause.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229279		/users/profile/292929	derek.ball.0	Donor	5	10/29/2014	Two points: first, Against Malaria Foundation does more than any other charity I have seen to give details about how your money is being used.  I donate monthly, and receive regular emails explaining exactly where and how each donation was used (including photos and videos of the net distribution, maps of where it took place, etc.)  This is really amazing feedback -- you can really see the good that your money is doing. Second, and more importantly, AMF is rated as one of the most efficient charities by the experts (see e.g. here: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities).  All the evidence suggests that a dollar donated here saves more lives than a dollar to almost any other cause.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229271		/users/profile/292918	Scott99	Donor	5	10/29/2014	When looking for a charity to support, efficiency and transparency were my two main criteria and Against Malaraia have matched these requirements perfectly. They do exactly as stated - provide mosquito nets to areas which desperately need them. This is a simple but incredibly effective charity which I recommend to all!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229079		/users/profile/292746	Per M.	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I learned about Against Malaria Foundation because it was among the charities recommended by Giving What We Can and I have been giving to AMF ever since (about 3 years).  AMF is an great organization.  They are among the most cost-effective charities working to improve public health in the developing world.  And they are a well-run, transparent organization.  I receive regular updates about where nets are being distributed, as well as progress reports on the measured impact of past distributions.  The fight against malaria is doing well--malaria deaths are down 40% since 2006--but there is still much to do.  Nearly 600,000 people still die from malaria each year.  I am happy to support AMF in their fight against this preventable disease.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229051		/users/profile/292721	stevebaguley	Donor	4	10/28/2014	This is a great charity that's run on a low budget but with massive and transparent benefits. I've done a couple of charity events to support fundraising and I'm a regular donor.Donating to the AMF is one of the best things you can do if you want to maximise the benefit that will come from your /$They've had some criticism for not distributing the nets as quickly as funds would allow but this is in order to maximise accountability - to make sure they're going where they need to go. The backlog is now being relieved I understand.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229015		/users/profile/292685	sam.senior1	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Against Malaria has to be one of the most focussed and transparent charities I have been involved with.I know clearly what Against Malaria goals are and where my money is going. I can even see what country my nets are sent to and how my donations are spent. This charity makes you feel involved in their work, their communications with you are personal, and their work on the ground is clearly effective. Of all charities, Against Malaria is the one I recommend to others time and time again. Transparent, efficient, effective.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	229011		/users/profile/292681	brenlowe	Donor	5	10/28/2014	They're a well-run organization with low costs that keeps in touch with donors and works to fight a very worthwhile fight. WHo could ask for anything more?
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228982		/users/profile/292653	savlleclive	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Against Malaria is a charity with a clear and simple purpose - to save lives by defeating malaria.  Being so clearly focussed helps it to save lives in a compassionate way and also an amazingly cost-effective way.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228942		/users/profile/292617	TBoW	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	The commitment to transparency and efficiency demonstrated by Against Malaria is second to none.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228911		/users/profile/292588	Jaque P.	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Well, what can I say if not that I had heard excellent comments pertaining to Against Malaria Foundation.  So far, the usefulness of my monthly donation and the updates on how my money is spent have made this experience quiet unique and rewarding because I feel that every dollar contributed helps, I mean really helps.  Altruism starts here.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228891		/users/profile/292569	Michael296	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Efficient and effective. Transparent and I love the traceability of the donation to the nets. As an Australian resident I can't claim any tax benefits unlike most other charities but I still think it's worth it! 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228825		/users/profile/292505	JessicaAl	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I was looking for an effective way to help people, and the Against Malaria Foundation has exceeded my expectations. Not only am I confident that my donations are used effectively, but I can also "track" how they're spent, down to the location of particular nets I've funded. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228818		/users/profile/223244	Alastair Marsh	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I've been donating to Against Malaria Foundation for over 2 years now. I started donating to them on the recommendation of a charitable evaluation organisation, Giving What We Can. I am impressed by how AMF are consistently judged to be one of the most effective charities in the world. From my personal experience as a donor, I have found the donation process to be welcoming, informative and hassle-free, with personal communication from the charity when necessary. I really like that each of my donations can be traced to a net distribution in a particular location. Keep up the great work!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168354		/users/profile/223244	Alastair Marsh	Donor	5	09/08/2013	I started donating to Against Malaria Foundation after Giving What We Can recommended them as a highly effective charity. Since then, I have donated monthly. The donation process is straightforward, and even provides information on the fees taken by the companies of each payment method. I am told where the nets my donations have bought are distributed to, and the operation of the charity seems very efficient and transparent. I would definitely recommend donating to AMF.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228805		/users/profile/292488	Simon T.	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Charitable donations involve both an emotional and a practical involvement.

Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228804		/users/profile/292487	wshapcott	Donor	5	10/28/2014	AMF is a dedicated group of hardworking professionals who are changing the world, one mosquito net at a time.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228798		/users/profile/292482	kirstiemacgregor	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Fantastic levels of transparency, and very honest and well run organisation. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228711		/users/profile/292388	sambrightbart	Donor	4	10/28/2014	Leads the way with transparency and directness of intervention. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228679		/users/profile/292359	paabrown	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I like donating to this charity, because of its high ranking with givewell, and the transparency with which it communicates the impact of my donation. You can feel that you are doing a great deal of good, even with very little money!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228673	1	/users/profile/292353	michael.miener	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I was made aware of this nonprofit via the The Life You Can Save campaign & website. Given their continuous top-ranking in the GiveWell evaluation (GiveWell.org), I was convinced this is the right approach to donating: How can I maximize the impact of each dollar I am giving? AMF gives full (that is 100%) transparency on where your funds go. I am receiving regular reports about which nets I have sponsored, i.e. in which exact geography and community they have been distributed. In case of delay or local difficulties, this is also made fully transparent, and funds are re-allocated accordingly. Plus, they operate with extremely low operating costs, as they have mostly volunteers in their backoffice. I am a regular donor and want to encourage everyone to give it a try!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228659		/users/profile/292341	adamperelman	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Very transparent and very effective! I love that the communication from AMF is so open. It's easy to find out about what projects are in progress, what projects are in the pipeline, and how projects are going. And I like that each donation is matched to a specific project, so you know where your money is going.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228656		/users/profile/292338	esta.levinson	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I feel good about donating to Against Malaria Foundation on a monthly basis for several years because all my donations go directly to distributing nets to save lives.  No mother should have to choose which child can be protected against malaria. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228635		/users/profile/292320	freelance.lewars	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Superb, sector-leading transparency and accountability, coupled with life-changing impact.  Inspirational.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228618		/users/profile/292306	pfoisehla	Donor	5	10/28/2014	It is hard to think of a cause that has more direct impact.  A donation, even small amounts, saves lives.  Priceless.  In addition, Rob the Founder takes the time to communicate with donors and others - feeling a part of the charity increases my desire to help.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228585		/users/profile/292273	br1658	Donor	5	10/28/2014	They are very transparent and committed to effectiveness, which is all I can ask for. It's a nice bonus that they e-mail now and again to let you know which country your money is going to.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228583		/users/profile/292271	barbagain	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I read about this non-profit in a great book called "The Life You Save". Malaria is a deadly disease that can be prevented. For a very small amount, at least in American dollars, this non-profit literally saves thousands of lives by providing mosquito nets, a proven way to prevent malaria, to needy populations. I strongly encourage giving to this foundation.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228549		/users/profile/292236	Guybrush4444	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I found AMF via Giving What We Can, and I've been impressed by the quality and clarity of their reporting.  I like knowing exactly where the nets are going.  I also like the high standards for net distribution: if the conditions aren't right, the distribution doesn't happen.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228488		/users/profile/292179	christopher.hassall	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I give regularly to the AMF because they are a highly effective and efficient charity.  I know that their methods are well-researched, well-monitored, and documented in a fair and transparent manner. Donations to widespread but treatable health-related issues in developing countries represents one of the most effective forms of giving. This combination of factors places them well above the average charity, as recognised by a number of charity rating services including GiveWell, Giving What We Can, and The Life You Can Save.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228484		/users/profile/292172	kenbaumann	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I found the Against Malaria Foundation via Giving What We Can, an international organization that encourages people to donate a fixed portion of their income to highly-effective charities. AMF has been a mainstay of GWWC's "Recommended Charities", and so I began making monthly donations. Simply put: AMF saves lives, and does so in a way that is rigorous and selfless.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228442		/users/profile/292131	chill61	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I decided to subscribe a small amount regularly towards anti malarial nets and it can be difficult to find NFPs who are sufficiently organised to process small donations internationally.  AMF's use of technology to keep donors informed seems excellent and makes them a worthwhile charity to support.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228406		/users/profile/292096	heatherpurnell	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I chose AMF because of the valuable work they do, combined with their transparency and approachability. I've always found I can email the team if I have issues with payment or queries, and they respond quickly and accurately to me. It feels more personal than other charities I've donated to.I really appreciate how they proactively let us know where our money goes (down to pretty specific detail) as well as helpful tools on their website for tax reporting.A lovely foundation.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228405		/users/profile/292095	DAitken	Donor	5	10/28/2014	An extremely valuable and effective charity, whose personal style is both charming and informative. The transparency of the organisation is exemplary, as befits a group tackling a major global health problem. Highly recommended.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228404		/users/profile/292094	jcastelnuovo	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I've been donor at Against Malaria Foundation for several years now, and all I can tell is that I'm always surprised by their transparency and their efficiency to make each $$ count.You will not find easily many charity organisations out there, where almost 100% of what you donate goes directly to the field. Congratulation guys. Please keep up your great work !
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228402		/users/profile/292092	soletmons	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Simple, direct and effective action by a wonderfully transparent foundation
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228399		/users/profile/292090	ninerswin	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I have been donating to the Against Malaria Foundation for many years because:-Malaria nets are among the most effective donations you can make given their low cost & proven impact on health outcomes-They are the most focussed charity I have found both in their purpose, distributing malaria nets, and geographic focus of specific net distributions-They are excellent stewards of charitable funds and only allocate where they can achieve the highest levels of transparency on net distributions and follow-up on net usage.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228392		/users/profile/292084	mattws1	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Effective, personal, focused, transparent, and tackling a major global health issue. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228390		/users/profile/292082	lynsherburne	Donor	5	10/28/2014	If you want one thing to make you feel happy - do this. It costs me 8 a month - (makes 10 with gift aid) and I get to buy mosquito nets that save people and the Foundation tells me where they are going to send them & why & regularly updates me. I know I am very lucky, to live in the UK & not be very poor & definitely NOT to have mosquitoes spreading disease. The Against Malaria Foundation  succeeds because it lets you feel like you are a part of something wonderful.  Thank you :)
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228383		/users/profile/292076	JohnPage	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I have made donations to this Foundation for some 6 years.I have been fully satisfied that all my money goes to buy nets with nothing consumed in admin. It is also clear that there are rigorous processes in place to ensure that nets are deployed effectively: in terms of comprehensive regional coverage, education around deployment, assurance of deployment and rigorous follow up
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228382		/users/profile/292075	DMcH	Donor	5	10/28/2014	AMF is a highly effective, highly transparent organisation which is run by intelligent, ethical individuals and, in my view, it is the best practice example for how a charitable institution should be run. Their entire focus is on the provision to, and installation of, anti-malarial bednets for the most at-risk populations in Africa and, in terms of real human benefit per each USD or GBP raised, I don't think there is any organisation to match them. I am a regular donor and also appreciate the frequent updates as to where my donations are being spent. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228380		/users/profile/292073	ChrissieB	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I have been donating to the Against Malaria Foundation for a number of years and I do so very happily. This was triggered by a work colleague nearly dying when she contracted two different types of malaria at the same time. I don't think before then I had fully appreciated the magnitude of this problem, and what a killer malaria is. The Foundation is brilliant. I am especially impressed by their transparency, and I know exactly where the nets I buy have gone. It is such a simple idea but it is so unbelievably important. I am very happy to continue supporting this fabulous charity, and I hope that their work continues - with success - for many years. i have no doubt that they have saved hundreds, probably thousands of lives. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228377		/users/profile/292070	Carl Huseby Fosli	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I like that I can keep track of where the money is used and how it is used. It is very transparent.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228373		/users/profile/292067	NicolasD	Donor	4	10/28/2014	I decided to give to AMF based on recommendations from Giving What We Can and GiveWell and have continued my support for nearly two years now. Their proven cost-efficiency and transparency appealed to me, as well as the friendly feedback you get from them when you donate or when your nets are distributed. The cause is obviously a major one and the means to fight for it so simple that we tend to overlook how easy it is to help.  My only reservation is the user-friendliness of working between the AMF website and the WorldPay platform to review or edit your donations. You have to cancel your payment and create a new one each time you want to suspend or increase your monthly donation, which creates a whole lot of user ids and passwords hard to keep track of. On the other hand it's safe and reliable, and you can quite easily trace back your past donations and get your tax receipts. I strongly encourage people to donate to AMF and thank them for their amazing work.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228370		/users/profile/292064	naomioleary	Donor	5	10/28/2014	This is one of the most effective charities in the world, ranked as outstanding for their use of money by Give Well and Giving What We Can. That means you should give to Against Malaria Foundation if you want to dothe most good per dollar of donation. As well as this, they are excellent at giving feedback to donors on where their gifts have ended up, their website is easy to use and efficient, and it is extremely simple to get a statement on your yearly donations for your tax return. All round, a fantastic organisation.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228363		/users/profile/292056		Donor	4	10/28/2014	I am donating some dallers per month. I just wish my tiny donation could help them even better than before.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228361		/users/profile/292055	Philip12	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Arguably the best charity in the world; see where your money is going and get ready to spread the word to family and friends: you too can save a life!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228359		/users/profile/292053	David266	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I first heard of AMF thru GiveWell and it has been the lead recipient of my charitable donations since. The organization is transparent, accountable, ever courteous in my dealings with them, and - most importantly - effective in saving lives. I highly recommend AMF to friends and family considering donations, and am happy to do so here. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228358		/users/profile/292052	danicquinn	Donor	5	10/28/2014	AMF has a very focused mission that is focused on saving and improving the greatest number of lives. They provide clear information about what they do and how it has impact, but otherwise their work (and donors' money) is focused on reducing and preventing the spread of malaria. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	228356		/users/profile/292050	jamestravis007	Donor	4	10/28/2014	Pretty good overall. Sometimes the owner, Rob, emails me unprompted to ask me to review his charity for some website. That's kind of annoying. Also, it's not tax deductible in Australia! What's that all about? Someone should fix that. Anyway, it's a good charity, and you should consider donating to it if you enjoy writing reviews and not getting any money back from the federal government. Love, James
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	224998		/users/profile/288771	markusanderljung	Donor	5	10/22/2014	I give to AMF regularly after the recommendation of Giving What We Can. I donate to them because they take cost-effectiveness very seriously, meaning that my dollar will go as far as possible, given to them. Their model is something other charities ought to adopt.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	169801		/users/profile/225043	Nick251	Donor	5	09/15/2013	Donate regularly, thanks to their recommendation by Giving What We Can and Givewell,  as a result of their proven effectiveness. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168390		/users/profile/223277	TomD2	Donor	5	09/08/2013	I first read about the Against Malaria Foundation at the website givewell.org. Their analysis convinced me that this charity is one of the most effective around.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168362	1	/users/profile/223249	Scott65	General Member of the Public	5	09/08/2013	I have emailed back and forth a few times with the people at AMF. In addition to running one of the best nonprofits around, the guys at AMF are quick to respond and thorough in their messages. I was genuinely surprised to find everyone at AMF so open and responsive. Highly recommended.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168341		/users/profile/223229	Michelle Hutchinson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/08/2013	The Against Malaria Foundation works in an area in which you can help people a great deal for a small amount of money. For just $3, it supplies a malaria net which prevents children from getting this deadly disease. AMF is extremely efficiently run. It also tells donors precisely where the nets their donations by go, allowing people to feel connected to the recipients.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168325		/users/profile/223210	Alex21	Donor	5	09/08/2013	AMF show you exactly where your money goes and deliver incredible results with your donations. I love being able to see exactly where I am helping and the fact that 100 percent of your donation goes on nets is amazing.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168318		/users/profile/223201	Jacob_H	Donor	5	09/08/2013	The Against Malaria Foundation is an outstanding charity in many ways. Most impressive of all is the sheer number of lives they can change with your donation. It's also quick and easy to donate via their website (http://www.againstmalaria.com), and if you choose, they will email you back when they have spent your money to tell you exactly what they did with it, which feels great.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168223		/users/profile/223110	Xio K.	Donor	5	09/07/2013	The Against Malaria Foundation is #1 recommended by GiveWell, which only recommends charities that are stellar at: 1. Transparency2. Being scientifically proven to be impactul3. Having room for more funding.4. Being the best change for your buck. That is to say, they do the most good for your dollar.  If you donate your money to the Against Malaria Foundation, you are guaranteed to make a difference. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168209		/users/profile/223097	Claire Knowlton	Donor	5	09/07/2013	I've donated to AMF multiple times. A few months after your donation is received, you'll get an email with photos, a map, and sometimes video showing the exact location where your bed nets were distributed. They also provide tips and demonstrations for the bed net recipients on how to use the bed nets. I think that's such an essential part of their work - the bed nets do nothing if they are not used properly.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168190		/users/profile/223083	Soeren	Donor	5	09/07/2013	I think if you want to help humans anywhere in the world as much as possible, AMF is the way to go. More charities should take this approach of self-evaluation, transparency and focus on impact instead of just doing something that makes them feel good. As others have mentioned, this approach has made AMF the most cost-effective charity in the world according to GiveWell and a great example to learn from!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168150		/users/profile/223049	imbenclifford	Donor	5	09/07/2013	This charity makes the more impact on people's lives per pound spent than any other charity. For more see http://www.givewell.org/ or http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168139	1	/users/profile/223041	Joey6	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	AMF has been a consistently strong charity in everything from transparency to cost effectiveness.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168136		/users/profile/223038	alex.foster	Donor	5	09/07/2013	World's most cost effective charity (or at least most likely to be) Nice one! Low Hanging Fruit FTW
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168133		/users/profile/223035	caniseethemenu	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/07/2013	AMF provides bednets for two children for $5, which is an amazing deal- in fact, the cheapest way to get proper insecticide-treated nets to people, and because distributing nets is one of the most important and cheap health interventions in the world, it's near impossible to find a charity that you can trust to do something more wonderful with your money. Donate donate donate!
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	168119		/users/profile/223024	Sam Hilton	Donor	5	09/07/2013	I wanted to give to the best charity in the world at reducing suffering and fighting poverty. I did some research and looked at what experts were saying, and it turns out this is it. Expertly run and focused on the most effective cause I cannot think of anywhere better to put my money
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167994		/users/profile/222883	travisfarr	Donor	5	09/06/2013	Demonstrated, lifesaving results: that's why I support the Against Malaria Foundation.  Rigorous and reliable statistical analysis proves that insecticide-treated mosquito nets save lives in malaria-prone areas, and AMF has a proven record of distributing these nets where they are needed most. Their transparent approach to sharing information means that a donor never has to wonder what the return on his or her investment will be: a donation to the Against Malaria Foundation *will* save lives.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167992	3	/users/profile/222881	Peter32	Donor	5	09/06/2013	If you want a high degree of confidence that your donation will be effectively used to save lives, then AMF is for you.   Everything I have learned about AMF is Five Star.   That is shown, above all, by its top ranking with GiveWell, by far the most rigorous charity evaluator.  GiveWell requires transparency, very strong evidence of impact, and great value - in this case, lives saved per dollar spent.  AMF has come through this screening above the hundreds of other nonprofits GiveWell have looked at.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167826		/users/profile/222714	brendanrlowe	Donor	5	09/06/2013	Against Malaria is an impressively personal, large organization that seems to genuinely appreciate its support and use donated dollars extraordinarily efficiently, which is what I want as a donor. I recommend them highly.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167764		/users/profile/222637	arthur.kievit	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/06/2013	I'm a doctor in Holland and know how hard it can be at distributing donations in a vost effective way. Tha against malaria foundation does a great job at this and is therefore an influencial partner to donate to. Beside that, the contact is very personal and you get very detailed information on what is done with your money to the exact region. Very highly recommended! We give monthly.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167266	1	/users/profile/222126	Charlie Bresler	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	Rob Mather, CEO of Against Malaria Foundation, is beyond comprehension in his ability, passion, and willingness to help.  As Executive Director of The Life You Can Save, I have not encountered a CEO more helpful or knowledgeable.  The CIO, Andrew Garner, has been exceptionally helpful to my organization -- I love working with them!  The Organization is transparent and fulfills their mission at an excellent level.  I am excited to contribute to this Organization and to benefit from Rob's counsel.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167203		/users/profile/222064	Alice Ravenscroft	Donor	5	09/05/2013	In giving money to charity, my objective is to do as much good as possible. Against Malaria Foundation is the top-rated charity of both GiveWell and Giving What We Can, professional charity evaluators who have done years of work evaluating thousands of charities. It ranks very highly on cost-effectiveness,  transparency, room for more funding, and has an excellent track record. The intervention is also extremely well-proven. As a donor, it feels great to know where my nets are being sent, and to see photos of them being distributed. AMF has allowed me to help protect hundreds of people from malaria- I could never have had such a great impact without them. Thanks to AMF's great work, I can have confidence that my money is being put to excellent use and confidence to make giving a more significant part of my life.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167201		/users/profile/222062	jeff.t.kaufman	Donor	5	09/05/2013	I came to the Against Malaria Foundation after reading GiveWell's recommendation.  Malaria causes huge problems in areas where it is still endemic and distributing nets is the most effective way to reduce it's effects.  In donating to the AMF I know that my money is going as far as it can.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167198		/users/profile/222059	bhurley	Donor	5	09/05/2013	The Against Malaria Foundation does everything right. They are scrupulous and transparent in terms of reporting results and monitoring their effectiveness, and this allows them to report back to individual donors on what their donation accomplished. How many charities can do that? Instead of the usual "thanks for your donation, here's a link to our annual report," donors get a link they can follow to see how many nets their donations purchased and where those nets were delivered. Furthermore, AMF has managed to find a small group of donors to fund their administrative costs, so that 100% of everyone else's donations can go directly toward purchasing and distributing nets.  
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167193	2	/users/profile/222054	Mook Bangalore	Donor	5	09/05/2013	When I donate to a charity, I want to be as sure as possible that my funds will do good. With the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), I am absolutely at ease.  AMF is a top-ranked charity by numerous evaluators, including Givewell, The Life You Can Save and Giving What We Can. AMF ranks high on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, need for additional funding and transparency.  Moreover, the AMF team is in constant contact with donors, and provides information as to where the nets funded are distributed.  I have donated 3300 to AMF over the past two years, and will continue to contribute for the foreseeable future. 
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	167192		/users/profile/222053	AMartin	Donor	5	09/05/2013	We wanted to give some money towards mosquito nets but we were really keen that all of the money went directly to this rather than on administration costs.  I found the 'Against Malaria Foundation (US)' online and was really impressed by their work.  They have done a brilliant job of keeping us up to date on where our donation was used. Its been good to feel part of the process rather than just giving money and not hearing anything else from them.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	164168	2	/users/profile/218126	Michael MF	Donor	5	08/03/2013	The four most important features of a good charitable organization are: (1) proven interventions, (2) cost-effectiveness, (3) room for more funding, and (4) transparency. AMF ranks really high in all of them: (1) the intervention they fund (distribution of long-lasting, insecticide-treated, anti-malaria bed nets) has been shown to work by scientific research, (2) they are so cheap that even a mere $3 donation is enough to fully fund the distribution of one bed net, which will help protect two children sleeping under them from getting malaria for up to 5 years, (3) malaria is a very pressing and prevalent issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, and they could really do with a lot more help than they have so far, (4) they're a model of transparency in the non-profit world, with everything clearly stated in their website and real time updates on distributions. If you'd like to learn more check the independent review of their work by GiveWell :-)
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	163956	1	/users/profile/217800	curiousepic	Donor	5	07/31/2013	While the opinions of single donors such as myself are very unlikely to be accurate in determining the effectiveness of a given charity, AMF has been the top recommended organization by Givewell for a number of years, and thus deserves very wide accolades and recommendation.
Against Malaria Foundation (US)	163952	6	/users/profile/217795	Boris Yakubchik	Donor	5	07/31/2013	I suspected that with my minuscule donations I couldn't do much good in the world, but it turned out that even with less than $5 I could protect two people from malaria for about 5 years if I gave it to AMF!  Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is the highest-rated charity according to both GiveWell and Giving What We Can. These organizations evaluate charities based on cost-effectiveness, that is their ability to help as many people as much as possible with the same amount of money.  AMF is at the top of their, and now at the top of my, charity list.
Octarium	80922		/users/profile/88357	Harv F.	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I have played with OCTARIUM at the last High Holy days and they are a wonderful Vocal group with a great conductor.
Octarium	80800		/users/profile/88196	Judith P.	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	As a trained musican and a member of B'nai Juhdah's former choir, I always enjoy, not only listtening to the Octarium choir, but also singing along with them  at our High Holiday services.   Our services are greatly enhanced by Octarium's participation during these services. 
Octarium	80796		/users/profile/88202	RLieberman	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	This cantorial group adds a sense of beauty to the dignity of the High Holiday Services and should be commended for thier efforts.
Octarium	80787		/users/profile/88188	cheryli	Client Served	5	03/01/2011	Octarium sings for us at Congregation B'nai Jehudah for our High Holiday services.  Their enhancement of the spiritual experince is ethereal, moving and brings deeper meaning to the occasions for me.  From the first time they graced our gatherings, I felt I stepped into a fresh, open, sacred  place.  I marvelled at their ability to so faithfully render Hebrew even though they had not previously studied it (I assume).  Thank you Octarium.  You make our High Holidays more wonderful and meaningful.

Theyappear as  professional musicians both in performance and demeanor. the sounds are angelic, harmonic, and appropriately match the tone of the litergy in each segment of the music.  THe music sets the tone of the prayers and they capture it all quite well.

Octarium	80758		/users/profile/88142	Sarah G	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	As a teenager who usually listens to popular music, I really enjoy listening to Octarium at our holiday services.  The two days of services are very long, but I get wrapped up in the music and time just flies.

They have helped to transport me to another plane on those very special and holy days.  They help transmit the gravity of the day.

I am amazed and transfixed by the power and beauty of their singing.  With only a few rehearsals, they perform flawlessly for the High Holy Days at my temple, Congregation B'nai Jehudah. I also had the privilege of conversing with them, and they are all kind and gracious.
Octarium	80692		/users/profile/88066	Sam G.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	It's not every day that my family and I choose to sit towards the front at services. When Octarium is there - we try to sit as close as possible. Their voices are beautiful and their showmanship connects us to both the music and the spiritual nature of why we're there.
Octarium	80554		/users/profile/87923	Mark C.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	Even with "substitute" singers Octarium is better than your average choral ensemble.  Only Krista Blackwood would think that minor misses could mar the performance of Kansas City's best eight member (or almost any number of members) a capella group.  The rest of us didn't notice - too enthralled by the music.  They sang everyone's favorites, and the crowd was duly pleased.  Actually, since everyone got to pick their favorites for the program (Listeners' Choice), this was more or less inevitable.  Nontheless, I'm sure there were many who came away with new favorites as Octarium did their usual superb job of lending intimacy, good humor and class to a wide variety of music from many genres.  The venue, St Elizabeth's in KCMO, is also one of my local favorites for vocal performances providing just the right mix of depth and resonance to everything from a three-voice chant to a triumphant chorus.You should go and listen.  
Octarium	80527		/users/profile/87897	tls1	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	Our congregation has had the great fortune to have Octarium as our holiday choir singing alongside our cantor for as many years as I can remember. Octarium's voices elevate the beauty of our holy days and help create moments of both solemness and joy. I am sure that their work in other settings is equally as beautiful as their participation in our holiday services. My hope is that they will continue to be able to share their music with our congregation, the Kansas City community and beyond for years to come.

I have had the opportunity to travel fairly extensively and to see and experience others in the role that Octarian has been filling.  I can without hesitation tell everyone that what Octarian provides is without exception an extrodinary experience.  We would be far poorer without Octarian's participation.

Our synagogue is fortunate to have this very professional group located in our city.  They create a full-bodied sound that helps set the tone for our entire service.  Additionally, they are always a pleasure to watch.  Their director exhibits true poise and grace in her leadership of this group.  This is a very unique group!
Octarium	80425		/users/profile/87791	sandra f	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	Our High Holy Days would be beautiful with only the voice of our Cantor but having Octarium provides a much more spiritual experience.  Their voices entertwined with the Cantor's gives our holiest days of awe a splendid aura not achievable without their skills.  Singing our songs demands the group learn Hebrew...a skill they did with integrity.
Octarium	80411		/users/profile/87776	kimkrutz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	This musical group has added  an extraordinary amount of beauty and soul to our High Holy Days services at The Temple, Congregation B'Nai Jehudah each year that they have provided music.  I'm a professional Bassoonist, teacher and adjudicator in the Kansas City area and I've performed with many ensembles in all the years I've been here.  None of the choral ensembles I have ever worked with or heard has the beauty and blend of this wonderful group of people.  They are so tasteful and musical, and it's also hard to believe that the Hebrew language that they sing for our Services is not native to any of them! If we could have them for all Holidays and Shabbat celebrations, it would be a dream come true!They also work hand-in-glove with our marvelous Cantor Sharon Kohn,  each party making the other's voice seem so effortless.Please consider this wonderful group for the opportunity to receive grant support, as it would truely be a shame not to support their marvelous efforts at music-making.

They have amazing blend and sound. You can tell that each musician is talented in their own right, but that together they are stronger and even more beautiful together as a group. You can also see a wide range of genre with them. When I hear choral, I think sophisticated and classical. But, they push the boundaries of that definition and have fun. One can tell that the group members are friends and have a great sense of humor. I only hope to hear much more from them in the future! They deserve great things.

The have a blend a balance of an ensemble 4 times their size, and a purity that a larger choir would be incapable of matching.  Simply put, Octarium is a musical gem; a rare and priceless one at that. Personally, my favorite performances of theirs include the Manuel ALLELUIA and Lauridsen's O MAGNUM MYSTERIUM.  Octarium brings out the beauty of these wonderful pieces in a powerful and moving way. I look forward to following Octarium through the years, and benefitting from their beautiful music.

I was fortunate to be able to travel a long distance to attend the Listener's Choice Concert.  I seem to enjoy their work more and more every time I hear them sing.  The programing for this last concert was amazing considering that the pieces were chosen by the fans.

Octarium	77230		/users/profile/84475	sackbut	Donor	5	02/26/2011	The Listener's Choice concert on February 19th was a pleasure to attend.  The program concept was nice in it's own right and (understandably) was more-or-less a compilation of "greatest hits".  I was taken by the antiphonal di Lasso work handled by two groups of four done very ably by the group.  All the pieces were enhanced by the wonderful acoustic at St. Elizabeth's where several other performances have taken place.  The singers and overall musical and artistic direction of Dr. Krista Lang-Blackwood make Octarium performances and recordings well worth attending and buying!

It's not exactly like listening to singing to me, but more like floating music.  I started listening to Octarium while expecting my first child a few years ago while looking for something relaxing, yet meaningful.  I found that with Octarium.  Time to get the fourth recording!

Octarium	73345		/users/profile/80157	Mary Lee G.	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	Octarium is a group of very talented individuals.  I personally know Brady!  I have seen him put on the spot to lead a group thru a song to finish the oncore ALL by himself without any back ground music.  My husband is a drummer for Mid Life Crisis of KC band which is my only musical background but Octarium is a completely different type of entertainment.  Style, organization, dedication and outstanding performance is what you witness when listening to Octarium.  The vocals are so projected that it gives you goose bumps just to hear this group perform!  This group has enducated me on what acapella is!

Octarium	72985		/users/profile/79782	mary	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	    My favorite Octarium concert was at Drury Stone Chapel in 2010.   The program was a selection of songs that were of a popular nature and singers voices became the instruments.  The incredible sounds, complete with textures and tones that mimicked elements of strings, woodwind and brass were such a delight.  As you looked at the crowd, they were fully engaged--smiling, tapping or singing along.  It was a magical evening and as people were leaving I heard them ask when they would be back.     The most notable thing of the group if the obvious pleasure they derive from the performance itself and the natural poise and balance they achieve with their voices.  Each voice has a strenth in itself as shown in some of the selections that had solo vocals within the text, but they seemed to blend together into a smooth and elegant sound.
Octarium	72783		/users/profile/79558	Noname	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	Within the Kansas City area are many musical organizations.  Only one, however, offers small-group acapella signing, octarium.  Anchored by the bass-baritone Brian Winters and moving through the voices to the soaring soprano of Ashley Winters, this, group consistently provides the highest quality of vocal music.  As a small group, it does not require vast financial resources; on the other hand, it shoud not be ignored merely because of its size.  Having attended many of Octarium's concerts over its eight year existence, I feel that my financial contributions help keep this wonderful music alive.  Their skill and enthusiasm brings so much to the audience that it would be a pity if they could not get the financial backing thay they need.
Octarium	72763		/users/profile/79537	scottdgiffen	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/22/2011	I had just moved to a new town, started a challenging new career of fundraising consulting for the performing arts during unhopeful economic times, and was trying to support a spouse in her first ministerial appointment. A friend gave me an Octarium CD, "Essentials" and Rachmaninov's Bogorditse literally slapped me in the face. The gentle firmness of pianissimo and both the depth and marriage of tone forced me to pull over my car because the sound was literally pulling the tearful depression from my eyes and the moaning stress from my throat. I believe art connects us to each other and to our Creator. Art as a vessel has saved me time and time again. Octarium was a vessel that day, and I'm continually impressed and blessed by their artful and innovative approach and dedication to producing one sound together.

I am pleased that a group of this caliber exist in my lifetime. I have had the pleasure to be blessed by there voices on a few occasions and that is a few occasions to few. Between singing perfectly blended arias and standards, to mixing in some popular songs from past eras, I am taken on a roller coaster ride through heaven. Christmastime is when this group shines the brightest.  They are the epitome of the lords own hand-picked singers to bring joy to all. I suggest that if you haven't seen them, then you stop what your doing and get a schedule of upcoming shows and then buy tickets for everyone you know. Maybe even people you don't, because no one should live without hearing them perform.

Every concert is wonderful, every CD is beautiful, and every singer is both individually and collectively an outstanding musician.  Their ability to connect with one another and the audience at the same time is unique and inspiring.  This is the type of music and art that individuals who enjoy hearing them sing should be inspired to support them over and beyond the price of a CD or concert ticket.  
Octarium	66317		/users/profile/72490	Kendrick	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I have been a fan of Octarium since they were first organized. They have a clean, choral sound that is very hard to find outside of a university setting, and universities get these kinds of singers together only so often. I have enjoyed each of their CDs and have heard many of their concerts. They are brave in their programing and fearless in their performances. I think that the world is better because they exist. I hope they will continue to grow and find new audiences to bring to the art of choral music.
Octarium	66293		/users/profile/72464	ReadingDoc	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2011	Octarium understands how to present acapella music that is both relevant and wonderfuly performed. While their live performances are marvelous experiences, their recordings allow the listener to be musically transported time and again. I hope that this group will continue to expand their repertoire and influence throughout the country.
Octarium	66246		/users/profile/72410	databtw	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2011	Whether recorded or live, Octarium's singing in sublime. Singing in the acapella form, they are a reminder that the voice truly is an instrument. Kansas City has the great good fortune to have them in their midst. I hope they can continue to expand their reach so that more and more children and adults can be exposed to their artistry.
Octarium	65494		/users/profile/71588	Sharon	Client Served	5	02/09/2011	Great singing combined with great programming is hard to find. Couple that with genuine people, bringing their enthusiasm deirectly to the listener and you have Octarium. This organization helps make this part of the Midwest a vibrant place to live. It deserves our support.
Octarium	64280		/users/profile/70274	cathymaxwell	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	I was spellbound by Brady Shepard's voice and range. Highly recommend for everyone...amazing is all I can say. 
Octarium	64264		/users/profile/70254	NRT1	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	I have been to two previous concets and am in awe of the voices. I espically enjoy Brady Shepherd's solo's. I am looking forward to the Feb. 19th concert.
Octarium	63395		/users/profile/69313	sharon	Client Served	5	02/04/2011	Octarium performed for the Crescendo Concert Series in St. Charles, MO in a previous season.  I had heard them twice before, once travelling to KC to attend a concert on their home ground.  They are a thoroughly professional and enjoyable ensemble with a great deal of audience appeal.  Much attention to choral detail, some excellent solo voices.  My admiration to their founder/director.  
Octarium	62532		/users/profile/68350	PattyP	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	How do you write a review on perfection.  The pure sounds of Octarium are a delight.  Dr. Blackwood evidently knows how to bring out the best in these talented performers and she shares this insight in Octarium's educational work.  The concert at the World War I Museum was outstanding and Octarium's rendition of "America the Beautiful" was most moving.   Thank you for all your hard work!
Octarium	62280		/users/profile/68076	KCmusicfan	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	I am a long time resident of Kansas City with season tickets to several musical performance series (symphony, opera, etc.).  I have heard Octarium in person and am always in awe of the sound that they create.  I consider them to be one of the musical jewels of Kansas City.  My most recent performance experience with them was their American Idyll concert in October 2010.  This was held in the Auditorium of the WWI museum.  The combination of the setting and the music really brought the meaning of the selections home to the audience.  I brought along a friend who does not get to concerts very often.  She is now a fan, too.  She immediately checked her schedule to find the next concert when she, too, could introduce someone to this special group! 
Octarium	62251		/users/profile/68044	smitty289	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/01/2011	This group gives new meaning to the much sought after "one voice" sound that many choral groups find elusive.  Congratulations to  Dr. Blackwood and her singers.   I would hope that Octarium will be able to extend their wonderful musical influence beyond the midwest and possibly to the international level.  A well deserving choral ensemble. 
Octarium	62176		/users/profile/67962	Jessie	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	Fabulous! A singular and highly erudite group of singers. Cheers to Krista Blackwood and all of her efforts. 
Octarium	62132		/users/profile/67913	shfrieswyk	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	My wife and I have attended many of Octarium's performances.  We  have done so for years.  Our age and distance from KC has not detered us.  Each performance has been a treasure.   We have both felt transformed by what we hear.  The eight singers  of Octarium blend beautifuly.  Their harmomies resonate throughout the glorious spaces of their venues that then echo in our memories. It is clear that their dirctor, Krista Blackwood, has with grace and skill helped them realize the composer's intent and has thus brought to life a vision of the eternal.
Octarium	62106		/users/profile/67889	ginny	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	Octarium consistently brings me joy, whether it is listening in person at a concert or listening at home to a CD.  Going to an Octarium Christmas concert is one of my rituals, a centering, peaceful and inspiring occasion. They did one of this year's concerts in a beautiful old church in the urban core that could not afford to keep the heat on.  We wore our coats and listened to these angels sing, then took up a donation for the church....all generated by Octarium.  I am a career non-profit volunteer and I consider Octarium to be the perfect combination of performing  a service beneficial to its clients and helping the community at the same time.
Octarium	62102		/users/profile/67885	jess g.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/01/2011	As a professional accompanist who has worked with nationally known directors, I consider Octarium to be a choral ensemble that is not only inspiring in their performances but top quality in precision, intonation, repertoire selection, and communication with the audience. It is always a joy to attend their concerts. They are my preferred choral group in Kansas City.
Octarium	62096		/users/profile/67879	Lanna Shepherd	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	I've never missed an Octarium Concert in the KC area, and I never go to a performance alone.  I have invited numerous friends and relatives to join me who never fail to become fans!  I keep a link to the Octarium website on my Facebook page to share with more friends and family across the country, and as far away as Sweden!They have been delighted with the cd's , and I am thrilled to be a supporter of Octarium and their fine tuned vocal instruments!!  When the radio is blaring away with odds and ends, and I'm searching for something to soothe my soul, I just pop in an Octarium CD and enjoy!
Octarium	62094		/users/profile/67877	rcrotty	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	What a treasure Octarium is.  A group of professionals who take time to share their rare talents with an adoring public.  Each performance is awaited eagerly by us and I hope they will be able to perform more often.
Octarium	62082		/users/profile/67865	MShay	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	Listening to Octarium is like a bit of heaven.  I enjoy listening to their CDs as well as attending their live concerts.  Thank you Dr. Krista Lang Blackwood, Artistic Director, Ashley Winters, Amy Waldron, Renee Stanley, Leah Jenkins, Jaime Scherrer, Andrea Coleman, Jason Parr, Jay Van Blaricum, Brady Shepherd, Benjamin Winters for sharing your talents.  Thank you to everyone involved for the work you do to bring us this gift.
Octarium	61853		/users/profile/67587	Dan Musselman	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I had the privilege to work with Octarium on a short recording project.  It was a thrill to work with them from the composer's perspective and I heartily agree with Morton Lauridsen's and other composer's praise for Octarium.  They took great pains to respectfully interpret and perform my work and had a fabulous dynamic.  I am proud to have a Octarium recording of my choral music.
Octarium	61520		/users/profile/67171	Rob F.	General Member of the Public	5	01/28/2011	I first heard of Octarium through a friend.  I looked them up on YouTube and was instantly enchanted by their sound.  I then ordered the two cds they had available at the time and have listened to them frequently on my iPod ever since.  Octariums motto; goal; raison detre (if you will) of eight voices as one, as evidenced in their name and sound, is one that all vocal ensembles should strive for but few do.  When the opportunity arose for me to hear them live, I was thrilled.  They perform frequent outreach programs with college and university choral groups and end their day with a concert.  I drove three hours to hear them and was not disappointed.  As great as they are in recording, they are even better live.  It is evident to me that they are dedicated to education and are uncompromisingly strong advocates of the arts in America.  I cannot recommend a small vocal ensemble more highly than Octarium.
Octarium	61300		/users/profile/66905	Aggie	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	I currently live in Texas. Every year, on the long-awaited first cool day of fall, I giddily slip my Octarium Hodie CD into the computer, close my eyes, and apparate back to Kansas City. This group has a specifically Midwestern sound, warm and enveloping. I instantly feel like I'm by a fire with a hot cup of coffee.
Octarium	61274		/users/profile/66868	DurwinRice	Client Served	5	01/27/2011	Octarium recently performed at a community benefit/fundraising performance for us in Kansas City's urban core and they set a very high standard for the future of choral music on Troost Avenue.    Their commitment to rebuilding our neighborhoods became real at this event and we are very grateful fo Octarium's efforts to help rebuild the health of KC neighborhoods through the arts.  The Friends of St. Mark Lutheran Church are now looking forward to an annual Lessons and Carols and the continued celebration of fine music on Troost Avenue.
Octarium	61266		/users/profile/66857	Elizabeth S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	The first time I heard Octarium, I was driving down the turnpike at 70 mph and their Thompson's "Alleluia" came on the radio. I was so struck with the sound that I almost had to pull over and stop.  The melody, the dynamics, the balance, and just the sheer size and quality of the sound literally brought tears of joy to my eyes.  I could not believe I was listening to only eight voices!  Now I have all the albums and attend concerts any time they are within 100 miles of me.
Octarium	61264		/users/profile/66856	Graham M.	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	Octarium has taken their craft to a very high level. Each year this ensemble has sung together clearly shows in their performances. Their ability to anticipate each other's cues is virtually unmatched in the choral ensemble world. To perform with such precision and passion without a conductor shows just how talented and dedicated each member is. The result: music that will take you far, far away from whatever room you are in when you hear it.
Octarium	61262		/users/profile/66854	Roxana S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	I had the incredible good fortune to be part of a fundraiser at which Octarium performed.  Not only was their performance perfectly suited for the venue, and the charity, in was positively divine.  Octarium should be counted as a local, national and global musical gem and I consider it a great privilege to walk among their fans.  
Octarium	60886		/users/profile/66376	Sharon S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2011	To hear Octarium sing is like being in heaven. I have been lucky enough to hear them sing several times now, and I usually have to drive several hours to do it. It is worth it every time. From sacred choral music to traditional choral music to experimental forms and new composers, they are up to the challenge. It is my good fortune to have them in my musical life. 
Octarium	60881		/users/profile/66359	Pat W.	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2011	This season Octarium  warmed up the sanctuary of St. Marks with lush tones and spot-on harmony. The occasion was a benefit concert to raise money for the city neighborhood church that could not pay its heating bills.  This musical organization is an absolute GEM that a friend and I had the good luck to stumble upon when looking for quality entertainment.  What good fortune to have found them! 
Octarium	60741		/users/profile/66142	kathy	General Member of the Public	5	01/22/2011	Octarium provides all residents of Kansas City and those of us who enjoy their recordings with a wonderful, imaginative and uplifting experience. Their musicality is extrarodinary and the blend of voices is ethereal. Clearly they have a commitment to the highest standards of performance.  
Octarium	60661		/users/profile/66037	John P.	General Member of the Public	5	01/21/2011	Octarium is a very focused music organization.  Its mission is to preserve the great a cappella music from the past as well as the present.  It serves the Kansas City area well in this mission, and it's starting to collaborate with other civic organizations to serve not only in the arts, but also historic preservation (among others).
Octarium	60633		/users/profile/66004	PastorDonna	General Member of the Public	5	01/21/2011	Octarium was kind enough to donate their talents to a service of Lessons and Carols at our church, St. Mark Lutheran, in December of 2010.  I was fortunate enough to have a seat in the chancel where they were singing, and I was mesmerized.  The singers were perfectly pitched and their voices blended spectacularly.
Octarium	60445		/users/profile/65725	Don Dagenais	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	As a lover of choral music I was enchanted when I first heard Octarium several years ago; the beautiful meld of voices, the balance of the singers, the ravishing harmonies.  This is a group of very talented singers, brilliantly trained to sing together as a perfect ensemble.  There is no more beatiful instrument than the human voice (when trained and used correctly), and here are eight such instruments working together with remarkable effect. I have barely missed a concert since, and just wish that more others could experience the sound of this wonderful group.
Octarium	60395		/users/profile/65658	Karin P.	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I am not a terribly verbose person and I'm a good writer, either.   I wish I could express how exquisite Octarium's music is - the beauty of the music, the phrasing, the synchronicity of the singers - 8 voices as one But these words are  like saying that the Grand Canyon is big or amazing or beautiful.  Words cannot do Octarium and their music justice.  We are incredibly lucky that they exist, that Krista Blackwood, despite all odds and absolutely no funding, is able to keep this chorale group together.  They sang for a fundraiser for a church in my neighborhood in freezing cold (the sanctuary was 42 degrees) and the music brought tears to my eyes.  Do yourself a favor:  Check out their website and buy a CD and transport yourself to heaven.
International Crisis Aid Inc	318415		/users/profile/409584	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	The first time I stepped inside the front door of Crisis Aid's office as a volunteer, I could immediately feel and see the heart and soul of this amazing organization. The pictures on the wall literally brought me to tears and tugged at my heart. Pat and Sue Bradley, along with their dedicated staff, are truly walking out the work of Our Savior Jesus Christ. There are many aspects of how Crisis Aid is "helping the helpless" in our city and around the world. They are providing love and hope to those in need of what most of us take for granted. I feel blessed to have come in contact with this organization! 
International Crisis Aid Inc	313142		/users/profile/404513	Alwayssjk1	Donor	5	10/21/2016	I first learned about sex trafficking through Crisis Aid International in 2009. They spoke to our youth group and actually built a replica of a street in Africa so we could get a real "feel" for life in the red light district. It broke my heart. Since then I have supported Crisis Aid monthly. I continue to watch God move and open doors for them to rescue and educate women who had no future before God sent them. Women who were rescued are now teaching other women about Jesus and helping them find a way to freedom! I am amazed at how much Crisis Aid does with the money they receive. They are very open about their finances and God just seems to multiply the funds like He did the loaves and fishes. People are fed and receive medical help. Girls are rescued and given a new future. I've spent time talking with Pat and Sue Bradley. They love Jesus and are giving their lives to the hurting. I am honored to be able to support them and the work they are doing both here and in Africa. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	312407	1	/users/profile/403773	Writer	Donor	5	10/20/2016	I had the incredible experience of going to Africa with International Crisis Aid...the trip has changed my life forever.  I was impressed by the extent of their work! They were helping hundreds of girls in the red light district, they operate an orphanage, they do food distributions in remote areas, they sponsor individual children, they operate medical clinics and build wells. It was apparent that this organization has had a widespread impact on the country and an intimate  impact on the lives of individuals.  There is not a day that goes by where I do not think of the the trip. Its a true example of how individuals with passion and dedication can truly make an impact on the world.

I have seen Crisis Aid in action first hand as a volunteer and continue to be impressed with the compassion and regard for the individual with which the staff operates and executes their programs.  As a donor I want my money to count towards what matters, saving and improving lives.  Having interacted with the president and the staff I have the utmost confidence that every penny donated to the organization is carefully spent.  And, more importantly, the organization expects (and can point to) specific results from their programs.  A great organization to support!!!!

I live in Australia so the impact from this organisation is truly global.  If you are looking to support an organisation with a big heart to help, the guts to do it and financial integrity this is the one.

International Crisis Aid Inc	311448	2	/users/profile/149471	Juliann T.	Donor	5	10/17/2016	I've been involved with and supporting Crisis Aid International since 2002 and in all that time Pat Bradley and the Crisis Aid staff have shown an unfailing love for the hopeless and hurting and a truly relentless desire to 'save lives, save souls and change lives', even at great risk to their own. I've seen so many lives saved and changed for the better over the years and look forward to seeing many more transformed in the years to come. Not only is Crisis Aid International faithful to the mission, they are faithful stewards of the funding they receive; consistently using funds responsibly and where it can have the greatest impact. If you're looking for an organization that truly makes a real and lasting impact, both in the U.S. and abroad, you don't need to look any further than Crisis Aid International!

I was so moved by their work there I was inspired to write a book about it (Where There Is No Comfort: Seven Days in Ethiopia).  They are making a real and lasting difference in the world by saving and transforming lives and bringing hope where there is none.

They have deep experience, compassion and knowledge. Most programs just buy a building, stick in staff and think that's all girls need and that's why they fail. Crisis aid does the job well

International Crisis Aid Inc	284619	2	/users/profile/374678	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/04/2016	ICA is a remarkable organization with a heart for one; starving babies in Angatcha, Ethiopia. Taking them to a feeding center later to stabilization center and reviving both babies and mothers back to health physically and spiritualty. Also, in Addis Ababa .. ICA has orphanage for kids who lost their parents with HIV AIDS and rescue girls from sex trafficking and train and equip them to help themselves. I witnessed Pat Bradley the founder of ICA and his team doing a wonderful and notable job in Ethiopia; in all of these places I was privileged to visit while a was a volunteer a couple of months ago.

They have the highest integrity of any organization out there. Their purpose is to help those who can't help themselves and they do this with excellence!  In my opinion this is a charity that you can contribute to knowing that the money you donated will be used with utmost care.
International Crisis Aid Inc	244961	2	/users/profile/332031	lar848	Volunteer	5	06/10/2015	Crisis Aid is headed by Pat and Sue Bradley, leaders with sincere hearts and intentions that always follow through. They don't just rescue girls from human trafficking. They provide them with all they need to begin their lives again...from the basics--like food and shelter--to medical assistance and job training. The don't just feed people. They try to help them learn how to be self-sufficient. They dig into the roots of societal issues and they attack the very core of the problems. Crisis Aid and their small staff do more in a day than many others do in a lifetime. It's with complete confidence that I support this organization and get the occasional opportunity to serve alongside them. Pat and Sue are the most humble, beautiful people I have ever met and the very essence of who they are flows consistently throughout their organization. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	244083	2	/users/profile/330959	Nolaann	Volunteer	5	06/01/2015	I have known the founder Pat Bradley for many years and am familiar with his selfless dedication. I volunteered last year to be a part of this ministry.  This is when I really saw how he and wife Sue give of themselves. I met the wonderful staff and many volunteers who make this ministry special.  It is such a blessing to be a small part in what they do.  I am confident my time and funds are given to a ministry which gives directly to those in most need.  I am proud and thankful to count this wonderful group my friends.  Nola Rigsby, St. Louis, MO
International Crisis Aid Inc	243868	3	/users/profile/330713	GabrielleWillia	Volunteer	5	05/29/2015	I started volunteering with ICA last summer. From the first time I met with Kay, responsible for donor relations, I knew I loved the organization.  In the fall of 2014 ICA began an after-school program in South St. Louis. I can honestly say volunteering at the after-school program each week was the highlight of my week! Each week, several children come to the program to read, sing, create art projects, practice roles for a drama, and share a meal together. The children are learning what it means to be a part of community and that each of them have great purpose and worth.  ICA truly has a heart for the communities they serve, whether they are in the St. Louis region or across the ocean in Ethiopia.  Not only does ICA have heart, they have integrity. The staff of ICA takes financial responsibility very seriously and their financials are always public. I can personally attest as a donor and volunteer, that your monthly donations will be used in the most responsible way possible to maximize aid for individuals in need. I have great peace coming alongside them as a volunteer and donor to be a part of the work theyre doing. I love the important work ICA is doing at home and abroad!  
International Crisis Aid Inc	243863	1	/users/profile/330708	SheilaShelley	Volunteer	5	05/29/2015	Two precious hours, with two precious sponsor girls.   We drove up and there they were.   Waiting, waiting, just for us.  Munria missed school in order to make the journey, and waited.  Hana did make it to school but was there also waiting.  I say girls, they were four years ago when my husband and I began their sponsorship.   Now they are young women.   They were so happy to see me.  Lots of hugs, kisses, smiles and tears.  They live with no electricity,  no running water, no bed to sleep on and HIV parents who are very ill.  Pretty dismal, yet they have HOPE.  ICA has given them that HOPE.   Because of the sponsorship program founded by ICA they have food, they are able to attend school with school supplies and uniforms.  Our time together went by so quickly, however, because of ICA and the vision of one man, I will see them again in November.  I can hardly wait!!!  Thank you ICA for giving my husband and me the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of two precious young ladies  in Africa.
International Crisis Aid Inc	243652	2	/users/profile/227186	Kathy Meadows	Volunteer	5	05/27/2015	In 2014, I had the privilege of going on my 3rd mission trip to East Africa with Crisis Aid.  Crisis Aid is one of the greatest non-profit organizations I have ever had the privilege of working with.  Their heart for serving and ministering to people who are in the greatest need physically as well as spiritually is amazing to see.  They go to the most remote areas imaginable and through God's hand, touch people who are at the brink of death and who have lost all hope.  They bring hope!  I have seen first hand the physical condition of many who were lifeless, be restored.to have food, water and a chance for life.  The before and after photos you see are real.  These are real people, real situations and a really great ministry, Crisis Aid, that utilizes every dime to meet the needs of people in such dire desperation.  They Biblically meet the needs of the orphan, the widow, the sick, the hungry, the hopeless.  I have seen first-hand the blessings God brings through this organization.  I will continue to support this great non-profit financially as well as physically going to serve with them every opportunity I can.  I pray others will do the same!
International Crisis Aid Inc	171580	1	/users/profile/227186	Kathy Meadows	Volunteer	5	09/24/2013	My family and I have had the blessed opportunity to sponsor two children through ICA for the past four years!  Just seeing the amazing pictures each year of their progress both physically and spiritually has been tremendous!  Last year, I had the wonderful opportunity to volunteer with ICA on a mission trip to Ethiopia.  I have had the opportunity to work with other mission based organizations, but ICA is top-notch!  From leadership all the way down to boots on the ground, their administration of funds donated to help aid people who are starving and in need of being rescued from sex trafficking is amazing!  First hand, I was able to help them in starting  three new feeding clinics in completely devastating areas in Ethiopia near Kenya.  I was overwhelmed at the need of the people, but amazed at what God did through the care of ICA and their volunteers for those people.  ICA not only meets the physical/nutritional needs of thousands, they meet health needs and most importantly the spiritual needs of those masses.  I will never forget the impact ICA had on those hundreds and ultimately thousands of people we were able to assist.  I remember Pat Bradley gathering our team before we began the ground work on a new feeding clinic and telling us that the need was much greater than we could imagine and see, it was overwhelming, but he reminded us that we serve ALMIGHTY GOD and he asked us to stop and pray and truly believe that our GOD could take what little we had to give, bless it and multiply it.  It was a true miracle that reminded me of the boy with the loaves and fishes.  After returning home and being able to see updated pictures through ICA's website and Facebook, it was totally amazing to see the physical and emotional transformation of those people.  Because of Pat Bradley and the rest of his team's total commitment to seeking GOD's guidance, wisdom and blessings first for the people they assist, GOD has blessed their ministry and has allowed them to reach and change the lives of multitudes.  I will always be an advocate for ICA and what they are doing within the United States and in many nations abroad!  I encourage anyone who is seeking to assist financially or personally through an organization that really DOES make a noticeable difference, they should choose ICA!

Active in their South St. Louis neighborhood, staff and volunteers provide homework help, food pantry, hot meals, school supplies, VBS, Easter Egg hunt, and more in a loving, welcoming and Christ-centered atmosphere.
International Crisis Aid Inc	243620	2	/users/profile/330418	Jtomato	Volunteer	5	05/26/2015	ICA has a heart for helping children locally and abroad.  We have a Safe House here in St.Louis that is not only rescuing girls off the streets but also provides counseling so that they are supported making significant changes in their lives. Africa is where their devotion to feeding starving children is focused. The Bradley's have important relationships in this country that help them with food deliveries. They truly live their lives reaching out to others -- how Blessed we are ! 
International Crisis Aid Inc	243596	2	/users/profile/330393	Saramcg	Volunteer	5	05/26/2015	Crisis Aide changes the lives of people everyday all over the world.  I feel confident that the money and time I give makes a large impact on the lives of the poor, hungry and abused.
International Crisis Aid Inc	243595	2	/users/profile/330384	Gary_G	Volunteer	5	05/26/2015	I am very impressed by the high level of service and integrity of Crisis Aid International. Whether on the African continent providing medical care, feeding the starving, building clean water wells, and rescuing young girls from the horrors of sex trafficking, or reaching out to the kids of Saint Louis City,  directors Pat & Sue Bradley have a heart of compassion to reach out to those in need.  Crisis Aid International staff & volunteers are awesome and work hard to touch lives. Volunteering with Crisis Aid International has been a blessing!
International Crisis Aid Inc	243592	1	/users/profile/330387	jewelryhelper	Volunteer	5	05/26/2015	I had never heard about Crisis Aid - Safe House for Girls prior to a friend inviting me to a Monarch jewelry show.  At this time the speaker told how thru the Crisis Aid Safe House they have been able to help girls that have become involved in sex trafficking for various reasons.  Some of these girls are as young as 13 and range up to 20+ years.  Monarch jewelry is a group of women from various churches in the St. Louis area who meet twice a week to make jewelry and the total profit from sales is given to support the Safe House.  All the women are volunteers.  In the year that I have been involved with this organization we have heard stories from several of the girls who have been helped and how this has dramatically changed their lives for the better.  They are not only given a safe place to stay but are given help with their education; given counseling; and given help moving back into the community.  This is truly a very worthwhile organization and they not only help girls from the St. Louis area but around the country if someone has heard about what they do they come here to get help.
International Crisis Aid Inc	243587	2	/users/profile/330380	dethridge	Volunteer	5	05/26/2015	IN 2014 My husband and I made our 6th trip to East Africa with International Crisis Aid.  We have been able to see the difference that their programs make.  The children we sponsor through ICA are growing physically, spiritually and are doing great in their classes in school.  The girls in the ICA sponsored Orphanage are happy, healthy and are growing up to be strong women who will serve their country well.  I can't say enough about the girls, some very young, that have been rescued out of the sex trade.  Both in other countries and in our own USA.  Because of ICA, these girls have a safe home, where they are not beaten, abused, and used for the sick purposes of others.  Without ICA, these young girls would still be out on the street, trying just to stay alive.  I appreciate that ICA puts all their information on their website.  If you want to know how much ICA spends for administration expenses, go to their website, You will be amazed that they do so much and yet the cost is so little.  You won't find million dollar salaries at this NGO!  International Crisis Aid is the real deal.  They love, they go, they give.  If you have an opportunity to help International Crisis Aid, please do so.  The dollars you donate today will make a difference in the lives of so many tomorrow.
International Crisis Aid Inc	204965	3	/users/profile/267044	N_Boliaux	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	Crisis Aid International welcomed me in as a volunteer with open arms. The staff is incredibly friendly and giving. Pat Bradley is an amazing man who is incredibly selfless and passionate about helping others. I am so thankful that there is an organization right here in St. Louis focused on helping women and children both in our own backyard and around the world. I have loved my experience volunteering with Crisis Aid International and hope to help them continue to help others far into the future.

International Crisis Aid Inc	201810	1	/users/profile/263346	TrishaKay88	General Member of the Public	5	06/03/2014	International Crisis Aid has its finger on the pulse of the many needs in the world today and is actively part of providing assistance to meet those needs.  ICA is well organized and fiscally responsible.  The organization provides assistance through volunteers and resources to meet needs in hunger relief, orphanages, medical outposts, and efforts to rescue victims of human trafficking.  My brother and sister in law have been on numerous trips to Ethiopia with ICA and have been blessed to be part of being "hands and feet" in helping others around the world.
International Crisis Aid Inc	201141	1	/users/profile/262608	magicdar	Volunteer	5	05/28/2014	 Crisis Aid International is a wonderful organization.  They do so much for so many. From helping with feeding children in other countries, that would have otherwise perished, setting up medical clinics, rescuing people from sex trafficking, to orphanages for children who have been abandoned. I have personally met the staff and the founder of the organization and they are wonderful loving people that care so much and are giving hope to those that otherwise would not have had any at all. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	201013	1	/users/profile/262452	cmccall	Volunteer	5	05/28/2014	What a great organization with a heart for people. My family and I have had numerous opportunities to connect with ICA and serve with them abroad. From what I have observed the ICA is making great impact  in a country that is poverty stricken. Whether, it is through feeding programs, an orphanage, medical clinics, or rescuing girls from sex trafficking the ICA is providing hope in a place of darkness. I would highly recommend the ICA to anyone looking to contribute to a non profit organization.
International Crisis Aid Inc	200974	1	/users/profile/262403	kKILBURN	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	I am with a group that makes jewelry to benefit Crisis Aid.  I heard Pat Bradley speak recently and I learned so more about how this wonderful organization got started.   So much good comes from the work that is done in St. Louis and in Africa to help girls who have been sex trafficked through the tireless work  of those involved with this amazing nonprofit.  I feel honored to be a small part of an organization that contributes to Crisis Aid.   Kathy Kilburn
International Crisis Aid Inc	200970	2	/users/profile/224966	CarolynMB	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	I have been making and selling jewelry through Monarch Jewelry weekly for about 4 years now to benefit Crisis Aid.  This organization is much more that a fundraising business.  Pat  and Sue and their staff are changing the lives of young women around the world.  They are like family to the countless numbers of girls rescued from sex trafficking.  I am honored to be a part of raising funds and awareness here in St. Louis and have had the opportunity to connect with rescued girls here in St. Louis through the Safe House opened here 1 1/2 yrs ago.
International Crisis Aid Inc	169743		/users/profile/224966	CarolynMB	Volunteer	5	09/14/2013	ICA and its satff are doing amazing work nationally and internationally.  Beginning in Ethiopia, they have rescued countless numbers for girls from the sex trafficing industry and have brought that same love and support to girls here in the United States. I have been honored to wittness the opening of the first rehabilitation home for girls that are trafficed here in St. Louis.  Not only do they help rescue from immediate danger, but they lovingly provide extended care both mentally, emotionally and physically in a Christ centered environment.  their leaders commit their heart and soul to this nonproffit and I am honored to know them. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	200709	1	/users/profile/149077	Diane E.	Volunteer	5	05/22/2014	My husband and myself have donated to ICA for the past 7 years.  This year we will make our 6th trip to Ethiopia with ICA.  Each year we have seen with our own eyes the difference in the people.  There is still much work to be done and we have the trust in ICA to see it does.  Each child they feed, each girl they rescue, each orphan they care for and each person who gets medical care is part of the family that ICA cares for.  " To the world I may be one person, but to one person I may be the world." Pat Bradley.
International Crisis Aid Inc	167227	1	/users/profile/149077	Diane E.	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I have had the pleasure to go on several trips with this amazing organization.  This year 2013 will be the 5th trip to Ethiopia for my husband and myself.  Each year we have seen with our own eyes the difference that ICA is making. The Health Clinic's, the Feeding Programs, the Safe Homes, and the Orphanage are all making a difference in a country where there are so little resources.  As a Christian, I believe it is a command from God to take care of those who are hurting.  ICA answers that call in action, not just with words.  I have been impressed from the beginning of supporting ICA that so little of what we give goes to administration.  When I give $1.00 at least .91 goes to the actual program I am supporting.  That is so rare in this day and time.  Pat Bradley and his team search out ways to help others AND stay accountable.  I was shocked last year when our team went into a place in Ethiopia where everyone, young and old were dying from starvation.  In 4 years, we had seen places that were really heartbreaking, but nothing compared to what we saw in 2012.  Pat assessed the situation and then gathered us,  we were told that unless a miracle happened, most of the people we could see would be dead within 2 weeks.  We prayed and then went to work.  I looked up and a father who was so thin a breeze would have knocked him over was standing in front of me.  On his back was one of his children who was so starved and swollen she couldn't walk.  We called Pat over and he immediately got the family into a place where they could receive immediate help without being overrun.  Most of us have never seen a person so swollen from starvation that their skin was splitting open.  I hate knowing that all over the world children are dying from lack of something most of us take for granted, food.  ICA is doing something about it.  If it seems impossible, if no one else will go, ICA flourishes in those places. The family, 4 weeks later after being placed into the feeding program a picture was taken.  Most people seeing her would have thought she was near death because she was still so thin.  I saw what God has given her thru the work of ICA.  LIFE!
International Crisis Aid Inc	109410	1	/users/profile/149077	Diane E.	Volunteer	5	04/10/2012	This October will be the 4th year that my husband and I have gone to Ethiopia with International Crisis Aid.  After that first trip, our church Watermark Church in Ashford, AL has put together a team to go every year. From the very 1st time we were convinced that this is the place, this is the organization where we need to send our funds and spend our time.  We had just been blessed with our 2 of our grandchildren that year and when we got off the bus in Angatcha at ICA's Medical Clinic and seeing, touching so many starving babies was shocking to say the least.  It was very humbling to know that at home our babies had plenty to eat and health care while so many died from lack of food and simple care.  ICA is making a difference.  I know because the following year and every year since we get to see the babies and children who the year before were near death and now are smiling little miracles.  One of the greatest things we get to participate in while in Ethiopia with ICA is work at their orphanage.  The 17 girls and their house mothers have become a large part of our lives. We get to work a good part of each week in Ethiopia at the orphanage.  We have played with and been loved by each girl.  It's a blessing to see each one growing up to be strong Ethiopia women.  While we are at the orphanage we have done projects like, building a fence and playground for the girls and we've painted the entire building inside. One of the best times we have is  when we get to take the girls shoe shopping.  Each year our church takes up money to buy each girl new shoes.  Loading up 17 girls, their house moms and all of the volunteers is a job in it's self.  ICA does a great job in making sure each one has a great time shopping.  Just like little girls all over the world they like to shoe shop!  By far the hardest and most rewarding time spent in Ethiopia has been working with the girls who are caught in sex trafficking.  There is no way I can begin to tell you what the "red light" district in Addis Abba looks, feels, and smells  like.  These young girls most start at the age of 11 or younger are not in this place because they want to be.  It is an evil that Pat Bradley the founder of ICA decided had to be stopped.  He and ICA are making a difference, one young life at a time.  ICA has opened Safe Homes for the girls that are being rescued.  Those young women are given, health care, what ever school they need, training in several different trades and most important love.  Meeting the young women and girls, hearing their stories and then seeing them grow over the last 4 years has been one of the biggest blessings of my life.  They know hope.  ICA has other note worthy programs that you can check out on their website.  They are an example of what a GREAT NGO should look like.  Their administrative cost are purposely kept low in order that most of their funds go to the programs.  Over 90% go to the actual programs, like feeding, health care, safe homes, orphan care and others.  I know my life and many others have been changed for good in the most positive way since I accepted the gift of Jesus.
International Crisis Aid Inc	199318	1	/users/profile/260222	Kathy157	Volunteer	5	04/30/2014	Sue & Pat Bradley are the most selfless people I have ever known. Their dedication to the community, both near and abroad continues to amaze me.  God bless both of them! 
International Crisis Aid Inc	192955	1	/users/profile/251991	terristipanovich	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/22/2014	Pat and Sue Bradley are my heroes.  I briefly worked for International Crisis Aid, traveled abroad with them, donated to their efforts and enjoy an on-going friendship with both of them.  They are careful and intentional to use every donation to it's fullest, making a positive impact on the suffering of the world, caring for people with passion, love and intentionality.  I am inspired by their work and model my own non-profit after their structure and care.  
International Crisis Aid Inc	175125		/users/profile/231440	boos	Donor	5	10/08/2013	Pat and Sue have done an amazing job of making ICS donations go a very long way.  I know this because i get regular updates from them on the progress that is being made in the lives of so many people across the World.  This non-profit is not for the faint of heart:  1) one of the first responders to the most remote regions that have fallen victim to natural disasters with the most basic needs attended to, 2) brings food and water to families in famine or drought struck regions, 3) brings medical care to untreated illness and 4) provides safe passage, builds safe houses and rehabilitation for victims of sex trafficking.  It takes great faith and a special calling to enter some of these regions and be a true force for change as well as a light of hope among such difficult circumstances.  I am proud to donate to a Christian-based mission that transparently shows the true impact of donations - and brings life and light into the lives of so many.  God bless them both and the staff that supports their efforts.
International Crisis Aid Inc	175059		/users/profile/231365	Rachel Hoover	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	I volunteered with International Crisis Aid in the Summer of 2009. I went to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to teach English. In the morning, I taught many impoverished children in their child sponsorship program. I witnessed the huge impact that the sponsorship has on each child's life, giving them shoes, clothes, nourishment, an education and so much more. These children came from the most devastating poverty I have witnessed, with most of them being AIDS orphans. Some of my students had big dreams of becoming doctors and engineers, dreams which would have no potential if it were not for ICA's investment in these kids' lives.  In the afternoons, I taught English in the rehabilitation homes for women and girls who were formerly prostitutes. The rehabilitation program was a godsend for so many of these beautiful young women. They were given food and clothing, a place to stay, counseling, vocational training, English language classes, and the true Love that was missing from their life for so long. The work of those programs was beautiful to behold, as women came in hardened and cynical and gradually opened up and flourished in the caring and nurturing environment. Many of the women and girls go on to get married or be gainfully employed. I still think of "my" beautiful girls and the opportunities that ICA has opened up to them. After having lives filled with so much pain and misery, ICA has given them hope. I had the privilege of transcribing a few of their stories. All of the girls recounted the first time they met Pat Bradley (the founder of ICA), and how he rescued them and showed them, for the first time, that men could be good.  One of the best things about ICA is their use of the native people to do most of the ground work. I did not see another American ICA worker during my entire time of volunteering over there. All of the programs were run by wonderful and qualified Ethiopians who did their jobs excellently. I  Nothing has changed my life as significantly as my trip to Addis and my front-row seat into the work of ICA. They are changing lives around the world, and it was incredible to witness. After seeing ICA up close and personal, I could not respect the organization more... The efficiency and transparency with which ICA handle their funds and resources is phenomenal.  I have also had the privilege of meeting Pat Bradley, the founder of the organization, and have nothing but the best things to say about him. His humility, generosity and love for all people could not be more evident. He and his team are giving hope thousands of people around the world. I cannot sing the praises of ICA enough! 
International Crisis Aid Inc	171543		/users/profile/227142	RodTucker	Volunteer	5	09/24/2013	Phenomenal.  Easily one of the best non-profits on the planet.  The amount of impact International Crisis Aid Inc has had on the world with their resources has not and will not be matched for many years to come.
International Crisis Aid Inc	170877		/users/profile/226330	jdouth	Donor	5	09/20/2013	Transparency, effectiveness, efficiency.  As a donor to many different ministries and foundations, ICA consistently has exceeded my expectations.  I have confidence in Pat and Susan and Dane that when funds are needed and utilized that good stewardship prevails.  Whether gently assuming responsibility of a St Louis inner city ministry or attending the weddings of young Ethiopian ladies rescued from slavery, this ministry does it right!
International Crisis Aid Inc	170793		/users/profile/226224	Mats09	Volunteer	5	09/20/2013	I went to Ethiopia with International Crisis Aid in 2009.  I am from London, England but found out about the organization through Joyce Meyer Ministries.  Put simply, that trip changed my life.  There are a couple of things that struck me about ICA but one of the main things was that rather than coming to Ethiopia and 'taking over,' they connected with a local Ethiopian church and Ethiopian doctors who run the clinics and other programs on the ground.  It's the idea of partnership that really struck me and ICA is truly making waves in that nation. The work with the poor in rural areas, sponsoring children in poor families, the health clinic and the work with women who have been sex-trafficked. It is truly transforming a nation. I love the fact that the staff just get on with it, no fanfare, no fancy advertising campaigns with high administrative costs (when I went in 2009 there were only 2 paid members of staff in the US office, with 98% of all monies going directly into the programs ICA runs) just helping the people, because as they put it 'love had no boundaries.'
International Crisis Aid Inc	170249		/users/profile/225608	Stacey25	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	ICA is such an amazing ministry.  After hearing about their work almost 3 years ago, my daughter (then only 7 years old) was so impacted by their ministry, especially the girls they help, that she felt burdened to help in any way we could to further ICA's impact.  Although I feel like what we are able to do with our time & finances are only a drop in the bucket, the team at ICA is so encouraging, honoring and truly grateful for everything we help with, especially for the efforts of my daughter, which has been so important for her to see the impact she can have at a young age.  Every person I have worked at ICA, from the CEO down, is humble & just plain honored to be serving as God's hands & feet here in St. Louis and around the world.  I have never seen so much integrity & humility in a ministry.  I am truly humbled & blessed for my entire family to play even a small part in such an amazing ministry not only for the work they do but also for the way they do it.  ICA is top notch in every aspect.   Thank you, ICA, for having such a profound impact not only on the world, but also on my family.  
International Crisis Aid Inc	169819		/users/profile/225064	khaak	Donor	5	09/15/2013	We have never felt more confident in giving our finanicial support to an organization.  We are so Thankful to be able to be apart of some of the amazing God things that ICA is doing around the world.  ICA doesn't just see needs or problems to fix they see people and they start there.  ICA loves God's children well!!

International Crisis Aid Inc	109373		/users/profile/149015	John60	Donor	5	04/09/2012	I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ethiopia during the mid-70's and was excited about the opportunity to get involved with Pat and Sue Bradley and ICA. My wife and I have been donors for for more than 5 years and I have participated in 3 mission trips as a journalist to Ethiopia with ICA; the most recent in May 2011, with our son. ICA is an excellent organization, doing wonderful work in Ethiopia. I only wish that we could do more to support their mission.
International Crisis Aid Inc	169301		/users/profile/224379	charick	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I started getting involved with ICA about 2 plus years and have been wowed everytime I come in contact with them. They never take any credit and are the most sincere, down to earth, loving people that I have ever worked with. I joined Monarch Jewelry when I learned about this organization and what they stand for. Other volunteers at our church make this beautiful jewelry to sell and the proceeds go to help ICA support their safe home for girls saved from sex trafficking. What a mission! These girls need all of the help that everyone can do. God needs our help and so does ICA. We work closely with ICA in a lot of ways and hope that we can make a difference in a girls life. I have worked with other charities and they are so impersonal and you are just a volunteer to them. Not ICA, you become friends and not just with the other volunteers or office staff but with Pat and Sue Bradley too. They also care about your life and what they can do to help you. So, it isn't a one way street. They are just genuine and loving people to work for.
International Crisis Aid Inc	169224		/users/profile/224266	cpurlmd	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I have visited Ethiopia with ICA and have supported a child for several years.  Everyone in the organization is rock solid and has a deep love for the work they do and the people they serve.  Integrity and openness are key values in the organization.  Pat has a special gift of finding people that no one else is helping, whether in Africa, the Middle East or Haiti.  When Joyce Meyer was visiting a feeding center in Ethiopia, Pat was able to find a severely malnourished child for the video team.  Standing back watching the events, I was stunned when Pat shared his excitement: not with Joyce and Dave Meyer's presence at the program but with finding one more child that needed to be in the feeding program!   ICA is a feet on the ground, make a difference, do the work and save a life kind of organization.
International Crisis Aid Inc	169221		/users/profile/224261	Nschomburg	Donor	5	09/11/2013	My friend Sherie and her son visited Ethiopia several years ago.  From her experience, meeting Pat Bradley, she and her son each adopted a child from Ethiopia.  Sherie shared the details of her trip, from having a party with the girls at the orphanage, to visiting where the people International Crisis Aid supports, and even the sex trafficking area.   I really felt for the people there and the children.  Sherie really sold me.  She start showing me pictures of girls (I'm partial to girls, I have 3 daughters) I could sponsor.  I prayed about it, and then decided to do it.  I love the letters I get from International Crisis Aid and from Kalkidane.   I know if I had to live like they do, I couldn't do it.  It's the least I can do, to support a child.
International Crisis Aid Inc	169154		/users/profile/224186	dvbeav	Donor	5	09/11/2013	My wife and I added International Crisis Aid as one of our supported charities a couple of years ago. This organization may not have the visability of many major relief charities but, from what we can see,  is doing far more with the resources available to them than most similar organizations. I am so thankful that Pat and Sue Bradley are giving their lives to such a great cause and thank God for allowing my wife and I to help with our donations. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	169146		/users/profile/224175	Guytonl	Donor	5	09/11/2013	In 2012, I joined ICA on a mission trip to Ethiopia.  It was beyond description!  There is much that could be written, but it is sufficient to say their impact is huge.  The work that ICA does is literally saving people from death and transforming lives.   The main focus of the trip was to help girls who are being sexually trafficked and to encourage those currently living at ICAs Safe Homes.  The need is immense as there are thousands of girls forced to work in the Red Light District in Addis Ababa.   It was amazing to see the vast difference a few months can make in the life of a young woman.   The girls who have been rescued are now being restored.  They have joy unshakable and are generous beyond expectations.   ICA also runs an orphanage for girls whose parents have died of AIDS.  This beautiful home keeps girls at risk out of the Red Light District. Sex trafficking is a horrid reality not only in Africa, but also in many countries around the world, including the United States.  In December, 2012 ICA opened their first U.S. Safe Home in the city where I live.  My first experience with ICA compelled me to continue serving with them.  It is a privilege to invest my time, skills and financial resources to help save, heal and deliver people into a life that it is truly life!
International Crisis Aid Inc	169134		/users/profile/224162	emilynicolech	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2013	ICA cares about those children in need.  Many people at our church purchase Monarch jewelry to support their Safe House for victims of sex trafficking. When I volunteered at my church in the past, some of the members of this organization spoke about the hardships they have seen and the help that children and their families received. Great Organization!!!!
International Crisis Aid Inc	169104		/users/profile/224122	KBach	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	We have a non-profit ministry called, "Monarch" which increases awareness and provides funds for the ICA Safe Home in St. Louis through the sale of jewelry & accessories.  We have been supporting ICA for two and a half years and because of their integrity, radical commitment to financial accountability & wisdom and, most importantly, their heart to help others which flows from the love of the Lord, we agreed a year ago to solely give ALL our profits to ICA! Unlike many partnerships which turn out to be a "one- way benefit" ICA works to help us succeed in our mission as well.  We have partnered together for awareness events in our community as well as vendor shows to sell our jewelry.  Several ladies who are part of Monarch also serve at ICA on a regular basis.  We have also had the awesome privilege of serving at the Safe Home by decorating it for Christmas (& providing Christmas baskets for the girls), teaching some rescued young women in the Safe Home to make a bracelet, assisting with their Walk/Run fundraiser and providing a space for their 10th Anniversary Celebration.   What they do is always done in a fashion that does not put the lime light on the organization, but rather those they are serving ... we feel like we're doing this together! 
International Crisis Aid Inc	169021		/users/profile/224035	Susan232	Donor	5	09/11/2013	I first learned about ICA in our city newspaper. I was very impressed with what I learned about them and further research confirmed that they were reputable. I have always been leary about nonprofits and careful with where I send my money. After more than 8 years of supporting only ICA, I continue to be amazed and blessed with the work they do. I wish I could so much more to support them as I am confident that they use the money I entrust to them with great care. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	168874		/users/profile/223847	drburnsdc	Donor	5	09/10/2013	I first learned of International Crisis Aid through the Joyce Meyer ministry.  After looking at their financial 'pie chart' & seeing about over 95% of the donations goes to the poor and needy, I called them.  I asked if they help with birth prevention like birth control pill and tubal ligation.  This might seem... rigid, but I would not want to see my child starve to death, that's harder than having myself starve!  So it seems logical to not only feed but prevent further starvation by propagation.  the staff are personal 7 they explained they offer teaching and direction to medical assistance.  I tithe on a monthly basis.
International Crisis Aid Inc	168859		/users/profile/149063	Nina V.	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	I have been doing their 5K for freedom and doing what I can as far as advocacy and volunteering for ICA for a long time now.  As a single mother with limited resources it is hard to find ways to feel like you are giving back and this is one of the few nonprofits I have worked with that makes you feel like you are really helping whether you can give a thousand dollars or only a few hours of your time.  The people who work here full time are some of the most amazing, genuine people I have ever met.  As someone with a 5 year old daughter I can't say enough how thankful I am for their SAFE program.  To think that there are little girls out there that are my daughters age being brought into child sex trafficking every 2 minutes... Thank God there are groups like ICA who are dedicated to saving these babies.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109401		/users/profile/149063	Nina V.	General Member of the Public	5	04/10/2012	I have worked with a lot of charity's in my life but this one is my new focus.  I am a single mom and unemployed right now so I can't always do as much as I would like to abut I can advocate and that is something that ICA gives you the chance to do.  When you hear about children being trafficked for the pleasure of grown men... That is the most disgusting, destructive things you could ever imagine.  But ICA is working to save these kids and if I can help in even a small way, that is awesome!!! Thank you ICA for allowing me and so many others the privilege of helping to save these kids, even if only by spreading awareness.
International Crisis Aid Inc	168842	1	/users/profile/223816	Jakeandnicolemerrick	Donor	5	09/10/2013	My husband and I have given to ICA on a personal level, out of our business for 2 years as well as our church body supports ICA monthly.  We only wish we had more money to put into them. The work they do goes beyond a single need. They meet the physical, financial, spiritual, and emotional needs of those they reach. They meet need in US as well as foreign.  I know firsts hand that they handle every penny with great integrity. The heart, soul and sweat of this organization is one to be modeled after. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	168313	1	/users/profile/223197	Racheldevine	Volunteer	5	09/08/2013	I have witnessed first hand the incredible work that ICA does. They have so much compassion and love for what they do. They are dedicated and driven to make a difference. They are the definition of selfless. They stay long hours in the office or leave their families and loved ones for months just to feed another child or give another sex slave a bed. The work they do with sex trafficking victims is incredible. I went on a trip with them to aid the trafficked victims and they have such a brilliant program that really works. It's practical and gives women a clean slate in life. They go there with theMessage of love in their hearts and preach compassion and value and worth to those women. They make sure the women know they are loved and valued beyond any price tag. They work so hard to raise money for those safe homes and they make sure no woman is left behind. Every rescued girlI met exuded joy and love. They call pat Bradley, the founder, father and consider the staff family. It's truly beautiful how ICA is changing the world. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	168196		/users/profile/41771	fbreitsma	Donor	5	09/07/2013	There are many opportunities to donate money and time to serve the less fortunate in this world. In ICA I found an organization that puts the funds they receive to excellent use. I have witnessed first hand the impact ICA has had both in Africa and here in the US. On various medical trips I have  witnessed personally the effectiveness of ICA's programs in saving children and whole families from malnutrition. I have seen how the ICA leadership has personally worked and sacrificed to better the lives of people in poverty stricken areas in Africa, people that were motivated to better their lives. The stories are endless: the girls that were rescued from sex trafficking and who i have personally seen change from destitution to successful tradespersons just because they were given an opportunity by ICA. The families that were provided the knowledge and tools ( including the seeds) to grow better crops to become more self supporting. The children that were saved from starvation.  The stories of changed lives abound, too mamy to share here. The reason that I support ICA goes beyond the story of changed lives. It is also the integrity of the leadership that provides me the assurance that my donations are put to good and effective use. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	40886	1	/users/profile/41771	fbreitsma	Volunteer	5	05/26/2010	As part of a trip to Ethiopia to help disadvantaged people to better their lives, we spent two days trying to rescue young women out of the rampant prostitution in Addis Ababa. The effort started with a trip to the city's infamous red light district. We were broken up into teams and instructed to strike up conversations with young prostitutes and try to get them interested in attending a community service ICA helped sponsor the next day. I talked to some 10 women and encouraged them to come to the meeting the next day, and tried to make them see a way out of their dead end life style. A few responded very positively and actually showed up the next day, where I talked to them in more depth about the training opportunities ICA offers and the opportunity to be placed in a safe house as away to start over in life. After returning to the States ICA representatives in Addis Ababa followed up with the women; even though there was interest ICA is funding-constrained and out of capacity in the safe houses for now. We are not giving up; it is very frustrating to see chances to rescue these women slip through your fingers. But like Churchill said "never, ever give up'. So the plan is to go back later this year and reconnect and see if we can bring some of these women out of the red light district and into the safe houses. I, and with me, the entire ICA team will keep hoping, keep pressing on, and keep working to provide a better chance in life for these women. Once you have seen what we have seen, there is no turning back. And we will persevere, even it means to rescue one at a time. One of the ladies I connected with, Genet, has captured my heart and I will not rest until she is safe.
International Crisis Aid Inc	167084	1	/users/profile/149729	Gpa	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I have been to Ethiopia several times with ICA. Each time we go we see what a difference ICA has madein many family's there. Our first trip there was a set of twins that we found in the crowd that would have died from starvation if they had not been found. I am talking in a few day's, that's how bad they were. ICAtook these kids into the program and starting helping feed the whole family along with the twins. Upon arriving at the medical clinic the second trip these kids were there and they were healthy. As we have been 4 times now we see what a difference ICA has made to the community. My wife and I sponsor 4 children through the child sponsorship program. And to see the progress they have made is awesome.There are so many things I would like to comment on from working at orphanage, working at feeding clinics, also working with ICA and girls caught up in sex trafficking. Every facet of this organization is extremely well ran. To see what they can do with so little is amazing. and the heart of there staff is a blessing to all who come in contact with them. ICA does so much more than just hand out food,they try to teach the people of Ethiopia how to help themselves. Construction ICA does is performedby locals in the villages which is a great help to all the families there. Any and all donations no matterhow big are small are use to the fullest. As a person that has been blessed to get to go there, thank you ICA for who you are, also for going to places where others won't go. And for living out everyday yourmotto: LOVE HAS NO BOUNDRIES. If you are thinking of donating to ICA you won't regret it. LOVE LOVE LOVE this organization.
International Crisis Aid Inc	167066	1	/users/profile/221914	philjonesred	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I have had the pleasure to serve in multiple capacities for this organization over the past few years.  I am blown away each and every time that I have seen the work that they are doing to meet the needs of the people they give aid to.  I know that ever minute that I spend or every dollar that I give will be maximized in the specific area of need.  It is truly a wonderful organization.  
International Crisis Aid Inc	167043	1	/users/profile/221889	majdrummond86	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	ICA is an amazing organization and I had the honor to join them in Ethiopia, I was blown away at the work they did and continue to do there. I was in awe of how the community in Ethiopia was cared for by ICA, and loved and respected the care they were receiving. I feel in love with Ethiopia, and ICA opened my eyes to trafficking and have given me a desire to care for young girls who are victims locally and internationally. I pray I can join them on a future trip. It was the greatest trip of my life! Life changing!
International Crisis Aid Inc	145558		/users/profile/145606	w_65_j	Donor	2	12/01/2012	This work is done for Christian evangelicalism, not for the goodness in and of itself. In their own words, "Share the gospel use words when we have to."
International Crisis Aid Inc	110103	1	/users/profile/149661	Lindsey C.	Donor	4	04/17/2012	I have been blessed to go to Ethiopia with International Crisis Aid twice, and will return for a third trip in a couple weeks. One thing that really stands out to me about ICA is how instead of just focusing on one particular issue or problem, they have implemented a variety of programs and have produced amazing results. In the Angacha region of Ethiopia, they have provided clean drinking water, a feeding program, a medical clinic, and have begun construction on a hospital. This well-rounded approach has truly transformed an entire community and it's incredible thing to witness. Whenever someone asks me what I see and do in Ethiopia, it's hard to decide what to tell them about first. In addition to Angacha, I have also had the opportunity to see the other programs ICA has in Addis Ababa -- the outreach in the red light district, the SAFE homes, the girls' orphanage, the child sponsorship program... the list of accomplishments just goes on and on.  I have such peace of mind supporting ICA because I have seen myself the quality and extent of care that ICA provides.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109893	1	/users/profile/149673	0311	Donor	5	04/15/2012	As a donor of ICA, I am impressed by their constant involvement with their donors.  Between their newsletters, facebook updates and other communication with ICA, their work is always visible.  Everyone at ICA is truly passionate about helping hurting and needy people.  I love how they go where other organizations are not going. Their commitment and integrity should be present in all non-profit work. They are doing tremendous work throughout the world. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	109781	2	/users/profile/149548	Drew N.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2012	I have had the honor of working along side International Crisis Aid in Haiti in 2010 and Ethiopia in 2011. I have been beyond impressed at how ICA sees a need and finds a solution quickly without question. Their love for every person is a tangible expression of the organizations' mission: "Love knows no bounds." It is the heartbeat behind everything they do and its an honor to see that love in action.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109771	1	/users/profile/149538	TimFlowers	Volunteer	5	04/12/2012	I have had the opportunity to work with several mission ordinations in the past 15 years. Some of them have been great experiences and  some just experiences. The difference is leadership... ICA has top notch leadership.  Serving along side them I had the chance to see the passion, determination, and desire to fulfill the mission God has called them to. When you see solid leadership in place with a clear vision and great passion... Great things happen... God things happen.  Don't miss out, help support or go on a trip with ICA. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	109753	1	/users/profile/149518	mtester	Donor	5	04/12/2012	My husband and I have had the privilege of knowing Pat and Sue Bradley from ICA for many years now. We met through our church, Victory World Church, in Norcross, GA. We were blessed to have been able to join Pat in Ethiopia a couple of years ago with our son, to personally see the work they are doing there. The ministry is growing and the vision that ICA has in reaching and ministering to people all over the world is coming to pass right before our eyes. We appreciate the honesty and integrity in which ICA functions. This ministry is certainly a testimony of how our support keeps on giving.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109745	1	/users/profile/149506	TillAllHaveHeard	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2012	I am the missions pastor at Victory World Church and our church has partnered with Pat and ICA on several high resource projects in Ethiopia and Haiti.  Without exception, we have always been pleased with the kingdom results of these collaborations .  I have personally spent time with Pat on the ground in Haiti directly after the earthquake, as well as in Ethiopia, and found him to be a man of faith, passion and integrity.  I also have had the privilege of working on site with a couple of board members for ICA, and found them to passionately committed to the mission of ICA.  I work with and have associations with numerous non-profits, and I would place ICA at the top of my list.  My recommendation for this organization is without reservation ... whatsoever!
International Crisis Aid Inc	109737		/users/profile/149495	Linda70	Volunteer	5	04/12/2012	I have been volunteering at ICA for several months. I enjoy my time here and feel like I am contributing to a very worthy cause. Pat, Sue and the rest of the staff are great!  Their love and passion for hurting people around the globe is inspiring.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109735	1	/users/profile/149493	HHolland	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2012	I work for a non-profit ministry that has supported ICA for the past ten years. During that time I've seen first hand how ICA uses the funds it has been entrusted with. This ministry has continuously handled itself with great integrity and wisdom. If you want to make a difference in someones life then donate to ICA.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109730	1	/users/profile/149488	Bob_5	Volunteer	5	04/12/2012	I volunteered to work on the ICA 5 K Run for the last couple years and I was always impressed with the energy and commitment of the ICA Staff towards their mission.  They are all wonderful people who work tirelessly to help others with their talent and treasure.  I have personally known Pat Bradley for over 20 years and I must say he is at the top of the heap when it comes to helping others, and enlisting others to help!
International Crisis Aid Inc	109688	1	/users/profile/149438	twoguysandabible.com	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	I had the privilege of going on 3 relief trips to Ethiopia with ICA.  It is an incredible organization with the donations really going to the people.  They have the local connections to see that real, meaningful, relief, and follow-up makes to it them.  This is an organization who has not only heart but fiscal responsibility to match.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109679	1	/users/profile/149424	fbreitsma2	Donor	5	04/11/2012	I have the privilege of having known Pat for many years and  his organization ICA since its inception as a donor and a member on a few trips to Ethiopia. Pat has instilled in the ICA organization the compassion for the lost and the integrity he has as a person. Through his leadership many a life has changed, and saved.  For me there is no greater joy than to contribute to support ICA's efforts in the US and abroad, and to get personally involved where and when I can. Get involved and expect to catch Pat's vision, compassion an enthusiasm!
International Crisis Aid Inc	109663	1	/users/profile/149409	VeronicaK	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	For years I have donated my time and money to various non-profit organizations, however, ICA has proven to be my favorite organization to be involved with.  I was introduced to ICA four years ago and since that time have gotten to know the founders Pat and Sue Bradley.  Their passion and integrity exceeds anything and anyone I have ever known.  It has been my extreme privilege to volunteer for them both in the US and in Ethiopia.  They handle the contributions with utmost care and hold a high standard of excellence for the money distribution to the various projects they take on.  I feel safe knowing that they maintain superior accountability to their board and donor base. Without hesitation I would recommend ICA to anyone who is looking for a non-profit agency to become involved with either monetarily or as a volunteer.  
International Crisis Aid Inc	109641		/users/profile/149386	Amy_15	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	ICA to me is the ultimate non profit organization. I have personally seen the integrity of ICA both overseas and here at home.  I have worked with many organizations but not one of them could hold a candle to the level of excellence that is ICA's standard. 
International Crisis Aid Inc	109525		/users/profile/149237	hasslerla	Volunteer	5	04/10/2012	At the request of my sister, I offered some time to help set up an office and filing system when ICA grew beyond what could be handled from the home office of Pat and Sue Bradley. This led to learning and believing in the mission, values and work God has directed for ICA. Although I have not been on a mission trip, I am thankful for the support role I can offer in helping provide for orphans, widows, young girls and hungry families in Ethiopia, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109368		/users/profile/149008	Rod T.	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	International Crisis Aid is easily the best non-profit that I have not only ever worked with, but also ever seen!  Their vision and goals are in helping people, serving children, and freeing the oppressed.  They do not focus on marketing themselves, as many non-profits do these days.  Instead, ICA spends its budget and resources empowering people to live life as it is truly meant to be lived; whole and serving others.  There is no other non-profit that will be able to parallel or even come close to the depth of impact that ICA has had on peoples' lives.  I challenge anyone to take a trip with them and see the health, love, and life ICA brings to families and children all around the world.  It is truly unparalleled.
International Crisis Aid Inc	109365		/users/profile/149001	Jennifer87	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/09/2012	Over the past four and a half years (since Jan. 2008), I have had the honor to serve as the Executive Assistant to the President of International Crisis Aid.  There are tens of thousands of nonprofit organizations around the world, but ICA is like no other.  Firstin the programs & services provided. Secondin their accountability and integrity.  And Thirdin the character of the executive staff. ICAs focus of delivering emergency aid which is then transformed into long-term community development projectsfocusing on solutions to the problems in the regions they workmakes ICA stand apart.  ICA is often told by other missionaries who have worked in the field for years that they have never seen anything like what ICA is accomplishing.  And what is amazing is what ICA is able to do with even a little bit of money.  ICA makes funds stretch as far as possibleand then reevaluates to make it stretch to the unimaginable in order to reach as many people with quality care as possible.   In order to keep administrative and fundraising costs as low as possible, the Founder and President who has served full-time for over 10 years STILL HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY PAYMENT FROM ICA.  Every purchase, no matter how small, is closely evaluated before any funds are spent.  And multiple quotes are obtained to secure the best prices.  The level of accountability this organization has in the office and in the field is beyond anything Ive seen in my lifetime of working in the nonprofit sector.   The character of the executive staff both in the headquarters office and in the field programs shines through their daily personal sacrifices to help people.  The executive staff have the expertise to be making a lot of money working wherever they would likebut instead, they sacrifice personally so that the number of people they serve can be increased.   Many people work for NGOs but wouldnt give a dime to the organization they work for.  ICA is an organization my family and I will forever supportfinancially and in service.  I am honored to have served for four and a half years alongside the staff of ICA and I look forward to a lifetime of working with them and growing the organization to reach more people in need.   
International Crisis Aid Inc	41955	8	/users/profile/42722	vkwright	Donor	5	05/30/2010	I have had the wonderful privilege of working with ICA for over a year now.  It is easy to link arms with any organization that is totally committed to rescuing girls from the horrors of sex trafficking. They are making great strides in bringing this issue into the light so others can join the cause. I am also particularly impressed that 93% of all donations go directly to relief efforts. That is the highest percentage I have ever seen in a non-profit agency. It clearly demonstrates how dedicated they are to honor the money that was given for the expressed purpose of combating human suffering. For that reason, my husband and I are regular monthly donors to ICA. We take great comfort in knowing that our contribution will be used to help girls who have been rescued from the sex trade industry. Pat and Sue Bradley have always treated me with the utmost respect and are a true pleasure to work with.  They are the most authentic people I have ever met in my many years of ministry.  It is my great honor to know them!
International Crisis Aid Inc	41176	7	/users/profile/42053	dkrg	Donor	5	05/27/2010	When I became acquainted with International Crisis Aid and met Pat Bradley in 2005, I was not only impressed with the compassion behind their efforts, but also with the effectiveness and efficiency of their organization. Within months, our organization began making monthly contributions in support of their work. When Pat talked with us about the growing sex traffic trade and shared his organizations vision to rescue girls from its horrors, we didnt hesitate to help financially. We knew they would work tirelessly to not only rescue victims from the immediate horror, but that they would also provide safe shelter, medical care, education and training to literally give these girls new lives. That is exactly what they are doing. I have read the reports, heard the testimonials, and seen the videos of what is being accomplished in Ethiopia and Cambodia. We are grateful for ICAs courageous efforts and are thankful for the opportunity to have a part in the work they are doing. I hope we can play an even bigger part in the days ahead by giving more and sending volunteer teams to assist in the work.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39535	8	/users/profile/40487	sondra1	Donor	5	05/19/2010	International Crisis Aid is an organization that goes far beyond where most nonprofit groups go.  ICA goes into the streets in the hardest areas of Ethiopia to rescue girls forced into prostitution.  These girls would otherwise be lost in a world of pain and eventually death.  They give these girls life and a hope for a descent future.  They build group homes for girls that cannot be returned to their biological homes.  The work of ICA comes from the hearts of it's workers and volunteers.  I will continue to give financial support to help rescue these girls and hope to one day be able to go to Ethiopia with ICA to do what I can to physically help.

From top to bottom ICA is run with integrity and is the type of organization I am proud to be associated with.  They are always more worried about helping others, before they think about themselves.  It is also nice that they do work in the US and internationally.  They realize that making the world a better place requires a global view.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39254	6	/users/profile/40204	dsingletary	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	I have volunteered with many organizations here in the states and have spent time as a volunteer with a larger non-profit organization, but none can compare to the passion,commitment,and transforming power that ICA delivers. From feeding programs,to child sponsorship,to their medical clinic and their rescuing of countless girls trapped in the horrors of sex trafficking, ICA is an organization that truely transforms the lives of those they help with dignity and preservation. Pat and Sue Bradley are full of compassion, integrity, and pursue their commitment to sustaining life in areas of crisis with an unyeilding strength. I have personally seen the transformation of those this organization has touched. I have been given the privledge to speak with young, terrified girls unsure of even their own shadow and see them blossom into captivating women, who are ready to go out and make a difference in the lives of others continuing the chain of love and security that they have recieved.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39189	6	/users/profile/40139	shawn3	Donor	5	05/17/2010	We hosted a anual patient appreciation day at our office and ICA was the organization that all of the proceeds went to from that day. They set up a booth in our office and not only were they very informative but they connected with several different people and made them very proud to be a part of helping with all of the work that ICA does.  We have worked with other Non-profit organizations and and ICA is the standard by which non-profit excellence should be measured.  They were extremely professional in their dealings with every one in our office. We just want to say thanks to ICA for giving us an opportunity to help.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39159	8	/users/profile/40106	kim12	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	I was lucky enough to be able to work with ICA on three different occasions in Ethiopia.  I was able to see ICA support people in helping people to help themselves to support theirselves. It was amazing to watch them in action and to be a part of it. I also was able to meet some girls rescued off the streets and given the means to expand themselves. The joy and relief on their faces are priceless. I feel such an honor to know ICA,see them in action  and have been a part of such a blessing.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39122	10	/users/profile/40068	erowland	Donor	5	05/16/2010	I love this organization. They do a great deal of work with rescuing women/young people from the horrors of sex trafficking. I see many of the photos that come from the field and I can see the changes in the girls faces as they are given a new life and a safe place to stay. Some have children and they will also have an opportunity for a happy life.In addition, the work they are doing to help feed families and provide medical care for them is incredible. Many times they go to the hard to reach areas where people are desperate for help.This is a solid, focused organization and they have my vote - A+!
International Crisis Aid Inc	39052	8	/users/profile/39985	jordan5	Volunteer	5	05/15/2010	ICA is an amazing organization. They first caught my eye at a school organization convention. I had never heard of sex trafficking before and I defintely didn't know how rampant it is. Through my school we raised money to help support the ICA SAFE homes for girls rescued from sex trafficking. ICA was so helpful in sending us information and even sent a speaker to our school for no cost. It is such an amazing thing to see an organzation speak for those girls who have no voice. ICA is love, plain and simple. Wherever there is a great need, ICA is there to provide for the people.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39032	8	/users/profile/39965	dmf138	Volunteer	5	05/15/2010	International Crisis Aid is one of the many non-profit aid orginizations I have worked with around the world. In more than 20 years of traveling to underdeveloped nations and working with numerous aid orginizations I have not come across any that compares to the integrity of ICA. International Crisis Aid has been so effective in their management of funds and people that they are able to move into areas of crisis and bring immeadiate relief amidst human suffering. I have personally seen many of their feeding programs in operation and have witnessed the before and after results of their outreach programs. Countless thousands of children, mothers and families have been literally saved from malnutrition and starvation. Many more have received medical help, including expensive surgical procedures.   The efforts of International Crisis Aid to end child sex trafficking has been so successful in Ethiopia and Cambodia that they can now be used as a role model to other orginizations who wish to do the same. They are even currently working with the FBI to set up the first of many, planned in the United States. They are litterally transforming lives as they go into some of the most dangerous places on the planet and rescue girls whom society has thrown away. Their safe houses are not only a safe refuge, but a place of hope and restoration as once shattered young lives are now gaining hope, medical help and education to become productive, respectable citizens. There is no better place to invest your money to help others than in International Crisis Aid. Your funds go directly to the programs and the people who need it most.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39019	6	/users/profile/39952	russell3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/14/2010	ICA has raised the awareness of many of us in Missouri of the tremendous need for programming to address the issue of human trafficking of American girls.  This is a need that many of us who have been in children and family services for many hears had not really taken the time to consider.  ICA not only has the concern, but has developed programming in other countries to address this issue in those places.  Because of its reputation and success, it has been asked to provide programming in the states to help American children caught up in this dreadful situation.  We commend ICA for its leadership and continuing role in meeting this need.
International Crisis Aid Inc	39001	5	/users/profile/39933	diane11	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	I first became interrested in International Crisis Aid (ICA) thru a friend who had spent a summer working with them in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  She took bio's and pictures of children for the sponsorship program.  When I saw the pictures, heard the stories, I knew the time had come when I could no longer turn the channel or page away from the images because it hurt too much to view it.  My husband and myself picked a child to sponsor encourage others to do so.  After going online and researching, we were/are able to recommend International Crisis Aid as an NGO who uses ALL donations properly.  They have a very small staff and at least 90 cents out of every dollar goes toward the programs.  In October of 2009, we were able to be part of a trip to Ethiopia.  We saw how ICA is using every donation to make a difference.  The feeding program at Medical CLinic that most of the people walked at least 10 miles to get to.  This clinic is the only source of help/hope for too many miles to count.  This clinic is being run at such a high standard that it is rated higher than most hospitals in Ethiopia.  How can I begin to explain what the experience of helping to feed starving people is?  I can say that each person who received food thru ICA was treated with the utmost respect and care.  During the week I was able to work along side Pat Bradley the founder of ICA and staff members. At the clinic, orphanage, girls homes and while we were going thru the Red Light District, you can see what a difference ICA has made in lives in Ethiopia. For the girls at the orphanage, ICA has given them a safe place to grow, learn and develop into strong women who will make a difference in their country. For the girls rescued from the Red Light District, ICA has given them a safe home for themselves and their children.  They no longer have to sell their bodies.  They are being taught skills that will enable them to work at a occupation they are proud of.  To build a life that is free and full of hope.  For the people who now have a safe, clean Health Clinic, ICA is the difference between life and death.  For the child or family that will eat today that didn't yesterday, ICA is truely all that stands certain starvation.  For each of us that went in October, we will forever be changed because we see what love can do.  As a Christian, I believe ICA is truely loving others as Jesus loved/loves us.
Outreach International	317225	1	/users/profile/408401	kapeshakm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2016	The method used by Outreach International is one of the most uncommon ways of resolving community issues, and as such it has not just impacted the community residents where we are working but even us as facilitators. For instance, the method of PHDP has greatly changed me the way and how I look at other people and even the way I look at myself. PHDP has empowered people to realize and appreciate their potentials.
Outreach International	317048	1	/users/profile/408236	holy76moses	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	Outreach is a program that helps others to help themselves by teaching them how to grow food for themselves. Show others how to run a farm. Build a well and maintain it. They are a great organization that has grown by helping others help themselves.
Outreach International	316575	1	/users/profile/407812	Dominicsk2015	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2016	In my 20 years of association with this Organization working in the field in 4 different countries with teams of 4 -8 field staff, I have had the privilege of hearing so many testimonies of changed lives and of seeing so many lives radically transformed by the work of Outreach International: entire communities getting access to more clean water and sanitation; producing enough food for themselves and even an excess to sell thanks to treadle irrigation; starting to make enough income to improve their houses and send children and grandchildren to school and college; creating, building and managing their own schools and kindergartens; feeding the malnourished, elderly and  orphaned children; learning to use and erecting hand-washing stations and water-sealed and even flushable toilets; creating and managing their own clinics; changing from fishermen to fish farmers; planting thousands of trees; starting to have a voice and to be be heard and become visible to local and central Governments, etc.It is not the kind of intervention that continuously provide material assistance for a short-term relief or continuing dependency. No. It is a sustainable change that impact both the people's existence and psyche; the kind of transformation that improves material life alongside increasing consciousness and capabilities while changing people socially and mentally for a long-lasting good. It is the kind of actions and interventions that transform both the development staff and the beneficiaries in their journey together; the kind that let the people participate in defining collectively their own happiness and getting fully involve in its pursue, escorted by donors and operators along the paths towards that happiness with both the field staff and the beneficiaries getting transformed in the journey.At Outreach International, we strive to end poverty while creating conditions for the poor to take charge of their destiny and create better communities for themselves and a brighter future for their children.That is why I am still with Outreach International and choosing to remain.

Outreach International	313843	1	/users/profile/290496	shortiekirk	Volunteer	5	10/24/2016	It's about creating PEACE! Worldwide peace. When people have their needs met, they begin to have hope about their future. They believe they can change their life for the better. That's when they begin to feel peace within themselves and their community.  PEACE is what Outreach International provides.
Outreach International	226764	2	/users/profile/290496	shortiekirk	Advisor	5	10/25/2014	If you believe in Peace, you can believe in Outreach International.  One way to have peace among peoples is to give them hope, give them the necessities of life, give them education.  Fathers want to support their families, mothers want to feed their children, kids want to feel safe.  Outreach works towards those issues.  This brings peace to a family, peace to community, peace to the world.
Outreach International	313728	1	/users/profile/405081	Randall Pratt	Board Member	5	10/24/2016	As a Board member I have personally seen the consistent results of Outreach International's work in Bolivia, Nicaragua and the Philippines.  Sending only a trained facilitator (who is a local national) to teach cooperation and inspire hope, the power of community spirit and working together transforms poverty into prosperity and hope. Too often we assume that poverty can only be changed by material things from the outside.  Instead, it is an intrinsic thing on the inside that really changes poverty.  Outreach International's "Participatory Human Development Process" transforms how a village thinks about themselves, others and the challenges that result in poverty, and provides a new way to address those challenges. It is a joy to see the results and hear the stories of those who have together improved their lives for a better, sustainable future. Randall Pratt

We are earning more in the farm than in the past when she was not involved, Outreach International indeed has helped me have more changes through the process of PHDP.Adams 
Outreach International	313405	1	/users/profile/404777	Writer	Board Member	5	10/22/2016	Outreach International is the only poverty-fighting organization I know that takes the time -- the patient, long-term view-- to ensure lasting change. They combine research, experience, and fundamental one-to-one relationships in the field to foster independence and self-reliance. Then, each generation in the village models that behavior for generations to follow. So the  resulting change stays there, for good. 
Outreach International	313030	1	/users/profile/404399	Felina D.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2016	Why am I still with Outreach International when I've been here for 19 years already? It started with the need to be employed for income, followed by commitment when my work context and direction deepened. Now, it's about passion. Passion that sustains me - making me happy, proud and fulfilled as the impacts of participatory community development work are manifested: people's projects are earning, their consciousness and capabilities are intensifying, participants are increasing with neighboring communities joining. Even families of the staff were benefiting with the positivity and capacities that staff were sharing. We were "tooled" enough to carry out what we need to work on. Isn't it too rewarding?

Outreach International	312202	1	/users/profile/403562	Steve181	Board Member	5	10/19/2016	From the perspective of a Board member and a regular donor who has visited Nicaragua three times with Outreach International, I can tell you that it means so much to hear the community members in a developing country speak with personal pride about the things they have done for themselves and their communities.  Outreach employs local people to facilitate communities to organize and get what they need and want.  Why wouldn't I love this sustainable magic?
Outreach International	312145	1	/users/profile/243693	Nancy139	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	Sustained commitment and dedication are words that are accurate and true for Outreach International (OI). The programs initiated in countries and villages across the globe are created with long term sustainability and support from OI.  Through this type of commitment and hands on training with the people directly affected by the programs, individuals lives are being enriched and enhanced in ways that were not possible before. Knowing that OI continues to support and sustain these needs is what sets OI apart for me. I've been a donor for years and plan to continue to support this wonderful nonprofit for as long as possible.
Outreach International	186680	1	/users/profile/243693	Nancy139	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	For years I have been donating to Outreach International, but it was only in the last couple of years did I get the opportunity to become a volunteer at their World Headquarters. I have always been intrigued and most inspired by the fact that the organization sustain the programs they create. The fact that they work with the communities around the world to create support sustainable programs, really sold me on this non-profit. Through volunteering, I have come to know many of the staff at their headquarters and its easy to see their dedication and excitement about their organization. I am proud to be a donor for life through their easy automatic deduction program. 
Outreach International	312064	1	/users/profile/403420	michigal	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	I am excited about Outreach International.  For several years, I represented Outreach International at the Combined Federal Campaigns.  The administrative costs of OI was always the lowest of the agencies represented there, which meant that the money was going to the programs and people in need, not administration.The process used by Outreach is transformative.  It establishes self-worth, while at the same time alleviating some of the problems of the poor, who are then blessed with better health and nutrition, fewer illnesses, and more sustainable environments.

Outreach international working in the poor communities to transform the peoples lives. Through the process of Outreach international people help themselves.  Through this process people get awareness, develop their skills, knowledge to resolve their issues and they get empowerment and capable to act themselves in making sustainable community.  People who are getting tangible or intangible benefits from outreach international are not confined with them but they are helping others to improve their lives and to come out from the poverty.  Outreach International impacted many Indian communities
Outreach International	311498	2	/users/profile/402854	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/18/2016	Working with Outreach is a great blessing, because OI work for sustainable development of the communities. OI empowering the people to act and make their situation better. I like the process that they do not provide/distribute the people tangible things/cash according their need but teach them to access the things/cash from other resource agencies. I think that is wonderful job, if we give a man one T-shirt he will wear minimum 6 month. if we teach a man how to get a T-shirt and he can buy many times. Outreach international is a great organization, which is providing skill, knowledge and capable to the people to sustain themselves.
Outreach International	311241	1	/users/profile/402583	Nancy271	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2016	Working with Outreach is a great blessing. It makes me feel and realized that the poverty that I have been is nothing compare to what the poor have been experiencing.  I am blessed to be an agent of change in the lives of many in the poor communities. How I wish others could also experience and see first hand how people work together to bring change in their lives, how they utilize their indigenous knowledge and capabilities to empower themselves and create sustainable solution to their own problems. The work of Outreach is contagious that is why it is growing, people are growing, partners are growing.. and that means we are creating sustainable solution to end poverty in the lives of the poor. 
Outreach International	311239	1	/users/profile/402581	KrizzaRia	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2016	As soon as I graduated from the university with my degree in Social Sciences, I started working with this organization. From the 2 organizations that they support in the Philippines where I was and is employed, I've been with them for more than 9 years combined! With my degree, I was offered by other agencies for teaching position, social work jobs, etc but I decided to stay and work with this organization. Why? Here, I work not just to earn for a living but is deeply appreciative with how this organization push for sustainability of community development by empowering the people to act and make their situation better. They encourage the rich and empower the poor to negotiate for sharing of resources. In every community that they work in they radiate hope and genuine love.
Outreach International	307554	1	/users/profile/353120	DanStifter	Board Member	5	10/02/2016	I was looking to get involved with a charity that made a meaningful difference in helping people take control of their lives to build their own better futures.  Outreach International "teaches" villages how to get things done to improve their circumstances.  We have better long term data than any other group I'm aware of that demonstrates that our villages are legitimately better off and that those changes stick.  We embed highly trained locals that guide villages through what is essentially a change management process.  For the first two years a lot of hand holding is required, but that quickly phases out as teams learn how to improve on whatever their most pressing need is, whether that's food, shelter, sanitation, medical care, education, it doesn't matter.  Outreach teaches how to work as a team to build long term solutions.  We typically are involved with a village for roughly 5 years, after that they are able to make progress independently.  If you teach a man to fish...
Outreach International	264396	1	/users/profile/353120	DanStifter	Board Member	5	10/15/2015	Poverty has no simple or easy solution.  Outreach International has a validated process that teaches people how to drastically improve the quality of their lives by focusing on problems that most need solving.  Outreach teaches empowerment so that villages can solve current, and future problems.   Data supports these conclusions, Outreach rigorously tracks progress across key measures and has many years of supporting data showing the success of this approach.  Outreach makes a sustainable difference and richly deserves your support.
Outreach International	277551	2	/users/profile/179627	Doris C.	Donor	5	01/21/2016	We continue to support this great non profit, and believe in its mission to educate people to improve their lives rather than give handouts. We have joined their site visits to Philippines, Malawi, Bolivia and Nicaragua to see first hand how their dedicated in country facilitators help villages learn to make a difference in their lives by working with and training them to learn to help themselves improve their lives. I am a volunteer coordinator of church congregations in my area.
Outreach International	133868	2	/users/profile/179627	Doris C.	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I have had the privilege of seeing Outreach International and their facilitators working in the field in Philippines, Malawi, Bolivia and Nicaragua.  Their facilitators work in villages of poverty around the world, teaching them organizational skills to make them more self sufficient, and helping them see their value as leaders within their community. After a few years of learning, they can sustain what they have learned. I have seen villages whose standard of living was raised to the point where neighboring villages noticed, and they were able to help teach them what they had learned from the Outreach International facilitators. We have supported Outreach as donors for many years, and believe their approach works.
Outreach International	270160	2	/users/profile/358879	SisterSusan	Donor	5	10/31/2015	The old adage about 'give someone a fish and they'll eat that day - teach them to fish and they will be able to provide their own food' is so true, and Outreach International really epitomizes that wisdom.  When Outreach International sends a team to a village/town, they meet with the people and learn what the locals feel is their most important need, a learning experience in itself as they arrive at a consensus. Then the team teaches and empowers the local people to take the steps necessary to reach their goal. That way, when the Outreach International team moves on, they can be assured that the village/town knows how to set and reach goals independently, having had a positive hands-on experience.  The best kind of mentoring!!
Outreach International	269983	2	/users/profile/358715	pabelshe	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	My husband and I contribute financially to Outreach International because we strongly believe in their mission. The model of sustainability is a highly effective system of support. The Outreach International helps others to help themselves. We are more than happy to give our support to this top notch non-profit. Kudos to OI! 
Outreach International	269373	1	/users/profile/184663	Vivian N.	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	To those who live in poverty, Outreach International is their ticket out!  It is a slower process than handouts, but because it teaches reliance on the community, the team and the individual, it builds programs that are sustainable and lasting.  These programs come from within the community or team where they empower and build confidence.  We have witnessed the joy and pride in the people who are living and working within the communities and we have seen the end result (gardens, wells, houses, etc.)! These communities are vibrant, children are attending school, people have jobs, families have food and life is good!Outreach also realizes that there are times of natural disaster such as the recent typhoons in The Philippines when time doesn't permit the process to unfold, in which case a handout is necessary. They are on top these situations also. With a low overhead budget, dedicated volunteers and a nine-step process (Participatory Human Development Process) that is proven (and sought out by other organizations), we know that Outreach International is exemplary and a Great Non-Profit!
Outreach International	138591		/users/profile/184663	Vivian N.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	As a hand up rather than a hand out organization, Outreach International's approach is to teach indigenous leaders to help their community identify and prioritize their needs and then find a sustainable way to meet the most urgent needs while, at the same time, training new leaders.  Education of community leaders and schools for children are a top priority for Outreach.  It has been my husband's and my privilege to serve nearly 20 years as either regional advisors or local representatives, sharing the story of the amazing work of OI. We have, as we have traveled, visited various communities where the testimonials of positive impact have been eagerly related as well as visually apparent!  Peace corps service was our first face to face exposure to the terrible plight of those living in poverty.  Vaguely aware of but not a contributor to or volunteer for Outreach International until our first hand encounter with poverty, we returned from Peace Corps and became active supporters and contributors.  We love that they build confidence, instil dignity, promote the worth of persons, teach sustainability and believe education and justice is the path to peace!
Outreach International	268916		/users/profile/357645	McAdamson Nkhoma	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2015	McAdamson Nkhoma/Malawi: The Outreach International from 2012 till now it is able to source ore funds for funding  poor people in the communities of Malawi particularly in the 12 partner communities that Malawi staff are working.The time  when we invited  government staff from the department of agriculture to give awareness of how to take care, replace/plant trees and about the causes of deforestation through  unnecessary fires (bush burning and cutting trees without its purpose into the partner communities that we  work, at first the community members were not understanding about this ideology from ODP and government, But when we explained/facilitate  about the effects  of cutting trees without real purpose and burning the bushes, that these two things if not taken care it brings land degradation and the soil will not produce bumper yield to the crops that the farmer may grow. The community people from the communities we work are now able to protect their lands that they inherited from there parents and the laws/polices are made within the villages that protects the burning of the bushes and cutting trees without a purpose. In additional to this the members have been able to submit proposals to different NGOs and GOs demanding tree seeds as well as polythene tubes for good germination of seeds, the most encouraging this is that OI when observed these people replacing trees in their own villages through facilitation from its workers, it provides funds that are meant  to food for work while these members of groups are planting trees during the lean months from December to April this has happen for three times in different villages that ODP works. Outreach International is also providing more support to its field staff/HDFs financially in order to implement the PHDP work efficiently the community members has been able to plant acacia and eucalyptus trees and other trees that replaces the fertility of the soil . As a result in five years coming the 12 villages will have more to benefit from these trees when it comes at the time of selling because one acacia or eucalyptus pole of 5 inches  thick and  7 to 15 feet long is sold at $3.70 USD as of now. each partner village has more than 1,000 growing trees. Thats why Outreach International is rated meets the expectations of the poor people.   McAdamson Nkhoma - Malawi Field Program
Outreach International	268712	1	/users/profile/357441	MelCrowley	Donor	5	10/28/2015	My wife and I have supported Outreach International for many years. We love getting the feedback on how our donations help others move ahead with being self sustaining and having a healthier life. I have always thought the participatory part of the program was very important to the long lasting effects. When the local people come together and use their own giftedness and effort to prioritize, plan, and implement the final outcome they have new expectations for their future and what is possible within their own community. I also appreciate how volunteers are actively involved and how much of the funding goes directly to the projects rather than overhead.Thanks Mel Crowley, Urbandale Ia.

It is dedicated to empowering local communities to help themselves in ways most helpful to each unique local village or city.  I am a professional social worker.  I have worked with a large variety of nonprofit organizations during my career.  I have been impressed with the values expressed and implemented by this organization.  I have also been impressed when I have met people from villages that have been helped by Outreach International.  They have made great contributions around the world including Haiti and The Phillipine Islands.
Outreach International	260216	1	/users/profile/348774	REPratt	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	Outreach International engages the collaborative energy of the whole village to sustainably address poverty.  Instead of dependency ("giving a man a fish"), the Participatory Human Deveopment Process of Outreach International facilitates lasting change and capability ("teaching the village how to fish together").  This approach is both efficient and effective, as it only requires one trained facilitator to organize and equip the village to transform itself. I have seen this success in dozens of villages in m trips to Bolivia, Nicragua and the Philippines.
Outreach International	247454	2	/users/profile/334992	PBallinger	Donor	5	07/04/2015	I am proud to be associated with Outreach International by being a donor.  Outreach doesn't just give handouts.  Handouts diminish pride and create dependency.  Outreach  works with communities to help themselves, to prioritize their own needs, to develop leadership among themselves, to work together for common good.  I believe Outreach makes a lasting difference in the world.

Outreach International	227040	2	/users/profile/181186	Jennifer158	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Peace and Justice are not just words spoken at a church service.  Peace and Justice require action.  Outreach International is an organization of action.  We are called to uplift the worth of all persons, lift each other out of poverty, promote communities of peace.  This organization does just that.  They do not just throw food and medicine at people or villages.  The members of this organization help people to help themselves be self sufficient, help communities work together to build economies that are self supporting.  I highly encourage all who want to invest in the future of Earth to donate funds, time, sweat equity through Outreach International.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact you will be a blessing to others and help them to be a blessing to even more people...
Outreach International	135320	3	/users/profile/181186	Jennifer158	Advisor	5	11/07/2012	I have supported Outreach International for about ten years and agreed to be a regional advisor two years ago.  I continue to support the mission of Outreach International because of its mission to help communities become self sustaining.  The opportunity to fund carpentry tools; sewing machine; chickens or a water buffalo; school supplies blew my mind.  The catalog is fun to go through. It provides a meaningful gift alternative when shopping for that person who has everything, or as a fitting memorial to a loved one who has passed on.  I used the Advent Stable materials last year and will do so again  this year.  The congregation loved the information contained in bulletin inserts provided by OI.  We made the four animals highlighted last year and are looking forward to crafting the gifts for this year's Advent Stable.

Outreach International	226227	2	/users/profile/289966	FChristine	Donor	5	10/24/2014	My husband and I have been supporters of Outreach International for many years, and in recent years it has become our charity of choice.  We are especially drawn to OI's model, as it is one of the few that seems to provide a realistic process for self-empowerment and sustainability in its efforts against poverty.  OI seems to really embrace the idea of abolishing poverty rather than just ameliorating it.  One way we have enjoyed incorporating OI into our Christmas traditions is to use their gift catalog to make donations in the names of loved ones, and then to create Christmas ornaments representing the contribution. For instance, OI catalog donations may be used to purchase livestock, plant trees, build wells or cooking stoves, etc. and making a little ornament to represent how the donation may have been used to further a community's prosperity make the gift special and tangible.  Regardless, I always feel our money is being used well when we make donations to OI.

Donor	5	10/24/2014	Traveling with Outreach International on a site visit to Malawi, Aftica showed me how the money I contribute really impacts those in extreme poverty. Many charities can advertise their work well. But I got to have the experience of seeing Outreach's unique process truely work to eliminate poverty. 
Outreach International	226130	2	/users/profile/289871	Deb_40	Donor	5	10/24/2014	I love this organization and have often offered it up to people looking for a place to help.  I appreciate many things, but the general public looking to make a difference can be confident that the funds go to the needy, as this organization keeps the administrative costs below 15%.  Also, this organization helps people help themselves in a sustainable way - no one shot deals!  I contribute by means of an automatic monthly withdrawal from my bank, as I don't want to forget this important work.
Outreach International	225289	2	/users/profile/289063	candycorn	Volunteer	4	10/23/2014	Donna, Helen and I went to Los Fresno for Outreach International.    We went down to teach new skills to approximately 30 women that could be used in their everyday lives.    Donna taught  canning......she used local vegetables and fruits......made some salsa for one example and demonstrated the process.     Helen taught sewing.....each of the women made a denim purse......it was fun and enjoyed by all.    I taught decorating of cakes and cupcakes......the ladies seemed to enjoy their creative side.      We all learned and hopefully everyone was able to take something from the classes.....if nothing else....self worth.   Would do it again in a heart beat!!!
Outreach International	225248		/users/profile/289018	Tawnya	Donor	5	10/22/2014	I have supported the work of Outreach International in providing funds to improve education in Haiti. As an elementary teacher I know the importance that education plays in improving children's' lives and the future of their communities.  I appreciate the emphasis Outreach International places on sustainability. 
Outreach International	225120	1	/users/profile/288895	Becca F.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	I have traveled to site visits with Outreach International in the Philippines and Nicaragua, and can easily say that the work they are doing there is incredible. Not only are they able to integrate the community in their project work, but the community members themselves are in the leadership roles. By actively listening to the needs of the community and facilitating life-changing project work OI is truly changing the world.
Outreach International	225117		/users/profile/288892	rklindgren	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	Coming from a financial background, I am most interested in organizations who address the problem of poverty with both financial effectiveness and sound, open financial stewardship of the gifts from their donors. Outreach International excels on both accounts. I have personally seen, in a self-funded site visit to the Bolivian Andes, how donor contributions change the current and future lives of men, women and children, with dignity and empowerment. I also pay close attention to how funds are being spent on administration, and again I consistently see personal responsibility and careful management of donations at all levels of the organization. Outreach International is a rare breath of fresh air!
Outreach International	225110		/users/profile/181289	MsPacoRN	Donor	5	10/22/2014	I've been a donor for years, had the opportunity to go on a site visit to Malawi, and have seen their work in-person in many other countries. Having spent years of my life traveling and working abroad for, with, and next to various NGOs, I can definitely say that OI exceeds the others by leaps and bounds. They do what they say, when they say they'll do it. Not only do they have good intentions (as I believe most NGOs do), but they have the professional knowledge and capacity to implement them in a sustainable, efficient, effective manner, all without racking up huge overhead costs.
Outreach International	135426	1	/users/profile/181289	MsPacoRN	Donor	5	11/08/2012	As a nurse who's lived in quite a few developing nations, I've spent much of my adult life working for, with, beside, and in conjunction with a variety of NGOs. Although I do believe that they all have great intentions, most of them fall incredibly short on sustainability, with minimal if any lasting impact. Having had the chance to travel to Malawi to see OI at work, and having seen many of their projects in other countries, I can honestly say that they're the only NGO I've ever experienced that really does what they say they'll do, and does it incredibly well. Their projects are well thought out, locally implemented, and truly sustainable. If more organizations had the mission, motivation, and mindset of OI, the world would be much better served. From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank OI for all that they do...keep up the good work :)
Outreach International	220831	2	/users/profile/284520	ttownsend	Board Member	5	10/08/2014	Outreach International is a truly unique organization in the way that it approaches the problem of poverty. Few organizations are patient enough to do it right -- break the cycle of dependence that so many of the world's poor have on outsiders, and create change within the hearts, minds and spirit of the poor themselves.  Through Outreach International,  communities embrace a new life-view -- defined by solving problems for themselves, by themselves. Then, as the younger generation in these communities witness the success that comes from self-motivated change, they perpetuate the practice until it becomes a part of the culture for the long term.  There is nothing temporary about the impact of Outreach International -- the change is lasting, sustainable, and passed down through successive generations in the village.  This is the way to do it. 
Outreach International	220717	1	/users/profile/284393	EPLACE	Board Member	5	10/07/2014	I have worked with and served on the boards of a number of charitable organizations.  Outreach International is made up of exceptional people doing very good work to produce REAL results in locations around the world where the needs are substantial.  It is a classic "Teach A Man To Fish....." model - and it works.
Outreach International	218283		/users/profile/281835	JohnK47	Board Member	5	09/29/2014	I have visited in many of the International locations where this organization has project work, and find the work inspiring and truly sustainable.  Teaching people to truly help themselves by working together with their neighbor to identify and solve their community issues means improving their life situations.
Outreach International	217418		/users/profile/280944	Elaine39	Donor	5	09/25/2014	I have enjoyed giving to Outreach over the years because of their long-term commitment to communities. They help people help themselves with projects that the communities themselves get to help choose. Some choose farming, and Outreach teaches them sustainable techniques and provides everything they need to get started, then continues to help and monitor until the community becomes self-sufficient. I cannot think of a better way to reach out to those in need.
Outreach International	210153		/users/profile/272898	Ramona S.	Donor	5	08/11/2014	I have been donating to Outreach for many years.  Their philosophy of helping people help themselves has intrigued me from the start.  I made a visit to Zambia with Outreach and saw the work they do first hand.  I donate to other organizations, but none can compare with Outreach and I donate to them on a regular basis.
Outreach International	205160	1	/users/profile/267263	barlou	Donor	5	07/04/2014	I have recently returned from an Outreach International sponsored site visit to Malawi where we visited seven villages to see the work the people are doing to improve their lives. Members of the village committees who were running the projects reported to us on how life was before the Outreach International facilitator began working with them, how it is now, and how they hope it will be in the future. You should have seen the look of pride on their faces. Several of the leaders were women. I was extremely impressed with the four Human Development Facilitators I met who work with the people in these very poor outlying villages and live in the same area of  Malawi. In a country that appears hopeless, these people have hope because of Outreach International. 
Outreach International	204652	1	/users/profile/266686	kjaycolumbus	Donor	5	06/30/2014	WOW.  I can't tell you how much the process that Outreach International employs empowers the poor to help themselves make changes in their lives and the life of their communities.  I just returned from a trip to Malawi, where Outreach is assisting the poorest of the poor villages to learn the skills and take the steps to learn communal decision; setting goals and prioritizing,,,,and learning how to submit proposals to many NGOs as well as their own govenment (when applicable).  And the process is SO empowering for the women.  The difference in the pride and joy and forward looking spirit in the villages where Outreach has been for 10 years, vs 3 years, vs a new village is amazing.  The "soft skills" of the in country, local Outreach staff are phenominal.  
Outreach International	186076		/users/profile/179838	Carolyn O	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Outreach International is an organization that really makes a difference in the lives of those who live in poverty.   On a site visit to Nicaragua, we could see first-hand how people work together to meet community needs.     I will continue to support Outreach International through personal donations and through the group efforts at our church.
Outreach International	134069		/users/profile/179838	Carolyn O	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	On a site visit to Nicaragua, I was able to see first hand how the sustainable aspect of Outreach International has made a very positive impact on the lives of people in the communities where it has a presence.   The people in these communities are guided to decide for themselves what it is that they need to improve their quality of life.      By working together, so much has been achieved.     
Outreach International	185913	1	/users/profile/242883	DSadler	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	I was fortunate enough to work for Outreach for a few years, and was overwhelmed by how much good work so few employees accomplish around the world. It was amazing to watch their energy, dedication, and professional skill. During summer and winter terms, college students compete to intern at Outreach, to travel to places where they can learn about authentic participation, to teach the next generation about poverty that can be overcome, and to create new resources that appeal to all ages. Elderly volunteers are regular as clockwork, filling the back offices with laughter and long hours, preparing mailings and special products. Since working at Outreach, I have used Outreach's children's program and catalog to teach large groups of kids from around the country about Outreach's message of making a difference by partnering with others to make sustainable change. Children are easily engaged in this message and purpose using Outreach's well-designed resources, Shop, and Catalog. 
Outreach International	183792		/users/profile/240707	drsue3	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I've been a donor to this organization for over 30 years. They are one of the first nonprofits that I know of that based their mission on sustainability. Their mission is to develop long-term, sustainable programs based on the needs identified by members of the community in which they are working. They work very hard to keep their administrative costs low so that most donations go to their programs and not overhead. I will continue to be a monthly donor and have included them in my will at my death.
Outreach International	183788		/users/profile/240702	Terry44	Donor	5	10/28/2013	Great organization that uses the resources effectively.
Outreach International	183593	1	/users/profile/240490	Glenn7	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I'm a small donor and I've donated to hundreds of different charities over the years. Outreach International is at the very top of my list. Number One. My reason for this stems from the development philosophy that this organization pursues. There are many excellent organizations that provide emergency aid, but Outreach International focuses on fixing the underlying problems through an approach that is often summarized in the phrase "Sustainable Good." I truly believe that a donation to Outreach International has a multiplier effect because it doesn't just save a life in an emergency, my donation supports an effort that will invest in development efforts guided by a  Participatory Human Development Process (PHDP) that is sustainable and will save lives over and over again. You can read more about  it here: http://outreach-international.org/about-us/our-approach/our-method/

Outreach International	180126		/users/profile/236782	The hawsome	Donor	5	10/20/2013	Outreach international is a great program that actualy helps people forever. I like the fact that they dont give the people things but actualy teach them. I think that is a wonderful idea and is a great non-profit program. I heard a saying that goes like this: "If you give a man a fish he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a life time." Outreach international is a great place where they really help people for a lifetime.
Outreach International	180124		/users/profile/236780	cody5555555	Donor	5	10/20/2013	At my church the youth(4 of us) choose to do a fundraiser for Outreach International. In the magazine they had a packet of items that we could purchase and send over to third world countries. We picked items like water sanitation kit, shots and other medication, eye exams, chickens, shoes, and other stuff along those lines. I like Outreach International because they help people rather than just giving them food. they might teach someone how to build a house instead of building a house for them. They have the mentality of "Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day, give a man a pole and he eat for the rest of his life."  I think that is a better mentality then to just give people food or shelter.
Outreach International	139762		/users/profile/185892	kape	Client Served	4	11/15/2012	As Human Development Facilitator in Zambia, assigned to Muchinshi community in particular, and having been part of the groundbreaking work in Muchinshi for the past 11 months, I have interacted with many families whose lives are being changed by the Participatory Human Development Process. Their stories include Florence Sanenes, whose 3-year old son Richard Kababas life was changed from an almost disabled to a playful little boy through a locally managed feeding program. Severely malnourished and lacking strength, Richard was unable to walk despite his age. When a community group facilitated by Outreach International decided to start a feeding program for severely malnourished children using locally available legumes and cereal grains mixed into a super flour called Chimamu in the local language, Florence joined in with four other mothers, seeing a ray of hope for her sons growth. Little did she know that it was going to dramatically change both her and her sons life and in a short period of time.  After only 3 months of being on the regimen, i.e., 4 feedings per week using the super flour as a supplement to family meals, much to the astonishment of everyone involved, Richard, whose starting weight was 9.500 Kg, was able to gain 1.400 Kg,  to gain strength and to start walking. The feeding program started on June 7, 2012 and on August 12, 2012 Richard made his very first steps and has been improving steadily since. Florence said, the condition of this child was a source of concern for me and his father Dickson. We suspected it could have something to do with our poor living conditions, especially feeding but there was little we could do to improve it. So, when Richard was selected together with 4 other children to be the first on the feeding program, we accepted and supported it. We could have felt embarrassed but the facilitator was there to help, not to embarrass us. He led our community to look objectively at our situation, analyze our most critical needs and identify workable solutions. He further motivated us to start doing things for ourselves as we planned. I become involved with the other ladies in the feeding program while my husband joined the vegetable growers group. We are active in both the farmland ownership and the clean water committees. Today, Richard is walking just as any other child, and I am hopeful that he is going to catch up with his age mates. This feeding program is a road to total recovery. Yet we use just corn, rice, beans and sometimes soya beans all locally available and even grown in our gardens. Just the mixing of the formula taught to us by Outreach International made the difference. We are looking forward to making the formula available to more kids in Muchinshi. 
Outreach International	139659		/users/profile/185778	Lunda kine kinda	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	As  one of the Human Development Facilitator based in Lubumbashi, DR Congo and assigned to the wide community of Kalebuka in the rural Southeast part of the city of Lubumbashi, I have the privilege of seeing first hand peoples lives transformed by the Participatory Human Development Process. You should see how proud they are to share their stories with visitors. Amongst them, maybe Phiri and Boni had the most tremendous change of their lives. Both are active members of local groups we organized in Kalebuka I and Kalebuka II. They are married and fathers of 7 and 5 children respectively. None completed his primary education.     Here is what Phiri said recently:   "Initially, when we started to get involved with Outreach Internationals program, I thought that was as always, but things began to take shape for my life." Working on the project of clean water supply as a community, I had the opportunity to be trained in the repair of hand pumps with my friend Boni. I am now a craftsman repairer, with a certificate that proves that I can repair the hand pumps. At least Outreach International with its program gave me the opportunity to have qualifications. I was a mere hunter and casual farmer.  Apart from the three hand pumps we receive from Outreach International that we maintain regularly, we receive more and more demands in addition, to repair many other hand pumps in our community and even in neighboring communities. I have started to feel that I am also being appreciated and valued as a worthy person, as compared to the time when I was without qualification. These people (Outreach International) came to help me develop; today I am also proud to help my community by repairing their hand pumps and by training others in the repair of pump. It is in this way that I participate also in the supply of clean drinking water to my community. Our training allowed us to have very good tools kits for the repair that many do not have.   Outreach International helped the two of us to have qualifications, with the possibility of getting employment in drilling companies. Lunda    
Outreach International	138627		/users/profile/184704	Jon H.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Outreach International is a unique nonprofit.  Rather than being a "handout" organization, it is a "hand up."  Outreach's philosophy is one about empowering people and communities to have skills that are self-sustaining, rather than being dependent on others for your livelihood.  It is through their approach of helping members of these communities discern what they need and finding their own solutions that lives are truly changed.  I can think of no other organization that has had the kind of impact on me that Outreach has.  It has been an honor to be a part of such a powerful, life changing organization.
Outreach International	138457		/users/profile/184525	Hulda A Steele	Donor	5	11/13/2012	At the birth of my first child I felt so fortunate--she was perfect and we were able to provide for all her needs.  I became accutely aware of the plight of children in other countries whose parents were not able to provide the basic necessities such as clean water, food, shelter, clothing or education.  I checked into many charities at that time and did not feel that their funds were used wisely or that their methods of addressing problems would really solve the problems.  Years later we heard about Outreach International.  Wow!, their pie chart of how donations are used is to us a wise distribution of funds.  And their approach -- Participatory Human Development -- hits the bullseye!  Those in need are very much involved in identifying their need/problem.  They participate in the plan and they enthusiastically work the plan.  And then, many times, they teach neighboring villages how to do the same.  Danny and I give joyfully to Outreach International every month.  They keep us informed about and involved in their (OUR) projects!  
Outreach International	137416	1	/users/profile/183397	Dominicsk	Client Served	5	11/12/2012	As Country Coordinator for the field program in Zambia, and having been in the field for the past 16 years, I have worked with many families in several villages of the Luapula and the Copperbelt Provinces of Zambia whose lives have been changed by the Participatory Human Development Process.Their stories include John Mashilipa s from the Luano community in Chingola, Copperbelt Province, who was able to change his life from a desperate jobless poor and food beggar to a net food producer and market gardener/ vegetable supplier and says that: I had no employment and no way to support my family. There were many days that we went without any food at all. When Outreach International began working in our community, I quickly saw that this was something I wanted to be part of to be able to help my family and myself out of our desperate situation. It was suggested that we who were out of work could farm the land around our community. Outreach International helped me negotiate a fair price and loan rate for farmland, farming tools and good quality seeds. They showed us how to use chicken manure to fertilize the soil and helped me develop simple irrigation techniques. Today, I grow enough vegetables and corn to sell some at the local market. I even supply some schools with food for their lunch programs. At the market, many people prefer organic vegetables. So, I can charge a little more.I have managed to save US$350.00 and even have my own bank account, for the first time in my life! Outreach International has made all the difference. I have been able to pull myself and my family out of poverty. We enjoy three nutritious meals every day, and our children are less vulnerable to illness. They are much healthier. I have repaid my loans, but thats not all. I have built three homes for my extended family. I am also sending the youngest members of my family to school as I am now able to pay for their school fees.
Outreach International	137137	1	/users/profile/183096	JoyceB	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	I started working with an Outreach International site 16 years ago and continue to this day. From that point I have been committed to Outreach International and the work they do.  We took 11 Jr. High youth to work in a community with families living in poverty and afraid of outsiders coming in yet all of these years later their lives have improved and we are welcomed with open arms. I have seen the changes the trip has made with the kids that go and serve. I have also seen the changes that have taken place in the lives of the families we have worked with. One of the comments made by one of the adults will always stay with me. "If these kids can accomplish this much work in a few days think how much we (community) can do for ourselves." We have tried to be an example to the community of what it means to work together to improve our lives through hard work and striving to build relationships with people that are different than ourselves. One of the biggest lessons the kids walk away with is that the families are really no different than theirs. We all desire to be safe, fed, have shelters over our heads, receive an education and most importantly know that others care. There is a ripple affect that takes place when we leave. The communities work together to improve their lives and our kids come home with a new perspective of what it means to live in poverty and how to serve others. 
Outreach International	136053		/users/profile/181957	StephenJY	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	My relationship with Outreach International has literally changed my life. Traveling with Outreach International to Nicaragua during college and seeing their on-the-ground work first-hand had a tremendous influence in leading me to change majors and study nonprofit management. I have worked with Outreach International in many capacities. I am also a monthly donor to this wonderful organization because I believe so strongly in the work that they do. 
Outreach International	135942		/users/profile/181841	vivianlynn	Donor	5	11/08/2012	I have been interested in OI for many years but recently I have realised more and more how the work they are doing is making such a difference in so many of the lives of the worlds poor, not just providing help but teaching them how to help themselves long term.   You find out so much through Facebook, their website and the blogs that are written regularly and where the money you give is being used.  Well done OI
Outreach International	135905		/users/profile/181800	Kathy83	Donor	5	11/08/2012	I am very proud to have been associated with Outreach International since its beginning in 1979, and privileged to serve on the Board of Directors, back during the 70's and 80's.  Over all of that time, Outreach has focused on working with impoverished persons around the world... providing the support and training  of the people to empower themselves to bring about positive and sustainable change in their lives.  When I was the President of the Board, I was very fortunate  to travel to the Philippines twice to visit and live among the people in rural villages.  The first time I went, a group of villagers were just beginning to meet together with an Outreach worker to identify their priority life concerns.  The Outreach worker functioned as an active facilitator, encouraging the input of the people.  Three years later, I returned to the same village - and saw the results of the people's work: there were now village leaders (leading the meetings and their daily efforts), they had worked together to increase their livelihood, were close to assuring a close-by source of fresh drinking water, and had a meeting planned with local government officials to resolve land ownership issues.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE YOU COULD SEE IN THE PEOPLE!  They were taking the leadership in their lives, making noted improvements, and very proud of what they had and could achieve.  THIS is what Outreach achieves through a "participatory human development" process and what they mean by sustainable results!  30 years later Outreach is working with people in 13 countries and continuing to support those earlier villages.  I will continue to be a supporter and donor to Outreach International - they have proven that they can achieve long-term people-changing and sustainable results! Kathy Robinson
Outreach International	135167		/users/profile/181032	randallepratt	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	I have seen first hand (two trips to Nicaragua) how Outreach International has been able to organize and empower villages to address their own needs to lift themselves out of poverty.  This is the "Participatory Human Development Process" that has been used by Outreach International for more than 30 years. Rather than hand-outs that result in dependency, Outreach International typically sends one field staff member to a village to help them realize their own abilities and power.  This results in "sustainable good", as the change comes from within the village.   It is a cost-effective and long-term way to alleviate poverty.
Outreach International	134707		/users/profile/180586	KathyMc	Donor	5	11/07/2012	I have known about Outreach International for many years but only during the last three years have I become a committed donor and supporter of this incredible organization.  Reading about their philosophy and success inspired me to go on a "site visit" to see firsthand the way Outreach International works with poverty.  Many of my stereotypes about "people in poverty" were challenged as I visited villages in Malawi where the villagers, themselves, were allowed to define their situations and solve problems.  Experts from "the outside" were not telling the villagers what they needed or who was going to lead.  The people were empowered!  Women began to be seen as legitimate, strong, creative, dedicated problem solvers when allowed to work side by side with village elders.  I saw villagers who created feeding programs for their children, built a pre-school and used local women to teach the young children, planted acacia trees to provide firewood and a cash crop, and even created a drip irrigation system to enable citrus trees to be grown to provide Vitamin C to the children.   I came home proud to say that my contributions were being used so effectively to make a difference in the lives of the warm and friendly people of Malawi.  
Outreach International	134385		/users/profile/180216	MarneB	Donor	5	11/06/2012	A year and a half ago I was able to go with Outreach International to see the work being done in Malawi, Africa.  (No organization funds were used to pay for this trip.)  I was amazed to see the results of the work being initiated by OI facilitators in the villages we visited.  The improved state and increased role of women in the villages were impressive.  The many agricultural, educational, and social programs generated by the villagers, facilitated by OI, and run by the village members were excellent examples of the work of OI and its "sustainable development."  
Outreach International	134379		/users/profile/180210	Terry30	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I am fortunate to have seen the work of Outreach International firsthand. In its early days, I witnessed both a community well project in the remote areas of Haiti and a nutrition and agricultural center in action in the rural Philippines. As part of a film crew, we captured the process of a Haitian village, led by one of its own members, organize and complete - with some technical assistance - a project that positively transformed both the physical and economic health of that community and the surrounding area who would be able to use potable water for the first time. I know that there are thousands of such stories that have occurred through the last nearly forty years. What's more, my daughter now works for this wonderful organization, helping add to the stories of participatory community and human development.
Outreach International	134239		/users/profile/180025	getowers	Donor	5	11/06/2012	My husband and I have been donors to OUTREACH INTERNATIONAL for many years and have been touched by the way OI helps those who are in need.  We appreciate the "give a man a fish and he is fed for a day, teach him to fish and he then can take care of himself (and his family)" philosophy.  It is good to know that more of each dollar we donate is used for the benefit of others rather than overhead expenses.  As friends and relatives have passed on, we have taken to donating to OI in their memory, rather than sending flowers that die quickly.  OUTREACH is what a charitable organization should be and we shall continue to donate to this wonderful organization.     Ed & Georgia
Outreach International	134231		/users/profile/180017	MamaKatie	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I support Outreach International because I believe in their mission to help folks around the world by investing in their communities to create "sustainable solutions and long-lasting change". I am confident that the money I give each month is put toward bringing sustainable good to the impoverished communities OI serves.
Outreach International	134202	1	/users/profile/179984	G Scott Lacy	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I have had a relationship with OUTREACH INTERNATIONAL since I was a teenager.  I was given a $5 bill to take and multiply to help raise money for OI.  I promptly took the $5 and put it in a drawer for about two years.   Then something happened.  I started really paying attention to what OI does as an organization.  I decided the best way to raise money for OI was to perform.  It's what I do.  It's who I am.  So, I organized a benefit concert.  20 years has past since that first concert and I am still in relationship with this AMAZING organization.  Here is what impresses me most.  They don't simply drop the things that people need to them.  They go.  They teach.  They live.  It's called SUSTAINABLE GOOD.  They leave behind the tools that the people and communities need to succeed and continue long after OI's time there.  They literally are changing the world and people's lives for the better.  It's not just about being charitable.  It's about giving and teaching and leaving HOPE for the people they touch.  I have raised money for many charities during my professional career as a performer and musical director.  NONE compare to the work and passion that is OUTREACH INTERNATIONAL.  They are MY charity.  They are MY HOPE for this world.  They are SUSTAINABLE GOOD.
Outreach International	134053		/users/profile/179822	Jeff R.	Donor	5	11/06/2012	Outreach International's focus on sustainability, their commitment to accountability and their ability to attract and retain talented and highly effective staff and volunteers assures us that our support is with the right organization.  We know the impact of each dollar donated lasts for generations as witnessed through projects we have supported and personal testimonies of site-visit volunteers.
Outreach International	134025	1	/users/profile/179793	Robin Cross	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2012	I have worked with Outreach International in Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 2010.It is in this collaboration at the tough, sharp end of disaster recovery and reconstruction that I have come to value the work of Outreach International. Outreach International are acutely aware of the need to strike the right balance between providing important aid to those in need and building a communitys long term capacity to support themselves. It is this long term capacity building approach to international development that delivers sustainable good. And it is through this strategically smart work that we can all help communities build a strong future, a future free from dependence on outside support. By combining the strongest ethical values with the highest levels of professionalism Outreach International delivers powerful results for their beneficiaries and donors. I have been privileged to work with OI over the last 2 years and I intend to continue supporting their work long into the future.
Outreach International	134023		/users/profile/179791	scruffysaint	Donor	5	11/06/2012	Over the years, I've had the opportunity of seeing several charities working in areas of poverty but none have impressed me as much as Outreach International. I truly believe that their approach is unique. Many organizations are happy to simply provide short-term handouts which I know from experience has few sustainable benefits. Outreach International on the other hand works very closely with the community, helping them identify their core issues and then works as a facilitator to assist them in overcoming these issues. I have seen with my own eyes how community members have become empowered to make permanent changes to their situation. The process takes a while but the long term benefits are astonishing. I am now an avid supporter of this charity and will continue to donate to this worthy cause in the future.
Outreach International	133896		/users/profile/179658	jekrueger	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	I've been associated with Outreach International for over 30 years.  I've taken site visits to Haiti, Philippines, and Nicaragua and seen the work being done by the field staff, known as Human Development Facilitators.  They are local nationals who learn about the process known as Participatory Human Development Process.  Couldn't be prouder of the great work to help the poor help themselves, by learning how to work together in communities and speaking up on their consensus issues.  The headquarters staff are the best group and dedicated to making sure every dollar possible goes to the work in the field locations.
Outreach International	133876	1	/users/profile/179637	Robert66	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	Of the nonprofit and charitable organizations that I have been affiliated with I am the most impressed by the management and professionalism of OI. We have been long-time donors/supporters and have been on three of their site visits.  The model and process that they use for their sites seems to work very well with having only local staff working in  the communities. The presentations that are given by the people involved in the efforts are very impressive and want to make you want to be more involved.  We are looking forward to the next site visit.

I recently attended the clothing drive with a student with special needs.  The volunteers there were so kind and helpful.  It required some waiting and patience on our part to help him understand what he needed to and make his own choices, and these ladies did exactly that.  This organization focuses on the students, makes them feel special, and empowers them.  I am so impressed and pleased with what they do.

Assistance League of Kansas City	272373	3	/users/profile/361404	Writer	Client Served	5	11/18/2015	I just want to tell you how grateful I am for AL of KC. In 2009, the rug was pulled out from underneath my husband and I when we were both laid off. I was out of work for almost 2 years, my husband for one of those years. We had two young children in Platte R-3 schools. If it weren't for the councilor referring us to AL and Operation School Bell, our children wouldn't have had warm, fitting coats and hats during those cold winters. While our family continues to struggle, (my husband was never able to fully recover with a full time job, and I now work in non for profit, which pays low wages) we are so blessed and grateful for organizations like the Assistance League of KC for all they did for us during our walk through the desert. Thank you to Assistance League for your kind and generous support and thank you to the people who support you and your efforts. It makes a huge difference for those suffering through no fault of their own. God's blessings to you all!

Each year we clothe over 2500 children K-8.  As a former educator, I know that having new and more trendy clothing really increases the self esteem of school children.  Clothing children is only one of the 10 philanthropic programs our chapter sponsors.  I'm thrilled to be a part of this group that works actively to meet the unmet needs of our neighbors in the area.

Assistance League of Kansas City	245047	2	/users/profile/332142	es9615	Volunteer	5	06/11/2015	I have been a member of the teen auxiliary, Assisteens, for the past four years and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The group completes a variety of community service projects in the area, which can be very useful when obtaining community service hours for school requirements. In addition, being a member of the group can be as small or as big of a commitment as the member wants, which works well with teens' busy schedules. The group typically meets or completes an activity once a month, and all events are optional. By contrast, members can take on a larger commitment by taking on a leadership role in the organization. As a member of this organization, I was able to serve in two different leadership roles, allowing me to see how an executive board works to run an organization. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to work with students from a variety of schools and age groups around the Kansas City area, as this allowed me to meet new people from a variety of backgrounds. Most importantly, though, the variety of community service projects we performed developed in me a passion for serving others, which is why I am now considering a career in non-profit management as an adult. I highly recommend this group for any 7th-12th grader in the Kansas City area interested in serving the community.

Both girls received the I'm In Charge booklet distributed by Assistance League of Kansas City. What a great tool to help assist children who need to be home alone. My second grade granddaughter was so excited to share her booklet with her mom and I as soon as she got off the bus, "Look, this book shows kids like us how to take care of ourselves if we are home alone or see a stranger. It's really great to know what to do". Thank you Assistance League of Kansas City for developing such a helpful, informative booklet for school age children.
Assistance League of Kansas City	242978	2	/users/profile/329593	rach700	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/14/2015	I am a school social worker a Kansas City metro area High School. You just can't possibly imagine how much we appreciate all the joy and hope that a clothing voucher for prom shoes and new clothing that ALKC provides  bring to families and students! ALKC was working with the social worker at the middle school  with a family of 4.  The high school student, who I work with, is 20 years old and in special services.  He is graduating this year!!!  I know he was not going to qualify for the clothing voucher.   I had already talked to him about that. and was trying to find graduation clothing in the clothes he already owned.  Earlier he had told me that Grandma was going to buy him a graduation outfit when she got back in town.  She is an over the road truck driver.  Well, then later, I asked again, and he said that her trip was extended and she wouldn't be back until the day before graduation.  Broken promises and disappointments are commonplace with some families. So, my next plan was trying to find graduation clothing in the clothes he already owned. He said he had a pair of dress pants, but he needed to sew the button back on.  He just asked for black thread.  I was thinking that I would wash and iron his shirt and pants. Then the other social worker gave me the incredible news that ALKC staff made the decision to provide a voucher for him as well!  WOW!   I just want everyone to know how much basic needs  and other things that the ALKC provides  touches the lives of children.  These kind of things make a difference and give them hope for the future!  Thank you!
Assistance League of Kansas City	238541		/users/profile/323861	Crystal 86	Advisor	5	02/25/2015	A few weeks ago, I met with a mother of 4 kids, to help her with budgeting and credit counseling.  As I got to know her financial situation, she expressed frustration at the overwhelming cost to keep up with school uniforms for her kids.  They had already outgrown the uniforms she bought them within the first couple months of the new school year!   To top it off, her daughter's winter coat was taken from her school locker, and the zipper of her youngest son's coat broke. So they were both wearing coats that weren't a proper fit for them.  I reached out to the Assistance League of Kansas City, and through a partnership with Burlington Coat Factory,  they provided this family with vouchers for 2 shirts, 2 pants, and a winter coat for EACH OF THE FOUR KIDS!!!  I'm just so thrilled that I was able to find such a wonderful organization to provide much needed help!!  
Assistance League of Kansas City	235707		/users/profile/319381	LKD24	General Member of the Public	5	12/19/2014	I am a volunteer at Lewis & Clark Elementary in Liberty. Recently, I took a second grader into the hall to read a story with me.  But before she would read, she said she wanted to tell me something. She proceeded to tell me about her exciting morning spent at Operation School Bell.  And she said, "I got to pick out things all by myself, and it was BETTER than Christmas"!  I found out later from her teacher  that she had shared her experience with her entire class with the same enthusiasm that she'd expressed to me.  I realize that the material things given to this child were certainly important to her. But more impressive was what the Operation School Bell ladies had instilled in her. She was so proud and felt so special in how she was treated.  I believe these ladies showed her respect and caring, and she left feeling like a very proud and important little girl. How great is that!   My thanks and admiration to each of you at Operation School Bell for not only WHAT you do for kids, but also HOW you do it. Congratulations on a job well done! Linda Daniels

I said hi to one of the children and ask them if they were getting new shoes and 3 little girls said yes we just went to a place where we got to pick out brand new clothes and now we are picking out our own shoes and they had such big smiles on their faces.  I whispered to my husband while we were in the store and said they have just been to OSB.  I am part of this organization and always feel rewarded when working at OSB, but it was even a greater experience listening to all the happy children talking to the adults about their new clothes and shoes.

Each child's face lights up when their name is called to walk into the "shopping area" and choose their own clothes. The Children leave there not only with the generosity of Operation School Bell but with pride and happiness. In the days that follow their trip to Operation School Bell, you see the pride on their faces as they show off their new outfits. So happy and big smiles! Thank you for this wonderful program and the needs that in fills in these children's lives.

Assistance League of Kansas City	217669		/users/profile/281205	Writer54	Client Served	5	09/26/2014	As great as it is to take our students to Operation School Bell, I think I like the day after the best.  Many, if not all, of our students come to school dressed in their new clothes and shoes and cant wait to show them off.  A few minutes ago, one girl came in my office to show me her new shoes, jeans, and shirt.  I honestly think she looks the best I have seen her since last winter.  She was so proud of her new things, as well as happy and excited to talk about them. From the "personal shopper" volunteers to the racks and racks of in-style clothing, it's clear that the Assistance League of Kansas City knows how to run a huge program smoothly, treat people with dignity, and provide a valuable service to kindergarten through fifth grade students. Thanks to all the wonderful people who make Operation School Bell possible for our kids!

The initials CAC were used instead of AL of Kansas City. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  The Assistance League of Kansas City offered to donate $500 to our school based program to purchase uniforms for families that do not have the money to get their child a uniform. Below is the response from the gentlemen that went with the volunteer to purchase the uniforms. We are truly grateful for their generosity.  "AL of Kansas City was very eager to help with as many uniforms as they were allowed to. We were at the register and the balance was like $430.00 and I was actually satisfied with the amount of uniforms we had, but Etta mae insisted we reach the whole $500.00 that was alloted to us. Etta mae insisted I go back and get more until we reached our limit. While shopping Etta mae and I spoke about our school district and I could tell that her organization really cared about our students and that community as a whole. I expressed to Etta several times how grateful spofford & Hickman were to be receiving such a generous donation, and we would have been grateful weather we received 20 uniforms or only 2."

I have donated to Operation School Bell over the past few years, but never had a chance to see the facility in person.  Recently, however, I got a tour of Operation School Bell along with a description of each child's experience.  It is so wonderful!  The clothes are all new, organized, neatly and creatively displayed, and it's all done with love and care.  I then did some shopping at the Re-Sale Shop.  I, again, was witness to the hard work done by so many dedicated volunteers.  The Shop is well organized and run with grace and respect for all who enter.

They have come through for families time and time again. Assistance League of Kansas City provided 9 families that I am working with school supplies for the upcoming school year, without this support those children would have started school without the supplies that they need. This service allows the children to go to school with the same supplies as the other children and feel like part of the group.  They also provided two sets of grandparents clothes for their grandchildren who they took in on an emergency basis with nothing other than what the children had on. In times of crisis when families do not know who to turn to they are there and they respond quickly so the family knows that they are not just another number. The Assistance League of Kansas City provided a family that was evicted from their home with little notice clothing vouchers so the children would have clothes for the upcoming school year, the children were so very excited to get to pick out clothes and it was an absolute blessing how quickly they received the vouchers. The agency went above and beyond with another family to provide a bed for a special needs youth. The community is definitely benefited by the work of this agency.

We have utilized their services through "Operation School Bell" and through the "I'm In Charge Program".  Both programs have enriched the lives of our children!  Through Operation School Bell, many of our children are able to receive much needed clothing and toiletry items.  The kindness of the volunteers and the attention that they give each individual child, make the children feel like a "million bucks" when they are there.  Our children are very excited to have the opportunity to "experience" having a "personal shopper" assisting them while they are shopping for much needed clothing items!  In addition to Operation School Bell, our school has utilized the "I'm In Charge Program".  Our students enjoy receiving the donated workbooks that accompany the video about safety.  The children feel that they are receiving a "special gift" when they are told that they may KEEP their workbooks!  They are very excited to do the activities within the workbook and enjoy referring to the pages as they learn important safety tips being taught.  This organization is wonderful!  I would recommend its programs to any elementary school!!! 
Assistance League of Kansas City	198010	1	/users/profile/258695	julesg	Client Served	5	04/16/2014	What are great organization that so benefited and helped our community! I am a school counselor at Heritage Middle School in Liberty, MO and this program served many of my students and their families who needed help. It was wonderful to see and hear the gratitude from the parents and the students who were offered the opportunity of purchasing clothing this winter. The volunteers at the Assistance League of Kansas City were so very accommodating and professional. A family from my school was unable to attend either of the two designated shopping nights due to the death of a parent. The volunteers, upon hearing of the circumstances, contacted me and worked closely with myself and the family to find a separate day and time that was convenient for them to meet at the store! The generous volunteers did not want this family to miss out on such a beneficial opportunity. The shopping experience ended up being very uplifting for the family even though they going thru such a difficult time! I was appreciative and overjoyed to see the kindness and compassion of this organization! I am very excited to work with them in the future.

I have used the I'm In Charge program with students and it is a great way to approach potentially uncomfortable topics with kids!  The video is well done and the kids LOVE the booklets!  It does a great job of bridging the gap between home and school as safety is one of those issues we as adults often assume someone else is talking with kids about.  Thanks so the Assistance League of Kansas City, schools can do their part in helping to keep our children safe!
Assistance League of Kansas City	197401	1	/users/profile/258058	dukem	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/10/2014	This dynamic organization fills unmet local needs efficiently and with impressive kindness.  Over my 20 years as an elementary school counselor I've watched The Assistance League of Kansas City expand and improve their school clothing program (Operation School Bell) both in quality of clothing and in number of children served.  A quick scan of their website will tell you that OSB is one of their many valuable services.  What the site may not communicate is the impact their work has on vulnerable individuals.  Imagine a kindergarten child who rarely speaks coming to school the morning after a trip to OSB sporting new clothes and stopping along the way to his classroom to poise and say, "Ta-dah!"  Picture precious children dressing up in their best clothes for a much-awaited trip to select the only new clothes they will get.  Along with the tangible gifts the students enjoy the excitement of "shopping" in what looks like a real store, not a thrift shop.  Perhaps most impressive is the kindness and dignity the volunteers offer the students.  For many of us who regularly shop in retail stores it is difficult to understand the impact OSB has on students.  But it is not difficult to help make the experience happen.

No matter what I have asked from them to help my families I have never been turned down. It is so nice when the families are so grateful for everything we do for them and I can only tell them that it was with the help from the Assistance League that made it all possible.

Assistance League of Kansas City	191207	1	/users/profile/249598	CHarkins	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/18/2013	I'm an elementary school counselor and have had the opportunity to take many of "my kids"  shopping with the wonderful ladies that run our Assistance League or Operation School Bell as we call it.  Today one of my older student reminded me why what they do is so powerful and has such deep meaning.  My "little guy" came out of the shopping area, and stopped in the doorway and said "That was the best experience I've ever had!" This very private, proud "little" boy of 10 said this so honestly and with complete awe on his face, his eyes were shining with (I am pretty sure he had tears in his eyes) joy.    Another thing many of the children mentioned was that this was the first time most of them had ever had the opportunity to pick out their own clothes.
Assistance League of Kansas City	188997	1	/users/profile/246683	ClayCountyCD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/21/2013	I work for the Children's Division in Clay County. Recently, Assistance League has really gone above and beyong to help the families I serve. This week, they provided a pack in play for a child that has medical diagnosis and did not have a bed to sleep in. This child will greatly benefit as she will have her own bed and place to sleep as oppose to sleeping with others.  AL was also able to provide glasses for a child that had broken his and the family could not afford new ones. This child is legal blind in one eye so this child will benefit academically as he can now read the board at school and better participate. AL provided bedding and clothing for 3 children of a family I recently worked with that was previously homeless and had lost all their belongings. The children were over joyed that they were able to get new coats and clothes and it was heartwarming to watch. They mentioned it being "like Christmas." AL will always find a way to reach out to a child in need. AL also makes special trips to community agencies to make them aware of their program and share the love they have in helping children. I feel honored and lucky to have such a great organization to work with.

This is a huge help to moms fleeing abuse who typically come to shelter with close to nothing but what they are wearing. School time clothes shopping is not an option for most moms in shelter.

Our shelter provides a safe place for children to go when they are in crisis.  The children are often scared and have recently experience a traumatic event. We try to make the children feel more comfortable by having friendly bedrooms for them to stay in, with an Assistance League teddy bear placed next to their pillow. This may be the first object a child reaches for when they enter their new bedroom.  We often see children holding their bears tightly, thankful to have something soft and comfortable to call their own.

I was approached two years ago to participate in a pilot program to assist college students in need of a professional wardrobe, which is now named "The Best Foot Forward Program".

The students served are now able present themselves in a professional manner.  However, it is not just the clothing, but the advice, support and kindness that the students have received by the Personal Shoppers that makes this program so exceptional.

Assistance League of Kansas City	148686	1	/users/profile/198061	Adv1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/30/2013	I work at Metropolitan Organization To Counter Sexual Assault (MOCSA), the rape crisis center for the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  MOCSA staff we were talking about hospital advocacy with victims of sexual assault and the Assault Survivor Kits provided by the Assistance League of Kansas City came up in the conversation.  Its really difficult to convey to the Assistance League just how much those kits means to the victims we see at the hospital.  Many times the victim comes in with nothing but the clothes on their back.  And then even that is taken from them for evidence leaving them wondering what in the world they will wear when leaving the hospital.  Sometimes its the first set of fresh clothes the victim has had in days.  Some dont own a toothbrush and they are so happy to brush their teeth.  The Kits are really a tangible piece of evidence that someone cares about them.  Thank you, Assistance League of Kansas City! 
Assistance League of Kansas City	117281		/users/profile/159495	Tammy20	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/29/2012	Dear Friends, I am a school social worker and I have had the privilege of working with the Assistance League for almost 10 years. They have truly gone above and beyond to help the economically disadvantaged children and families in the Kansas City area. They provide clothing (2-3 full outfits, socks & underwear, toiletries, coats, hats & gloves and shoe vouchers and free books. Not only have they helped elementary students, but based on our requests, they have started offering assistance to middle school students and also pre-K students. This has been extremely helpful as it seems needs increase even more as the students go onto to middle school. They have always been accommodating. We had several disabled children who needed assistance and we were not able to transport them to the AL, so AL brought the clothes to the students. It was awesome! Anytime I call them and ask for another spot or ask them to help another family, they are there for us! I have never been turned down when asking for assistance. In addition to clothing assistance, they provided a much needed fund to help pay for a variety of things including; prescription glasses, prescription medication, instrument rentals and/or other school fees that are often hard to fund for students. With several of our homeless students who don't have any money or support, the AL has been there to provide support and to also encourage positive things with the students and families. In one instance, we had a single mom who had lost her insurance. Her son required $500 in asthma medicine. The AL said to have the mom meet them at the pharmacy and they paid the entire cost. It was amazing and the mom and student were extremely grateful. In another situation, I had a graduating senior who could not afford her cap and gown, I asked and they paid for all it! An incoming kindergartner needed an epi pen at school and insurance would only pay for one, so I asked the AL if they could help and they said "Yes" with no hesitation. They do things like this everyday!!  They see a need and they do everything they can to fill it and more. We are truly grateful for their wonderful and caring staff and for all of the outstanding volunteer work they do for our community! I hope that your agency will strongly consider awarding them a grant this year! They are truly "one of a kind"!!  Sincerely, Tammy Slauson, LMSW, NKC Schools.

Working for the Children's Division I often see families that are in need of beds for the children, diapers, clothing, etc. The Assistance League has helped many families I have had on my case load. I had a family that the Assistance League helped get clothing vouchers for. The children stated that they had never owned new clothing. The clothing that they wore was either too big, too small or ripped. When this family was given the clothing vouchers they were extremely grateful and excited. I have had families where the children have never had a bed. The Assistance League has helped with this many times. The Assistance League has helped me, help people who truly need it.

The Assistance League has assisted many at risk children and families in the area by providing resources such as clothing, diapers, and household supplies for children for those in need. One family that I referred to the Assistance League was a single mother who had left a very abusive relationship. Her paramour had not allowed her to take any clothes or personal items. She and her two small children left with the clothes on their backs. The Assistance League helped this family with clothing and even delivered a bed for the family so that they would not have to sleep on the floor. Our agency has utilized the services of the Assistance League on numerous occasions and they often "fill the gap" in areas where no other service has been able to assist.

The Assistance League contiues to donate laundry detergent, socks, and feminie hygiene products through out the year.

The Assistance League plays a very important role in our work to support survivors of sexual assault since they provide us with care kits for victims at the hospital.  These Assault Survivor Kits include clothing, toiletries, and a book on healing from rape.  These items are presented to survivors when our advocates meet them at the hospital to provide support during the forensic medical exam.  This exam often requires victims to give up their clothing during the evidence collection process, so having clean, comfortable clothing and toiletries to clean up with after the exam can make a world of difference.  We are so grateful for the Assistance League and the great work that they do preparing these kits and ensuring that survivors of sexual assault in the Greater Kansas City area can feel as comfortable as possible during this difficult process.  They are such an asset to the community!  
Assistance League of Kansas City	88078	1	/users/profile/98923	Bren	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/29/2011	I have brought children to operation School Bell, a program  for disadvantaged children to choose new clothes, for many years.  This program is provided by the Assistance  League of Kansas City.  It gives these children h\the opportunity to walkback into their school wearing brand new clothes that they hve chosen.  There are so many eamples of how this experience has helped build self esteem and pridein our students.  One of my favorite, bittersweet memories was of a student who would not take the price tags off the clothes until they fell off so others would know they were new clothes.  Another student, who had a kinship with pigpen from the Peanuts cartoon was so proud of his new clothes, he insisted on wearing a new outfit back to school.  By the time we arrived back at school 15 minutes later his new clothes were already filthy but he still proudly marched up to his teacher to show off his new outfit. We never did figure out how he got so dirty in that short amunt of time, but the memory of his enthusiasm puts a smile on my face even today.  There are humdreds of children I have taken over 20 years to OSB at the Assistance League, and i still believe it is a ray of sunshine in the lives of all of these children just as I did on the very first trip.  children wil approach me i the halls fo the school asking when we get to go our our special new clothes field trip again. If ever an organization has make a profound difference in the lives of children in such a simple way, it would be this organization.  The volunteers take these children into their small clothing center and give the attention and smiles that these kids will remember for a life time.  I often have high school students pop in to say high and say, "do you remember when we went to et new clothes?"  What a gift they give. I cannot close withut giving a shout of approval out to their 'i'm in Charge" curriculum.  This is a curriculum complete with a professional quality video and enough high quality bookets forevery student in one grade level each year.  It is not ean exaggeation to say that this curriculum resource is the best discussion starter among my students about the subject of safety available.  The students literally follow me down the halls after class to discuss being oe alone safely, internet safety or a miriad of othe safety issues pertent to their lives.  The teachers get tickled watchng me looking like the Pied Piper as children tell me their stories or try to get answers to their "what if " questions or sadly tell me of dangerous situations they need help dealing with.  One 7 year old in our school went home to an empty house on a dark winter late afternoon when mom thought she was at girl scouts.  She told me when asked how she knew what to do, "I sat on my front step for a minute and cried then I remembered what you taught us bout going to my contact people for help."  She literally had to go to 3 contact people's houses before finding anyone at home, but because she had a plan she kept her cool and did it.  These are only 2 example of what this great organization does for the children of our community and surrounding communities.  They are changing lives one shirt, one safety booklet, one smile and helpful hand at a time.

The kits that they provide for sexual assault survivors who go to the hospital for evidence collection are a key piece in giving those survivors some dignity and self-respect back.  They provide over 400 of these kits a year to our organization which include new clothes, underwear, toothbushes, toothpaste, and soap.

The kids love walking back to pre-op and seeing those soft bears waiting for them.  Parents are very happy about them getting to keep them throughout there experience here.  I have had nothing but friendly, courteous communication with the volunteers.
Assistance League of Kansas City	87879		/users/profile/98683	Katie W.	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	In high school, I served as an officer in the teenage auxiliary of Assistance League of Kansas City, Assisteens.  I am now in college, but my experiences as an Assisteen member and officer taught me effective leadership styles I continue to use today and ingrained within me the importance of serving one's community.  The Assisteens service project I most enjoyed was the Senior Citizen Prom.  We filled the recreation room of a local senior center with decorations, music, dancing, and games.  We hired a professional photographer capture photos of couples and groups of friends throughout the event, and even crowned a king and queen.  The most wonderful part of the event were the comments from some residents who looked forward to the prom every year and had a lovely time.  One gentleman in particular, every year, arrived as soon as the event begun and partied until the very end.  His smile made everything the Assisteens do worthwhile.  Assisteens and Assistance League of Kansas City truly work to improve the lives of community members about them and genuinely succeed.  I was blessed to be a part of such a group.
Assistance League of Kansas City	87771		/users/profile/98535	myer86s	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/28/2011	The assistance league of KC has been a very vital organization in helping the Clay Co. Children's Division in providing pretty much anything our foster children and families have needed that there were no state funds for.  They provided one of my families who were about to lose their children to foster care due to having a cluttered, dirty house with cleaning supplies and rubber totes to store alot of their stuff.  One of the members Joy George met me and the family at Wal-Mart and was very helpful and supportive toward the family so they did not feel ashamed.  They have also provided the Children's Division with learning material such as books and DVD's to help our parent's learn positive parenting skills.  They provide Christmas to our foster children and to families in need in Clay Co.  They are a very important resource in our community.

Assistance League of Kansas City	87193		/users/profile/97811	ronda	Volunteer	5	04/26/2011	One of the many projects under the Assistance League of Kansas City is Operation School Bell.  Each year about 40 elementary students from my school district attends Operation School Bell.  During their visit to OSB, students receive new clothing and a voucher for a new pair of shoes.  For many of the students that attend, this is their first opportunity to shop, try-on, and select BRAND NEW clothing.  The volunteers that work at OSB are always patient, friendly and kind to our students.  Overall, this is a GREAT experience for our students.  This program provides so much more than just the clothing the children go home with.  It helps boost the children's self-esteem and confidence.  I send a big thank you to all of the volunteers and sponsors that keep this program running.   
Assistance League of Kansas City	87191		/users/profile/97809	rharrison	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2011	I have been involved with Operation School Bell for many years as a school social worker in a few surrounding school districts in Platte and Clay County.  Operation School Bell is amazing!!!  The children love getting to go and try on new clothes with their personal volunteer...their eyes and smiles just light up when they come back with a bag of goodies!!!  They always want to take everything out of the bag and show us all of the cool clothes they receive!  It never fails that they want to wear the new clothes back to school, but we try to encourage them to save their new clothes for the next few days of school.  When you see those kiddos walk down the halls of the school with their new clothes on...it is priceless!!!  Their self-esteem is totally positive and they are proud to look like all the other kids with cool clothes!  I get tears in my eyes every time I see one of them so happy and so proud to show me their new things!  This is an amazing opportunity for our students and we are extremely grateful to be able to participate in this outstanding program!!!  OSB rocks!!!
Assistance League of Kansas City	87123		/users/profile/97714	gcasel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	The Assistance League sponsors "Operation School Bell" which provides new clothes as well as shoe vouchers to needy elementary school students.  I have had the pleasure of accompanying students  on these trips. The volunteer staff is extremely loving and helpful.  The facility is clean, organized and well-maintained. The students are delighted to receive new clothes that fit. These typically become their favorite outfits!  The children are able to go to school feeling better about themselves.  This opportunity also builds stronger relationships between students, parents and school staff.
Assistance League of Kansas City	87083		/users/profile/97662	ncami97	Client Served	5	04/25/2011	The Assistance League of Kansas City has helped our Emergency Department by providing the  teddy bears for us to give to children who come to the ED (whether as a patient, with a parent, etc.) When the children receive these bears, their little faces just light up. I believe it helps to ease their anxiety of being in an unfamiliar place with many strangers.
Assistance League of Kansas City	86535		/users/profile/96913	annette	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	I am a volunteer with Assistance League of Kansas City.  I am amazed at the committment of the volunteers and the impact of their good work in Kansas City.  ALKC is making a difference in the lives of children and families in Kansas City through several philanthropic programs that provide new school clothing, backpacks, school supplies and other necessities for children in need, teaches practical skills to children home alone or away from home, gives teddy bears to children in hospitals, offers clothing and support to victims of sexual assault, and supports seniors in area nursing homes.   One of our largest progrms is the Operation School Bell program which provided new clothing and supplies to over 2000 needy and at-risk elemenary and middle school students in 2010.  There is nothing better than assisting these children as they choose their new clothes!  They are so excited and proud.  And studies show that these children have better behavior at school, have improved self confidence and are better integrated with their peers after coming to Operation School Bell.   
Healthed Connect	310066		/users/profile/401417	kirkpat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/12/2016	I've seen the lives of orphans and vulnerable children dramatically change as they were nurtured by grief support programs, schools, nutritious hot lunches, and compassionate adults.  Love the work and mission of HealthEd Connect!
Healthed Connect	310030		/users/profile/164675	kelswelch	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/12/2016	I've been involved with HealthEd Connect for over 6 years. The results of the grassroots, community-based empowerment approach utilized by the organization speak louder than any words I could write in this review. Each year I return to the communities I am in awe of the organic growth that is happening in the various education and health programs as the local community identifies areas of need and collaborates with HealthEd Connect for identifying sustainable solutions. Global work is a challenging endeavor navigating distance and varied cultures, and HealthEd Connect is committed to listening and learning from the local communities for implementing thoughtful and sustainable tools and resources. While the name may not be universally known or recognized like larger international organizations, the positive impact of HealthEd Connect in the communities in which is serves cannot be stated enough. If you're looking to support an organization that respects the communities in which it works, recognizes a local community knows its own needs' priorities better than any well-meaning outsider, and focuses on providing evidence-based tools and education to the local communities with a foundation of empowerment and partnership, then you've found what you're looking for with HealthEd Connect.
Healthed Connect	121024		/users/profile/164675	kelswelch	Volunteer	5	08/19/2012	As a social worker, I believe firmly in empowerment as one of the biggest tools for positive change.  HealthEd Connect provides education and tools to local volunteer citizens in the communities where they are involved, based on the needs identified by those within the communities. Their's is a commitment for the long-term and to empower entire communities to grow and promote positive change through health and education. And their approach is one that values and recognizes that by partnering together, amazing things can happen. The founders of HealthEd Connect have been working in these communities for many years and have built solid relationships and a genuine respect for the different cultures, foundational to the work being done now by the organization. I have had the priviledge to work on the ground in Zambia with HealthEd Connect for the past two years to help develop programs to support the emotional health of orphans in these communities, and am so humbled to be a part of the work of this organization and the amazing work of the local community health workers who have expanded thier view of "health" from strictly physical to also the mental and emotional. In Zambia, many orphans' and vulnerable children's stories include their lives being affected in some way by HIV.  In this culture, there is often a stigma associated with having HIV, and during the time spent in those communities, I witnessed firsthand the local community health workers fighting this stigma through education and support for those who had contracted this virus. There have been lives saved, length and quality of lives prolonged, and babies born HIV-free. In addition, children who have felt the broad spectrum of effects of this disease in their brief lives thus far have been able to discover they are not alone and found a safe space to be emotionally supported.  And all of this is thanks to the work of HealthEd Connect in Zambia and the commitment, dedication, and tireless work of the local community healthworkers. What an incredibly humbling priviledge to have witnessed this positive change happening in Zambia! And what hope lies ahead for continued growth and change in these communities because of the shared vision, energy, and dedication of this organization and the local healthworkers!
Healthed Connect	309733		/users/profile/401087	lghall	Donor	5	10/11/2016	I've traveled to Zambia with HealthEd Connect to experience their work first-hand. Nine years ago they established three community K-7 schools in the Copperbelt region for orphans who would otherwise not have access to any education. USAID has recognized two of the schools with distinction. Over 1,000 children are currently enrolled and fed daily! HEC provides scholarships through the Girls Achievement Program to continue their education at government schools through the 12th grade. I've met many young scholars who now have dreams of becoming teachers, journalists, and accountants, breaking the cycle of poverty and dependence. And none of this would have happened without the care and commitment of professionally trained community health workers - the heart of HEC's work! Equipping village women with basic health care knowledge in sanitation, nutrition, family planning, disease prevention, safe drinking water, and treatment of topical wounds empowers them as leaders and change makers in their communities. When they encountered so many orphans while providing home care, the health workers advocated for HEC to open schools and develop local leadership committees to run them. I've seen first-hand the progress and successful outcomes! Such a transparent and impactful volunteer-driven organization! Humbled to be a part of the HEC family!
Healthed Connect	308551		/users/profile/399925	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	This nonprofit changed my life. I am blown away by their philosophies and ways of empowerment. Most incredible people I have come into contact with. 
Healthed Connect	290301		/users/profile/164331	mike49	Board Member	5	05/18/2016	I have seen several of Health Ed Connects programs in person in Zambia.   The schools and programs there are very real, very active, and impact the lives of hundreds of children every single day.   I have been in each of the three schools, observed the teachers and staff working, seen the meals served, and seen the excitement and hope instilled in the students there.  I have walked with the volunteer health workers as they made visits to the homes of individuals they monitor and assist.  The other programs in the Congo, Nepal, and Malawi also make significant impact on children and women each and every day.   A contribution to this organization is put to work in programs with real and visible impact.   In my opinion, you could not get a bigger more tangible positive result from your contribution than giving to this organization.
Healthed Connect	173001		/users/profile/164331	mike49	Board Member	5	10/03/2013	I am very aware of the details of this not for profit.  As an accounting professional, I am specifically aware of the high standard of operating procedures that Healthed Connect uses to manage it activities.   All expenses, including travel expenses of the directors are reviewed by two Board members.   We work very hard to follow the dollars spent in our foreign locations, particarily Africa.   I can pledge that the dollars of the organization are being used to tremendous benefit of the women and children being served.   The organization is open and transparent.   If anyone would like to speak to any of the directors or board member, we are open to provide details of our work and how our money is being spent.   We are very very proud of the amount of work actually done on the ground in our various locations.   Schools have been built, meals are being served, community center has been built, health care workers are being trained and supported, women have generated family income, and children have been taught, loved and supported.   
Healthed Connect	120790		/users/profile/164331	mike49	Board Member	5	08/16/2012	Healthed Connect in my opinion, represents the best in what a non profit organization is intended to be.  A defined mission has been created and everyone involved has personal interest in taking the actions necessary to accomplish that mission.   Healthed Connect is successful because all of it volunteers are passionate about making a difference in their actions.  Although small by national standards, the organization has gotten quick and large results in just the couple of years it has formally existed.  We like to say that we are getting a big bang for the buck.  The leadership and Board is completely volunteer.  Therefore, with no large administrative salaries to support, a large amount of our dollars has been put into programs.  As such, within just two years we have built and started three different schools in Zambia, provided support and training to on the ground health workers in several countries.   We have established strong but efficient business practices.

Healthed Connect	289443		/users/profile/379696	cdhorton	Donor	5	05/11/2016	One of the best reasons HealthEd Connect is beneficial is because they work directly with the indigenous people.  They are able to get needed supplies to the people without having to go through the government and the ever-present red tape.  They create trusting relationships and are sincere about helping people help themselves and build better communities. 
Healthed Connect	289432		/users/profile/379684	Writer	Donor	5	05/11/2016	We have know Sheri and Jac Kirkpatrick, founders of HealtED Connect--for  many years.  They are extremely dedicated to Healthed Connect.  We get the "news" from the Kirkpatrick almost daily.  Sheri is a PHD nurse and Jac a long time minister.

Subsequently, I have signed up for their regular email updates to see if I might like to donate to their cause as well.  After reading the updates for about a year now, I will be making my annual donations to their organization. Any person who has done their due dilligence in educating themselves about this orgnaizaion will see it is clear Health Ed Connect is one of the best non-profits utilizing proven methods and research on how to make a long-term sustainable impact in the world.  As an educator myself, I believe the path to economic sustainability, peace and justice begins with providing opportunities previously unavailable to the world's most financially poor children.   Health Ed Connect will truly change the world by leveling the playing field one child at a time.
Healthed Connect	289410		/users/profile/379660	cog07	Board Member	5	05/11/2016	We have been regular HealthEd Connect donors for 5 years and have been very impressed with the many ways they enhance the health and education in Nepal and the African countries where they serve those in great need. They train the local people to do the work on the ground and the organization provides the supplies that are necessary. We will continue to support them in any way we can.

The GAP program was just reinforced for me hearing Nobel Prize Winner "Malala" speak in Santa Barbara for girls education.

Healthed Connect	258539		/users/profile/347039	Writer	Donor	5	09/20/2015	This charitable provides high quality assistance, helps individuals improve the quality of their lives through health and education and their communities with even the smallest of donations.  It has very little administration cost and very little overhead costs so the donations have a greater impact than most organizations of this type.  The structure is to empower the individuals and not make them dependent of the organization.  It is one of the best in its field!!!!
Healthed Connect	257263		/users/profile/272431	MAEK	Donor	5	09/15/2015	The co- founders of HealthEd Connect, Jac and Sherri Kirkpatrick,  have dedicated their efforts toward helping  and educating communities in ways they can improve their living conditions, both in the area of health issues, general living issues  and learning how to read, for  both old and young. Their news- letters provide exciting information of the activities provided by HealthEd Connect to the communities they are serving.  A number of people have recognized the value of this organization and have volunteered their time to also serve these communities. Because Health Ed Connect has recognizable value, local leaders of these communities have also reached out to support HealthEd Connect. 
Healthed Connect	209684		/users/profile/272431	MAEK	Donor	5	08/08/2014	I have been very impressed with the skills that HealthEd Connect is providing in Zambia such  as: educating the children, and providing learning tools for them, sewing, cooking, training workers who already live in the area being served by HealthEd Connect.  The directors, through their email updates, have kept me  aware of how blessed I am to live in the United States and how blessed others are due to the efforts of such people as Sherri  and Jac.  It is amazing to see pictures and stories of women who are learning health care skills so they can provide the needed care for their children and their communities and to see pictures of children sharing their new skills. that surround them.
Healthed Connect	257194		/users/profile/345603	RavingFan	Donor	5	09/14/2015	The leadership of Healthed Connect are veterans of the global non-profit sector and experts at truly making a difference in the world.  Their efforts are highly spoken of at Graceland University where I work.  After seeing their annual report detaling the communities they have helped inspire to invest in the education of their children, I decided to make a monthly donation. It's not near enough, but it is motivating to me to see how far they stretch every dollar.  What sets Healthed Connect apart is that the local community is so invested in the success of the schools the community builds and the appreciation for the health care training the local women receive.   Long story short - this is not an outside group coming in and taking over, or deciding what is best.  The local community members themselves are heavily invested in the success of each initiative.

The nimbleness of a small group of volunteers that can move quickly and are deeply connected within the communities where they work. An extraordinary example is the instant response following the earthquake in Nepal where thousands received food and were assisted with housing. HealthEd Connect assisted remote communities badly stuck by the earthquake others couldn't reach. I am proud to be a part of such an extraordinary organization.

All individuals in this nonprofit still go, work, and live among the people they serve.  I am so impressed by this small orginaztion and what they have been able to do for education.  Three villages now have schools and my university students who are training to be teachers here in the US can go work and see first hand how valuable and coveted an education is in Africa.  It is amazing work.  I have experienced well run and poorly run nonprofits in my line of work and this is one of the best.

My husband and I lived in Zambia for a year and frequently visited some of the communities in which HealthEd Connect now works. It is inspiring to hear about and see the positive impact happening in these communities as local community healthcare workers and teachers are being trained by HealthEd Connect to respond to some of the most pressing needs in the community. Some of their initiatives include free of charge schooling and meals for orphaned children, home based care for people with AIDS, and providing education for the care giving of babies and monitoring their growth.  This model encourages the empowerment of women and children, which is exactly the mission of HealthEd Connect.

My daughter has been involved with Sherri and Jac for several years now and has gone to Zambia two different times.  What they do for the people of Zambia who are less fortunate than most of us is remarkable.  It touched my daughter is so many ways that her first trip brought about her career change.  HealthEd Connect touches everyone who is involved whether that is on their end (they giving end) or the receiving end.  
Healthed Connect	210309		/users/profile/273071	Pam_69	General Member of the Public	5	08/12/2014	I have learned about HealthEd Connect from my granddaughter who took two separate trips to Zambia this year to support the program.  The needs are many in this area of Africa, and are being met in many ways through the teaching that helps increase the skills of the adults and children in the village and through medical care that has shown a true loving and caring support system for many years.  HealthEd is administered in an effective way that will continue to develop an independent way of life for these wonderful people that are so eager to learn and take care of their families.

Healthed Connect	209861		/users/profile/272607	Lynley C.	Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	HealthEd Connect successfully creates sustainable opportunities for impoverished areas in Zambia, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nepal to improve community members standard of living and quality of life. I have witnessed first-hand the positive effects of HealthEd Connect's presence in three communities in Zambia. Last January, I shadowed the nonprofit and saw empowered women (and men) making incredible change in their communities. HealthEd Connect trains women in the communities to be Healthcare workers and entrepreneurs (that contribute funds to the greater community). Hundreds of orphans and vulnerable children attend the schools created by community members in conjunction with HealthEd Connect's support, as well as benefit from the school lunch program. With a special focus on educating women, they are making powerful strides toward breaking the cycle of poverty in the communities of Chipulukusu, Kasompe, and Zamtan. With intentional planning and expertise, this nonprofit is transforming the lives of many, including my own. 
Healthed Connect	209843		/users/profile/272589	ruthseagraves	Donor	5	08/09/2014	The transformations that occur in the communities where HealthEd has brought education and training are so noticeable and effective that other villages are asking for the same type of training so that their own communities thrive as well.   What's beautiful about it is that the growth truly comes from the energy of the local people who are empowered.  The "weakest" groups (women and orphans) are leading the way and inspiring everyone to believe that change is possible and that poverty is not permanent.  I am proud to support such great work.
Healthed Connect	209796	2	/users/profile/272548	andmur02	Volunteer	5	08/09/2014	HealthEd Connect truly lives out its mission of empowering women and children through evidence-based health, education, and advocacy programs. They have created a sense of volunteerism in the three different communities I visited in Zambia in 2013. For the past 20+ years, Sherri has been training community health workers to look after the most vulnerable in their community. In that same caring sense, those community health workers came together a few years ago and said we need to not only take care of the sick among us, but also the children. They decided they needed schools. Thus three community schools were created. Having visited, observed, and taught in these schools I can, without a doubt, say that these schools are changing lives! Everything they do is intentionally planned and culturally relevant to the people they are working WITH.
Healthed Connect	209781		/users/profile/272533	sharonmcclain9	Donor	5	08/09/2014	I became aware of Healthed Connect after listening to Sherri Kirkpatrick speak at a Women's Retreat.  I was impressed with all of the things they were doing for African families in some very poor communities and decided I wanted to help.  For two years, a group from our church has made 400 birthing kits for Zambian women and this year, we made 40 book bags for a school for girls.  I receive Sherri's blog and read it regularly.   I am amazed at what Healthed Connect is able to do with a little money and I applaud the "on the ground" information they get and evaluate before rushing in to help.  Because of this, the help they give is truly needed and wanted.  I will continue to support Healthed Connect because I believe in what they do! 
Healthed Connect	209650		/users/profile/272403	Fisch1	General Member of the Public	5	08/08/2014	I am amazed at how well and how often Jac and Sherry communicate the great things they are doing with HealthEd Connect to interested parties.  Peoples lives' are being transformed through HealthEd Connect.
Healthed Connect	209633		/users/profile/224192	ashley.guinan	Donor	5	08/08/2014	HealthEd Connect does great things every day! There are so many success stories to share from the group, I'm sure the constant updates we receive are only the tip of the iceberg. Such a great group!
Healthed Connect	169158		/users/profile/224192	ashley.guinan	Donor	5	09/11/2013	This is the greatest nonprofit I have ever been involved with. They do a great job of stretching donations to impact thousands of lives a year. Yearly reports and constant blog updates also keep everyone involved in the know. I have been to Zambia with this group and have seen firsthand how great of a job they have been doing for people for decades. I would recommend this nonprofit to anybody wanting to make a positive difference in this world. 
Healthed Connect	209570		/users/profile/272330	Charles46	Donor	5	08/08/2014	Jac and Sherry Kirkpatrick continue to offer service beyond self to others who do not have the blessings that we here in the US have. I have nothing but respect for the sacrifices that they continue to make helping others and educating a new generation of volunteers in the service of helping others.
Healthed Connect	209561		/users/profile/272321	Sewer	Volunteer	5	08/08/2014	I am impressed by and supportive of the important human development projects Healthed Connect has undertaken. My efforts are small monetary donations along with organizing my congregation's sewers as we fulfill our commitment to make apron/uniforms for the African health care workers and school cooks. In the past our congregation has also made baby seats for weighing the little ones and contributed triple antibiotics and aspirin. I especially appreciate the online updates as they help me see the progress and  know that my contributions are meaningful.
Healthed Connect	209502		/users/profile/272262	PeaceDove	Donor	5	08/08/2014	I am amazed by the dedication, expertise and vision of HEALTHED CONNECT. I believe in its mission and in it as a non-profit that is really making a critical difference. I have often shared its stories of success and inspiration with my friends. 
Healthed Connect	209501		/users/profile/272261	David245	Donor	5	08/08/2014	The Kirkpatricks brought decades of experience in international human development and the medical profession to the establishment of HEALTHED CONNECT.  They now draw on trusted experts in a number of fields to serve as board members and staff. They have invaluable long established connections on the ground in each nation where they work. In addition to working side by side with villagers in true endeavors of development (rather than charity) they provide opportunities for young adults from developed countries to gain insight into the challenges of resolving critical issues of global poverty.  Having worked with Jac and Sherri in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, we know of their high standards, their ethics and values, their competence, and their dedication and commitment. This is not just another non-profit seeking to do good. Look at where the money goes. Follow the hard data in the statistics they monitor.  Watch their interactions with people in the nations and villages where they work.
Healthed Connect	209482		/users/profile/272244	jabraham231	Volunteer	5	08/08/2014	HealthEd Connect is one of the finest non-profit organizations I have ever had the privilege of working with.

Lives are being changed for the better.  And, donations go further than can be imagined because of the dedicated work of the volunteers!
Healthed Connect	209243		/users/profile/272013	ALBrand	Donor	5	08/07/2014	HealthEd Connect meets their clients where they are in development.  They have clear goals and a vision for the area they can make the most impact, but allow the individuals they serve to have impact in what will work for the community.  HealthEd Connect is also great about connecting donors to the recipients and vice versa, even though they are typically on opposite sides of the globe.
Healthed Connect	207084		/users/profile/269634	Rrobino	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2014	My sister recently traveled to Zambia, Africa with HealthEd Connect.

Healthed Connect	205948		/users/profile/268227	j.heide	Volunteer	5	07/14/2014	HealthEd Connect,  a Top-Rated Nonprofit in 2013, and is still setting those high standards in 2014!Working closely  with the people that they serve in Zambia, Malawi, Nepal and the D.R. of the Congo.  The founders and volunteers love the people that they serve and they work diligently  to make their dreams come true. We are building schools and libraries for the children, providing  for healthy lunches, digging wells for water, working and training health care workers to provide much needed basic care and delivering healthy babies, this is what HealthEd Connect is all about. As a donor, you can expect to keep connected with the very people that you are trying to help through personal letters, and social media. Lifting and empowering communities that face incredible challenges; this is what we love to do!
Healthed Connect	205196		/users/profile/267315	Probino	Volunteer	5	07/05/2014	I've been fortunate to represent HealthEd Connect twice this year in Zambia, Africa. HealthEd Connect is a wonderful example of how the world can change and bring hope to other countries. I appreciated the opportunity to work closely with the founders who exemplified the qualities of not just living for yourself, but living to make the world a better place for all. HealthEd Connect's transparency, framework, and generosity has broaden my perspective. This will continue to change my life forever. 
Healthed Connect	177297		/users/profile/233830	mwaite	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	HealthEd Connect is incredible, and in my opinion one of the best nonprofits in the world. I have had the wonderful opportunity to travel to Zambia three times and observe the life-changing impact their programs are making. HealthEd Connect has not only changed the lives of people in need all over the world through their unique programs, but it has changed mine as well. HealthEd Connect is led by a distinguished board who are driven by the projects and I have confidence they will continue to lead this amazing nonprofit to great places in the future!
Healthed Connect	175304		/users/profile/231644	c.ash	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2013	I learned about HEC through my sister, who has travelled to Zambia twice with the organisation. It is humbling to remember that basic education (for body and mind) is a luxury in so many places, when I was fortunate enough to think of it as a fundamental right. Through her I have seen how HEC operates with conscientious compassion to support and challenge growth in the individuals and communities it seeks to help. I cannot recommend these programs (and the staff who run them) highly enough.
Healthed Connect	174856		/users/profile/231158	James91	Donor	5	10/07/2013	This summer, I met two women who shared their experience, illustrated by photos,  of a recent HEALTHED CONNECT (HEC) trip to Zambia.  I was impressed with the community response and dissemination plan for the health training and basic life changing first aid skills provided by HEC.  But as an educator, I was most excited by the schools being developed for the children through the intense desire of the mothers in the communities.  Mothers everywhere are a force for good, and HEC listened.Basic teaching strategies are being taught by HEC staff to help women in the community to begin to teach children the elements of language and how to read.  This effort feels personal and I want to be part of the solution by  encouraging compassionate generosity to raise money for books with children and adults alike. 
Healthed Connect	174834		/users/profile/231136	Kludwig	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2013	HealthED Connect is a great organization! I became famiier with it through their employee Lisa Ash. I teach Fifth Grade and used the information Lisa shared with me with my fifth graders. We explored the web site and it was very eye opening for my students. I had the opportunity to purchase 'reading beads for the fifth grade students in our school, we use them every time we read. The web site really hit home with my students. The whole idea that some kids do not get a free education was priceless to them. This is a great non-profit group that is helping people that really want the help. This was very eye opening for students that feel school is an unnecessary evil!Kelly Ludwig

HEC volunteers teach how to connect future dreams to present actions paving the way for a better world.
Healthed Connect	122586	1	/users/profile/166970	kristik	Board Member	5	09/19/2012	What if your mother had no help in birthing you and you were breech? What if you had lost both parents to HIV and went to live with your blind grandmother who couldn't  afford to send you to school? Where would you be, who would you be, would you survive?   Now, what if your community had a plan for you? What if volunteer health workers were there for your mother when you were born.  What if the community had a school for orphans  to attend where children could learn about health as well as reading and writing? HealthEd Connect  supports groups in several countries in  planning for and implementing these types of solutions. Communities research for themselves and identify their own needs.  Health Ed Connect then supports these groups in achieving their goals.  Presently HealthEd Connect is involved in several community projects in several countries, like two new schools for orphans and vulnerable children in Kamsompe and Chipulukusu  Africa, and health worker education. Projects like these have allowed the entire community to have new hope for the future by addressing the present needs of their women and children. Please support HealthEd Connect in helping communties help  themselves.

Healthed Connect	169472		/users/profile/224560	Amy_103	Advisor	5	09/12/2013	HEC is using a sustainable model to empower communities to care for themselves.  The projects are executed intentionally with a very strategic eye on the scope and target of all projects.  Health education and training of trainers model is in place with some emphasis on economic development activities.  The organization has also partnered with university service learning projects to increase access to highly skilled volunteers.  I have personally know the leadership of HEC for more than twenty years and can attest not only to their competence but also to their lifelong dedication to serving others. A well rounded advisory board is engaged with the organization and financial support is directed almost 100% to project execution and community betterment.
Healthed Connect	169125		/users/profile/224151	lash	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	HEC works to empower communities.  Their health care worker model and their training models for small businesses and teachers are well organized.  The overhead and the staff are quite minimal, but the volunteer base is huge!!  I've never seen such a small non-profit organization make this wide of an impact.  Truly amazing.
Healthed Connect	166436		/users/profile/221083	AGuthrey	Board Member	5	08/28/2013	The Community Health Worker model that HealthEd Connect has put to work in communities across Africa and Asia is central in giving members of these communities a voice, especially the families and children with special needs.  A Community Health Worker is a trained local volunteer on the ground in the community who assists with primary health care needs, works as a traditional birth attendant and/or provides home based care to those who are ill.  HealthEd Connect empowers these local volunteers not only by providing health education skills but by asking them to use their experiences in the community to be agents of change. The leadership at HealthEd Connect is passionate about seeing these communities succeed and because the organization is volunteer run, a large amount of funds go directly to supporting programs in country.   As someone who has worked with the organization over the last couple of years, I am a huge advocate of this sustainable model and life changing mission.

It is a privilege to be associated with loving people who want to share what they have with others.  The individuals we see in Zambia have become my second family.  HEC has invested time, money and love helping Health Workers and children learn self-esteem and ways to a different way of life.  It is a worth while investment!

I know HEC has made a difference in the lives of many, many people including mine.  Establishing schools, building classrooms, creating a daily lunch program and developing income generating activities are just the beginning of beautiful relationships that have been accomplished over the short years HEC has been working in Zambia.  My sisters and brothers in Zambia are eager to work and learn with us to become proficient in different activities, and in return, they work and teach others in their communities.  I enjoy being a volunteer for HealthEd connect!

I have experienced nothing but exemplary ethical and economic standards at work in this organization. Each dollar is treated as a precious gift from a donor and is used with the utmost respect and practical wisdom to achieve the most efficient possible outcome. Not a penny is wasted and almost all work on the American end is done by volunteers. The beautiful people of Zambia and Nepal express the deepest appreciation for our efforts and are often moved to tears or song or dancing at the idea that people they have not met could possibly care so much for them. I can say with absolute certainty that HealthEd Connect is changing the world for the better, through health, education, and a deep sense of connection with the communities they serve.
Healthed Connect	122675		/users/profile/167090	san clemente	Board Member	5	09/20/2012	Healthed Connect is a non profit that I deeply admire.  Its goal to provide education and health improvements for the people and communities it serves is a goal that I completely feel is the best way to improve the lives of people.  The very selective use of local trained and educated personnel is extremely efficient and produces quality people with a new hope and horizon that they could not have dreamed of before Healthed Connect became a reality in their lives.

Healthed Connect	121781		/users/profile/165705	grambre	Board Member	5	08/31/2012	HealthEd Connect offers unique person-centered empowerment to women and AIDS orphans/vulnerable children of Zambia through community schools, physical healthcare, and emotional support of volunteer community health workers. Training is also offered free in the villages of other developing countries like Malawi, Nepal, and the Congo. Hundreds of babies and mothers are alive today because of the trainings guided by HealthEd Connect's volunteer staff, yet provided to these volunteer community health workers in each area by their own leaders. The dedication of the villagers involved is incredible--hundreds of miles walked to deliver a baby or share a simple nutritional solution to save little ones' lives is unimaginable in the US tradition. What a blessing!

The Silver Star Families of America	264652	1	/users/profile/35100	sffan57	Board Member	5	10/16/2015	SSFOA is a great organization.  We are totally grassroots.  Whatever we accomplish it comes through the volunteering of time, effort and materiel.  This organization has a big heart and we hold a mission there and uppermost.  Our wounded, ill, and injured combat troops and veterans, along with our homeless vets and vets in hospice care are a small group overall and because of that they tend to get shuffled to the wayside.  But SSFOA will not allow them to be forgotten.  We are there for them until they leave us for their final duty station. 
The Silver Star Families of America	215925	1	/users/profile/35100	sffan57	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	I have been associated with SSFOA for almost 9 years now.  I continue to be amazed with the dedication and effort that our volunteers give to this organization and to those we serve.  Because we are a true grass-roots, all volunteer organization we can put at least 95 cents of every dollar donated directly toward our programs and warriors.  I am truly proud and honored to be part of this great organization.  Come join us ... you don't want to miss out on the experience.
The Silver Star Families of America	123890	2	/users/profile/35100	sffan57	Board Member	5	09/29/2012	This is truly a stand-alone organization.  No matter the issue, if it affects/involves our combat wounded, ill and injured troops and veterans, we are there.  SSFOA does not hesitate to take on the tough stuff ... witnessed by our stance and action about combat PTS (Drop the 'D' and lend a hand) and our Prayer Blanket program for veterans in Hospice care.  Everything we accomplish is by an all volunteer force so that the maximum amount goes to our programs and 'our kids'.
The Silver Star Families of America	99826	1	/users/profile/35100	sffan57	Board Member	5	10/27/2011	SSFOA is the only organization to formally recognize all the consequences of combat.  We are not afraid of taking on the difficult jobs that other groups shy away from.  We are there for our wounded warriors and veterans until they leave us for their final duty station.
The Silver Star Families of America	34279	1	/users/profile/35100	sffan57	Board Member	5	03/31/2010	I've been a member of SSFOA since August, 2007.  I found the group by accident, yet very soon realized that I had found a home.  I have been involved with military support activities for 30+ years and this group is like none other.  SSFOA recognizes, honors and remembers those who have freely given so much of themselves to this country, to us.  This organization is the only one to recognize the consequences of serving in a combat zone, whether those affects are seen or unseen; for all branches of service; from all wars.  Being on various committees and on the BoD with this group, I can assure folks that SSFOA's mission is at the heart of group, literally and figuratively.  If it is something that affects our troops and veterans and is within the realm of our mission, we're involved.  You won't hear "Why?" with this group.  You hear "What can we do?" and "How can we get it done?"

This is the best way a person can give to a hurt soldier without being there to give it to the soldier themselves. 
The Silver Star Families of America	221511	1	/users/profile/285201	roadkill	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	Ive seen disabled veterans spirits greatly lifted through the efforts of this caring organization. Thank you so much! It lifted my spirit too.I've seen articles in the newspaper about the Silver Star flag that is a symbol of America's appreciation for the physical and mental sacrifices made by these heroes of ours.The flags are received by these wounded soldiers with great pride and become a cherished keepsake that will be handed down for generations. Worthy.
The Silver Star Families of America	263428	1	/users/profile/352132	Harmony R.	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2015	I think the silver star families of America is a great way of help many in need of support and hope for those that served to fight for our country and their families. 
The Silver Star Families of America	263392	1	/users/profile/280137	Gary49	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2015	I had asked them to help a vets family in need. And Pappy being the Good Christian he is helped the family a lot. I am a friend of the founder and also a proud member.
The Silver Star Families of America	216641	1	/users/profile/280137	Gary49	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2014	I personally know the founder of this great organization. I met him through  The OAS movement.  He is a true Patriot and loyal to the veterans of our military.He is always willing to put his personnel life on hold to help someone in need.Of all the organizations out there I rate this a 1. I have been  a proud member and will continue to be a proud member.                                                                                  God Bless                                                                                Gary Sellers  
The Silver Star Families of America	263350	1	/users/profile/352056	Writer	Board Member	5	10/12/2015	For the amount of money via donations the SSFOA does a lot of good. There are no paid Officers, Board members or volunteers. The SSFOA uses almost 97 cents of each donated dollar on programs and initiatives of the mission. Sometimes things get a bit backed up but they always come through and never charge a fee for first time recipients. The silver star service banner is unique and so is the SSFOA.
The Silver Star Families of America	260579	1	/users/profile/349155	Ronald18	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	The Silver Star Families of America was sort of confusing for me in the beginning.   It was my thoughts that it was for the military Silver Star award winners, and their families.  I consequently went barreling in asking if I could get help for a Silver Star medal winner and his daughter.   The winner of the Silver Star was a shipmate of mine who had recetnly passed away.  I got in contact with his daughter, and found out that she had her dad cremated and wanted to get his ashes to Arlington, but with no finances to do so.   I told Steve the story, and almost immediately we were on the Go Fund Me website looking for donors to help Kim Hines Halbardier make the trip to Arlington with her father's ashes.   We had enough cash to get this underway within a week.  I have dealt with the government for many years,  and dealt with other organization for as long as I can remember trying to get the help that was needed, in whatever circumstance we were in.   No one moved faster then Steve on this, and I think Dianne was the one who got us on the You Fund Me site.   As a USS Liberty survivor, and knowing the past political problems we have had to put up with,  I might say I was astounded to see the help we needed happen so fast, and even more happy when I told Kim that it looked like we were well on our way.  I will be meeting with Kim in Billings, Montana where she takes her daughter for medical care.  It will be exciting for both of us and her little girl to get together and talk a bit about the trip.   Taking that last trip with her dad to get him where he needs to be, has caused this girl to awaken to organizations like this one.   I know it certainly has been a wild trip for me, and thanks is never enough.   Since father and daughter were not that close during their lives, this seems to me to be a sort of healing trip for KIm as she travels with her father's remains, and puts them in a place of honor, where they rightfully need to be.

The Silver Star Families of America	217812		/users/profile/281353	Brandy8	Client Served	5	09/26/2014	My brother was injured in combat in 2010. Unfortunately I did not find out about SSFOA until a year later. I wish I had found them sooner. The love and support they gave my family can never be replaced. They work hard to make sure the families of those injured have all of their needs met. 
The Silver Star Families of America	217462		/users/profile/121122	Margie H	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	I appreciate this opportunity to write a review for Silver Star Families of America.  I was made aware of SSFOA by a former Navy friend.  After checking out their site, I called them and became a volunteer becoming the Maryland/DC Representative.  This has been a most rewarding adventure for both myself and my husband.  We have had the opportunity to assist in creating SSFOA's Headqarters Building in MO, place wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown, and represent SSFOA on Veterans Day at Arlington Cemetery.  Additionly, we work with staff at the Veterans Hospital (Old Soldiers Home) in DC, presenting a program each quarter.  Our group of card creaters do cards each quarter for the VA hospitals.  We do fund raisers and other activities to raise funds for SSFOA.  This is just a tiny portion of the wonderful work SSFOA does nationwide for our veterans.  I have been fortunate to become a member of the Board and now hold the position of Vice President.  I strongly recommend you check out the SSFOA site at:  silverstarfamilies.org where you will find additional information and see photos of our wonderful veterans receiving banners and citations for their service.  Hopefully, you will want to become involved with a donation of funds or your time to honor our kids, as we lovingly call them.Thank you for your time.  Margie Harich, MD/DC       
The Silver Star Families of America	124536	1	/users/profile/121122	Margie H	Board Member	5	10/04/2012	Thank you for allowing me to review Silver Star Families of America.  My name is Margie Harich and I am now a Board of Directors member.  I first became acquainted with SSFOA when a retired Navy nurse felt it was a most valid charity and I might find it interesting.  Well, that was an understatement.  I contacted the Founders, Diana and Steve Newton, who were delighted to bring another member on board.  Shortly thereafter, I became the Maryland/DC Representative.  It has been a beautiful adventure.  Just to name a few things my husband, Marvin, and I have had the priviledge of doing.  We have, with pride, presented Silver Star Service Banners and Citations to many honorable and most deserving veterans.  It was our pleasure, and with lots of sweat equity, we helped renovate the Headquarters Building in Missouri for offices and public/private interviews.  We have handled charitable functions and met wonderful individuals, some famous in their respective fields.    We have cried, laughed, and been awed by our couregous veterans.  We have done fund raisers and met with other organizations to share our fund raising ideas.  So, it is with continued respect and pride I give this five star rating to one of the most deserving charities in the nation.        
The Silver Star Families of America	99812	1	/users/profile/121122	Margie H	Board Member	5	10/27/2011	Hi Everyone, I would like to relate how I became a member of Silver Star Families of America.  A retired Navy friend suggested I should join SFFOA as they were a find organization for helping veterans.  So, I went to their website as was immediately contacted by the Founders, Mr. and Mrs. Newton.  They were polite, helpful and wonderful.  This made me want to be associated with the group.  The result is I have found another family who are caring to a fault about our wonderful and honored veterans.   Additionally, you should know there are no paid members of SSFOA and 90% of all monies/donations are provided to the veterans.  The only monies used are for supplies/necessities, like manditory audits.   Please take a look at SSFOA's web site, www.silverstarfamilies.org and see for yourself how terrific they are and how devoted everyone is to our kids (that's veterans to you folks).  We think of all of them as ours and we want to share that feeling with you.  So come join us, you will never regret it. Margie HarichMaryland/District of Columbia RepresentativeSSFOA 
The Silver Star Families of America	215564		/users/profile/120669	flexjob2	Board Member	5	09/18/2014	The SSFOA has made many strides in serving our beloved combat wounded, ill and injured troops and Veterans for 10 years now (this month Sep 2014). We are proud of all of our volunteers whom contribute so much of themselves with time and talents toward the mission. The main mission is to present a Silver Star Service Banner (SSSB) package to all eligible requestors to honor the service in sacrifice of injury and illness on the combat lines overseas. It is our honor and duty to recognize each and every one from WWII-Present war/conflict. We have a great groups of members, alumni, supporters across the country and overseas; thank you all. Without each of you, the SSFOA, your organization would not be able to do all that is accomplished on a shoe string budget. Economic times have effected us all in many ways but one way unaffected has shown through in all of our volunteers caring and compassionate hearts. We thank you all.  
The Silver Star Families of America	123415		/users/profile/120669	flexjob2	Board Member	5	09/27/2012	It has always been a pleasure to provide, honor and assist our nations combat wounded, ill, injured and dying troops and Vets from all wars (WWII- present). As a board member, it also brings me and the organization much satisfaction knowing that our SSFOA overhead for 2011 was at 3.1%. This means that practically .97 cents of each dollar donated goes directly to programs that benefit our wounded and ill, homeless Veterans and all other SSFOA programs and initiatives. Thank you so much for helping the SSFOA help them all, our beloved and treasured combat wounded and ill, injured and dying troops and Veterans.
The Silver Star Families of America	99733		/users/profile/120669	flexjob2	Board Member	5	10/25/2011	We (SSFOA) have worked tirelessly over the past 7 years + to ensure that no combat wounded or ill, injured or dying of our Armed Forces and Veteran population, will always be remembered and honored. I have enjoyed the SSFOA and having the ability to recognize so many of this sometimes overlooked population, especially our homeless Vets and Hospice/palliative care Vets in the V.A. hospitals nationwide. The special devotion the SSFOA also feels toward our Vietnam Vets, their struggles of coming home and now their struggles of getting the care they need within the V.A. hospital/op clinic as they are aging, now. Presenting the silver star service banner packages in person in ceremonies and in one-on-one cases are more than rewarding for all concerned. Volunteering and serving in professional capacity for SSFOA has only increased my respect and awareness of the need for SSFOA and other non profits to help, honor, recognize, assist and advocate for our beloved troops and Veterans.
The Silver Star Families of America	213371		/users/profile/222479	BJSummers	Volunteer	5	09/04/2014	I volunteer for The Silver Star Families of America by making and sending out cards to our veterans, mostly to Vet homes or hospitals, it is really nice to get word back that you made someone smile. Great Group that really is dedicated to our countries veterans, honoring and helping them where they can!

The Silver Star Families of America	168920		/users/profile/223890	Becky49	Donor	5	09/10/2013	Silver Star Families of America is a phenomenal group of volunteers from all over the country dedicated to supporting and helping those wounded service members from all past and present  US war involvement.  Headed by Steve & Diana Newton and supported by many other friends and families of those that have given so much for the freedoms we so highly appreciate in this country. Honoring those injured in the line of duty on and off the battlefield and sharing information in furthering their care and support after injured.  Honoring those who have given so much and pay the price every day. What an awesome organization I am proud to be supporting.   
The Silver Star Families of America	168414		/users/profile/223305	Selena C.	Client Served	5	09/08/2013	What an awesome organization! My husband was injured in the desert and thus we are a Silver Star Family. We have been welcomed with opened arms, and my husband is honored to hang our Silver Star Flag on the wall in his office!

The Silver Star Families of America	168100		/users/profile/223004	Myrtlecrk	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	I never did serve our country in the military, however I do have many friends who have.  I am recently retired (2 1/2 years ago) after spending over 33 years in Law Enforcement as a Patrol Deputy and Patrol Supervisor. During my service our agency has had members injured in the line of duty as well as killed in the line of duty.  I am so aware of the pain and suffering the family members, as well as those who have been injured serving the public, go through.  I am a major supporter of our military and any organization that gives of their time to help those wounded warriors and their families who have been severely injured while serving in our military.  I recently came across "The Silver Star Families of America" through a friend who asked me to volunteer by sending money and spending some time making cards for our wonderful veterans.  I strongly urge anyone, who wants to help out to donate some time and money, if they can, with the this wonderful organization, to honor those who have served and given their all for our protection and let them know they are not forgotten and are loved and appreciated.
The Silver Star Families of America	168092		/users/profile/222993	Wildflowers	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	Great Organization.. Highly recommend it to anybody that is looking to volunteer and help out our Military wounded and Ill and Dying..

Silver Star Families of America offers me support and information. These are people who get it because they also have been there & done that.
The Silver Star Families of America	163459		/users/profile/217011	Diana43	Board Member	5	07/24/2013	After almost 10 years with the Silver Star Families of America I continue to be amazed at the wonderful folks that have just as much passion for the mission as I do- sometimes more!!!  It is our duty to recognize, honor and advocate for the combat wounded, injured and ill troops and Veterans. When personally able to present the Silver Star Service banner package it is an experience like no other, even after the 1,000's of the SSSB packages that have either been presented or mailed for presentation, each one unique and touching- just like each individual recipient. I am grateful and thankful for our vital role of our mission to be able to be a part of such a wonderful thing.  The SSFOA operates on a 'shoe string' budget and the things and programs and initiatives that we accomplish on so little just goes to show that what is in the heart - not the coinpurse- is the soul of success. We thank each wounded and/or ill that we connect with and we thank the generosity of our donors, supporters, alumni and membership with gratitude. Without you there would be no SSFOA and that would be a sad day, indeed. THANK YOU all.
The Silver Star Families of America	163109		/users/profile/216519	mag2school	General Member of the Public	5	07/19/2013	SSFoA is an excellent organization. Positive support and understanding. Any questions - just ask because someone may have an answer or maybe it is just a hugs & a prayer. I am Mom to a combat wounded warrior, his injury can not be seen so he "appears normal" and you just can't talk about with non military types because they just do not get it, the long waits at the VA, the VA not answering questions or following through with appointments, his raging rants.... These are people who have Been There Done That and understand your frustration and also celebrate in the victories no matter how big or small. 
The Silver Star Families of America	162889		/users/profile/216207	rjs004	General Member of the Public	5	07/17/2013	Silver Star Families is an amazing organization that honors our wounded warriors.  Many people have seen  the gold star and blue star service banners, but only a few understand the sacrifice our Veterans and their families endure day in and day out when that banner hangs in their window.  With Silver Star Families providing the banner free of charge, it shows that the nation understands the sacrifice we wounded warriors have given for service to our country and wants to thank us for it.  They additionally do other events to help our wounded and ill Veterans.  With Gulf War Illness and now what can only be called Burn Pit Illness, they help educate American citizens about the battles we face now at home inside out bodies from the toxins we were exposed to.  Without media attention, Congressional Support, and public attention we could easily be the forgotten remnants of a war.  After becoming a Wounded Warrior myself in Afghanistan in 2012, the first organization I found to help me in this new chapter in my life was Silver Star Families of America.  I will never forget what they have done for me!  
The Silver Star Families of America	162888		/users/profile/216204	DesertYankee	Advisor	5	07/17/2013	I became involved with Silver Star Families of America in the course of my years-long association with veterans outside of official capacity. As a totally disabled veteran I spent many, many days at the GEW Memorial Veterans Medical Center in Salt Lake City over the last 15+ years of treatments. I have personally talked with hundreds of veterans over that period. What struck me as extremely important was that there just didn't seem to be anyone or any organization out there helping a lot of the really depressed and financially desperate vets I spoke to. Several months ago, through a very dear friend's recommendation, I got in touch with SSFoA and asked how I could help. This opened a whole new world of people who are dedicated to fill that void of caring and assistance! I then applied for and was accepted as an adviser for the group and have since been finding lots of new ways to make a difference in the lives of veterans nationwide. Please reach out generously and give to Silver Star Families of America. There is NO veterans' support charity in the nation that is better equipped and more dedicated to the service of our "forgotten veterans". May God bless them for the wonderful work they do.
The Silver Star Families of America	124625	1	/users/profile/169556	JERSEY ANGEL	Volunteer	5	10/05/2012	As a volunteer with Silver Star Families of America, I have found them to be very helpful in assisting me when I need advice or help with an issue.  They are a very sincere friendly group of people, and they have come a long way.  Successfully bringing back May 1 as a traditional day of recognition for our wounded and sick veterans.  This has been a remarkable achievement, and I am proud of being part of this endeavor.  The Silver Star Flag, which is the official flag for our wounded and sick veterans, can now be seen flying across our nation.   This charity provides meal cards and items for 'stand downs.'  Any veteran can and does, when made known, the honor of receiving the Silver Star flag.  This charity is recognised throughout the United States for its compassionate concern for our veterans of all wars.
The Silver Star Families of America	124580	1	/users/profile/169491	Carol62	Volunteer	5	10/04/2012	Silver Star Families of America is a wonderful organization.  My first project was to send cards to veterans who were hospitalized. The second project was sending cards at different holidays to military personnel whether Iraq or Afghanistan, or on a aircraft carrier. As the daughter of a career Army officer, it's important to show how much they are appreciated. Their honor, commitment and courage are recognized by this Patriot. I highly recommend Silver Star Families of America! Submitted by: Carol McGuinn email: isalutetheflag2@yahoo.com

Through personal experience and working with the members of the Silver Star Families of America they are by far at the top of the list.   What they do for the thousands of military personnel current and prior and their families ls admirable. Each staff member and volunteer is fastidious and pertinacious in all they do and they are to be commended.   The Silver Star Families of Americal consistently show a high degree of enthusiasm, energy, and force in helping the heros of our nation.

The Silver Star Families of America	124503	1	/users/profile/169374	Jeremy5	Volunteer	5	10/04/2012	The Silver Star Families of America is a growing organization with a mission vital to the recognition of sacrifices made by our wounded warriors and their families. It's mission has become so profound that the Missouri Governor--twice yearly--holds ceremonies in his Capitol office during which he presents Missouri wounded with Silver Star Banners on behalf of a grateful state and nation. What better endorsement for our heroes than this! Thank you SSFOA for all you have done. 
The Silver Star Families of America	124472	1	/users/profile/169329	Carrie31	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	SSFOA is one of the greatest organizations I've been associated with.

I have made lasting friends while working for this organization. It really gives you a good feeling to be able to help wounded military and veterans by writing cards and letters, collecting personal care items, and making up gift boxes for hospitalized veterans. I have also been able to give and recieve support as the mother of a wounded service man.
The Silver Star Families of America	99448		/users/profile/119582	Cathy23	Volunteer	5	10/19/2011	I joined the Silver Star Families after my son was wounded in Iraq.  I wanted to help other servicemen and families who were going through the same thing I did. This organization honors and assists servicemen injured or wounded in a war zone.  We have written cards and letters of thanks and encouragement to the wounded, those suffering from PTSDand their families. We have provided gift bags of personal care items to VA Medical Centers as well as baked cookies and sent boxes of items to both Iraq and Afghanistan. We have given DVD's and CD's to various hospitals including Landsthul. We have honored the sacrifice of thousands of servicemen by awarding them the Silver Star Service Banner. 
The Silver Star Families of America	123362	1	/users/profile/121140	Hazel S.	Volunteer	5	09/26/2012	I have worked with Silver Star Families of America for 6 years.  It is the most wonderful and warm experience of my life.  They do everything they can to help our wounded and ill.  They work from donations only and really does need help.  Soldiers in hospitals receive help, veterans in hospitals and homes receive help, veterans on the street receive help - they go 100% of the way to find wounded or ill to help.  They have a wonderful PTSD program and a hot line for those that need to talk or are suicidal.  They are the best!  I will work with them until they are no longer needed - but there will always be wars and the need.  God bless them for the work they do.

Volunteering is so heart warming and rewarding and I can't think of any other organization that I would enjoy as much.  Steve and Diana are such an inspiration to everyone and they work tirelessly.  It is a truly a gift to our wounded that they founded SSFOA.  SSFOA needs more volunteers and I pray about it daily.  God bless our wounded and ill and all of our military veterans and active duty.  Our country is very blessed to have each one of them.  God bless America.  
The Silver Star Families of America	99903		/users/profile/121279	StarHeart	Volunteer	5	10/28/2011	I am a member of the letter writing team.  It is so heartwarming to participate in a program that offers support to our military who are deployed as well as those who have returned home.   This wonderful non-profit consistently communicates the needs of our wounded for letter writing volunteers to send cards of encouragement and well wishes.  Volunteers who take on leadership roles are true examples of the spirit of giving unconditionally.  The focus is on the mission and the number of people making it happen is a testament to the integrity and purpose for which this organization was founded.  I am proud to say I am a volunteer for the Silver Star Families of America.

The Silver Star Families of America	99811		/users/profile/121120	ldvhaynes	Volunteer	4	10/27/2011	The Silver Star Families gives me an opportunity to give back to those men and women who have not only given their lives literally but to the ones who made it home (sometimes with limbs missing and other horrible injuries).  I personally want to do something directly to affect their situations and this was the way I chose to do it.  I am so happy there are groups like the Silver Star Families who do care about the veterans who return home and while they are still away and follow up with them and keep tabs on their situations after they return.  They need help; any and all kinds of help.  We can go through these great organizations to give back.
The Silver Star Families of America	99445		/users/profile/119570	jgrace77	Board Member	5	10/19/2011	Silver Star Families is truly a mission that is all about giving our combat wounded, ill, injured and dying the recognition and honor they deserve. SSFOA is very careful and protective of how these wonderful heroes are treated, both those still serving and as Veterans. The org and its members hold its mission in highest esteem and work together to see it accomplished for our "kids."

Some of these Veterans have never been recognized for what they have done, but thanks to Silver Star Families they are not forgotten.

In 2005 the SSFOA became a 501 (c) 3 non profit public charity with the IRS. Most of the programs are very active and benefit wounded and ill troops and veterans from all wars.It has been a wonderful and emotional experience being involved with the Silver Star Families and I am grateful for this organization and the caring folks that keep it running smoothly.A newcomer can rest assured that at least 95 cents of each dollar goes directly to SSFOA programs!! The Silver Star Families of America is a non profit that does what they say they will with transparency and expedience.
The Silver Star Families of America	32272	6	/users/profile/33063	carol9	Volunteer	5	03/02/2010	I have been a member of this Organization for almost 2 years and volunteer on the Letter Writing Team and fundraisiers.  What The Silver Star Families of America does to honor the wounded, ill and dying veterans is a blessing.  So many of these veterans think that they have been forgotten for what they have done.  Well The Silver Star Families has not forgotten them.  One can never grown tired of seeing a Veteran honored with a banner whether they are from WWII or just home from Iraq.  It tugs at your heart when you see the tears in their eyes because they are being honored and remembered.  I can't think of anyplace I would rather be volunteering then where I am right now.  The Silver Star Families of America is like a second home to me.
The Silver Star Families of America	32245	8	/users/profile/33035	peteesdee	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2010	In May of 2008, I became a banner recipient of the Silver Star Banner.  As a Vietnam Veteran who was never welcomed home, this was quite an experience for me.  I had never been honored for my service to my country.  I suffer from PTSD and a host of Agent Orange related issues as a result of my service in Vietnam.  The Silver Star Families of America recognized that, and I proudly have a Silver Star Banner hanging in the front window of my home.  Not only do they honor Veterans that have been wounded, or are ill but they also remember the dying veteran too who has served his country.  They send prayer blankets to VA Hospices around the country and no Veteran who is wounded or ill or dying is ever forgotten by The Silver Star Families of America.  They also put out information about PTSD and TBI to educate the public. There are a lot of excellent organizations out there that honor Veterans, but The Silver Star Families of America is a class act in everything that they do. As a result of all of the above I have become involved in the Wounded Warrior Watch Forum which is a place that one can go for answers, comfort and companionship.
The Silver Star Families of America	32185	6	/users/profile/32973	padre	Volunteer	5	03/01/2010	Though The Silver Star Families of America has many programs to meet Veterans needs, it's main goal is to honor wounded, ill and dying Veterans from all wars and make sure these heroes are never forgotten. The org has succeeded in doing just that and is also working to establish May 1 as Silver Star Service Banner day across our nation, a day set aside to honor wounded, ill and dying Veterans together. I have seen the strong capabilities, determinations and accomplishments of the SSFOA and it is a pleasure to volunteer to help further this great mission.
The Silver Star Families of America	28120	8	/users/profile/29199	goldie	Board Member	5	02/12/2010	Silver Star Families of America was an organization that I joined to honor my husband who is a Wounded Vietnam Veteran.  Little did I know that SSFOA would capture my heart and soul and become a daily word in my family.  There is always something to do, and always Wounded and Ill and Dying Veterans to take honor.  With Silver Star Families in my life, I'm not sure what I would be doing right now, except that I don't think I would have much to get up for everyday the way I do now.  If you want to honor Veterans from past or present wars, well then this is where you should be.  You won't be sorry.   This is my other family.  It is a wonderful experience and I can't think of any other thing I would rather be doing then honoring those that served our Country.
The Silver Star Families of America	2014	10	/users/profile/3202	cestorey	Volunteer	5	11/22/2008	I joined the Silver Star Fmilies of America after my son, a US Marine, was wounded in Iraq. In addition to honoring and aiding those members of our military, wounded while serving in a war zone, they have provided moral support, friendship and understanding to me and my family. I have been honored to be able to help our troops in any small way that I can, whether it's raising money for banners to present the wounded, sending cards and letters to the troops and those hospitalized, or just offering a kind word and support to their families. The Silver Star Families of America has made it possible. They are a great and loving bunch, and I am proud to be one of them.
The Silver Star Families of America	1999	12	/users/profile/3181	MrsWildweasel	Volunteer	5	11/20/2008	I got involved with Silver Star Families after one of my sons best buddies in the MANG was injured, and trying to navigate the complex VA system to get his rating. He wanted to continue serving, but couldn't do so until he got  his rating.After talking with him and hearing the hoops he had to jump through and continue to jump through, I wanted to make a difference.I'm a vet myself, but served during the Cold War, I wanted to make a change and difference for the returning vets, especially the National Guard service member.Especially since they are like the forgotten ones of the military.In researching organizations, I came across Silver Star families, and read what they were all about, Honoring our Wounded. That was an organization I wanted to be involved with. This organization truly cares about the wounded and trying to make changes for their benefit.I am proud to be apart of this great organization.
The Silver Star Families of America	1997	11	/users/profile/3179	nancy	Volunteer	5	11/20/2008	I joined Silver Star Families of America looking for a place I felt comfortable at while working for and with our military and veterans. I was looking for a way to honor the thousands of wounded military members and veterans that suffer from visible and invisible wounds. There are many organizations that honor the visible wounds, but very few that honor the invisible ones. The invisible wounds are the ones that are dear to my heart as I watch my son and see what he experiences. SSFOA members do not allow any hero's sacrifice to go unnoticed, the members within the organization appreciate and show they care through the pride and effort they give in all the programs. It is very heart warming to come to any member and feel when they say they support the wounded, that it comes from deep within them and they will not harm the integrity of any of those that are wounded. I feel honored and privileged to work with the members of this organization, but to be able to present a banner that the wounded member richly deserves just thrills the soul to watch them with pride written all over their face while accepting it. The wounded warriors deserve to feel human and they deserve recognition. We cannot forget those injured in war, no matter what type of injury they suffer from and no matter what war it occurred in. The volunteers and the board members keep things organized and controlled while faithfully serving. And the cofounders of SSFOA did those injured a genuine service by starting this organization and anyone can tell, as they talk with them, that their hearts are completely in this effort. The wounded will not be forgotten with this organization moving forward continuously.
The Silver Star Families of America	1993	11	/users/profile/3174	gmmarbeiter	Board Member	5	11/20/2008	I am on the BOD with SSFOA.  I have served as a volunteer since 2006 (I believe).  I came to find out about it through our president, Janie Orman.  She and her husband have a prayer blanket ministry that was there for my husband and I (the whole family) when my husband got sick.  Then I was asked to be part of the prayer team and I hooked up with that, and through the course of that Janie and I would email back and forth and then she told me about SSFOA.  My husband was a VN Veteran who died from Agent Orange cancer, and Janie and Steve gave him the Silver Star Banner.  I was so touched by this in many ways.  The first being they wanted to honor Gene with the banner, and then to make it even more personal, Janie and her S-I-L Stephanie drove to FL from IN to personally present this to Gene. (In January no less)  It was an instant connection from there on with my whole family.  I talked to Steve for the first time that night in January after Gene received the banner.  Then one thing lead to another and so on, and before you knew it, they asked if I would like to be the State Rep for FL and from there came Ex. State Coordinator and Letter Team Captain and BOard Member.  I have grown to love SSFOA.  We are a family and have a heart for the wounded and we are there for each other.  I have developed many friendships through this.  It also was (is) a healing for me since the passing of my husband.  It is a wonderful group of people that I am blessed to call my family and friends.  We have come a long way in a short few years, with many mile stones crossed and many more to go.  I can see the hand of God on this from the get go.  Our founder and co-founder, Steve and Diana Newton are wonderful, loving and caring.  I am honored to call them friends.  They have been there for me MANY times, just to listen.  I have been honored to be at events and present banners and that is so rewarding.  I have been part of several different things with in SSFOA.This is a WONDERFUL GROUP.  Georgeine (George)
The Silver Star Families of America	1992	10	/users/profile/3173	Sunshine	Volunteer	5	11/20/2008	Being a member of Silver Star Families of America is an honor and priviledge.  I have received more joy out of what it stands for and honoring our wounded and ill soldiers.  The joy that I feel when I write a letter to a wounded soldier or to a Veteran that needs a boost makes my heart soar.  This organization is more that just that.  We are family.  I have found a home here, and I intend on doing everything in my power that I can do to make sure that every city in this country signs a proclamation to make May 1st Silver Star Banner Day a National day of observance to honor our wounded and ill.  The two people who are the founders of SSFOA are angels sent from heaven.  Without them this never would have been.  Then we have a wonderful team from our president to the rest of the officers of our organization.  Each and everyone of them put forth so much that you can't help but want to take part.  It warms your heart to know what you've done for a soldier or veteran.  I thank G-d everyday for being a part of this wonderful family.  I am truly blessed to know all of these people.  As our founder says, "Let us NEVER lose site of the mission, which is to promote, protect, honor and help our wounded and their families.  May God continue to bless American and ALL of her troops!"
The Silver Star Families of America	1991	10	/users/profile/3171	JO	Volunteer	5	11/20/2008	SSFOA is a wonderful organization who honors our wounded and ill service members. Being a volunteer in the SSFOA, who relys totally on donations, it is great to know that 98% of the funds raised goes toward the purchase of Silver Star Banners and programs directly assisting wounded and ill members of our Armed Forces. The heart of the org is to make sure that ALL who were wounded or incurred illnesses while honorably serving our country during wartime know we shall never forget their sacrifice and sevice. The SSFOA goes beyond wounds that are seen to also include wounds and illnesses that our service members suffer as a result of keeping our country safe and served in a combat situation. Our mission is to say THANK YOU, we HONOR YOU, WE WILL NEVER FORGET, and we do this primarilay by presenting Silver Star Banners to our wounded or ill war Heroes. This organization is awesome and I am proud to be a part of their wonderful mission.
The Silver Star Families of America	1990	12	/users/profile/3170	Trish	Board Member	5	11/20/2008	The longer I am a member of The Silver Star Families of America, the more Joy I feel in my heart.  Whether it be presenting Silver Star Banners and Certificates to a Purple Heart Recipient, or knowing I can contact my state Senator to help out a wonderful Veteran........it gives me a warm feeling of accomplishment on a daily basis.  My network of contacts grows each and every day making it possible for me to make a difference in the life of a Veteran, and it's All due to The Silver Star Families of America.  Without them as my 'backbone' and my 'support system,' I could never pull this off alone!!  I wake up every day knowing that I Can make a difference in someone's life........the rewards are endless, and I'm not talking about monetarily - I'm talking about that warm feeling in your heart that lets you Know that you Have helped someone today, and will be able to help someone tomorrow, the next day and the next, and so on.   As the saying goes, "Silver Star Shining for Sacrifice" - "They" sacrificed for 'us' - now 'we' owe them, and through The Silver Star Families of America, we are doing just that - giving back to them!!  May we continue to grow in numbers, and help our wounded and ill each and everytime they need us.  God Bless!!

They were well done. The social worker and foster/adopt volunteer were kind, passionate,  and well informed perspective to the classes. The classes helped prepare us for the foster adopt process. We look forward to taking other classes there too.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	234058		/users/profile/298138	lovelynoize	Volunteer	5	11/20/2014	I started as a donor through the Little Wishes program and became a volunteer because I whole-heartedly believe in the work and mission of the Coalition.  The staff works tirelessly to find children their forever families through innovative programs such as Extreme Recruitment and 30 Days to Family.  The Coalition also provides a wonderful variety of services and supports such as Parents Day Out, Training Extravaganzas, and support groups for parents and children.   As a member agency of the United Way , the Coalition measures and evaluates their programs to ensure time and resources are used effectively.   Donors can be sure every dollar they give gets put to good use.   I am proud to support this organization as it celebrates 25 Years and find Families for 2,500 Children! 
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	232017		/users/profile/295570	Keks	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2014	I'm the parent of a volunteer and have heard wonderful stories of her experiences and the great work the organization does. Our local newspaper has also covered the organization and its intense efforts to find a forever home for each child. Furthermore, as a teacher, I recognize the importance to a child of a stable home environment.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	229211		/users/profile/292860	up2mst2	Donor	5	10/28/2014	As a professional clinical counselor, i am aware of the long-term adverse impact of a lack of stability in a child's life.   The dedication of the Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition to find Forever Homes that will provide this needed stability for children is inspiring beyond words!    I have seen first hand how the expertly trained professional staff works tirelessly to protect and advocate for children.   FACC is a Gift - to the children, their new families and the community as a whole.   
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	229196	1	/users/profile/233347	kzeigler	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I am a volunteer and donor of the Coalition and quite simply it is an inspiring organization. To me, they achieve two objectives - finding permanent homes for children and providing support to both the foster children and foster families.  I can see how an organization might focus on one or the other yet the Coalition does both exceedingly well.  From the Extreme Recruitment program to Parents Day Out, the Coalition has an amazing variety of programs yet at the same time they don't duplicate work other organizations are doing for these kids.  The Coalition is not just about passion and enthusiasm however, although that is overflowing & downright contagious, the Coalition also measures and evaluates their programs to ensure limited time and resources are used wisely.  (Example:  I was part of the college mentor program which had exciting potential, however when the program didn't achieve its goals the Coalition ended it, which was the right decision to prevent inefficient use of time and resources.)  Because of this good stewardship, donors can be sure every dollar they give gets put to good use.  When I became less available to volunteer, I was thankful I could become a donor in a small way and I have never for a second questioned that every dollar I've given directly supports the children the Coalition serves.  So.... Efficient. Passionate. Effective. Inspiring.  I'm not sure what more anyone could ask from a nonprofit.  
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	228789		/users/profile/292474	3timemom	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	This is a terrific organization that takes its mission of finding forever homes for children VERY seriously.  The staff and volunteers are organized, compassionate, dedicated and -- above all -- they all love the children.  In every activity we do, we keep the best interests of the children as our paramount goal.  I have never volunteered for a better non-profit organization and feel it is a privilege to be able to contribute.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	228669		/users/profile/292349	jaslake	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	The most important gift we can give our Children is a loving, safe environment in which to live and grow. People who will spend their lives finding homes for Children in need of this loving, safe environment is one of the greatest gifts God has given us. The Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition does this in spades. Creating the "Forever Family"...For Every Child A Place to Call Home. God Bless them.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	228536		/users/profile/292224	JPHA	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I am a Donor and Enthusiastic Backer (capitalized because this should be a Proper Category) of the Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition.  A mission to help children, most of whom really don't have someone fighting for them, is as high a calling as I can think of.  You meet these kids and hear their stories of joy when that adoption comes through, or Extreme Recruitment has discovered a relative, and you just want it to happen again and again and again.  You want to be a part of that happening.  The Coalition makes that happen.  THAT makes for a fabulous organization.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	224847		/users/profile/288608	momlady3	Client Served	5	10/21/2014	I don't know where my family would be today if it wasn't for the Coalition; they have been with us since the beginning of our adoption journey - navigating the process, answering our questions (when no one else would!).  Our adoption was finalized several years ago - I had no idea that our family would have such a long lasting and supportive relationship with this agency.  As our kids became older, we struggled with several issues - managing our daughter's behavior took a tremendous toll on my husband and I - we didn't know what to do - we were physically and mentally exhausted.  Thankfully, we reengaged with the Coalition, started attending parent support groups, and, utilized the services of an educational advocate.  Our life has changed - our kids are having success in school, and, we have a supportive network of adoptive parents and professionals at the Coalition!  
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	224736		/users/profile/288495	Hemmputnam	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I am so impressed by the ongoing measurements used by the Foster Care Coalition.  This is what evidenced based practice at its best looks like!  I also appreciate how they fill the gaps left by other children and family service organizations rather than duplicating services.  I'm most familiar with the KidStore where I get to see the difference low cost clothing and baby supplies make for foster and adoptive families.  Their appreciation is heart warming, especially because they are the ones doing the truly hard work!
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	224699	1	/users/profile/232310	JanStL	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I have been a foster mom and now an adopted mom and I don't know if I would have been either without Foster Care Coalition. I was a volunteer and was strictly looking for adoption when I had a conversation with Nicki, she got me set up with a different organization then what I was with. From there I became a foster mom, I have only had 6 foster kids, and then I was staffed for my daughter and she moved in.  As an organization they are there all the way for you. They have their parents  day/night out, to give parents a break. They have their meetings with give both adoptive and foster parents a group of supports that have all been there. Not everyone knows what it is like to be a foster or adoptive parent and having others who are going through or been through what you are doing is so great. It takes a little stress off and reminds you why you are doing it and how to overcome some of those hills. They are also there for the IEPs for the kids/parents in helping the parents get the information and help that the kids need. I feel that they are part of your family team and help get the services and support you need to make sure these kids have every opportunity they deserve.  
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	175928		/users/profile/232310	JanStL	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I am writing to give my review on Foster Care Coalition. My journey started with them, so many years ago, I was just a volunteer with the Foster Friends, and was given the opportunity to spend some time with kids in Foster Care while their Foster Parents were given a short respite to do whatever they wanted. I had a blast being with the kids, we did soccor, we did race cars, we did a play and park, each event was such fun for me and I think for the kids as well. Five years ago I became of Foster Parent and still worked with Foster Friends, I then started attending their training groups and one to one groups. I was given such great information and was able to share and get information from others. This year I became an Adoptive Mom of a foster child. I know that Foster Care Coalition will be there for me for the rest of our lives, to give support and answer questions. This is such a great organization that has helped so many in the community and I plan to be a part of it one way or another for the rest of my life.  They changed my life for the better.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	202382		/users/profile/264053	nancykSTL	General Member of the Public	5	06/09/2014	Although I have not fostered or adopted, I support this agency because I know they really do what they say. They have been recognized nationally for their work, and it seems to me; what could be more important than finding a home for a child?  That's what they do, among a lot of other things. Friendly staff, just a great charity to donate to.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	182865		/users/profile/239743	David Singer	Board Member	5	10/27/2013	The Foster and Adoptive Care is one of the best run groups that I have been involved in.  The staff does an exceptional job laying out plans and then executing.  They have measurables for all of the programs that they run and exceed the expectations on every one.  They hold their staff accountable for results and disciplined in not taking on new programs that will stretch the group too thin or are not in keeping with the mission statement.  Melanie Scheetz the Executive director brings tremendous energy to the group and the board is engaged, diverse and dynamic.  I feel honored to be a part of the board and contribute to their continued success.

At  age 5 our son was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome and autism. We have turned to the Foster Care Coalition  many times and they have alway been able to serve us. From something as simple as how to sign up for services from the department of mental health to being assigned a educational advocate for my son at his school. They are the first I call when I need any type of help for my son. I'm very grateful for Foster Care Coalition.
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	182687		/users/profile/239559	lluke	Board Member	5	10/26/2013	I have been involved in many non profit organizations for years, donated time and money.  However, this organization has made a special place in my heart.  8 years ago I was introduced to them by a friend who asked me if I liked handbags...what girl doesn't?  With that I was quickly put on a committee for a fundraiser called "old bags"!  At first it was all about the handbags but then something happened, I started meeting amazing women who had more in common with me then their love of handbags!  The handbags party was just the beginning then I became a foster friend and went on to serve as a board member.  My parents have always been such an important part of my life, always there when I needed them for anything, to me every child deserves someone they can trust and who will be there for them!  FACC helps children find this special bond better than anybody!!  Another bonus is I have met some of the best people I know and have made friends for my lifetime that I also know will always be there for me!!

Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	181059		/users/profile/237770	mshockley	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	The Foster and Adoptive Care Coalition is one of the most amazing non-profits I work with.  I started working with them in 2002. We partnered on an adoption project called A Place to Call Home.  Our goal was to find forever families for children living in foster care. We have almost a 60% success rate... which is unmatched to any other program in the country.  We feature hard to place children due to their age or that they are part of a sibling group. Their stories air 4 times a week on the NBC station in St. Louis.   When I started working with the Coalition, they had 2 full time and 3 part time employees. Now, they have more than 24 full time employees and 5 part time. And why have they grown? Because they are filling gaps in services for children in foster care.  They don't duplicate efforts.  They find needs and fill them. But the most important thing about the Coalition, they never take their eyes off the mission: to find children forever families and to keep and retain foster parents.  If a project doesn't fit one or the other, they don't do it. Children in foster care are forgotten children. Just because they have food, shelter and clothes doesn't mean they are "taken care of." The Coalition makes it their mission to find these kids loving, permanent families and a chance at a future.   Without them, I know of more than 200 kids that would still be sitting in foster care.  You see A Place to Call Home has found forever families for all of those kids. Cycles are broken and lives are put back together.   
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	181012		/users/profile/237723	Clar489	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	From Cheryl _STL:  There are so many positive things that I can say about this organization Foster Care Coalition, this could go on for hours.  ... however, since my Introduction to the various services offered by the Foster Care Coalition of St. Louis in 2011, I have held on tight and have not let go as the benefits of their various services can and have been life changing particularly for me and my family.  Our first introduction was for a crisis in my home with two of my Foster children.  The crisis worker came right in and worked with us to resolve. This was a good learning process for all of us and extremely insightful, we all felt so very empowered by the process.  Through this service we were introduced to Education Advocacy services which we have been utilizing since 2012 and I just can't say enough about my advocate she is amazing, absolutely amazing, she listens to my concerns and she hears me and she has compassionately guided me through the process of getting services in place for my child who has special needs.   My advocate was extremely helpful recently in getting my son out of an unaccredited school district where he struggled and  into an accredited school district and a better suited school environment.  She guided us to a school district that could meet his needs allowing him an opportunity to excel educationally.  In essence all of my encounters with this agency have greatly improved our lives in such a positive way, we could not be happier. As a result I am more engaged with this organization and have referred so many people  to them for assistance as I am certain that this group will meet any challenge that comes their way in a positive and a proactive manner.  I cannot stop singing your praises as long as i have a voice.  FOSTER Care Coalition I could not imagine life as an adoptive parent without, thanks so very much for the support

I am not only a volunteer, I am a client and a partner. From my first experience with the coalition as a volunteer I was astounded by the deep and personal caring that each of the members of their team has for every child. They are dedicated, caring, considerate and always striving to be better for the kids.  After becoming a foster parent I have turned to many of their programs to help find clothing, resources and much needed guidance to better the lives of my kiddos! I have been able to experience from another side just how needed the programs they provide are and just how much of an impact they make. As a community employer I have been able to partner and work with the Coalition to provide opportunity to kids aging out of the system and looking to establish themselves. This program has shown me just how committed the Coalition is to full service, broad spectrum programs that leave no child or group of children without valuable programs.  One of the most impressive things about them is there dedication to pushing for the very best for every single kid and they never sit back and think they have done good enough. They always rise to the challenge of saying that they can do better for the sake of each of these kids. It is truly a pleasure to work with them.

Currently,  my daughter is working with an amazing art therapist. I have also had the Coalition's educational advocates come to school meetings for my son and daughter.

They are an amazing resource to adoptive parents.

Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	109794		/users/profile/149560	tagy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/12/2012	Thank You for starting ReFresh!!! I'm a foster care case manager and teenagers at my agency only have $200. per year to spend on clothes. I have one 16 year old in particular that just loves fashion, but feels like she's not able to have fun and be creative with her clothes. She feels like other kids can tell she's in foster care because of the way she dressed. Her 200 dollars a year barely covers her winter coat, shoes and undergarments. Since foster youth get 90% off at ReFresh, she was able to spend $50 and get twice as much as she could usually afford! I can tell she feels more confident and is having fun with her wardrobe. She's even talking about going through the job program at ReFresh now!

I can personally attest for the good this organization does for the St. Louis community by helping those children who are unlikely to be adopted through the traditional channels.  The FACC has been acknolwedged in the NY Times and most recently Time Magazine for its groundbreaking method of finding homes for foster children.  The campaign is called extreme recruitment.  It has been widely successful and is only in its infancy.  The employees and volunteers for The Coalition are beyond impressive in how much dedication they show towards the children and foster parents in St. Louis. I am very proud to be so involved with the FACC.

Moving to a more accessible location and opening a resale store were both wonderful strategies to raise awareness and also money!  Moving the annual Old Bags event to a new venue last year proved to be a great decision, and this spring's event is highly anticipated.  Despite the terrible economy, this agency has positioned itself to move forward with hard work and wise innovations.

I have been a volunteer for four years, and the impact that this organization has had on children is life-altering for them and breathtaking for those who work on the sidelines.  Finding homes for living, breathing people, who, through no fault of their own, are drifting, abused, and unloved, is the greatest mission that exists, and FACC exemplifies fulfilling that mission
Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	83051		/users/profile/91879	not aplicable	General Member of the Public	2	03/23/2011	This is in regards to the little wishes for Christmas from the channel 5 "a place to call home" program.  I intended to give little wishes to a couple of children in the name of people I know. I went through the process for one child age 17 because I know these kids are aged out and thought giving to older children would make them know someone cared.  I then picked another child wanting the same thing, went through the process and was told there were no more of this item available. When I tried to review my donation I found the first child had been deleted and this would go to the second child.  Not only did this mess up my Christmas giving (I didn't know who and if they would get an acknowledgement ) but my heart broke knowing these and probably others would think no one cared enough to pick and get them a gift and not understand it was a lack of resources. I'm sure a lot goes in to arranging this program, but wanted to let you know so perhaps this disappointment. Thanks, Kathy Burns

Foster Care Coalition of Greater St Louis Inc	70922		/users/profile/77531	AJRosenberg	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	From the moment you step into the Coalition you are surrounded by the sights and sounds of people who truly believe in and love what they do. The energy is infectious and you can't help but be moved to give more than you ever thought that you could. The smiles of the kids they help beam from pictures on the wall and each one of the Coalition members operates every day with the clear understanding that what they do every day is nothing short of saving these kids lives. The greatest thing we all strive for every day is to be loved by someone and the Coalition and its staff and volunteers exude love from floor boards to rafters. Love for their purpose, love for each other, love for their volunteers, love for the community and above all, love for the kids. As a volunteer I have never felt more like a part of a family then I have during my projects done with the Coalition. Every effort no matter how tiny is fully appreciated by everyone. One of the most impressive things about the Coalition is that they never set out to do anything good enough, they ALWAYS shoot for the best and in the lives of these kids that makes all the difference. As someone who is lucky enough to have a home to go to every night, the Coalition has made me a better person by helping me realize the many blessings we all have that we might take for granted. Many of these kids only wish is to have a home and for many of them the Coalition's support helps them come closer to that dream every day. They certainly all have a home in the hearts of the Coalition members and volunteers and we love to work hard to help find these kids permanent homes.  I am honored to be a volunteer and am so excited to tell other people about the Coalition. You will never meet a more committed, caring, loving, honest and service oriented group of people. I am humbled to be among them and I am truly lucky to be able to support their mission.

Board Member	5	02/17/2011	This is an amazing organization with a staff that is deeply committed to the children in foster care.  I first became aware of the organization when I saw "A Place to Call Home" on KSDK. I was so moved by the young man being interviewed that I immediately called FACC and asked how I could help. Their response was amazing in that they didn't ask for money but they told me of the many, many ways that I could  be involved in helping the children (though $$ is always welcomed!). When I met with a group of the staff members it was obvious that they love what they do and they love who they do it for, the children.  As I've become more familiar with the staff and board members I can honestly say that I've never been associated with a more dedicated group and I am very proud to be a small part of it, very proud to know that I've played a small role in helping the children that do not have the security of a family.

I can't imagine what it would be like as a foster child not to get any Christmas gifts.  With Little Wishes each foster child who participated would get 1-2 gifts.  The big goal is to find forever families for these kids.  FACC and their Extreme Recruitment team have done a wonderful job and I am very proud to known them.  The more money they receive the more permanent homes can be found for the foster kids.  Every kid wants a family and a home.

We also were able to discuss questions and concerns with other adoptive parents.  We learned so much to help us with raising our daughter in the best way possible.  Knowledge is a powerful tool to have and the Coaltion provided us with first hand knowledge.  In addition, if needed, babysitting was provided making it possible for some people to attend.

The pantry is always open taking care of the needy, also providing them with clean clothes. The list go on, not to mention proper  etiquette classes for all employees are a must. COLA go beyond to make sure that ones affiliated with this organization is allowing their light to show. I've been welcomed with open arms, and offered help with things I may need assistance with. I am forever great fully.

I have had 5 children that have attended the GALC and I am very proud of the service and education we have all received through this entity of C.O.L.A. Child care is very expensive especially for someone who has multiple children. The GALC provided me with affordable child care without sacrificing quality. My children were well prepared for elementary school when they entered on every level. The educators there are very attentive to and loving toward the children which is a necessity!!!! I have a new born that will soon enter the center and I am happy to not have the fear of sending my child off to a "babysitter" to watch and HOPE they take good care of my child. Instead I have the luxury of knowing that my child will be well taken care of, given as much love as I myself as a mother would give and will be given the necessary tools to prepare for the school age years and more. Thank you C.O.L.A. for your presence in our community.

Client Served	5	07/15/2016	I live over an hour away from this place and don't think twice about making the drive out there with my 3 cockatoos.  One of my birds has a beak that doesn't grow right and a toe nail that grows sideways and I know that she will do a great job of keeping them in great shape so my girl doesn't have any problems eating and getting around.  She has seen and done it all when it comes to bird issues.  She is the expert that I trust.  She is also the go to person for birds who have been abandoned in the wild by people too.  She has braved more lakes and ponds for ducks in need then most would ever get into.  She accepts all birds who owners wish to dump and provides them with excellent care and boarding free of charge.  If they can not be adopted out, she still provides a great life for them.  No matter how much they add on to their bird rooms, it seems there are always more birds in need to fill any open spaces.  They are a great charity that really helps birds in need.  Even if it means packing up and going to disaster areas to lend a hand.  Dr Burge is one you can always count on.  
Burge Bird Rescue	157616		/users/profile/209025	Sherri T.	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2013	This rescue does great work for the birds who need them.  They are not afraid to help any bird be a pet or wild bird who needs their help.  I have seen them save birds that others have long given up on.  They rescued ducks who were dumped in public, one with an arrow in it.  Helps people who have lost their pets, take in all needy birds, provide great information to people who have and want birds, travel all over to help where they are needed.  Provide a great temporary home to many many birds with special needs and care requirements with very little help.  Julie Burge has super long days, and does them without complaining, she is great and deserves the extra help.

Four of them have/had complex medical issues and need/needed special care. These birds would have been left to die by regular rescues but their lives were saved by Dr. Burge and then she waited for the right "forever home" for them. She taught us everything we needed to know to give them excellent care. When we moved to Texas and found a new veterinarian  for our flock, our new veterinarian could not believe we have two birds missing upper beaks. He had never seen that before and could not praise Dr. Burge's work enough.

Not many veterinarians deal with birds in this area, yet alone do surgery on birds.  The staff was wonderful and Dr Burge was extremely knowledgeable and just great. She fixed my baby up and I was able to take her home soon after. The work she does for this community is much needed: the rescue, the avian veterinary services, as well as the continuous education and awareness they provide.

Burge Bird Rescue	243065	1	/users/profile/329703	Tamara27	Client Served	5	05/15/2015	 I drove four hours, across the entire state of Missouri, from the Illinois side of St. Louis Metro area to Dr Burges rescue to adopt a parakeet.I had adopted keets from the Chicago area and at Independence, MO (not too far from Dr. Burge.)I filled out the app and spoke to them on the phone  and we arranged a day and time.There was about a 2 hour misunderstanding on the time,I thought it was 2 hours later than they did. THey were still very nice when I arrived. They had scheduled me around a surgery and I showed up at the wrong time. No problems. They were VERY kind to me. Nurse Julie(not to be confused with Dr. Julie!) went out of her way for me more than once. She went and got Benny, my new little guy. I wanted to take a photo of him in his travel cage, on his way to his new home. I went to the car and could NOT find my camera. I was panicked  (card had 5+ years of photos-) and Nurse Julie came out to help me look.I did not ask. We did not find it and I thought I had left it at a rest stop. We went in and Nurse Julie called MO Dept of Transportation so I could find out who takes care of the rest stops and maybe I could locate it that way.. that was no help as they had no clue. But Nurse Julie was very nice to help in that way. Again, all her idea. I did not ask her to call. I had no idea to contact anyone. (camera was found once I calmed down!) Nurse Julie filled me in on Benny's diet and habits. Then she told me how to get back to Interstate 70 to St Louis, It was very confusing as those highways criss cross over one another about a dozen times..I got onto the highway but got immediately lost. AAA tried to talk me to the right place but were driving me in circles. (They admitted they told me a wrong direction) I noticed I was at the exit to go to the rescue, so I went back , unannounced. Nurse Julie was very understanding and printed a map and went over it with me. I took the map and was back on Interstate 70 in about 10 or so minutes. Everyone was so kind and helpful despite my lateness (and what I thought) being a pest. Burge Birds are in wonderful health. WheN I took Ben to my vet , he looked at him and right away said "he is in perfect feather". Dr. Burge has been so kind with me too since Benny is now a member of my bird family. I have asked her more than once for info on Benny re: behaviour and medical history. And despite being a full time vet and running the rescue she has willingly taken the time to call me or message me to help me find out as  much as I can about my new little Benny. I think the** most important** thing and the thing that impresses me and I LOVE the most about Dr. Julie is that she takes the birds' feelings into consideration. She knows and recognizes and respects that they are more than little feathered robots.So ,so important and something I have never seen from a vet to be honest. She really deeply cares for these guys. She has many birds waiting for a loving home, please help Dr. Burge and the birds! I probably will be later again ,at some point!

Since I live more than 2 hrs away they were very nice to let me come up and spend as much time as I wanted to get to know the birds and pick out the best ones for our family.  I could not ask for more knowledgable and helpful people.  If any of the birds have any issues that need to be dealt with they are upfront with you about everything that you need to do to ensure the correct care of the bird and their adoption fees are more than reasonable . They also sometimes have several used cages for reasonable prices which is a big help when you need a cage for your new friend. It's a great place to get a bird!! Be sure to check them out!

Each and every bird is given compassionate, knowledgeable and thorough care, whether it be just grooming or life-saving surgery.	I first learned of Burge Bird Rescue several years ago when my Peach Fronted Conure became very ill and am firmly convinced he would not have lived as long as he did without their special care. It was like a breath of fresh air for appointments to be more like visiting with concerned family members instead of the, wham bam, take a number and stand in line, Maam, attitude so common with other bird vets.	Their dedication to and compassion for bird health and safety is apparent in their website, where they clearly state that they make house calls, (how many vets do that nowadays?) and maintain detailed information  on care, feeding and steps that can be taken in case of emergencies.	Ive since adopted birds from Burge Bird Rescue.  Theyre the only bird vet I will see.

Dr. Julie got my Indian Ringneck that I adopted from another local rescue organization healthy. It was not an easy task and took a while, but Aruba has been a healthy, happy bird for years now all because of her. When my youngest daughter wanted to adopt a bird, we naturally went to Dr. Julie. We found a green Quaker, JoJo, who has been a good friend to my daughter. One night, I trimmed JoJo's nails too short (he jumped when I was trimming them) and I could not get him to stop bleeding. I called Dr. Julie in a panic. She had me come in after hours and had the bleeding stopped in just a few minutes. I can not thank her and the staff at Burge Bird Services enough.

Dr. Julie helped me pick Katie, a cockatiel from "the bird pound" (Burge Bird Rescue), who needed some special daily care but who was a nice friend. A year later, I felt like Katie deserved a friend and I had found a bigger, easier to clean cage, Dr. Julie introduced me to a flightless buddy, Star. My two roomates are getting along nicely, and I like to know that I have Dr. Julie's support for manicures, boarding, and nose-jobs!  It is discouraging that every time I'm in there, somone is giving up a bird but I'm so happy they have a safe place to go. Thousands of souls are in your debt. Thanks for all you do.

Bisa aka BEASTA  has Never been seen by ANY other Clinic or Dr.  I also adopted "The Pips" from Dr Julie. I have NEVER had any concerns with ANYTHING when Bisa is in their care.  EVERY Bird is treated the same, with Care and Love.  Paying clients bird, rescue birds....doesnt Matter.  I had to Call Dr. Julie late one night after Bisa had been attecked by a Dog.  Dr  Julie saw us that nite and promised to Do EVERYTHING she could.  She  was also willing to give us a referral to K State.  I said  NO.   Bisa had surgery to close the gash on his head.  After a few days at the Clinic he was upset being away from home, so we continued his care at home.  He IS  AS  BAD  AS  EVER Thanks to Dr. Julie and Bird Nurse Julie !!

She not only makes sure that all the birds she takes in has the best medical treatment she helps the domestic ducks and other foul that people think it is ok to just let loose and fend for themselves. I have adopted a bird from her rescue unit. I feel so strong in what she is doing that I recommend her to a friend. I am so glad that there is a person like Dr. Julie to care for the winged Angles she rescues. I know she will earn her Angles wings one day. Thank You DR. JULIE

Julie saw my story and immediately contacted me wishing to help my bird no charge to me. We rushed him to her and she did surgery but it was to late for my feathered friend. Dr.Burge is an incredible lady and did all she could and more. I will not take my birds anywhere but to Dr. Burge. She is so dedicated in the care of any feathered creature and does an exceptional job. Thank you again Julie Burge for all you did for my turkey.

I have seen her put in hours and hours of concerned care in rescuing birds and caring for them with the utmost professionalism and expertise. There aren't words high enough to praise the work of this doctor and her volunteers.  They deserve every bit of good press that can be heaped upon them.  I wish more people would spend such time helping critters of all kinds; the world would be a far better place.

He was sociable enough to come right up to us, and we thought he couldn't fly - turns out he'd been out so long he was starving and was probably too weak to fly!  I took him to Burge Bird Rescue, and he was nursed back to health and is now up for adoption.

Many of these animals require a great deal of time, effort and sometimes financial resources to give them what they need in order to get them to a good home. In all instances, the animal's welfare comes first!

Doctor Julie has taken care of my birds for about 30 years,  Once when I had my parrot in for toe nail trimming, I told her I had taken a junco away from my cat that morning and she immediately fixed a hypo with antibiotics and said cat bites were almost always fatal to birds.  She told me how to give the shot.  I did.  The bird survived and I released it a few weeks later.  She's a wonderful bird veterinarian.  Knowledgeable and caring.  Nurse Julie makes the visits there warm and friendly.  I know from experience that Nurse Julie is an excellent caregiver.

Dr. Julie is gentle and builds a bond with her patient FID.  Her dedicated work for Rescue birds knows no limit.  She has worked very hard at rescue and has made trips out of state when a disaster hit.  She has also gone out many times to help capture a bird that got away from the owner.   Dr. Julie has been at least twice to help with birds that were removed from hoarders.  I honestly can't think of a more deserving rescue that deserves to be recognized.   
Burge Bird Rescue	106458	1	/users/profile/143846	Amanda18	Client Served	5	02/15/2012	I was told about Burge Vet by an aquaintance of my dad's. I had recently lost my beloved budgie, Bukkit, whom I had purchased from Petco. She was only with me for three months, and I loved her almost as much as she loved me. I was devistated from the loss, and I was interested in looking for a new budgie to help heal the gap in my heart. I went to BBR over Thanksgiving break to see her birds available for adoption. She introduced me to a semi-tame little female. They had found her out in someone's backyard. Freeflighted and no home they knew of, they named her Amelia. As I was holding the trembling bird, I leaned over and took a chance. She let me rub her head with my nose! SIlly, yes, but she closed her eyes and stopped trembling. I took her home with me. She has now been with me for over a year and I love her so much. She is obnoxious and loves to see how far she can throw her food out of her cage, but she loves me (in her own conditional way) and I enjoy talking with her. She usually has the last word in our sometimes intense conversations. She loves loud music, Disney movies (but not as much as she loves action movies), and climbing on my computer to look at her reflection in the screen. She is my baby in every way, well, more like a rebellious teenager. She may be a complete opposite of the late Bukkit, but she has healed my heart and will forever be treasured.
Burge Bird Rescue	106036	1	/users/profile/142613	Bj S.	Volunteer	5	02/05/2012	My role with Burge Bird Rescue has been two fold. I have been a volunteer, helping to raise funds for a larger rescue facility and a client. My beloved African Grey Parrot, JJ, stays with them whenever I go out of town. My motivation to help them build their rescue facility is that they share my love for ALL animals, not just people's pets. They also rescue animals in the wild and do what they can for them. My JJ also adds his recommendation: He is currently fully feathered and flys all over my house. He loves to play with me and can be very difficult to catch until he wants to be. When I asked him if he wanted to go see his birdie friends at Dr. Julie's he walked right over to me and stepped up on my arm! What more can I say!!

Client Served	5	01/08/2012	Following a serious car accident  someone gave me a 6 month old cockatiel who needed a new home as much as I needed a companion. In the past, I had cats and dogs in my life.Now alone and recovering from my injuries  Gabby, a pet bird was the perfect companion for me. I learned how important an avian veterinarian was when Gabby got a wood sliver from a toy imbedded in his mouth. The regular veterinarian told me Just keep on eye on him for a couple of days. NO WAY! I had heard of Dr. Julie Burge at a Bird Club Meeting and immediately went to her. She knew how serious this was. She saved Gabbys life! After 8 years of people telling me I needed more than one bird  I knew I wanted to adopt a rescue companion for Gabby someday.   On a regular wing and nail trim visit  Bird Nurse Julie declared a new rescue was perfect for Gabby and me! She opened the cage door to introduce me to this most adorable happy cockatiel -singing for joy, he run across the cage to her, and immediately put his head down for her to rub his neck! (Gabby never let me mess with his feathers!) This poor bird had been found by someone flying outside, on untrimmed wings and a broken leg! Yet here he was so happy and singing ---with a little cast on his broken leg. Somehow he knew he was the luckiest bird in the world because someone had brought him to Burges Bird Rescue.  Five years later, Skippy is still a happy, singing little guy. He loves to travel and is an instant friend to everyone he meets. For unknown reasons, Skippy has a special affinity for UPS Delivery Drivers. Unprompted he reserves his biggest wolf whistle for greeting Brown and making his day. I like to think theres one happier truck driver out on the roads on those days!  Skippy and Gabby share a life and cage with a true love/hate sibling rivalry as if born to it. They have totally different personalities but we are a happy family. Theres no place like Burge Bird Rescue! No one would have taken in, treated and given a little bird with a broken leg a chance to live. No one but Dr. Burge, Nurse Julie and the staff would have given Skippy a chance to bless my life and the world every day.

Care to put together care packages for troops who are deployed. It is a friendly competition between us to see how much we can put in the box and still close it.  Last year, we set out to collect enough donations for 101 care packages to send to a unit deployed through Christmas. H.E.R.O.E.S. Care allowed us to use their space and when we ran out of donations, they gave us items to continue packing boxes. We finished with 103 boxes, but H.E.R.O.E.S. Care wasnt finished. They ensured the boxes were addressed and shipped. We paid for the postage, they did all the coordinating and delivering to the local post office.  Dave, Jon and the rest of the H.E.R.O.E.S.

H.E.R.O.E.S. Care, Inc.	287401	3	/users/profile/377492	Writer	Client Served	5	04/27/2016	I am very grateful for all that H.E.R.O.E.S. Care does for the military families.  The staff is very friendly and supportive.  My story is simple.  In the fall of 2008, when the economy started tanking, I lost my job, my home, and my good credit.  As luck would have it, I lost my job just weeks after buying our first home in Los Angeles, CA.  I would lose the home in foreclosure, my credit cards would all go into default because I was trying to save the house, and in turn, my strong credit would be destroyed.  In the years that followed, every additional penny earned has been spent on recovering from the negative impact a foreclosure and defaulted credit lines had on me.  I joined the Reserves a few years ago and one of the immediate benefits I received was the ability to utilize the food pantry.  It may sound cliche, but truly "every little bit helps" when trying to recover from financial demise.  Because our focus over the last 7 years has been to get out of debt and repair negative credit lines, we don't go out very much.  However, thanks to HEROES Care, we've been able to attend a few ball games and hockey games, which my boys enjoy very much.  Additionally, they've supported my unit's Holiday/Christmas event each year and also provide school supplies as well.It's those little things that add up over time.  I am very grateful to the men and women who volunteer at HEROES Care and to all the very generous donors who make it possible.  I am looking forward to the day when I will be in a better financial position so that I can become a frequent donor to HEROES Care.Thank you to all of you at H.E.R.O.E.S. Care!-Luis

Our Ministry is to assist Active Duty, Veterans, and their families. We have proudly worked with and supported the work and  the hard work and dedication of H.E.R.O.E.S. Care Inc. and urge anyone with a real passion to come beside our brave men and women, both young and old to either assist physically or financially as God would lead your heart to do.  As a U.S.A.F. Veteran myself, I know the anxieties and complexity of issues our Veterans are going through on a daily basis.  I see the numbers (22 a day) of those who give up and commit suicide because organizations like ours have not been able to reach them. Please, we can't do it alone.

I can't tell you what a morale booster it was for the Marines to be able to have a cold soda or sandwich after working hours (eating MREs every day for two weeks gets old fast).

While my husband was waiting for his disability claim to go through our family of 5 was on the verge of homelessness. After calling countless charity organizations and receiving little to no help, I had lost hope. After one conversation with H.E.R.O.E.S. Care, I felt hope for the first time! They instantly send someone to my home with donations of food, diapers, and clothes and then the help continued to pour in from there. All in all they saved us from homelessness, bought my children Christmas gifts, provided us with necessities and most of all showed us that they DID care and gave us hope when we were alone and scared! I will forever be grateful to H.E.R.O.E.S. care for helping my family in our desperate time of need.

As a former soldier, wife of a current soldier, and also current FRG (family readiness group) lead they are always there when we need them.  I was also a lead volunteer when the guys were on state emergency duty for a month for floods last summer.  Another wife and I had spent the morning collecting items to take to Heroes Care after our FRG decided we would like to donate something to them for all they do.  We arrived with a truck load and left with a truck load of items to deliver to the soldiers on SED.  We didn't plan on taking anything with us, but of course they wanted to make sure we did not leave with an empty truck.  That night the guys each got their own box of GS cookies as well as many other items and they also had a connection with a truck load of Gatorade to donate and helped me make arrangements to have it picked up and delivered to them on duty, what a surprise for them.  My husband's work drove the truck and dropped off the pallets.  They are also always there when we need items for soldiers families, every time I call or refer a soldier they are very helpful.  My family and I (about 15 of us) decided to help them out one day and spent the day doing inventory and rearranging items, they were going to feed us, imagine their surprise when we had brought our own food too!  All the kids had fun and expressed interest in doing it again when we are all together.  I was able to help another wife get furniture while her husband was deployed and deliver it to her home, he was surprised to see the pictures and she was thrilled.  Heroes Care is always doing something, big or small, to make sure needs are met and wants can be too.  I love working with them and appreciate everything they have done for both units that I take care of.

This is the organization that Prince Ministry supports. This year has been the greatest year yet, for moving forward. This year another house was opened, and now we have 24 children in care. We also opened our own school up through 3rd grade. The children are doing so much better in their new environment, with teachers who really love what they are doing. We are in the process of building a chicken coop, and enlarging the garden, so we can save money and be more self sustaining. We want to add another teacher next year, but we must raise the $1,000 monthly to pay for the teacher. This teacher would be taking care of 4th, 5th and maybe 6th grade.

Our children are from 2-15 years old. We are hoping to open our own private school in the next year or two, which will improve the education.

The people are giving their everything to uplift children with poor circumstances. The children all looked happy and well cared for. What impressed us was the houses which was run by house mom's and the fact that brothers and sisters are kept together in one house and not divided between 2 houses. The school which the Fold are running was of high standard. We could see that love and care for the children was the main purpose of the Fold. We were so blessed by visiting them.

I feel a great sense of satisfaction investing in the lives of these children. It's my goal to gather to us, others of like passion.  Our 30 year goal is to have as many as 8 houses with as many as 8 children in each house. Our own school is quickly becoming a reality and a dream come true.  We will obviously be needing increasing support as we grow toward the end goal. We are pleased to report that awareness and support of this ministry is growing.

Prince Ministry in South Africa	266159		/users/profile/354926	Trokkie	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	Being part of The Fold Children's Home is one of the most fulfilling things I have done in my years of working, it is not just a job but a calling / passion. When I arrived at The Fold I immediately fell in love with the children and knew I was at the right place. At The Fold there is a great family bonding and strong relationships between Co-workers and Children. Everyday here is a challenge and just by being part of these kids life and realizing how privileged I am to be part of this great thing knowing that someday these children is South Africa's next generation. If you are at The Fold whether it is full time or just by being part, you definitely know that God is real!!!

Prince Ministry in South Africa	255761		/users/profile/344145	tpage	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I have worked with The Fold when I came to visit South Africa. They are helping children to have a safe environment where they can thrive and grow. The kids are happy and get many opportunities for their future because of living there. I am impressed with the system they have and hope to visit them again. 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	210650	1	/users/profile/273430	scarrillo	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	To put it simply, The Fold changed my life. My first visit to The Fold was in September-December of 2011. I had just graduated high school and did not know what to do with my life. I came to The Fold rather than starting college right off the bat. During my stay, my heart broke for the children here. I had such an amazing time that when I left, I knew I wanted to go to Bible College to get a Missions degree. Now I am in my senior year of college, an intercultural studies major, and I am completing my extended internship here in SA where most of my time will be spent at The Fold. I knew I could not live the rest of my life without returning here, and I am sure I will be back. The people here are visionaries with their hearts set on doing God's will. This work is not easy, and not even desirable by many, but it is diligently done because God has instructed them to do it. The love, care, and attention the children receive is incredible. I have seen several people come to The Fold and heard many others' stories, each person was changed in some way after being here. They not only give their all to make sure the children are well taken care of, they also go out of their way to help the volunteers in any way they can, whether it be emotionally, physically, or spiritually. The Fold is a fairly new organization, so many things are still in the making, but the visions and ideas of what it will be like in the future are equally as incredible as the work going on in the present. I am so glad I came here, and there is no other place I would rather be right now. I thank God for the people who answered God's call and share His love with children who so desperately need it.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	205154		/users/profile/179851	judi blomquist	Donor	5	07/04/2014	Having visited The Fold Children's Home in South Africa two years ago, I can say confidently that all donations are gratefully received and used to the max!  Paul and Micky Prince have sacrificially given their all, both their resources and their lives, to improving the lot of these needy children.  Two years ago, my husband and I purchased and delivered school supplies to The Fold, in conjunction with a hunting trip to the area.  Then, again last year, I sent a former student to The Fold for the summer, and had her bring a big suitcase full of clothing, school supplies, and toys for the children.  The goal is to someday be able to conduct daily school classes at The Fold, as it is often difficult to afford to send them in to the nearest town for their education.  The Fold relies on volunteers to help tutor the children, and to provide recreational opportunities for them.  Any efforts beyond personal volunteers to help support this worthy act of love are greatly appreciated.  One day, these children will grow up and begin to pay it forward, thus improving the lives of a new generation in South Africa.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	167264		/users/profile/179851	judi blomquist	Donor	5	09/05/2013	Having visited The Fold Children's Home in the Limpopo region of South Africa over a year ago, my husband and I were impressed with the amazing work done by Paul & Micky Prince.  They have dedicated their lives to the betterment of the lives of children in that region, who have been either orphaned or left to fend for themselves in a very difficult economic situation. We have donated money, gently used clothing, school supplies, and other necessities to The Fold, and I can honestly say that every donation has been directed to the needs of the children, one hundred percent!   In addition, I encouraged and helped to send a former student of mine to also volunteer at The Fold for an extended stay, and she came away with inspiration to continue the work began by the Princes.  A visit to The Fold changes ones world view--guaranteed! The Prince Ministry practices good stewardship of any donations received, and they are constantly networking with individuals and organizations to further their work among the children.  Amazing results have already occurred, and more to follow with added support. I can't rave enough about the wonderful work taking place with the Prince Ministry in South Africa.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	134081		/users/profile/179851	judi blomquist	Donor	5	11/06/2012	My husband and I visited The Fold when on an African Safari in May, 2012.  The professional hunters at Kawalata Wilderness supported them and have urged all hunters coming to South Africa to bring school supplies and other necessities for the children at The Fold.  Upon visiting The Fold, we were impressed with the alll-consuming desire of the Princes to meet the needs of the children.  We immediately sensed the passion they both felt for giving these children a home, an education, and a hope for the future.  Their ability to network to get things done is amazing!  It seems that they always have volunteers coming and going to help the children.  I wish we could have stayed awhile to help them out!  I find myself looking back at photos of the kids.  Any support that they can receive, both monetarily and through volunteers, helps the children IMMEDIATELY!
Prince Ministry in South Africa	204646		/users/profile/266680	Lisa360	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2014	I have been aware of The Fold for a while now, and I was so amazed by their story that I just had to go. What they are doing for the children there pulls on my heart strings, so in October, I will be traveling there to serve. I am looking very forward to meeting the children and working for this wonderful organization. They have done amazing work there and could use the support of anyone who has a heart for the work that they are doing! 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	199568		/users/profile/260521	chic_alexis	Volunteer	5	05/03/2014	The Fold is such a wonderful place! Children from the nearby town of Vaalwater are being taken care of by stunning people who truly care about them. I was able to stay there for a few weeks last summer and was absolutely blown away by all that the Fold is doing for these kids. The children are valued and important and will one day be able to take all that they have learned at the Fold back into their community. I believe that the leadership being taught to the children at the Fold will help build a stronger South Africa one day.  
Prince Ministry in South Africa	199305		/users/profile/260211	Michael241	Volunteer	5	04/30/2014	I have been blessed to be able to visit and help out at The Fold on three different occasions. The Fold is doing a wonderful work as they teach children to be responsible for themselves and those around them. The staff at The Fold have given their lives to be mentors for the children and to be respected members of South Africa.  Each visit I have made I have seen growth in all areas including knowledge of the bible in each child. I truly believe that what they offer by taking care of the health and welfare of these children will give each one the opportunity to be who ever they want to be as they become responsible citizens of their communities... I pray that more people and organizations will take a look at what great things are happening and will happen in the future at The Fold.  
Prince Ministry in South Africa	199171		/users/profile/260056	Teresa53	Donor	5	04/29/2014	This is a tremendous organization!  They are very caring people, who are meeting a great need in South Africa.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	199170		/users/profile/167208	Michael106	Volunteer	5	04/29/2014	The Fold has been a work of Prince ministry in South Africa for years.  Their systematic approach to every part of taking care of the children in this hope is very noticeable.  Their attention to quality in provision for the children shows in the structure, physical and spiritual.  Their commitment is for a lifetime, the lifetimes of the children in their care.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	182523		/users/profile/167208	Michael106	Advisor	5	10/25/2013	I have worked with Paul and Micky at The Fold Childrens Home for years now.  They have been inspirational in their collection of data, developing resources, and acquiring the information needed to be not only legal but to absolutely be caring of the children placed with them.  If you ever need an excuse to do something good and want to do it in South Africa, I'm sure they would greatly appreciate your help. Look now, support financially, or plan a trip to contribute to their needs at the facility in South Africa.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	122764		/users/profile/167208	Michael106	Advisor	5	09/21/2012	I have worked with The Fold since before it became The Fold.  The people are dedicated to helping children in Limpopo South Africa where many turn a blind eye.  Paul and Micky have decided not to ignore a huge problem with child care in this part of the world and sacrificed their time, money and conveniences for the sake of helping those desperately in need. Many cheers for them as they elect to spend their life taking care of those that nobody else wants.  This orphanage is a regular stop on our work projects from teams recruited to make a difference.  It is easy to make a difference with them.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	198965	1	/users/profile/167194	Betty13	Volunteer	4	04/25/2014	August, 2014 will be my 4th trip there from St. Louis, Mo. It is so rewarding to visit and work with the children. That children's home is such a blessing to those children. There is so much love there for each other and their faith is so strong.  God bless them all. Some of those had no or little schooling before going there and now are getting the best. I did jobs around there and played with the children. The last time I was ill most of the time, so I did sewing away from them just in case. I am 77 years old and enjoy those children.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	179333		/users/profile/167194	Betty13	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	These great Christians sold everything, moved to South Africa forever. They have purchased land, have 2 children's home and have taken in 16 children so far. The children are being raised in loving Christian homes. And going from no schooling to getting the best.  I have been there 3 times for a total of 8 weeks.They are doing a great job.  I am also a donor and every cent goes to those children and what is needed to raise them in a loving Christian way.  Micky and Paul are both military retires and have their own income.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	153712	1	/users/profile/167194	Betty13	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I am Micky's Mom. Sept, 2013 will be my 4th trip over there. At 76, I will go as long as I have my health. I am in awe to see God's hand in all that happens there. Micky & Paul have sold everything to spend the rest of their lives taking care of and training as many children as they can to have productive Christian lives. When there is a need, it seems to me that God knows ahead of time and it is there for them.Every penny donated goes to the care and support of those children. Micky & Paul both have retirement checks for their support and their forwarding agent is Micky's sister and charges nothing. I donate every month even tho I am a widow with fixed income. I hope all will donate and go over to see for yourself and do some work for them, even if it is just reading books to the little ones.  AND write something here.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	122752		/users/profile/167194	Betty13	Donor	5	09/21/2012	Volunteer and donor! I donate every month and have gone over to help 3 times and plan to go over next year. You can just see God's hand in what is going on over there. I encourage all to do the same. It is a blessing to be a part of doing good for those children.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	198901		/users/profile/259726	Mollie S.	General Member of the Public	5	04/25/2014	We keep n contact with this ministry and the more we hear from them we grow deeper in love with them.  We are planning a trip visit them soon.  They give so much one on one with the children under their care.  They teach then they are loved not only by them, but by their heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ.  They do an excellent job of sending pictures and keeping us informed.  I feel that I am almost right there with them.  We work on our church missions board and I can tell you that not all missionaries keep you as well informed.   
Prince Ministry in South Africa	182556		/users/profile/239386	Lori Aplin	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2013	This ministry selflessly gives to make each child feel loved. They are Jesus' hands and feet and through their actions they share Jesus with each child   As an individual who spent time in orphanages, I'm impressed with the 1:1 time given to each child   The pictures show the joy of Jesus!  The love is contagious and makes me want to be a part of it all. I've taken the extra step to make plans to personally visit.

Prince Ministry in South Africa	178518		/users/profile/235149	Margaretlu	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	The Princes visited in South Africa, saw the need to help deserate children, came back to the United States, got rid of their possessions and went to help those in need in South Africa.  Each child is treated, loved, cherished, and schooled as if each one were the only one.  Love abounds at "The Fold".
Prince Ministry in South Africa	178415		/users/profile/235052	Kathy134	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	The Fold  have answered the call to take care of orphans in their distress and they are doing.a fantastic job of it.  They are becoming sustainable with garden and game and use every resource God gives them.  They are training young men and women to be Godly and the changes that will come from them are yet to be known, but I am excited to see what those will be.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	178396		/users/profile/235030	SandieC	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	Whilst on holiday in Waterberg Feb 2013, my children and I visited The Fold Children's home. We left a few hours feeling truly humbled by the selflessness, hard work and dedication of Micky and Paul and the wonderful house mothers in the team. I found myself particularly drawn to the the beautiful spirit of house mother Fatima Mahlase. We are in touch and her wisdom and aura of peace and positivity still regulalry captivate me, what a special woman to have in such a special place. Paul and Micky are tow of the most godly people I have ever met. We are returning in Feb 2014 to visit The Fold and show our support again. 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	178392		/users/profile/235017	Rebeccam	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I greatly enjoyed my time at the fold. While I was saddened by the fact that Paul and Mickey were in the states at the time that I visited, I still had a blast working with the kids. Baby Lucky still holds a dear spot in my heart as do the others. I wish I could go back in the near future just to see the progress they have made. But it seems it will be a while. Paul and Mickey are amazing Christian leaders and do a fantastic job managing this ministry. I love them dearly!
Prince Ministry in South Africa	167806		/users/profile/222694	EllenSmith	Donor	5	09/06/2013	I support this organization.  I keep up with their news updates and news letters.  I have talked with people that have visited "The Fold" so know first hand what a wonderful home this is for children that are no longer wanted or cared for by their families.  They make sure that they are taken to the doctor to keep up with medications and to get medicine when they are sick.  Bit by bit, child by child they are making a huge impact in South Africa and it will spread even further as these kids grow up.  Their education and even tutoring is closely followed.  They are working hard to meet a need in that community to make a difference in children's lives and I am sure impacting the adults they employ as well.  What a blessing to be involved in this ministry. 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	167626		/users/profile/222491	thomason.alexis	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	Over the summer, I volunteered at The Fold Children's Home: South Africa for five weeks. Paul and Micky Prince, who run the Home, are incredible people who are giving the 16 kids who live there a hope and future. Not only are the children learning what it's like to live in a family, but they are also learning what it means to be a person of character, since they have such wonderful examples. This organization is raising children to realize their potential and become so much more than their culture allows them to dream they can be. Each kid is worth it, and change will happen in the slums in South Africa, one step at a time, because of this organization.  
Prince Ministry in South Africa	167232		/users/profile/170052	Terri12	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	Visited The Fold in Sept 2012 and was amazed at the great work Paul and Mickey are doing!  The kids are so precious!   Great place!
Prince Ministry in South Africa	124958		/users/profile/170052	Terri12	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	I volunteered to help with the children while they were on break from school.  it was a blessing to experience the faith and hope that Prince Ministry gives to the children of South Africa.  Paul and Micky and their staff are amazing with the children they have in in their home. It was such fun to participate and experience the smiles and love of the children they have at The Fold.  Anybody who visits will be blessed by the experience.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	167171		/users/profile/34449	mickycaz1	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	Prince Ministry runs a children's home in South Africa. The progress in the last two years have been nothing short of amazing. They have gone from having one home with 7 children to having two homes with 16 children. They already have a third home ready to open for another 8 chldren, as soon as they can raise the money to support this additional home.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	157110		/users/profile/208346	DebSch	Board Member	5	05/04/2013	Everyone involved in the support of the Children's home understands the importance of breaking the cycle these children were born into.  The children are being surrounded by people who have excellent morals and a loving nature.  Much effort is being spent on education/academics, as well as teaching responsibility, so these children will grow up to be capable, loving adults. The organization is supported by the local community, and caring communities around the globe.  So much has been accomplished through volunteers and donations of material goods.  We have volunteers who handle a variety of services, including administrative tasks, construction of every type, tutoring, mailing services, public relations, printing/publishing, accounting, maintenance around the property, artistic talents, and the list goes on. With all of these services donated by volunteers, it allows us to concentrate our monetary donations on the direct support of the Children, and building additional homes to help more Children. From:Volunteer Treasurer/Forwarding Agent
Prince Ministry in South Africa	130658		/users/profile/176139	June L.	General Member of the Public	4	10/29/2012	My husband and I visited The Fold in October, 2011.  We interacted with the children and toured the grounds.  We were impressed with Micky and Paul's obvious dedication to the children's welfare.  Knowing just a bit about the red tape that exists for NPO's to operate there, we were also impressed with the progress they've made since moving there.  The potential of this home is so very great.  In my opinion, Micky and Paul are worthy of financial support and prayers.    
Prince Ministry in South Africa	125044		/users/profile/170157	mrodell	Volunteer	4	10/10/2012	I spent a month in South Africa with the Prince's last February.  Even though the chidren's home is still fairly new, the impact that they are making in the kid's lives is amazing.  Can't wait to see them grow in the upcoming years and experience (hopefully, first hand again) the ways that God is changing lives at the Fold.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	125020		/users/profile/170132	K8UZR	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	I had the opportunity to visit The Fold with another non-for-profit to do painting and work in the houses. We met Paul and Mickey and were introduced to the kids and house mothers.  We were received warmly and made connections right away. I was impressed by the organization of the orphanage and the methods used. 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	124949		/users/profile/170038	jenlhayes	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	My family is visiting Prince Ministry because we are considering moving to South Africa to work with them as missionaries. We have asked a lot of questions and spent a lot of time observing day to day operations. We have been very pleased with all aspects of their ministry. They are doing a wonderful job in working with orphans and vulnerable children in the area. I highly recommend a visit to their property, The Fold.

Prince Ministry in South Africa	123055		/users/profile/167626	churchfriend1	General Member of the Public	4	09/25/2012	I have known Paul and Mickey Prince for almost 20 years.  They are two dedicated people who love the Lord and want to serve Him.  They also have a heart for children to be given a chance not just for survival but to make a difference in their lives.  They have overcome many obstacles in the time they have now spent in that part of Africa.  They have improved the property and built the necessary housing to do their work....take in children who need a home, a place to grow and develop into adulthood.  They believe they have been led by God to serve in this way.  And they are determined to make a difference.  They have inspired others to take the same step of servanthood.  In telling their story to churches, to friends, and getting the word out over internet to reach those who would be interested, capable and willing, they have been successful in their work.  They have a vision that God has given them to minister, to love and care for those little children by taking them into THE FOLD---by giving them an opportunity---a life!   They report regularly on their work and how they have used funds and donations in the most effective way to accomplish their goals.  I pray the Lord will continue to bless them and their work.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	122771		/users/profile/167218	vogt4	Donor	5	09/21/2012	It is amazing the work that is being done for the children in this home. They have grown so much in their ability and education. There are so many more that can be helped, if only the money could be donated on a larger scale.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	122761		/users/profile/167205	Julie75	Donor	5	09/21/2012	We have supported Paul and Mickey since the beginning of their decision to go to Africa. We are amazed at their obedience to Gods word, selflessness to serve the children and people of South Africa. They are by far the most responsible and steward-conscious missionaries we know. We are proud of them and their work. May God continue to bless them. 
Prince Ministry in South Africa	99208		/users/profile/118715	Mary234567891011	Volunteer	5	10/11/2011	I was privileged to help Prince Ministries for a week while visiting South Africa.  Being able to work with the children at The Fold was the most amazing experience ever!  To read to them and play with them and help them to learn about Jesus was truly wonderful.  They are living in wonderful surroundings now, where they get the influence of house parents who really care about them.  The children who are there are orphans and after they get adjusted to rules, they do very well. It was a learning experience for both the children and myself.  Language did not get in the way, we all felt love towards each other.
Prince Ministry in South Africa	34514	4	/users/profile/26580	Michael	General Member of the Public	5	04/02/2010	I was here when the Princes settled in South Africa.  When they arrived they had an idea that they would be part of something that would make a difference in this country, and in specifically Limpopo.  Shortly after they arrived they learned that they would not be part of something, but rather would be something.  From that day on they have been undaunted in their approach to learn what needed to be learned, file what must be filed, figure out what needed to be figured out so that they could realize their dream of caring for children of need in this area.  Bravo!
Prince Ministry in South Africa	33690	6	/users/profile/34506	boverocker	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	Prince Ministry of South Africa allowed me to have an adventure of a lifetime while working to help them with their missionary work in South Africa.  I was truly blessed to have had this experience of working with the missionaries that are doing so much to help the people of South Africa to improve their lives. In the local community, I witnessed much cooperation with other missionaries in the area to lay the ground work, set in motion and continue to do good for others.  I participated in the preparations and distributions at weekly soup kitchens.  I attended weekly bible classes and church services led by area missionaries and local Christian to help spread the Word to others and give them hope for their tomorrows. Prince Ministry supports families by collecting and distributing food and home supply boxes for families and school supplies for children. All this work is in addition to The Fold Children's Home which is the main mission of Prince Ministry.  The Fold is in the building stages of becoming a Children's Home.  The land they have purchased and the buildings will be come homes to local children that have no home.  It will be run like a true Christian home with a set of hired parents and local foster children living in a home like a family.  The house and help will be provided by The Fold. What has already been accomplished and what the dreams are for The Fold is truly amazing!  The possibilities of what Prince Ministry can do for the people and children of South Africa to give them a start on a productive life are miracles in motion. I was privileged to be able to do some work at The Fold.  Amongst all the little tasks that were performed, I sewed hems on donated sheets which were cut down and resized for use on the children's beds.  Scraps from the sheets were also made into pillow cases.Now that I am home, I continue to encourage others to help Prince Ministry through conversations and presentations to local groups about my experiences in South Africa. By supporting the works of Prince Ministry of South Africa, you too will have a hand in helping others achieve success in their lives.

Marian Middle School	316713		/users/profile/228427	turner1973	Client Served	5	10/30/2016	My daughter was accepted as an incoming 6th grader, and it was a blessing! Sarah thrived, and had opportunities that she would not have had in public school . She went on to the IB program, where she excelled, and she earned a full scholarship to Hofstra University iN NY. She is a freshman at Hofstra this year, and our family still stays in touch with many of her former teachers from Marian. We appreciate everything they did for our child, and our family. 
Marian Middle School	246110		/users/profile/228427	turner1973	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	My daughter attended Marian Middle School for 6th and 7th grades. We then moved out of STL. She is 16 and was accepted into NYU'S Summer program this year. She (and we, as parents), credits Marian Middle School for building her knowledge, her self-esteem and encouraging her to succeed. I wish that every young lady had the opportunity to be a Marian student.  
Marian Middle School	172501	1	/users/profile/228427	turner1973	Volunteer	5	09/30/2013	My daughter heard about MMS when some students came to speak at her school the end of her 5th grade year. She was so excited, she got permission to call me and ask if she could apply...right after the presentation. I researched it, and found out I wouldn't have to sell a kidney for her to attend, and we started the process. We were ecstatic when Sarah was selected, and as we became part of the Marian family, we couldn't believe our good fortune. Not only did MMS set the bar for academics, it set the bar for what a school family should be. As parents, we were actively involved, got to know other parents and teachers. We moved to another city right before Sarah would have started 8th grade, and the ONLY factor that had us wavering about the move was her having to leave MMS. It broke our hearts. We have stayed in touch with the school and other parents since we moved.  MMS understands that a child needs to be challenged academically, spiritually and as a community member. I wish that every child had the opportunity to experience this kind of love and support in a classroom setting.

Im constantly inspired by the enthusiasm and tenacity of the students and teachers! The leaders at the school know they need to connect students, families, teachers and the broader community to provide the strongest, most well-rounded curriculum possible and to help the students perform to their full potential. The education at Marian helps students find success at college prep high schools, into college, and beyond. They are about to add even more STEM opportunities, and thats obviously so important since women are underrepresented in these fields. They definitely Educate Girls for Life.

Marian Middle School	268775		/users/profile/357509	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2015	Marian Middle School has opened it's doors to many Hispanic girls from poor families who are not able to pay for a quality education.  Most Hispanic children have to attend public schools where they are considered lesser beings, are bullied for their lack of English, and resort to dropping out early or joining gangs.  This school encourages friendly communication, equality, and justice, while teaching the necessary subjects (math, reading, science, etc.).  While many public schools are failing our children, Marian Middle School is an example to follow.

Marian Middle School	243257		/users/profile/329952	bethkellett	Board Member	5	05/19/2015	Marian Middle School is an amazing school that truly does educate girls for life.  Its goal is to break the cycle of poverty by educating urban adolescent girls in the St. Louis community.  To do this, Marian ensures that it supports its students and graduates financially, emotionally, and socially through their high school years and beyond.   It costs $12,500 to educate one Marian girl and yet each Marian family is responsible for only around $400.  In order to continue its success, Marian Middle School relies on the generosity and support of people who see the great value that it provides its students and the community.

I am always impressed with the poise and confidence Marian girls exhibit when I meet them.   I have been involved with Marian for a few years now, serving as Chair for their Girls Night Out event last year.  The organization is really top notch, and St. Louis is lucky to have such a school serving the community.
Marian Middle School	230536	1	/users/profile/294164	LHutchinson	Advisor	5	10/30/2014	Last week, I attended Marian Middle School's Girls Night Out event. There were several current students and recent graduates in attendance. I spent most of my time talking to these girls, particularly the alumnae. How refreshing to witness their Marian Middle School testimony - their confidence, their poise, their intelligence, and their enthusiasm for their alma mater. It was obvious that the school lives by its motto, "Educating Girls for Life." I asked each girl whether Marian had prepared them well for high school and the future. Each gave an enthusiastic "yes" and proceeded to tell me how. They talked about how much better prepared they are then their classmates in terms of their study habits and the knowledge they gained at Marian. They also talked about their study process and their plans for the future. Congratulations Marian Middle School! You are an asset to the St. Louis region.

It is moving to hear the success stories of the alumnae, and I am proud to be part of a community that has such a deep impact on these girls' lives. My experience in Marian's Young Friends committee has shown me how worthwhile Marian's mission really is. Personally, the greatest evidence of this was at Marian's 8th grade graduation last year. In hearing their stories, you can really tell that Marian's mission really does make a difference.

As I returned to St. Louis from college and a job that was out of St. Louis, I look to immediately get involved in the community.  I was honored and thrilled to be a part of the Young Friends committee, which I currently participate in.  Marian lives out its mission every day through the students, families, staff and community.  I am constantly proud of every alumnae's story and passion for education and confidence you see grow within the girls year after year.   The school's leadership and my fellow volunteers' passion and actions speak volumes to the commitment to Marian Middle School's mission and future development.  We believe the girls can, and will, achieve anything they put their minds to.

Marian Middle School	187938		/users/profile/245111	jshaugh508	Board Member	5	11/06/2013	I was directly involved with Marian Middle School very early in its formation as a Board member, and I served in that role and in different capacities as Chair of Membership Committee, Chair of the Long Range/Strategic Planning Committee, Chair of the Policy Review Committee, Vice Chair and Chair of the Board, and Member of the Academic Committee as well. I have seen the wonderful work of the school up close for a number of years.  It is a stellar model of the Nativity-type school, and it has a wonderful record of success serving the underserved educationally.  One cannot but sense the great spirit among those one encounters when entering the building and meeting students and staff! The positive energy, the upbeat tone of all involved, and the warmth of presence is palpable. Others have made this observation as well.  It has a very strong and broad base of involved volunteers to support its efforts, an outstanding reputation as a supportive and nurturing educational environment underpinned by a capable, committed professional staff and excellent leadership from the Board and Administration. Additionally, the school has a wonderfully supportive parent body and community engagement. From my experience it is a model for others to follow. In my view, educational reform could learn a great deal about what it takes to make significant changes in the education of American youth.

Marian Middle School	178224	1	/users/profile/234845	mohara	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	The Marian story is a hope-filled, exciting one.  I was part of the original group of three Sisters who envisioned a Nativity School for girls and "got the ball rolling."   Within two years of planning, Marian opened its doors, because a dedicated group of volunteers believed in the mission, hoped against hope and told the story.  Many joined us in this venture because of their interest in giving young women with limited resources a chance at a good, solid, faith-based education.  Maureen Herrmann brought wonderful leadership to Marian and took the school to a new level in fund raising, some financial stability (though this will always be a challenge),and getting the word out about Marian.  Christy Tobin as its present principal has a profound sense of the Marian mission, a hand that reaches out to the students as individuals, and challenges each teacher and student.   The staff are all persons who truly want to be there in a school that is making a difference in the lives of young women.  As the administrator of a private Catholic high school, I have been on on the other side as we welcomed Marian grads to our school.  The Graduate Support Program has grown to be a very helpful and necessary  program fostering  success a these young women move through high school.

I have gotten a variety of answer, "we have to wear uniforms", "it is important to show up on time," and one girl said, "here I am not afraid, so I can learn." These girls are put in a safe environment with a staff who truly care about them. Being on the Board, I can tell you every dime the school receives is used to help the girls.

I am most impressed with the high quality of the teachers, staff and volunteers at Marian. Just watching them interact with the students, you can see how much they care about each girl. Seeing them in action--in the classroom or in enrichment activities--you can see the high level of professional expertise they bring to help the students succeed. As a high school administrator, I have also been privileged to work with and see how Marian alumnae continue to grow during their high school years. Marian prepares them academically to be successful in a rigorous college preparatory program and gives them the confidence to persevere.

Marian Middle School	174780	2	/users/profile/231088	Tesha S.	Client Served	5	10/07/2013	Speaking from a parent perspective, this is the best middle school for girls in St. Louis!! I am a mother of four extremely intelligent children...Maurice (graduate of SLUH, current student at Missouri University of Science and Technology), Aurelia (10th grade/Incarnate Word Academy), Anderson (8th grade/Loyola Academy of Saint Louis and Andrea (6th grade/Marian Middle school) so as you can see education is a priority in my household.  I tried public schools, charter school and magnet schoools in St. Louis but they all fell short of challenging my children. My children never had homework and scored straight A's in all areas. Although I am not rich by any means,  I wanted a great education for my children. Marian provides that education for my daughter based on my income and is willing to help any family regardless of financial situation!! Marian cares about each child's success and it shows through education, my daughter is reading post-high school books. Marian also understands that family involvement is a must in order for a child to be successful, I know what Andrea is doing in school via website and teachers. The charter schools that my children attended in the past made me feel unwelcome when I wanted to drop in on my lunch break just to get an idea of what my child was learning. Not Marian...I am welcome by one of the most knowledgeable people I know...Ms. Pearl. She knows my family as whole and is concerned about all the families at Marian. Ms. Pearl make suggestions on things that my children and I can do better their education, which is beyond what she is required to do! The teachers Sister Sara, Ms. Klonsky, Ms. Hearn, Ms. Aigaghi, Ms. Fox and Ms. Olson are just a few of the teachers that go above and beyond their job to make sure my daugher is successful and reaches her goal as an engineer. The school also has an online website for families called Teacherease which gives you up to the minute information on your child's progress and if you daughter needs extra help with a subject there are also practice worksheets/quizzes on the website. I use to have problems with keeping up with my daughter's progress and what she needed help with and my daughter won't  volunteer this information. Well Andrea had a C in one of her classes and after talking with her teacher Ms. Fox and she helped us with the website, that grade is now a B!! 
Marian Middle School	173599	2	/users/profile/229745	Carol J	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	Marian Middle School has been a part of my life for at least 10 years.  As a retired educator, I first volunteered to work with students after school to assist with homework and enrichment.  Later, I became a Board member, substitute teacher, and a member of their Academic Committee.  Presently, i continue to serve on the the committee and volunteer after school to tutor 3 eighth grade students, whom I have worked with since they were in fifth grade.Marian's mission is to educate the whole child and that education is the key to success in life. The total school environment centers around this mission. I have observed the dedication of the staff as they not only teach during the day but stay after school to assist students.  The students put in a long school day by staying until 5:30 pm, and a long school year from August to June. In fact, the three students I tutor during the school year volunteered to come in during a week in the summer just to receive extra help on specific skills. Marian staff provide a safe learning environment, have high expectations of their students, and give support to families.  School personnel continue to assist students throughout high school. The ultimate goal is for all students to graduate high school and college and become productive citizens involved in their community. Once a Marian girl, always a Marian girl.

I  was a Board Member and  now serve on the Academic Committee.   I have witnessed the  growth of this school from  its  beginnings  to its present  status today.  More importantly,  I have  been privileged  to  teach some of the graduates of this program  in  high school.   The  maturity, poise,  generosity, leadership  and work ethic of the  girls has been an inspiration to me.   Marian  has changed the lives of many of  these girls and has given them  the  tools they need to be successful in whatever field they choose.   Moreover, it has  empowered them  to  have goals and  given them the means  to achieve those goals.   
Marian Middle School	172566	1	/users/profile/228495	Emily71	Volunteer	5	09/30/2013	Two years ago, I was given one of the best experiences of my life, the opportunity to be a year long volunteer at Marian Middle School. During this time, I learned how thoughtfully laid out Marian's Mission is and how it can change a girl's life. As I watched the students' become more empowered young women daily it is not a surprise that I too became more empowered. If it were not for Marian, I would not have found the strength to go back to school and pursue my dreams. Marian truly teaches women that they can be whatever they want to be and that strength, determination, and a lot of hard work goes miles. I am grateful daily for this experience and the ample amounts of guidance I received. 
Marian Middle School	172552	1	/users/profile/228482	Katy Kaminski	Volunteer	5	09/30/2013	I was blessed to be able to be a long tern volunteer at Marian Middle School. MMS is truly one of a kind. Not only is a great place for girls to learn, it empowers them to become strong young women. Marian sees each child as someone with something to offer. Each child has potential. I think about Marian often and miss it dearly! 
Humanity For Children	310602	3	/users/profile/401946	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	I have had the opportunity to opportunity to do an internship with Humanity For Children, an experience that has shaped the way I think of non-profit organizations. I come from Uganda, Africa, and have noticed that most NGOs that work in such places come in and go without making any tangible change. Humanity for Children's continuous efforts to engage with the community that it serves, its creative and innovative ways of finding solutions for people especially women in East Africa is unmatched. Dr. Bob Hansen's dedication to serve the people  of East Africa, and constantly going back to see that programs are being implemented as planned is astounding and something that i truly admire about the leadership of the organization.
Humanity For Children	310404	3	/users/profile/401758	amandawstevens	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	I have had the privilege to work with Humanity for Children and their work in Tanzania (Summer 2016).  Humanity for Children is working with traditional birth attendants in remote villages to improve birth outcomes. I was very impressed with the partnerships that they have formed in this area.  This project was truly a community-based, sustainable approach.  I was fortunate to experience this with a great group of volunteers and enjoy the beautiful country and people.  I hope to return again and continue to work with this amazing non-profit. 
Humanity For Children	310402	3	/users/profile/401756	Eva_16	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	This summer, I went to Rwanda and Tanzania with HFC. What I experienced and what I got out of the trip completely blew my expectations out of the water. HFC is unlike any other nonprofit organization.The ways in which they help people are not temporary, but sustainable. You leave knowing that the impact you made and the things that you did will continue to grow and stay in effect long after you leave. The people that I met, the friendships that were created, and the experiences that I had are invaluable and something that I will cherish forever. The group I went with was also amazing. The president, Dr. Bob Hansen, is one of the most loving and compassionate people I know. I would do it all over again and 10/10 would recommend it to anyone thinking of going. HFC understands that volunteering is not about telling people what they need, but asking them for what the people want and need. It is an incredible organization and I had an incredible experience volunteering for them! 
Humanity For Children	310277	3	/users/profile/232840	saskiachaskelson	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	I first became involved with Humanity for Children 5 years ago as a volunteer. I spent 9 months working in the dispensary supported by HFC in Rota, Kenya. To say the experience changed my life would be an understatement. I witnessed first hand the impressive impact HFC is making across the globe. Each person involved in Humanity for Children is a volunteer which speaks volumes about the character of these individuals as well as their passion. Next year, I will be traveling back to Africa to support HFC's newest project in Tanzania.  I am extremely excited for this upcoming endeavor and am extremely honored to be working with such a phenominal non profit. 
Humanity For Children	176426	4	/users/profile/232840	saskiachaskelson	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	I consider Humanity for Children one of the best of the best.  I spent 9 months volunteering with HFC in Rota, Kenya and the experience changed my life.  Since my return, I continued to volunteer with the NGO and am impressed and humbled by the great work that they do.  I have experienced first hand what a difference HFC has made in the lives of others and  am moved beyond words.  I can not thank them enough for the impact they have made in this world.  
Humanity For Children	310118	3	/users/profile/401480	Esperance	Client Served	5	10/12/2016	Humanity for Children is a life changing non profit organization. I have known  HFC for a more than 4 years and ever since , everything is coming up roses. I have learned from them life skills such as organisational ans team building that are useful to my daily activities.  Most importantly, with HFC  I have discovered that transforming people's lives is not all about giving people fish rather teaching them how to fish.  Listening to people, putting first their needs  first, empowering women and educating children are the drives of any nation's growth!  That's why I am proud of the changes being made by Humanity for Children in my country - Rwanda!
Humanity For Children	309914	3	/users/profile/401263	zozy34	Volunteer	5	10/12/2016	I was once a volunteer for humanity for children, and it was a life changing experience for me. I have never in my life worked with such tender and caring people. The board members and volunteers are so welcoming and graceful with everything they do. They treated everyone we met along the way as though they were family. I highly suggest them if you are looking for an NGO to volunteer for. Beautiful experience, that will change your life.
Humanity For Children	309911	3	/users/profile/401260	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2016	HelloMy daughter was a part of humanity for children volunteers this past year, and it was a wonderful experience from what I have heard. The volunteers and board members are nothing short of outstanding human beings. 
Humanity For Children	309910	3	/users/profile/401259	simsim1234	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2016	My sister was a volunteer for Humanity for Children in 2015. In my eyes, the experience has changed her life completely. She cam back very humble (not that she was not before). But something about her changed for the better. From what I heard from her, the groups that are picked to go, are selected carefully. Everyone that I she has told me about was an outstanding human being, it restored humanity to be honest. They are able to make a huge difference in communities by finding innovative and smart ways to keep their project sustainable and running for a long time. This organization is a wonderful organization to get involved with.
Humanity For Children	309729	3	/users/profile/401084	MadisonRybak	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	I traveled to Rwanda and Tanzania this past summer with Humanity for Children and it was an amazing experience. I experienced a different world and culture that truly opened up my eyes. I was constantly introduced to new things and people which forced me to work outside of my comfort zone to help others around me. I witnessed Humanity for Children carry out effective and sustainable projects in these countries through working with different communities as equal partners with the understanding that the community members were the experts and we were there to listen to them. This is not only an amazing nonprofit organization, but this is friendship that has been built between the people of Humanity for Children and the people of the different communities visited over the past 10 years. 
Humanity For Children	308692	3	/users/profile/334340	bernerbk	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I have been blessed to be able to travel to Africa with Humanity For Children the past two summers. The work the group has done in the past and continues to do in both Rwanda and Tanzania is just awesome! Seeing the lives that have been touched and helped has impacted my life in so many ways.  I hope to be able to go back again!
Humanity For Children	246887	3	/users/profile/334340	bernerbk	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	I just returned from my first  of what I pray is many trips to Africa with an amazing team from Humanity For Children! Seeing how they have positively impacted so many lives in Eastern Africa has given me a much broader idea of what this nonprofit is all about! They are not there to provide a one time fix or band aid for the  people they meet. They are there to help in providing support for projects that will help the people become self-sustaining and thrive. Humanity for Children really takes the time to get to know the people of each village and listen to what their needs are. Then they can work with them on their projects and be sure the projects will support what their needs are. I am truly blessed to have been able to go with them! I look forward to the next trip!

I am writing to congratulate HFC on his dedication, efforts and support, not only by getting learning and teaching materials that have dramatically brightened up the future  of  Rwandan students but also by changing lives of hundreds of farmers in Eastern province of Rwanda.  Your courage to live our  Rwandan harsh conditions each year,  is  the drive that aspires children and underprivileged people that you have been supporting and it is a proof that each day is different!.  HCF is a trusted nonprofit I have ever known!   
Humanity For Children	308548	2	/users/profile/399922	McKenna P.	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I went to Rwanda and Tanzania with a group from HFC this summer and it was the most amazing experience. The way they do things is to efficient and every project is sustainable. Not only are they smart about how to help but the people who run the organization are so kind hearted and have so much compassion. It's truly an amazing organization and group of people and I'm blessed to have gotten to work with them. 
Humanity For Children	261288	2	/users/profile/349886	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	I think Humanity for Children is doing a great job not only by establishing projects in Eastern Africa; but more, through providing integrative and encouraging voluntary opportunities for people who want to travel and make a difference. These voluntary opportunities allow ordinary American people  to get to know other cultures and expand on their knowledge about the world outside. Such opportunities  are great tools to create humble ties and diminish the gab between people of developed and less developing countries. 
Humanity For Children	258221	2	/users/profile/346709	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	I volunteered  with Humanity For Children in June of 2015 to Rwanda and Tanzania. This was a great experience, HFC is really doing it right, to make changes where it is most needed by going to different villages building relationships and getting to know what the people need. One thing that HFC focus on is listening to want they want and need not what we think they need. 
Humanity For Children	257901	2	/users/profile/346375	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	I volunteered for humanity for children one summer, it was a life changing experience. I've never worked with such tender, caring people. We worked with so many women and children, and the patience and tenderness of the hand picked groups that volunteered was unbelievable.
Humanity For Children	257129	2	/users/profile/345540	Tony52	Volunteer	4	09/14/2015	Hi my name is Tony Mitchell and I am student/ staff member at Westminster College. I attended the trip with  Humanity For Children this past summer.  Visiting Rwanda and Tanzania was a surreal experience.  As an economics major,  I have had the opportunity to  read numerous  articles about the challenges that these  exact countries face.  Reading articles to understand  the well being of millions of people is one thing, but to actually travel to the countries of Rwanda and Tanzania brings the words to life and allows a shift in my perspective, as one learns about the complexities surrounding the challenges. The biggest impact  the trip had on me, was being an Black American and traveling to  countries where people saw me as their equal and even a native.Also with my father being an Haitian emigrant, I could have been one of the millions facing the same day y to day challenges . It makes me appreciate the many privileges I have from being born in the United States.Traveling to these countries has been the  highlight of my life but has also laid down a foundation for something even greater to be achieved. Hopefully one day I can establish polices and regulations that will help eradicate the poverty traps plaguing developing countries.  
Humanity For Children	256396	3	/users/profile/344797	kberner67	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	My wife went to Africa with Humanity for Children this past summer and the work they did was amazing. The way they are touching so many lives is awesome. They are not there for a one time fix, but to  help the people become self-sustaining and thrive as a community. I know it changed my wife's life and I hope to someday be able to go with her and work with HFC and the people of Africa as well. 
Humanity For Children	247021	3	/users/profile/334497	malbers	Donor	5	07/01/2015	My connection is through a fellow faculty member who knows the Dr. in charge.   I have seen the fantastic work they do for people in dire need.   From nite lamps to food to education, this organization is beyond words.
Humanity For Children	246906	2	/users/profile/334361	tjcpcom	Donor	5	07/01/2015	Humanity for Children is a fantastic non-profit for the following reasons:1) The organization is committed to making a change for those less fortunate in a way that is a sustainable.  Teaching someone to fish is much better than bringing them fish.  Their methods invests in people to create a better life through their own efforts, not  the non-profit's.  This provides a since of responsibility, pride, and  confidence in how they can keep on improving their life through their own efforts and commitment.2) Once the seeds of progress is sown, others learn these basic tenants and the process/benefits are multiplied.3) The groups commitment is outstanding.  The members of HFC are humble and energized to making a difference.  The commitment to making it happen and follow up is key the to success. The combination of the right people, the right process, and humbleness makes this group one that I will keep investing in.
Humanity For Children	246888	3	/users/profile/334341	Ihatepineapple	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	What I enjoy about HFC is the emphasis on team building, the focus on culture, and the priority of helping parents help their children. It is a simple but clear model that empowers everyone involved in the mission. I can't say enough about the Leadership, volunteers, or the people of Rwanda and Tanzania that we work with.Blessings to all!
Humanity For Children	246844	4	/users/profile/334292	bob.hansen	Board Member	5	06/30/2015	Our 2015 Project Team just returned from East Africa where we monitored existing projects and explored new ones.  It was a great team -- Bret, Kaitlin, Meredith, Tony, Azza, Bernard, Luca, Big Poppi (Dan) and me.  Our economic empowerment projects in Rwanda and Tanzania are exceeding our expectations and we look forward to our second year of the Bright Light Campaign at Gashanda Primary School.  We thank our partners -- Ernest, Dieudonne, John English, Emmanuel, Jean Claude, Toto, Israel, Robin, Daniel, Ndinini, Mayor Aphrodise, and so many more.  Although we have no paid administrative staff, HFC continues to make a difference in the lives of people, particularly children, in East Africa.  Please join us as we work with our partners in Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya.    Bob
Humanity For Children	222048	5	/users/profile/285739	BradBerg	Advisor	5	10/12/2014	Humanity for Children supports the villages and clinics of East Africa by helping those areas support themselves and become independent.  Their clinic support has helped many thousands of people in the Kisumu region of Kenya and is helping to expand health services in Rwnada.  Through their micro finance projects, they are helping individuals break out of the cycle of poverty and sustain themselves and through their partnerships communities flourish.  I cannot recommend them enough to anyone looking to make a difference.
Humanity For Children	221800	4	/users/profile/256871	Valens	Client Served	5	10/10/2014	I am really proud of this organization for the work that they have been doing internationally, especially in Rwanda, Eastern province, Ngoma district. I am glad to say that my family, friends, neighbors and community members of Gashanda were able to get a health post that takes care of their basic medical needs due to the partnership and collaboration with Humanity for Children. In addition, Humanity for children has reached out to the women that are passionate to use their talents, skills and experiences to starting their own micro income projects. The amazing thing about this organization is, no body gets paid for the life changing work they do, it's all about love and commitment to blessing other people with who they are and what they have. 
Humanity For Children	196524	3	/users/profile/256871	Valens	Client Served	4	03/26/2014	I can't express enough with my words what HFC has been doing to change people's lives particularly in Rwanda, Kibungo city. I have been working for HFC as an interpreter, translator, advisor, guide and assistant since 2007 and I have seen with my own eyes where dreams came reality, and where projects, ambitions, goals and humanitarian passions get implemented. It is so impressive and humbling experience to get to see mothers and children lining up at one of the most needed HFC health center (Gashanda) to see a nurse/doctor. How awesome, inspiring  and rewording is to see micro project groups get together and sit under the tree to share the progress of their own income activities! Personally, I would say that without HFC, I wouldn't be able to come the States to pursuit graduate school. Anyway, there are a lot to say about this nonprofit organization; I wish all international NGOs can learn from HFC such effective and cross -culturally sensitive approaches to serve the world. Valens 
Humanity For Children	221709	5	/users/profile/285395	mbeahon	Volunteer	5	10/10/2014	My late husband had a heart for Africa from the time he was area director for Europe, Africa and the Middle East for Junior Chamber International in the early 80s. Through Humanity for Children he was able to fulfill his dream of returning to Africa and working with the people there to help them help themselves. His passion inspired other people, including me, to work with Humanity for Children. It is a small organization, run completely by volunteers, but it accomplishes big things: a clinic for women and children, micro-financing projects to help Rwandans obtain self-sufficiency, solar lights to allow young students to do their homework at night in a home without electricity, to name a few. Through their connections with Humanity for Children, three young African men have come to the U.S. and completed their master's degrees at the University of Missouri, and one is working on his Ph.D.  They will be able to return to Africa and assume leadership roles, working for a better life for all Rwandans and Tanzanians. I can't say enough about this wonderful organization that manages to accomplish so much without any overhead or administrative costs.   
Humanity For Children	221625	4	/users/profile/87848	NancyMc	Volunteer	5	10/10/2014	Humanity for Children supports by helping people help themselves.  When an Association of farmers is given a pig, one baby pig is given away to a farmer who does not have one.  Then from his baby pigs, a pig is given to someone else.  That way the people are given a way to make a living or send a child to school.  There is a sense of pride and togetherness in the community that is invaluable.  It is money well spent.  I have personally witnessed this project when I traveled to Kibungo, Africa.  The smiles on their faces are worth more than money can buy.  This organization sends all the money donated for projects.  Their only outlay is the native African who travels to each project to make sure it is running well.  And this employs a person in the countryside, not someone from a western country.  What a great organization!!!!
Humanity For Children	221506	4	/users/profile/285197	emilyajennings	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	I found out about Humanity for Children through my dear friend Kathryn Morgan.  I'm passionate about health and education in many contexts and capacities.  Their mission and work is inspiring and I wanted to support their efforts.  I volunteered at one of their fund raising events.  I also helped organize a team to complete the Rock N Roll 1/2 marathon and we raised money for Humanity for Children.  They are a great organization and its wonderful to watch the positive impact they're causing expand and grow.  
Humanity For Children	221384	4	/users/profile/285080	Lindaart	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I have had the privilege to see how Humanity for Children has developed over the years. My husband, had always wanted to travel to Africa and contribute to making the lives of the people he met better.  Through this organization I have seen how the lives of many people have been changed including his. He and this organization amaze me with their dedication and commitment to helping and improving the lives of the people this organization is dedicated to serving.   Not only does this organization help change the lives of people they work with, but I have seen the students return from working with this organization changed and inspired to make a difference in the world.  
Humanity For Children	221371	4	/users/profile/285068	calliedidion	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer with Humanity for Children starting early on-- traveling to East Africa for 8 weeks in 2007. What an humbling process it all was--a big vision with little funds, few but dedicated volunteers. Although, because of this, I was able to see first hand the development of this small, but passionate organization. I saw friendships strengthen and community cultivated, I saw empty lots turn into health clinics. I have witnessed people of different cultures, ages, races working together to improve education, health care and empower communities--learning from each other and growing as individuals along the way. To see the impact of this small, but dedicated organization for the past 7 years has been remarkable, and personally I have come to see many fellow volunteers are part of my family- and for that I am so thankful. As my husband finishes up his residency to become a physician, we are already brainstorming ways we can continue to volunteer and travel back to East Africa with Humanity for Children.   
Humanity For Children	217087	4	/users/profile/280605	briansmorgan	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I am blessed to have had the opportunity to volunteer with Humanity For Children.  It was amazing to travel to East Africa to be a part of the difference this organization is making as well as the incredible impact the experience had on me.  Not only will I continue to help support this organization but I will also work to find another opportunity to travel back to Africa to be a part of the difference first hand.
Humanity For Children	210094	3	/users/profile/272835	AZnonprofitstudent	Volunteer	5	08/11/2014	Humanity for Children is an organization that, despite its small size, makes a huge impact in every east African community it decides to engage in.  Humanity for Children is faced with monumental challenges(opportunities) in striving to improve the quality of life of children in east Africa.  While volunteering with this organization I was overwhelmed by the amount of work that there is to do with the wonderful people in Rwanda and Tanzania.  The organization is very deliberate and strategic in its relationships, always seeking to leverage the limited resources available to create the most positive outcomes for the children in east Africa.  This is an international NGO that is conscientious and uses clear, predetermined guidelines for engaging with communities in service activities. I was most impressed by the quality and depth of the relationships that this organization has cultivated with servant leaders in Rwanda and Tanzania.  These relationships of trust enable Humanity for Children to have a clear advantage when looking to accomplish projects/plans that will further it's mission.
Humanity For Children	209084	4	/users/profile/271851	sarahcarnes	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	The impact that Humanity for Children has made in Kibungo, Rwanda is incredible. Through dedicated volunteers, board members and donors - the organization is able to truly make a difference in the lives of women and children. Their commitment to continue to reach out, help and support the villages and communities in Rwanda is simply amazing.
Humanity For Children	196143	5	/users/profile/190140	big poppi	Volunteer	5	03/21/2014	I have had the honor and pleasure of volunteering for HFC for three (soon to be four) summers. The passion and mission of this wonderful organization has inspired me, my family and friends to see the world from a new perspective and to realize that everyone is our "neighbor". I have received so much from from the people in Rwanda and Tanzania, far more than anything I have given. SincerelyDan HarmsDean of StudentsLutheran High School SouthSt. Louis, MO.
Humanity For Children	143668	3	/users/profile/190140	big poppi	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	HFC was a life changing experience for me, my family and my school.  The two trips to Rwanda and Tanzania have taught us how the power of ordinary people working together can affect permanent change-through micro-loans, education and husbanding of resources.  
Humanity For Children	195994	5	/users/profile/256267	kbail	Volunteer	5	03/20/2014	So many non-profits garner recognition less from their work and more for their panache, so when I was first introduced to Humanity for Children I had expected much of the same.  It was quickly apparent to me, however, that that was simply not the case with HFC.   When traveling in Rwanda and Tanzania with HFC's project team in the summer of 2011, I was struck by the organization's approach to their work.  Humanity for Children and its directors have built real relationships with the people in the communities in which they are active.  They go to a community, observe it, talk to the people who know it and its needs best, and then set out to implement their projects.  This means that whether they are raising funds for solar study lights for Rwandan school kids or constructing health facilties in remote areas of Maasailand,  HFC is having a profound impact.    I'm so proud to be involved with this organization.   It's through the opportunities I have had to work with its volunteers and meet the people whose lives HFC's projects affect that I'm reminded why we all need each other, how we can help one another, and how we challenge each other to be better versions of ourselves.  HFC pours such passion and joy into all of their efforts, and I'm excited to see what they do in the future.
Humanity For Children	195895	3	/users/profile/256158	Carolyn71	Donor	5	03/19/2014	I am so thankful that my Westminster students (and my own children) have had the opportunity to volunteer with Humanity for Children.  Working with HFC in Rwanda and Tanzania has been a life-changing experience for them, primarily because HFC presents such a fine model of what it means to be a global citizen, devoted to improving the lives of others.  I hope I have the opportunity to serve with HFC someday, as well!
Humanity For Children	195843	4	/users/profile/79475	bobhansenwc	Board Member	5	03/19/2014	I am so proud to be working with Humanity for Children.  Most people don't realize that nobody in the organization's leadership gets paid for their time and that all of us pay our own expenses when we travel to Africa.  The only paid staff are three on-the-ground workers in East Africa.   When asked about our administrative overhead, we can be very truthful when we say that almost 100% of our contributions go directly to projects in Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya.  We are a lean and transparent organization that is always seeking to improve.   On behalf of our board of directors, I want to thank our Executive Director, Kathryn Morgan, for her efforts and commitment to our work, and to all of our volunteers who serve the organization with great passion and enthusiasm.

Humanity For Children	169546	3	/users/profile/224712	Sandra Nivyabandi	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	Humanity For Children can truly be said to be a Great Nonprofit Organization. Over this past Summer I was granted the opportunity to experience what it is that Humanity For Children does firsthand in Rwanda. Working with various community members, mothers, fathers, children and the elderly we were able to address issues of health, education and how women can achieve an income through starting their own small business. From such an experience, working with such a phenomenal NGO you are reminded of what your purpose in life is, how it is that such an experience can impact others as well as one's self. As this NGO continues to steadily grow, I wish for HFC to open a post in Burundi in the next coming years, because their mission fits perfectly. Their mission goes a long way in implementing a great cause. Humanity For Children, I sincerely thank you for all that you do to serve the East African community and change the lives within of many, among those, individuals who have the opportunity to be a part of this NGO.

They have changed my life and directed me to the importance of my life.  The experience I had while in Rwanda, help me see first hand the importance of relationships.  The relationships they build with the people grows and grows.  All of their donations go towards a project in a community which they have build a relationship.  This is important because they want to trust them and get feedback which I believe is a huge strength then just donating to donate.  I cant wait to support them again!  
Humanity For Children	156508	3	/users/profile/207594	tim rupp	Donor	5	04/27/2013	Susie and I had the opportunity to visit Africa several years ago and were stunned by the abject poverty we observed while there.  We were saddened by the very high mortality rate for children.  When we became aware of the mission of Humanity For The Children, we knew we wanted to become involved.  We have been very pleased to know that our contributions go to building a sustainable health care system.  Whilethe system is very basic by our standards, it is miles ahead of what was available before.  HFC is making a difference!     
Humanity For Children	156049	3	/users/profile/207060	jenniferklemisch	Donor	5	04/24/2013	This is one of two nonprofit that I will give it to because they get 100% of the donation to their cause! This organization makes a drastic difference and the lives of children in Africa.  They run their organization Efficiently and give experiences to their volunteers that are not otherwise available. Everyone involved in this organization is very passionate about the cause. 
Humanity For Children	154191	3	/users/profile/205022	lmennella	Volunteer	5	04/11/2013	I had the opportunity to volunteer with HFC after graduating from university.  I had the most amazing experience traveling with the group, and it really affirmed by belief in small-scale NGO work.  Nothing seemed wasted, the contact with the local community was genuine and beneficial, and the people I met were absolutely incredible.  Really amazing stuff and I would recommend it to anyone.
Humanity For Children	153542	3	/users/profile/204340	Ixchel L.	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	I have had the privilege to volunteer with multiple NGOs that want to help diverse areas of our society, but none compared as working with Humanity for Children. I grew up in a third world country, where children constantly suffer from the repercussions of poverty. I have constantly strive to educate myself in the developing programs to help individuals overcome socio-economic problems through grassroots organizations.  Humanity for Children not only strives to help people, but to educate, inform and motivate them to be better. What make HFC such a passionate organization is their drive to maintain relations with the communities they help.  Through education, micro-loans and women empowerment HFC not only help individuals, but change their lives and the whole community.  Furthermore, I had the pleasure to work with the HFC team, who are passionate, motivated and driven to help. I felt very blessed to have had such wonderful opportunity and to see through my own experience how rewarding it is to help others. Also, that through what may seem so little to some is a great gift to others. This organization truly makes a difference in Africa, but also in the lives of those that volunteer. HFC it is an organization that truly wants to help others meet their goals, as well serve the community through programs that are sustainable, independent, efficient, caring and passionate.
Humanity For Children	153406	3	/users/profile/204211	hannahmariemp	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	This organization helped me believe that I can make a difference in this world. I have seen firsthand the kind of change they are creating in the areas they serve. Unlike larger non-profits, they KNOW the people they serve. The projects come from the people, and are left to the people. I have had the opportunity to go on two trips to take a look at the microloan initiatives, health projects, fair trade relationships, and partnerships between churches, schools... It's amazing what all they are doing. What's even better is that 100% of the donations go to their development projects! That's hard to argue with...
Humanity For Children	152827	3	/users/profile/203724	Edet	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	I have been in contact with HFC board members and volunteers in different capacities since 2009 and had the chance to visit the Rota dispensary in Kenya. It was inspiring to see an organization put all of it's efforts, resources and man power into their programs. The volunteers I met there were of an unrivaled caliber, dedicated, passionate and driven to help despite challenges and set backs that naturally occur in any worthwhile endeavor. From what I have seen of HFC it is an organization that truly keeps it's actions in line with it's goals of serving the community from a position of respect and sustainability - efficiently and passionately. 
Humanity For Children	152764	3	/users/profile/203673	Mulay Smara	Volunteer	5	04/06/2013	I have had the privilege to work with many NGos that support and change the lives of people. Humanity for children is by far the best and the most effective. Not only for helping people but for its way of changing lives in many places in Africa. They helped building generations that will help and give back for their communities, by using micro-projects, education and supporting women on creating small businesses  Many people that I know of would appreciate and thank whoever helped or supported through Humanity for Children. Indeed it is great to see someone cares about you and treat you like one of them.
Humanity For Children	149504	3	/users/profile/186588	Silas	Volunteer	3	02/16/2013	I would like to say a great thank you to Humanity for children and the american people for their support to Africa.

Humanity For Children	140412	3	/users/profile/186588	Silas	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	Since i came in contact with HFC it was a life changing moment. I met with them while we were starting a partnership program with the government of Kenya in supporting a small dispensary called Rota in Kisumu. They managed to sponsor medications and employment of a clinical officer when the clinic only had one nurse who was overwhelmed. Now the dispensary have more than six staffs including the clinical officer, a laboratory, HIV clinic in partnership with another partner who came because there was a clinical officer, electricity which was not there, a fence  and a water tank. In addition to that a beautiful and friendly environment. This were never there, that is why HFC is made a great impact. We have new partners who have joined us through HFC, that is Africa Dream- Chile, who send Doctors and volunteers who support the dispensary and a youth project called Young Christian youth - Tuasawa Tunaweza project. Life is changing greatly in Kenya through HFC. n the Youth project: A poultry project has been started and creative Arts and handicarft is on going, just because of HFC. Asante Sana HFC
Humanity For Children	146898	3	/users/profile/193947	Pamela31	Board Member	5	12/17/2012	HFC is an organization that changes the lives of children by changing their environment. What a humbling opportunity to take part in helping others to gain independence through sustainability and provide children with a chance to become what they dare to dream......
Humanity For Children	144976	3	/users/profile/191536	Kathy Ritter	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	When you hear the words "life changing", it is difficult to imagine what it really means. For me, it occurred on my Humanity for Children trip to Africa. To intimately interact with children, mothers and  community leaders left me feeling differently about all things and yet struck by how much all people want the same things - stability, good food, education, dignity and joy. Humanity for Children impacts thousands of lives with improved health, education and appreciation for other cultures. I cannot thank HFC enough for allowing me to travel to Rwanda and Tanzania with a committed group of volunteers with big hearts and infectious humor. Thanks for changing my life - for the better.
Humanity For Children	140131	3	/users/profile/186297	Bob Hansen	Board Member	5	11/15/2012	Can a small nonprofit humanitarian organization make a difference in this world?  Especially when it is staffed exclusively by volunteers and not even the executive director gets paid?  The answer is YES...just look at Humanity for Children.  I've been involved with HFC since 2007 when, on its behalf, I circled Lake Victoria in East Africa to identify possible locations for new health clinics in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania.  Since then, I've traveled to HFC project sites each summer and have been blown away with the positive ripple effect of what HFC's actions have triggered.  The organization has learned a lot over the years and embraces a set of values that puts the people we serve in control of what we do...our job is help them achieve their goals.  Our projects must be focused on what the people want and need, not what we think they need.  They must be in true collaboration and partnership...we aren't doing anything without their involvement, and they must sustainable.  These are the keys.  HFC makes a difference and it does so being a true steward of our donor's time, energy and treasures.  I'm proud to be part of this organization.
Endangered Wolf Center	293526	1	/users/profile/384141	BKLYNWOLF	Volunteer	5	06/21/2016	Before moving to Missouri I knew about the EWC. It was actually one of the many bonuses of relocating from the East coast. I strongly felt that by educating folks about  natural predators and supporting a place where successful breeding of these beautiful, beneficial Canids was actually happening would bring me joy. I was right but had no idea the impact.  The volunteer base is diverse as they are inspirational. Animal care staff are unrelentingly devoted. I've painted fences, raked leaves, cut wood,...but nothing compares to the wonderful questions people have and the look on someones face when they spot one of the Red or Grey wolves in the enclosures.  Assisting on tours has been amazing.It's beautiful to see families, school and scout groups, birthday parties(where a child actually in lieu of gifts asked for guests to help support the EWC!!) become more aware of a part of our natural order that we are very close to loosing. Been too many months since I've volunteered. Work and life started overwhelming me to exhaustion. Time to at least visit if my body can't physically help out...yet.Thank you for inspiring me in a world filled with enough knowledge and technology to be able to do better though our  human greed often deters us. Hear a wolf howl and you know the sound of life.
Endangered Wolf Center	292441	1	/users/profile/382956	Wolflover	Volunteer	5	06/08/2016	Once I joined this amazing organisation and saw the desperate importance of preserving these wolves, I was inspired to pursue a degree in conservation. The Endangered Wolf Center is a place that provides you with an understanding of how you directly impact other creatures on this planet, and will bring you closer to the keystone species of the west. The staff and volunteers at the EWC are all great teachers and it is easy to tell how large their hearts are for these beautiful animals. Go check out the Mexican gray, red, and maned wolves at the Endangered Wolf Center! Swift foxes, African painted dogs, and Fennec foxes can also be found on a guided tour around the center. This center was built to breed these endangered wolves so they can be released into the wild.
Endangered Wolf Center	292376	1	/users/profile/382893	Larry.W.Jewell	Volunteer	5	06/07/2016	This is a place where you can see humans working to help restore balance to nature by returning the alpha predator to the wild in the natural territory of the Mexican Wolf, the Southwest United States and northern Mexico. Once there were only seven Mexican wolves  in the whole world. Now they roam free in Nevada and Arizona. Inspirational, motivational, and sensational, visit the EWC and pump up your heart and your will to help the world be a better place for ALL us critters. 
Endangered Wolf Center	292245	1	/users/profile/382741	cemeyers09	Volunteer	4	06/06/2016	The EWC has been largely responsible for the re-population and preservation of both the Eastern Red Wolf and the Mexican Gray Wolf.  The facility is not designed for public entertainment, but is great for both the animals, and for educating the public.  This is one of the often unknown jewels in the St Louis area.  Please read about them online, schedule a tour and/or find out how to help support this fine organization. 
Endangered Wolf Center	292186	1	/users/profile/382681	irish94	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	The EWC has literally saved 2 species of Wolves from extinction. The staff and volunteers are passionate and hard working. The facility is quiet and peaceful and provides a great home for  the Wolves but is also a great place for visitors as well. The tours are educational and interesting and the night time camp fire howls are a great experience especially during the autumn months. The staff and volunteers will dispel the age old myths and lies of how bad wolves are and will tell the truth on how wolves are shy and devoted to their families but also play a vital role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. 
Endangered Wolf Center	292160	1	/users/profile/382652	holaday	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/05/2016	I love the endangered wolf center! As a current employee, I come to work happy and excited to start the day. Our staff is extremely hard working and functions almost like a family. You can tell that our conservation message strikes a cord with guests through our amazing docents, volunteers, and staff members. 
Endangered Wolf Center	292118	1	/users/profile/382603	kzelle	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	The Endangered Wolf Center is a very special place with a critical mission (To preserve and protect Mexican wolves, red wolves and other wild canid species, with purpose and passion, through carefully managed breeding, reintroduction and inspiring education programs). From the moment you enter the gates and meet your first staff member or volunteer, you sense the passion of a community of individuals committed to dispelling the cultural myths perpetrated by "Little Red Riding Hood," "The Three PIgs" and the like. With  programs for all ages, the Center invites all who visit to have fun, gather knowledge and join the pack!
Endangered Wolf Center	292091	1	/users/profile/382578	Lisa551	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	Fabulous facility with excellent staff and volunteers!  They are all dedicated to their mission, rare with many other organizations.  I've watched them grow so much over the past 6 years and they truly are dedicated to their endangered species.  It's always a pleasure to volunteer and also to be a guest.  
Endangered Wolf Center	292089	1	/users/profile/382575	Claire28	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	I was an intern for the center as well as a volunteer on tours and this center is truly a wonderful place. All the staff is so knowledgeable about the work they do and they're so passionate as well. The work they do with the reintroduction programs is inspiring and has helped me personally by fueling my own passion for this field. It's a fantastic, welcoming place with a lot to offer whether you are looking for a job, a chance to volunteer, or simply looking to visit to learn more about some pretty amazing wildlife.
Endangered Wolf Center	292087	1	/users/profile/382573	egmf3f	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/04/2016	The Endangered Wolf Center is a world-renowned organization for their work with Mexican and red wolves. They go above and beyond to educate the public about wolves and how the Endangered Wolf Center is involved in conservation, as well as how visitors can help, too.
Endangered Wolf Center	292046		/users/profile/382533	drose2493	General Member of the Public	5	06/03/2016	I absolutely love the work this center does and how passionate the people who work there are. 
Endangered Wolf Center	291979		/users/profile/382465	pzemitzsch6226	Board Member	5	06/03/2016	A wonderful conservation story that informs people and protects the future of endangered canids. Top quality.
Endangered Wolf Center	291971		/users/profile/382458	redwolf	Board Member	5	06/03/2016	The Endangered Wolf Center provides a critical function in helping to keep endangered species from extinction.  Their work with the Mexican Gray Wolf and Red Wolf since 1971 has enabled these two North American species to survive in the wild through selective release and fostering programs.  The staff of the Endangered Wolf Center adheres to a Mission statement with the utmost professionalism, and is known as a resource for other organizations, both government and non-government.  Their work in wildlife conservation and education is an inspiration, and I would recommend anyone who has an interest in this program to view their website, visit the facility, and research the information concerning their work.
Endangered Wolf Center	220241		/users/profile/283890	VirginiaZimmerman	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2014	The Endangered Wolf Center is an amazing place. Teaching about the environment and how every animal and plant is connected. They also teach how humans play a role in the ecosystem and how we can care for it and keep it clean, healthy and safe.  They do so much work to save endangered animals and their long and very successful history are inspiring.  Thank you for what you do and I love bringing my family out to all of your wonderful, fun and educational events.

Endangered Wolf Center	213012		/users/profile/276128	Aleksandra Z.	General Member of the Public	5	09/02/2014	Wonderful organization that works really hard to help raise awareness about wolves and dispel the ridiculous myths about them that many people, unfortunately, believe. I love the fact that they concentrate on educating the public, especially children, through creative workshops and working directly with the animals. The people who work there are truly dedicated and kind.  
Endangered Wolf Center	212994		/users/profile/275521	Diane118	Donor	5	09/01/2014	Awesome organization....a wonderful non-profit, working to protect and preserve our wolves from the threats facing them...
Endangered Wolf Center	212991	1	/users/profile/276104	catyak	General Member of the Public	5	09/01/2014	Being in the trenches of apathy and insensitivity is not a place for the faint of heart.  The Endangered Wolf Center works tirelessly to educate and inform those who make the effort to listen about the plight of wolves.  Wolves are an essential, integral living link in our environmental chain, yet they are treated like disposable castoffs in a terrible game driven by politics and money.  EWC is dedicated to dispelling the image of the "Big Bad Wolf."  I applaud their efforts!  I hope you will, too...  
Endangered Wolf Center	212945		/users/profile/276050	Chenoa	General Member of the Public	5	09/01/2014	This organization is knowledgeable and dedicated to educate the public with the truth regarding wolves based on facts and science! It understands the need for a balanced environment and the roles wolves play in keeping it healthy and balanced.  It is truly what a non profit should be in all aspects!
Endangered Wolf Center	212920		/users/profile/276016	ashliedeborah	General Member of the Public	5	09/01/2014	Great not for profit organisation! If the world had more people willing to stand up for animals and the environment, the world would not be in the position it is in.
Endangered Wolf Center	212899		/users/profile/275996	Dava W.	Donor	5	08/31/2014	A wonderful organization, dedicated to those they help.  They truly care.

Endangered Wolf Center	212892		/users/profile/275990	mamansrd	Donor	5	08/31/2014	Wolves are vital to the ecosystem. This organization which supports, cares for,and educates the public about wolves is outstanding  in the quality and breadth of their work.  Endangered Wolf Center dispels myths and provides correct information to overcome the misconceptions of a fearful few.  Thank you for all the work you do.
Endangered Wolf Center	212885		/users/profile/275983	Neesa M.	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	I always learn something extraordinary from The Endangered Wolf Center.   This is a wonderful organization dedicated not only to the survival of wolves but to the education and respect necessary for wolves and humans to find ways to share this planet in good harmony.  Great work done here!
Endangered Wolf Center	212884		/users/profile/275982	christa4284	Volunteer	5	08/31/2014	This center is focused equally on wolf/animal care and education to the public on wolves and other endangered canids, which are two crucial parts to ensuring survival of these unique and intelligent creatures. They are leaders in the world of Mexican and red wolf conservation and are armed with a vast amount of knowledge and support from their staff, volunteers, interns, and members. Their animal enclosures are truly impressive in that they attempt to mimic the natural environments in which these species occur. The Endangered Wolf Center is truly a great organization to be a part of and/or support.
Endangered Wolf Center	212883		/users/profile/275979	Judith30	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	They have organized to clear up the misconception  of wolves and the damage they supposedly have done.  it is possible for wolves and humans to coexist.  The wolf center is trying to teach all of us how that can happen.
Endangered Wolf Center	212875		/users/profile/275971	Audrey19	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	I love this!! They really fight for wolves and I appreciate them greatly. Keep up the good work!   :)
Endangered Wolf Center	212874		/users/profile/275970	Rosa M.	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	The endangered wolf centre is a briliant charity. They do great work. They do the type of work which this world needs! If there were more charitys like it this world would be a better place!
Endangered Wolf Center	212873		/users/profile/275969	Patricia106	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	Endangered Wolf Center has been an organization close to my heart for all the wonderful work they have done on behalf of wild canids, specially the Mexican wolf. Besides they were keepers of Don Diego  who died at 15 years old, founder of the captive breeding population and last wild wolf captured in Mexico.
Endangered Wolf Center	212868		/users/profile/275964	Angelika_Moss	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2014	I have been a member with the WWF and NRDC for a few years now. I am always trying to help and support the organization in saving the wolves. After I found out that there was an Endangered wolf center not far, I have been out to see the site and the animals. Took part of a wolf howl. I am impressed by the expertise the staff is handling the animals. I love to see the postings on there website. It is great to have people like the Endangered wolf center staff to help save these endangered wolves. 
Endangered Wolf Center	212866		/users/profile/275962	Gene A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/31/2014	This is an excellent organization doing good work.
Endangered Wolf Center	212865		/users/profile/275961	Julia41	Volunteer	5	08/31/2014	This is a wonderful organization doing very important work. Wolves are an integral aspect of nature and America should be reminded it that constantly!
Endangered Wolf Center	212742		/users/profile/275820	GregVanek	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2014	Have been watching the Endangered Wolf Center on their Facebook page ever since one of my friends shared one of their posts. They are doing great work for these endangered species. Very active, in the field, working hard. Especially on behalf of the red wolf, one of my favorite animals. It is a national treasure. I am now dedicated to being a life-long supporter of the Endangered Wolf Center and urge everyone else to do the same.  Every little bit helps and it is our responsibility to care for God's creatures.
Endangered Wolf Center	203233		/users/profile/265072	brendamomma	General Member of the Public	5	06/18/2014	Wow. Just speechless. We just came from a tour of the endangered wolf center and it was mind blowing. So much information I never knew about wolves and about nature. My 2 year old, 6 year old and 13 year old LOVED it, I am so happy I was able to share this educational experience with them. We met with their keeper staff who was so passionate, so kind, and the care they provide these endangered species is stellar. I suggest you 'all call and make a reservation for a tour today!
Endangered Wolf Center	195860		/users/profile/256125	JNevins	Donor	5	03/19/2014	This is a fabulous organization. I think they accomplish an astonishing amount for the animals with the resources that they have. The dedication and resolve of the employees is very impressive. I enjoy supporting this organization because I know it is directly helping the ecosystem which ultimately helps all of us that live on this planet. It is a cause we should all care about and support. 
Endangered Wolf Center	189518	2	/users/profile/247394	Zac_	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2013	I work at the Endangered Wolf Center as an Aminal Keeper. I love working with the animals and taking part in the breeding and management of the endangered canids, primarily the Mexican gray wolf and the Red wolf. But here I also get to interact with the public and educate everyone  as to the plights I these beautiful and remarkable animals. It is an amazing feeling when talking to someone and seeing them fall in love with the animals that I take care of everyday and wanting to make a difference to save them. This institution has been the leader in working with these 2 species and I am particularly proud to be a part of the Center. I have had the privilege of working at the Saint Louis Zoo in Education for many years and now at the Endangered Wolf Center as a Keeper, both of which Marlin Perkins was a huge part of.  He was a brilliant man and I am glad to taking part in the work he began.
Endangered Wolf Center	189288	2	/users/profile/247026	Peter409	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/25/2013	The Endangered Wolf Center has been a leader in Mexican wolf conservation for over 30 years. EWC has been a major participant in the captive breeding effort which has not only kept this wolf from going extinct but is the only source of wolves for the two reintroduction efforts currently underway.  Their educational outreach and leadership in the wolf conservation community is un matched.Peter SiminskiMexican Wolf SSP Coordinator
Endangered Wolf Center	188921	2	/users/profile/246580	STLstay	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2013	 The EWC great organization!  I'm always impressed with the staff and the work they do.  I would encourage everyone to visit and support the EWC.
Endangered Wolf Center	188874	3	/users/profile/246516	Lisa314	Volunteer	5	11/19/2013	I came to the Endangered Wolf Center in December of 2002, my purpose was to learn more about the wolf so that I could help educate others on why they are an important species in our world and why it is so important to correct the wrongs that have been imposed on this animal.   What I found and have experienced was an organization that is so very passionate about saving wolves and other wild canids.  The staff and animals have impacted my life in so many ways it is hard to put into words.  The passion and commitment of the staff is second to none, the animals draw you in and the knowledge and passion of the volunteers leave you wanting to know how you can help. I have participated in many tours, campfires, summer camps and other events and I am always re-energized by the responses of the visitors.  Visitors leave the center with a great appreciation for the animals and their plight.  Young campers come back year after year and fall in love with the animals, a junior volunteer program came out of the fact that young campers who had "aged" out of the summer camps wanted to keep coming.  I have seen several of those young people go on to college to work in the conservation field and they all say it was because of their time at the center. Participating in the breeding observations allowed me to gain insight to the pack life and see for myself what a wonderful animal the wolf is and the Endangered Wolf Center has proven throughout the last 43 years that their commitment and passion for wolves only continues to grow and they are striving to reach many more people and impact the survival of the majestic animal. I encourage everyone I know to support the Endangered Wolf Center, I know I will. Lisa Houska Volunteer 2002
Endangered Wolf Center	188781	2	/users/profile/246384	bretb	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2013	I have had the opportunity to witness first hand the level of dedication and committment that the staff of EWC has for the animals entrusted to their care. Their passion, and also compassion, is top notch even in the most challenging situations. 
Endangered Wolf Center	188736	2	/users/profile/246311	Friend926	Volunteer	5	11/17/2013	I am always amazed at the passion and zeal that the staff approaches the challenges facing them both from the sheer work load and daunting misperceptions of the public; but they persevere.   As a  volunteer I can only share a small part of the burden they carry to perform their duties, but I am always reminded by the staff members of how it helps.   The spirit of the work that all members have possessed since the inception of the Endangered Wolf Center keeps this a viable and relevant organization.   Further, they enthuse those in the community to find this same devotion in themselves to reach for a cause that serves a greater purpose.   
Endangered Wolf Center	188706	3	/users/profile/246266	Berkely	Volunteer	5	11/16/2013	After retiredment I wanted to volunteer at an organization that makes a significant contribution that helps prevent the extinction of this magnificent and long misunderstood and persecuted species. I chose The Endangered Wolf Center. The dedication of the staff and volunteers leaves a sense of hope that these wonderful and highly adaptable animals will not be wiped off the face of the earth.Besides their mission to preserve and protect Mexican gray wolves, red wolves and other wild  canid species the center manages to debunk some of the myths and the aura of threat an fear that have been prevaent for so long about the wolf. The Center also helps foster a sense of reverence for all that is wild and beautiful.Steve Johnson

The St. Louis area is so fortunate to have the Endangered Wolf Center and it's very dedicated staff and Board! There is a difference being made everyday right in our backyard! No wonder it is a model for all of the other facilities around the country! I'm proud to be a part of this noble and important effort.Laura Allers-Lowry
Endangered Wolf Center	188687	4	/users/profile/246244	Tim_41	Volunteer	5	11/15/2013	I am currently in my 3rd year as a volunteer, member and donor. I joined this organization to help Wolves that have been scorned and persecuted for no logical reason throughout the years. I often tell people that I have 2 jobs. I have my job that helps pay my mortgage, daughters tuition and utility bills, and I have my other job at the Endangered Wolf Center that belongs in my heart. Although, I am only a volunteer I consider my salary to be anytime I hear the Wolves howl. One of my favorite duties as a volunteer is hosting our night time camp fire howls. It is both an honor and a privilege to be able to speak to people about how Wolves really are and not how they are perceived in movies and story books. I love being a voice for the Wolves and I am grateful the staff at the EWC has the confidence in me to perform such an important task. It is an honor to be a volunteer and member at this legendary organization and I never have to remind myself as to why I give my time to this organization. The Wolves need this place and I am proud to be a small part of it.
Endangered Wolf Center	188674	3	/users/profile/246229	Linnylee	Donor	5	11/15/2013	I have been involved with the EWC since June of 2009.  When I visited there in May 2009  I was enamored with the the Mexican Gray Wolves and all of the species there.  The staff and volunteers were so friendly and informative.  I was 'hooked' !!  I have had the thrill of naming quite a few wolves and a Swift Fox...I enjoy the antics of the Swift Fox and the beauty of the Maned Wolf, the intelligence and social manner of the Mexican gray Wolf, and the beauty of the Red Wolf.  But I cannot leave out the unique qualities of the African Painted Dog.  I believe in the mission of the Endangered Wolf Center, and hope I will live to see the change that wolves in the wild will make to balance our ecosystem.  I have introduced this wonderful facility to many and several have joined me in membership to help with this mission.  I have the best hopes for EWC to accomplish this effort which was started by Marlin and Carol Perkins...may their dream come true!
Endangered Wolf Center	188669	3	/users/profile/246225	Debbie513	Volunteer	5	11/15/2013	As a volunteer at the Endangered Wolf Center, I am very impressed with the dedication and commitment shown by all the staff and volunteers towards the care of the endangered wolvesand other canids at the center.   The center's mission is to preserve and protect the animals as well as to release healthy wolves into the wild.  In addition, we aim to educate visitors, via tours as well as other events such as campire howls, that wolves are not the vicious creatures that they are portrayed as in stories and legends.   It is an honor for me to be a volunteer for this organization.  
Endangered Wolf Center	188625	4	/users/profile/246166	amymarieb	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2013	The Endangered Wolf Center is doing hugely important work, both in conservation and education. Every experience I have ever had visiting the Center has been positive and enjoyable. My perspective on  wolves has changed dramatically thanks to what I have learned from them.
Endangered Wolf Center	188609	4	/users/profile/246143	TravisM	Volunteer	5	11/15/2013	I have volunteered at the Center for many years now and have constantly been bowled over by the amazing spirit of camaraderie that exists between the staff members and the volunteer base. With some organizations (maybe because  their overriding goal is too amorphous or abstract) it's not always clear why people work or volunteer there--maybe they don't even know. That's not the case at the Center. With the Endangered Wolf Center, the goal is always the animals and it's inspiring to know that the work they've done (and I've done) may have helped to literally save multiple species of animals. It's the torch everyone carries at the Center. If we are meant to be stewards of the environment, the Endangered Wolf Center really has been the cornerstone of stewardship for the last 40+ years. 
Endangered Wolf Center	188603	3	/users/profile/246129	EWC1	Donor	5	11/14/2013	As a former Board Member of the E.W.C. I can give a qualified "thumbs up" for all the dedicated hard work and commitment that occurs daily to assure the preservation of the Mexican Gray Wolf.  The Endangered Wolf Center is a hidden "gem" of conservation passion that does so much with so little.  Truly a wonderful organization with a passionate mission it was a honor to serve in the name of preservation.                 
Endangered Wolf Center	188570	4	/users/profile/246083	Mossotti	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2013	I currently work at the Endangered Wolf Center as the Director of Animal Care and Conservation.  I have worked with the EWC for many years and believe whole-heartedly in its mission.  Its dedicated staff and volunteers are working diligently to help conserve endangered species and educate about their role in the wild and the importance of a healthy ecosystem.  The impact and legacy this Center, and its founders Marlin and Carol Perkins, have left will affect many generations to come.  I am not only an employee but a member and a donor.  I am proud to work and support the Endangered Wolf Center's efforts and hope many more will join our pack.

Endangered Wolf Center	188567	3	/users/profile/246079	jconnor98	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2013	I have known of the Endangered Wolf Center for many years and have seen the vital conservation work they do to save endangered species of wolves and other canids.  The critically endangered Mexican gray wolf would not be here today with out this center's world-renown expertise in canid husbandry.  The organization was instrumental in saving the red wolf and the Mexican wolf from extinction...how many other facilities in the world can claim that?  Their approach to research, education, husbandry, policy and management of wild canids and human-wildlife conflicts is ground-breaking and will help change the face of conservation.
Endangered Wolf Center	188564	3	/users/profile/246076	EWC1971	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2013	I am the Director of Operations at the Endangered Wolf Center, which is dedicated to preserving and reintroducing to the wild some of the most endangered wolves in the world. This requires a careful balance and blending of animal care and education. The Center offers educational tours and evening events, which both inform and entertain visitors. On daytime tours, guests can see the five species of canids that live at the Center.  On evening wolf howls, guests get a chance to hear wolves howl and to howl themselves. The Center relies on and deeply appreciates its strong army of volunteers, many of whom lead tours and host campfire wolf howls. The Center is a non-profit that receives no state or federal funding, so its vital mission depends on money generated by tours, events, memberships, donations and sponsorships.
Endangered Wolf Center	188406	3	/users/profile/245824	Maxine Bradley	Donor	5	11/12/2013	The Endangered Wolf Center has been doing vitally important work in the areas of education, managed breeding and research for endangered wolves and other canids for over 40 years.  The staff and volunteers are passionate and dedicated to the Center's mission.  They have many educational and fun programs, events and activities for all ages.  There's nothing quite like hearing wolves howl when you're sitting around a campfire or seeing energetic puppies playing during the day.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	217548		/users/profile/281079	Debbie141	Donor	5	09/26/2014	This is such a great rescue/shelter.  They don't turn animals away because it may cost them too much in vet bills, they take on the hard cases.  They work tirelessly to get the furry ones to a point they can be adopted and they never give up on any of them, no matter how long they may be there.  The nicest thing if the cat can be, they are roaming around a room not in a cage.  I always know my donations go straight to the care of these kitties.  These folks have stuck it out through thick and thin to ensure the right thing is being done for those they care for.  I really can't say enough but these folks are tireless, dedicated, honest, friendly and they love what they do.  That is why I donate when I can to them, 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	217505		/users/profile/281028	Dan-Kara R.	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	The people at HELP humane society are so friendly and warm. I love feeling welcomed instead of like a burden like i have in other shelters. All of the animals seem at home and well cared for which is the most important thing.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	217368		/users/profile/280890	Amy_180	Client Served	5	09/25/2014	HELP Humane is wonderful! Cyndi Dill and the rest of the crew do such a fantastic job with their cats (and dogs). I have contacted Cyndi in the past with cats I have found out about that have severe medical issues that had no place else to go and she took them with a smile! HELP provided as much vet care as was needed and has either found homes or they are long-time residents of the facility. This group is AMAZING with what they do and I will never forget the times they have helped me place cats I had no where else to go with. Love you guys!!!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	217151		/users/profile/280672	shanvw	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	It is hard to know where to start with my review of HELP Humane; I have had many different roles!  : -)I first heard of HELP at a Feral Friends meeting in Kansas City; this meeting was focused on Trap/Neuter/Return, an issue I had quite recently studied and embraced.  (I am still very active in TNR.) I subsequently visited HELP to participate in a TNR project and fell in love with all the HELP cats. This led to a weekly volunteer night of scoop/water/feed, which made me even more familiar with the cats, to the point where I was convinced I had my own "fan club" in a particular room (nope; they loved everyone, which was even more awesome.)  When the Shelter Buddy program started, I joined, and I also contributed to various HELP causes as I could (there were  quite a few of these over the years; I would have to check my tax receipts; remember, everyone, that donations to HELP are tax deductible!) One thing I would like for people to keep in mind--there are many wonderful reviews of HELP's treatment of their animals, with lots of references to how happy and safe the animals are.  Well, it's true, they are!   But please, everyone, keep in mind that if you adopt from HELP, you are still saving a life--any animal you adopt from HELP gives HELP a chance to save an animal who is not yet safe!  HELP rescues animals who are in need, so if you adopt from HELP, you save a life, because you have now given a spot to another needy furbaby!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	217061		/users/profile/280581	Susan334	Donor	5	09/24/2014	HELP Humane is a wonderful animal shelter!  Cyndi Dill and staff are so caring and concerned about the animals in their care.  It is a tremendous free roam shelter where every furry is happy and loved.Our family first became involved with HELP when our daughter was home from college one summer and started doing some volunteer work for them.  Lauren volunteered with them for many years until she moved out of state but is still committed and sponsors a cat every year.  They deserve any support people can give them--this is truly an incredible shelter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216833		/users/profile/112765	dhenry	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	Our whole family started volunteering at Help about 7 years ago.   I always feared going to an "animal Shelter" for fear the animals would be kept in cages and might not be adopted but put down.  Help Humane in Belton, MO is completely different most of the cats are free roaming.  New arrivals are kept in a large cage until they get use to their new home and then they are free to roam.  Animals are not put down because no one wants them.  If for some reason they are not adopted they have a home forever at Help with a large family to love and take care of their every need.  Special needs animals are cared for and loved and find homes.  We foster two special need boys and wouldn't trade them for anything.  If you need a new family member check out Helps cats and dogs.  If you just want a place to come and let tension leave you come and love on the furries.  We survive on donations and would welcome donations of money, food, litter, etc.  Remember one person can make a different.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96585	1	/users/profile/112765	dhenry	Volunteer	5	08/25/2011	Three years ago I walked into Help Humane to drop off something to a friend and fell in love.  Since that time my husband, son and myself are regular visitors.  Trying to get by for a couple of hours each week just loving and patting the cats.   Helping where needed.   I have a soft heart and was afraid I would want to take every cat home.  But these cats are mostly free roaming you sit down on the sofa or chair and you have four or five cats on your lap, on your shoulder and wanting nothing more than to love you and be loved.  This is a no kill shelter.  It isn't like you will come the next week and the cats are gone because their time ran out.  They are there for as long as they need a place to live as they wait for their forever home.    I saw them take in cats and dogs that were to be put down at other shelters and then turn around and find these beatiful animals forever homes.   When they already had many kittens and took 43 more from a shelter that was putting all their kittens down due to lack of space.  Help made the space and found foster homes.  Kitten after kitten was adopted that would hae been destroyed if not for Help.   My husband works a high stress job but loves to go and as he puts it "de-stresses" from all the love he gets.  Wishing there were more shelters like Help,  In fact my first grandcat came from Help.  When my son got his first home the first thing he did was adopt one of the cats.    Help is now looking for "help" as donations are down.  Shelter Buddies are being sought for $10 a month you can help them ontinue this wonderful loving work.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216802		/users/profile/280319	Susan333	Client Served	5	09/24/2014	About 1 1/2 years ago, my daughter and I wanted to adopt a kitten, our senior cat had passed away a few months before. We found Help Humane online and the stories posted with their cats really drew us in!! We went in person and we both fell in love with 2 different senior cats.(Never even looked at the kittens lol) We couldn't pick just one so we adopted them both. Two-Bits and Butterfly. They have brought so much light and joy to our home I could not imagine life without them!! I highly recommend Help Humane for your next pet, they are awesome!! The animals are treated like family there. We always donate money whenever possible to help support this wonderful place!! 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216793		/users/profile/280307	Susan332	Donor	5	09/24/2014	After I had to euthanize my kitty Stanley, in 2010, I decided I would adopt again.  I don't remember how I found Help Humane but I'm glad I did.  I found the people in this organization really care about animals and go above and beyond to save as many as they can.  This is especially gratifying to me since we 'kill' so many animals every year.  I am a regular donor to Help Humane and I'm happy to do it.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216781		/users/profile/280294	Pat_50	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2014	HELP was sending out roots in the community more than 20 years ago, when "rescue" was a new concept and they were a nucleus of concerned citizens.  Back then, in Cass County, MO, if you called to report an animal at large, you were advised to shoot it if it was bothering you.  Instead, once their own homes were filled, these people would network to find other like-minded, caring souls to bring helpless, frightened, often abandoned animals into their homes and hearts.  It is gratifying to see how this organization has matured into the still wonderful, cageless, loving, caring space it has become, with the respect, and more importantly, financial backing, from people who appreciate the fantastic job that they do.  Keep up the good work, putting animals and their safety at the forefront of your priorities.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216765		/users/profile/203722	UKMumof3	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	A wonderful free-roaming, No-Kill shelter full of love and caring.  The staff and volunteers are friendly, knowledgeable about cats and clearly love each and every one of the cats in their care.  It is a lovely place to visit and just hang out on a couch in one of the rooms for a little cat cuddle therapy time!  Highly recommend you visit if ever in the area.  
Help of Raymore, Inc.	152824		/users/profile/203722	UKMumof3	Volunteer	5	04/06/2013	HELP is truly an amazing no-kill shelter run by the most hardworking, loving and dedicated people I have ever met.   I foster kittens for them when they are too young/sick to safely be in a shelter environment and it has been a wonderful experience.  There is nothing better than hearing the news that one of 'our' foster kittens has been adopted into their furever home and knowing that without HELP this probably wouldn't have been possible.  HELP does amazing work in our community with their TNR program to help reduce the feral cat population, but sadly, I bet most of the local residents don't even know.  They are unsung heroes who genuinely care about each and every animal they take in and have created the most wonderful free-roaming shelter.  I used to dread the idea of going into an animal shelter because I knew it would break my heart, but HELP is truly a wonderfully happy & peaceful place to visit after a long stressful day and just hang out with the cats for a while.   
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216760		/users/profile/280272	Erica45	Client Served	5	09/24/2014	Words cannot express how much I love HELP Humane in Belton! My husband and I have adopted five cats from Help over the past few years. They have brought so much joy into our lives. The kind people at Help care about these animals so much. They take great care of them, they educate other people and they give these animals a second chance at life. While some shelters would put down sick animals,  Help provides the care to rehabilitate these animals and help them get better. I hope that Help is around for a very long time so they can continue doing the great work that they do!

She is beautiful and was well cared for. They have had several events that we were lucky enough to participate in to benefit the animals in their care. They advocate and educate.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216743		/users/profile/112987	beltcat1	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I cannot speak highly enough of HELP Humane, I have never seen the love, compassion and caring that these animals are given in a shelter elsewhere.  No matter how poor a condition or health issues,this organization is willing and does go all out to provide the care that each case requires.  I first became aware of HELP Humane several years ago after a traumatic loss of several pets due to a total loss house fire and have watched it grow from fosters in peoples homes to the homey atmosphere it has today.   I have adopted several animals from HELP , volunteered for some time, and fostered numerous cats and dogs as well.   It is a truly NO-Kill shelter and survives solely on donations and the support and dedication of volunteers.  It is truly worth you time to make a visit.

The shelter is exceedingly clean, friendly, and inviting.  I would encourage anyone who can open their heart and home to a cat or dog to please go there.  I know there will be one who you cannot walk out without!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216741		/users/profile/280246	Lexi20	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I found HELP Humane back in 2007, I believe.  I was killing time before a sports game at the school I taught, and wandered in.  I only stayed for a little bit, but was enthralled with all the free-roaming cats!  For some reason, I didn't go back until December 2011.  A lot had changed in my life.  I was no longer teaching and was very stressed at my job at the time.  I came in and explored the entire shelter.  I was amazed at all I saw.  I loved the set-up and learned about each room in the shelter. I learned the philosophy behind what HELP did.  I felt great leaving and being able to return since it was a TRUE NO-KILL shelter.  I didn't have to worry that one of the cats might not be there the next time I visited.  If they weren't there, it was because they got adopted.  I started visiting at least once a week, if not more.  I realized how calm this place made me.  I would lose hours there, which is a good thing for me.  Almost three years later, I am still visiting once a week or more if I can.  This place is my stress release, my therapy.  I volunteer my time, I used to do the orientations for new volunteers until my job schedule changed recently.  I look forward to going to HELP Humane.  I just wish we were able to help all the homeless animals.  I thank God that HELP is able to do what they can for the ones they do get.  I love the compassion of all those involved at HELP.  I've met many new people/friends through HELP.  This place has been a life changer for me in the most positive of ways.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216732		/users/profile/280233	DKH47	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I started fostering dogs and cats a few years ago.  In that time, I have had a dozen puppies/dogs and more than fifty kittens/cats from six different organizations.  Although all do a great job, HELP Humane is definitely at the top of the list.  The facility, staff and volunteers are completely devoted to each and every meowing and woofing resident.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216731		/users/profile/203975	Judy69	Donor	5	09/24/2014	I donated supplies  and funds for medical care to HELP.  I was directed to the site by a friend's experience.  After reading about Help when I had an opportunity to give, I did.  At that time I was able to tour their facility.  It's truly a home atmosphere.  The animals are well loved.  They are not stressed because they feel safe & cared for.  The volunteers activlely seek out new homes for their charges but to those who cannot be adopted for health issues they are still welcomed.  HELP feels like a big, loving, remarkable family!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	216729		/users/profile/280231	Jess20	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I first became involved with HELP when I adopted my first cat from them.  I loved the passion and enthusiasm they showed for the animals in their care.  After that, I decided to start volunteering.  I absolutely love helping this organization!  They are unlike any organization I have ever been involved with.  They are so passionate about what they do and the animals they care for.  Each animal is treated with so much love and compassion!  They treat each animal like their own pet and in doing so, they learn their personalities.  This allows them to truly help adopters pick out the best pet for their family!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	188228		/users/profile/245540	Gina45	Client Served	5	11/09/2013	I used to have two perfect cats. The first cat I got when I was in 2nd grade, and the 2nd cat when I was in 5th grade. They grew up with me, and remained the loves of my life all through my teen years and half way into my twenties. When they passed on, each at their own time, I was devastated, and I couldn't imagine ever having another cat again. I couldn't replace my little girls. Life continued, I fell in love, moved to Kansas, got married, and as time continued to pass I started wishing we had a little four legged friend around our home to keep us on our toes, but I just wasn't sure. I figured I'd look, just in case I find a cat that stands out from the others, a cat that I just had to have. I couldn't handle visiting a typical shelter with rows and rows of caged homeless pets that looked so unhappy. Seeing all those sad animals stuck in cages with no homes would break my heart too much. While looking on Petfinder for a possible contender to add some cuteness to our home, I came upon some cats from Help Humane Society, so I checked out their website and learned that they were not the typical animal shelter. The animals roam free, and all of the volunteers work around the clock to play and spend lots of time with them, making this shelter a very fun and happy place for the animals. Visitors are allowed to roam around the shelter and spend as much time there as they like, and multiple visits to insure the right pet for them is considered is encouraged. During my first visit to the shelter I was not only greeted by two very nice ladies who could tell you anything you wanted to know about each animal in their care, but I was also greeted by a couple of their very friendly and outgoing feline tenants. I liked that I was able to spend as much time as I needed on my own looking around the shelter, and I met some very friendly tenants who were very content there, making my decision not to take them home with me feel less terrible. I decided a second visit would be best, and it was during my second visit that my new family member caught my eye. The ladies of the shelter told me what they could about this particular cat, and still not wanting to rush into any decision I decided to sleep on it and make a third visit later. By the third visit I decided I couldn't stand to let this cat go to someone else. My three visits to this very happy place is the reason I now have the most sweetest little cat who never fails to surprise me with how smart she is. The Help Humane Society took her in when she was a stray kitten, and made sure she was healthy, well taken care of and safe until someone came along and fell in love with her. I am so grateful for a shelter like Help Humane where the animals are loved like family, and not treated like stray animals. It is a very happy and friendly place to find your next family member. 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	188129		/users/profile/245392	Jasmine8	Client Served	5	11/08/2013	When i discovered Help of Raymore I found them online. I went in to visit  a particular cat Angelo. His picture caught my eye and i just had to meet him. When we walked in the door we were greeted by two very friendly and patient women who told me all about him and his history. I was able to view the whole cat section of the  HELP home and i just loved all the kitties. Their were old, young, friendly and not so friendly cats but most of all i loved the set up of the different rooms we could walk through and look at all the cats just hanging out. They seemed well cared for. Angelo was a timid boy and one of the women helped me get him into the carrier and even clipped his claws for me prior to us leaving. A great, friendly staff! They really do care about their pets! As angelo and i were leaving one of the ladies he was close to was close to tears! The compassion these people have is amazing! I feel so blessed to have found Angelo he is the best cat i have ever owned. He is cuddly, personable and playful. My advice? Go adopt a cat today! They change your life! I wouldn't have changed a thing about my adoption experience. 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	188103		/users/profile/245356	DLove4	Client Served	5	11/08/2013	We had lost our two cats within a year of each other, one lived to be very old but the other was younger and we were not expecting that to happen.  We waited a couple of years and then we decided we had to have another one, actually our kids begged us to get another one.  It was time to go to the dreaded shelters.  I love shelters for the thought that they help animals but HATE going into them, all those fury babies with no homes, living in cages, and then sent off to die if no one takes them.  When I walked into HELP Humane, it was just a whole new experience.  The cats are free roaming, some are in cages as they adjust but most are roaming around in different rooms.  It is like a big home for cats/kittens (and they also have dogs too, just not as much space for those babies so not as many) and not a depressing place to go.  The people who take care of those babies have so much love for them.  We did find our fury baby there a couple of years ago.  When I went to pick her up, she was being snuggled by her volunteer and her volunteer was crying as she was happy she had a home but sad to see her leave.  That is the love they have for those sweet babies.  I knew I would be back, no question.  We have been back, over and over, to visit and have become shelter buddies.  My kids even save money, on their own, to give to them.  They love going there and we are always checking on who got a new home, and the kids know most of their names.  They always ask, were any of them adopted and who was it.  They get big smiles when they get a home.  We walked in to the shelter to get a cat/kitten, we walked out with so much more.   Please get your baby from this shelter, volunteer or donate.  It will change your lives more than it will change theirs.   
Help of Raymore, Inc.	152638		/users/profile/203583	Ann_55	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	I first went to HELP to donate items from my cat when she passed away in 2009.  I could not believe the number of cats free roaming and playing with each other.  I was also free to roam and look around.  I could not believe every corner I turned was another room full of cats.  What surprised me the most was the number of special needs cats that they had that would be well cared for and loved for the rest of their lives.  This is truely a NO-kill shelter that wants nothing more then to show the animals that have already been thrown away by someone that they are special and they have nothing to fear or worry about any longer.  I love my volunteer time with all the animals at HELP and hope I help bring a little peace and joy to their lives.

The care given to animals is as near like a home as possible.  They are a "no kill" shelter  and give their animals the dignaty they deserve until they are adopted by a good family or  pass.   I have become attached to the animals and the wonderful staff and volunteers.  I would suggest that anyone who can donate their time and money to this great place.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	152614		/users/profile/172437	Patricia J.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	So many people say they could not volunteer at or even visit an animal shelter because it is so depressing.  They have not visited HELP Humane in Belton Missouri.  There is nothing depressing about our shelter.  We do have some cats in cages, but these are either new kitties, or kitties that must be confined due to medical or behavior issues.  We have some sad cases, but whatever chance they have for a life as normal as possible, they are given that chance at HELP including medical care.  The employeees and volunteers love the animals here like they are our own.  We are happy when one of our babies gets adopted, but sad at the same time because we miss them so.  HELP is a strictly no kill shelter and operates solely on donations.   
Help of Raymore, Inc.	127388	1	/users/profile/172437	Patricia J.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2012	I have been a volunteer with HELP Humane for 3 years.  HELP is a free roaming absolutely no kill shelter located in Belton Mo.  This shelter takes animals that are hardship cases, such as FIV+ cats, FELV cats, any medical issue, no matter the severity.  They receive medical care, and more importantly, the love and care of the staff and volunteers.  Many get better, many don't, but we make sure that their time is quality time.  The goal of the shelter is to find quality homes for these precious kitties and dogs.  If they are not adopted, they will always have a home in the shelter.    
Help of Raymore, Inc.	127566	1	/users/profile/172635	Ronnie T.	Client Served	5	10/21/2012	I was looking for another companion cat for my other two, so I went on Petfinder.com. The shelter did not matter to me, only the cat's heath and personality. I was linked to HELP's website and was amazed at the beautiful pictures of each animal,  the detailed description on their behavior and most important: the background or history.  The knowledge of each animal plus they were a free roaming shelter made up my mind to adopt from them. I went with a special needs cat and have never regretted it. The staff have hearts of gold and compassion beyond belief.  I have been a supporter (shelter buddy) ever since!  I  am also now educated about the TNR program and how important it is since it gives the best option for a cat to live.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	127241		/users/profile/112735	Marcy C.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2012	I am so proud to be a part of this shelter!   HELP takes on some very hard luck cases and turns their  precious lives around.  They have recently been able to purchase their own facility and reduced rent expanse so they can spend even more of their budget to care for the animals.  This means more animals can be saved and live a comfortable life while waiting for their forever families to find them.    
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96566	3	/users/profile/112735	Marcy C.	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2011	This is a shelter like no other I've ever seen.  Almost 2 years ago,  we decided it was time to add another dog to our family.  I don't believe in buying from breeders or pet shops, so I knew a shelter animal was what we needed.  I was so scared to go though - I'd seen pictures of traditional shelters and was afraid I'd want to bring all the animals home with me. We found Sammie on Petfinder and went to meet him.  HELP was nothing like I expected from a shelter!  I was greeted at the door by friendly kitties before a person had a chance to say "hello".   The place was not lined with cages of scared animals, the animals were walking around interacting with each other & people who came in.  They were all so happy & cared for, it was really a nice surprise.   I met Sammie, filled out an application, then brought my family to meet him.  After we were approved to adopt, we brought our other dog to meet him and the people there had no problem with that.  They didn't just want to send him out to a home, they wanted to make sure we were all a match.  Sammie did come home with us and is a wonderful addition to our family.   Because I was so impressed with the whole experience, I now tell everyone looking for a pet that they need to go there and check it out.  I cannot volunteer on a regular basis, but am a Shelter Buddy ($10 per month to help with animal care!) and donate time & goods whenever I can.  HELP is a unique kind of shelter that I wish all others could be like.  They don't have a big budget but do a lot of good with every penny that they get.    
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96831	1	/users/profile/113141	michelef	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I became aware of HELP Humane around 2008 and adopted our cat there shortly after. I never really looked forward to going to animal shelters and had actually only  ever adopted one pet at a shelter before. My memories of that place are good people, good animals but sad environment, no hope other than an occasional animal getting lucky and making it out. The animals at HELP are happy, well cared for and actually loved as individuals by the staff and the volunteers. I am happy being there, it is a place of hope, a place where good is being done and where you can join in with others and achieve something you wouldn't be able to on your own. A place to talk with other people who share my interests. I should pay them to let me work there, it provides so much stress relief for me.  If every animal shelter could be like HELP Humane.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96762	1	/users/profile/113040	Tonia H.	Volunteer	5	08/28/2011	I have known this organization for several years now.  I have adopted from them, fostered for them, and had their help in spaying/neutering a feral feline mother and her kittens in my neighborhood.  I am happy to say that they are a shelter who truly do care for the animals in their care.  They take in animals no other shelter would and give them a chance to find a home or care for them and give them veterinary care for life.  What a blessing they have been to our furry friends!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96746	1	/users/profile/113019	Kathy I.	Volunteer	5	08/28/2011	In 2003 I moved to an apartment complex that had a small feral cat colony that was rapidly increasing. A neighbor and I worked to trap, vet for spay/neuter/vaccinations, and release the cats back. In 2004, one of our girls got sick and I needed advice. I called and e-mailed multiple shelters and the only response I received was from HELP Humane. It did not matter that the cat was feral, and it did not matter they didn't know me, they answered all my questions, gave me ideas I had not thought about and knowledge I did not have before. I didn't know I was doing TNR, had never heard of that, but they explained to me why it works and why it is an integral part of any no-kill initiative by stopping birth of more homeless pets. HELP had been involved in TNR for many years at that time and still is.  I attended my first volunteer meeting in 2004. Since that time I have done whatever I can including trapping, transporting to clinics, foster home, shelter for ferals, volunteering at events. I have adopted and I am a proud Shelter Buddy.  HELP Humane is what other shelters should strive to be. Come visit and be amazed how the volunteers know all the cats by name on sight, no matter how much one may look like another, and can tell you their history, where they came from, how they have blossomed since arriving at HELP.  At HELP all life is precious. There are no expiration dates. 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96737	1	/users/profile/75006	Mrtaylandlady1900	Donor	5	08/27/2011	I first heard about Help from a friend who lives in the area.   I was so impressed by my friend's recommendation and the website materials that I have been a donor for several years.   The shelter environment is a very positive one and I been able to recruit several other donors from my part of the country.    I only wish that there was a similar group in Maryland.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96723	2	/users/profile/112979	tararaesands	Volunteer	5	08/27/2011	When my mom and I had a house fire in 2009, one of the first people at our house to help with our cats was a volunteer with HELP. This volunteer, our very, and the director of HELP worked hands on with us and with another rescue group and with emergency responders to ensure that all cats were accounted for and received the care needed. From basic head rubs and reassurance to carrying around one that has special needs (obsessive compulsive disorder), each volunteer from HELP made a tremendous impact that day! HELP continues to impact the community on a day to day basis in everything they do! A better shelter could not exist! I am proud to call myself a volunteer at HELP Humane Society.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96716	1	/users/profile/112967	Shirley23	Volunteer	5	08/27/2011	One hot July day I was at the kitchen window and say a momma cat and three babies.  I could hardly believe my eyes so I went down the stairs to the patio door and sure enough there was a cat and three kittens.  I filled a bowl with water to take to them but of course they ran away.  I left the water and just watched from the basement door.  It didnt take momma long to crawl under the fence to get a drink and then she brought the babies so they could get a drink too.  That was the beginning of my feral colony that still eats from my back yard.  Of course I couldnt get anywhere near momma or her babies so before too many months I had more babies and then even more babies followed that.  I talked to anyone and everyone about all these babies but no one had any ideas as to how to stop the process until I was told to try HELP Humane.  I talked to several other people that were familiar with the TNR program and then one day the director of HELP Humane called me and explained that I could trap these cats and take them to vets and have them spayed and or neutered.  I had no idea that there was such a thing.  So one lady came to my house and brought a few traps and gave me a crash course on how to set the traps and then in a few days another lady came to help me and we trapped nine cats all in the same day and within about a month to six weeks all my feral cats had been spayed and/or neutered.  There were twenty cats in all that were eating from my back yard.  Not all of them were babies from the original momma but some of her babies had babies of their own before I finally got the cycle stopped. I now volunteer at the shelter where I now have adopted three cats that HELP Humane rescued.  Now I foster baby kittens until they are old enough to live at the shelter and be adopted to their forever home.

It's often difficult to walk into some 'shelters' without feeling extreme sadness, but not so at Help.  This is such a happy place to visit with a home like feel and free roaming kitties.  Staff and volunteers alike are dedicated caregivers, providing excellent physical and emotional care.  Help believes that all animals deserve a second chance for a quality life regardless of circumstances or disabilities.  My calico cat Clarabelle wouldn't be alive today if not for the assistance of Help's open heart and open arms.  Clarabelle was found on a city street paralyzed in the back end.  She was taken to a local pound and was literally an hour away from being destroyed when a rescue angel spotted her and shared her story within our community.  The good folks at Help immediately stepped up with sponsorship for this sweet little cat who had suffered an unknown trauma.  Being a volunteer foster mom for Help (and a rehab nurse for people) I accepted Clarabelle into my home.  She had no fractures and no other injuries or illnesses but her prognosis was uncertain.  Over the course of two months I was blessed with the opportunity to watch over Clarabelle as her body healed and her spirits lifted.  Today she walks and climbs and jumps, she plays and she loves.  She's also found her forever home right here with me!  Without the support of Help, Clarabelle would never have found her second chance.  This lovely calico cat and I have together signed up as Shelters Buddies for Help, offering our monthly charitable donation as a sign of our ongoing faith and appreciation for all that they do for the homeless animals who need second chances.                  
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96696		/users/profile/112938	Kristieo8	Client Served	5	08/27/2011	I learned about Help online while searching for a kitten. It was a bit out of the way to go, but was well worth it. They're a roaming shelter and my boyfriend and I instantly knew we HAD to get a kitty from this shelter from how well the animals were treated. We picked up a little boy and haven't looked back, we're even looking into getting another from this shelter.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96687	1	/users/profile/112914	PatriciaJC	Donor	5	08/26/2011	From the first moment I set foot in HELP, I knew that I was in a shelter unlike any other.  Immaculately clean and cheerful, the animals seemed to be living a supervised freedom, taking turns peacefully enjoying life out of the confines of their cages.  One got the feeling that the animals lucky enough to be rescued by HELP, did not feel imprisoned.  By the end of my visit I realized that the answer was in the intensity of the love that undeniably permeated the facility.  Three years have passed and through my involvement as donor, shelter buddy and sponsor my respect and gratitude have only grown for this organization who cares for EVERY animal as a member of the family.  And this is a family that does not deny the best treatment possible to its old and sick.  I have no doubt that there are other wonderful animal shelters with hardworking selfless individuals, but there could never be another shelter anywhere that could hold a candle to this amazing shelter nonpareil!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96664	1	/users/profile/112872	Diana U.	Volunteer	5	08/26/2011	I learned about HELP from a dear friend who is a foster mom for HELP's kittens. We would stop in occasionally just to visit with the animals. But one day, about a year after losing our sweet Jack Russell, our visit turned into an adoption when we found an adorable Norwich terrier named Zorro. That was almost 3 years ago and since then we've also added Fiona, a 3-legged Min-Pin, and Aspen a big gray/white cat to our family. Our entire family now volunteers in some form and don't know what we'd do without HELP Humane. The people are wonderful, giving their time to rescue animals that otherwise would have NO hope. If they aren't there to rescue these precious babies, then who will???
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96656	1	/users/profile/112866	sdrydenpwr	Donor	5	08/26/2011	I have adopted 3 cats from HELP Humane over the last 5 years and started volunteering there last fall. It is an unusual mostly free roaming shelter with couches and chairs for the cats and the visitors. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the cats and kittens so they are very well socialized. I have seen frightened cats who are new to the shelter become calm and friendly after a week or so due to the gentle care they receive. HELP also takes in animals who are special needs and have various medical problems unlike other shelters in this area. It is just a great organization.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96647	1	/users/profile/112856	Lisa234567	Donor	5	08/26/2011	Awesome experience with them.  They truly do care about animals and saving their lives.  I am a Shelter Buddy and feel very good about donating to them every month.  Keep up the great work that you do.

While I personally haven't had dealings, I know others who have & they've spoken highly of them.Without a great organization like this, a lot of animals would not receive the care that they deserve.Keep up the good work that you do for our metro area Humane Society!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96644	1	/users/profile/112852	Steven23	Donor	5	08/26/2011	HELP Humane is a very special rescue and one of the few truly no kill shelters in the country.  HELP does its best to save as many animals as possible, and takes in animals whether they are healthy, sick, or have long-term ailments such as FIV, feline Leukemia, and other disorders.  I had recently become a Shelter Buddy, pledging to donate $10/month to help this amazing organization keep it's doors open.
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96612	1	/users/profile/112802	jewellsmom	Donor	5	08/25/2011	I am extremely picky about the organizations I support.  HELP Humane is a TRUE no-kill shelter for abused/abandoned animals.  They take in animals that no other shelter will and do what is necessary to give them another chance to find a furever, loving home.  I have recently become a Shelter Buddy, as they need assistance to keep their doors open.  It would truly be a shame to lose such a caring group of people that care so much for the animals whose lives they touch.

Help of Raymore, Inc.	96607	2	/users/profile/112796	Marie-Odile F.	Volunteer	5	08/25/2011	I was involved with other pet rescues and shelters in the past, and when I moved to Lawrence, KS, from Florida, I started looking around to decide where to volunteer to help homeless pets. Even though HELP Humane is an hour away and there are rescues that are closer to my home, I drive there to volunteer every week because it is truly special and different.  HELP Humane is a true no-kill shelter that takes in many special needs cats that would have been put down at Kansas City shelters and not rescued by other groups. I watched them take in cats with various ailments like hyperthyroidism (like Macy), heart murmurs (Oliver), kidney failure (Jasmine), FIV (Twister and others), eye disease (Desiree), and others. Desiree, for example, came in with painful untreated eye disease that required surgical removal of her eyes. She was rescued by HELP even though her ailment looked terrible at first and she tested FIV-positive. Desiree got her surgery and good care throughout her recovery. She is now a happy, bold cat that fearlessly roams the main room at HELP Humane and licks my face when I greet her. This type of story is not uncommon at HELP Humane neither, and many such pets thus had a chance at a happy life and adoption thanks to HELP Humane! Every pet at HELP Humane gets so much love and attention from a crew of volunteers and staff that absolutely care for each animal that comes in. The pets are kept in good health in a mostly cage-free environment until they get adopted, even if it takes years. They are happy and well-socialized. They are also matched appropriately to adoptive families because the staff and volunteers know each one so well. I love that HELP Humane is also very active in getting the word out about their pets that are up for adoption. They take on off-site adoption events with other groups and they update a blog and a Facebook profile with updates on certain pets and fundraisers. They are doing everything right to get these pets into permanent, loving homes! They also have foster homes, hospice foster homes, adoptable cat housing at Petsmart, and a feline leukemia cottage so that they can help as many pets as possible. I cannot praise HELP Humane enough for their efforts to help homeless pets. The one thing they really need though is more Shelter Buddies to sign up to donate $10/month at www.shelterbuddies.org so that they can keep doing this great work!
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96583	1	/users/profile/112764	Michele123	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2011	A few months ago, one of my children was diagnosed with severe dog allergies. His rashes were so bad they were open and bleeding. He was constantly having respiratory infections. When we found out it was the dog, we had to act quickly. We loved our dog very much. He was a poodle mix. We rescued him from the pound 2 1/2 years earlier, when he was just a pup. He was family. There was no way I would take him back to the pound, and I couldn't find any family to take him.  HELP Humane was the only shelter I contacted that was willing to take him in. I was very upset when I was driving him to the shelter, but after I met the staff and saw the facility I felt such relief. My dog loved cats, and there were cats greeting him at the door. He was so happy. I was also so thrilled that he was not going to be caged all day. The staff was so kind and understanding of my pain in losing him. They really helped me get through that horrible day with their kindness and assurance that he would be well cared for. I tried to follow my precious pup on Facebook and saw that they found him a nice home within just a couple of weeks.  Thanks so much HELP Humane. 
Help of Raymore, Inc.	96568	2	/users/profile/112739	slspiek125	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2011	As an animal lover and someone who gets really sad seing animals in kennels/cages, I have always found myself unable to go to local shelters and unable to volunteer.  I didn't like not being able to reach in and pet them, I was sad that they had such a confined space to live.  One day I found HELP Humane Society through Facebook.  I followed their story for several months.  Then came across post that they were having a kitten shower/open house.  Very skeptical to go, I wanted to help the animals.  I came with donation of food, toys and litter, and braced myself to enter the shelter.  I was so happy once inside.  I saw lots of cats, roaming freely.  Lots of hammocks for them to nap on, lots of beds, lots of toys, lots of scratch pads, lots of chairs and sofas, lots of food, lots of litter boxes,  and lots of volunteers.  I had an instant smile.  I went from room to room finding most of the cats are roaming free in their room, no cat fights, just cats......happy to have food, water, shelter and love.  I grabbed a kitten, sat in a chair and spent an hour loving him.   It enlightened me on what a shelter CAN be.So, after that I became a Shelter Buddy, giving $10 a month.  I wanted to help make sure they remain open.  One day they asked for help with an adoption event.  Once again, I wanted to help so I volunteered.  It was such an enlightening experience.  The volunteers really love the animals and are so proud to be a free roaming no kill shelter.  They take on cases that other shelters won't touch.  They have cats with FeLV, FIV, cats that are blind, cats that require daily medication.  They truly believe in the no kill theory and they will make sure all animals get the medical help they need.  I'm thankful to have found such a wonderful shelter, but so worried they might have to close their doors, leaving hundreds of animals homeless.  We need to all fight to save this special home to these special animals.   
Jacobs House Inc	311838		/users/profile/403194	Glory1978	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	Faithfulness is a theme at Jacobs House. It is one of the chief lessons taught to all who pass through the doors of this ministry to children.  The children are taught to be faithful to God, and to the Jacobs House family; faithful about their schoolwork and their chores; faithful to any commitment they make whether large or small. Faithfulness is held as a principal attribute of strong character.From a distance, I see the primary way faithfulness is taught is through the daily example of Dan and Penny Koontz lives. The word that best describes them is buoyed.  A buoy is an anchored float serving as a navigation mark to show reefs or other hazards.  Buoyed in the hand of God is exactly where Dan and Penny choose to place themselves. When storms come, when temptations come, these founders and leaders of Jacobs House are faithful to stay buoyed to their principals and faith in God that have made their ministry the amazing success it has been over the years. All of the children are taught that they must be faithful to be successful. Reefs and hazards are inevitable as we navigate the waters of life. Reefs and hazards of life can be an alcoholic or drug addicted parent, abandonment by a mother or father that should have always been there, financial lack, physical abuse, disloyalty and betrayal, troubled and at-risk kids, or a myriad of other painful circumstances.But staying true to who we are regardless of massive waves, or a broken oar, or a hole in the bottom of the boat is the faithful lesson taught on a daily basis at Jacobs House. Stay buoyed to Jacobs House. Your reward will be the testimonies of the strong, faithful, happy people that are the product of the loving and faithful leaders, volunteers and supporters of Jacobs House.If not already buoyed, join up and become part of wonderful organization that gets life changing results!
Jacobs House Inc	311222		/users/profile/402565	expectresults	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2016	"A resounding two thumbs up"!That's if you asked me for my opinion.Jacobs house is something special. Dan and Penny work from a shoe string budget to provide for those that come through their doors. Many of these youth are from torn families. Broken kids, struggling with rebellion and abuse,confused about the prospect of a future. The turn around  and change is encouraging and really amazing. I really don't know how owners, Dan and Penny and their Staff do what they do. What I do know-  their are now many strong individuals and families that are glad, that they did what they did. I believe that what is done here is changing lives and whole heartedly recommend Jacobs House with two thumbs up. 
Jacobs House Inc	311060		/users/profile/402397	Chandra C.	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2016	This is an AMAZING organization to give back to!  I happen to have had the privilege to get to know Penny Robichaux through Facebook, her book 'I thought you had a bigger dream' & a relative of mine knows her pretty well through circumstances that were tragic for the 3 kids involved.Jacob's House is very much needed which is a very sad & truly tragic reality, but these kids are super blessed to have her, the other caregivers, this Ranch, etc as a safe haven when life is so hard for them...when so much is against them...when they're no longer able to be apart of their "traditional family".  Truly a remarkable lady & organization!  I cannot say enough about Penny, the Ranch, & all she's doing for these little souls that could end up lost in a system that far too many children end up lost in each & every day.  I wish more children were blessed in the ways the kids that visit Jacob's House are blessed.  If we had more people & organizations like Penny, her caregivers, & her Ranch, I have no doubt that more kids would come out of such loss & tragedy in a much better place...whether their stay be temporary or long term, they're blessed more than they know...beyond measure. There aren't the right words nor enough space for me to describe or explain what this organization means to so many families past, present, & for future generations to come that will someday know the tragedy that resulted in them being in such a loving place. I can tell you from a relatives child who had to spend time there which resulted in the child living with his Dad & his brother & sister ending up together, but adopted by another family that if it weren't for Penny & her Ranch, 2 of these kids would not have known love like they did & do now. That's a long personal story I won't go into, but it says a LOT about the Ranch when kids who have come & gone actually want to come back for a visit!  How often does that ever truly happen???Please think about selecting Jacob's House when you're donating.  :)

They helped our family during terribly difficult times for us, and have remained good friends in the years since.  Penny in particular has been a constant encouragement in our faith and in our daily life.  We can see that they truly love God and live consistent with what the Bible teaches about living a life of integrity.  We recommend Jacobs House to anyone who needs help in crisis and beyond.
Jacobs House Inc	307409		/users/profile/398743	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/30/2016	Donated food can sometimes overwhelm available storage space and exceed the current needs of individual charities.  Recent interaction between Jacob's House and another area charity has enabled them to share their donated foods resulting in a greater variety at each site and maximizing the use of available space to the betterment of all.  Any excess food is then donated to a third local charity serving the homeless.Dan and Penny are dedicated to optimizing the use of all donations to the greatest well-being of the children at Jacob's House and minimizing waste.  They lead by example.

The lives of children they have care for are changed so much.  They take broken pieces and put them back together. Children that come in withdrawn, hopeless,  and alone,  find out life can be fun,  it can be full of hope,  and that family is a beautiful world.  Dan and Penny @ Jacob's House are a national treasure.

Their love knows no boundaries,  their efforts at times seem superhuman. My wife and I are so pleased that God allowed us to partner with them. You just have to see what they do to truly understand. The world could certainly use more people and pl homes like them.Joe Black, Clarksville Arkansas

It is my one and only charity and I do whatever I can to lend a hand and a prayer to the wonderful family there. Jacobs House is a nurturing, faith-filled, Faith- based loving environment, where children do not just simply reside. They are wanted and loved. They are raised as an integral contributing member of the family. Each and every child is given the individual attention that particular child requires. Dan and Penny work seemingly tirelessly to instill good old fashioned values and family unity into each child that is blessed to come to the ranch. What they learn, see and feel will prove invaluable as they go out into the world on their own. My daughter and I sent gifts at Christmas to the darling kids and received handwritten, heartfelt thank you notes from each one that was able to write. Our hearts were so blessed. We both cried. Jacobs House is a cut above thanks to the faithful and committed Dan and Penny. They run the ranch with loving hands and hearts. I wish I could live there!!!!!!!
Jacobs House Inc	289363		/users/profile/379601	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	It is hard to put into words what Jacob's House means to my husband and I. Because of Jacob's House, we are now parents to two amazing kids and our lives are forever changed in an indescribable way. I first made contact with Penny at Jacob's House seven years ago as I was searching for an internship location to satisfy the requirements for my college degree. Little did I know, I would be walking into the rest of my life. My first day at Jacob's House involved me riding with Penny to pick up a timid, runny-nosed little boy from school. Again, little did I know I was picking up my FUTURE SON. That same day I also met a precious little toddler with wild blonde ringlets and the most precious smile. She and I would form a close bond from that day forward (and now she is my daughter). The years went by and my husband and I remained involved with Jacob's House and their ministry. We even decided to get married on the land. Again, our family was already forming and we were none the wiser. The little wild haired blonde was our flower girl that day and her brother was one of the escorts. It's amazing to look back and know that our own children were part of such a special day. Not only were my husband and I promising our love and commitment to one another, we were also unknowingly promising to one day become a family. Years later Children's Division called and asked if we would be a placement for our two precious kiddos. Fifteen months later, we became an official forever family. One of the most rewarding parts of this whole experience was seeing my son transform into a confident, joyful young man. Once the adoption was finalized there was no longer any hesitation or fear in our son. He knew he belonged to our family and he now had a father for the first time in his life.  He was given what he always deserved and dreamed of. I truly believe my children are so well adjusted and resilient because of their frequent stays at Jacob's House. They not only prepared my husband and I to be parents, but they also prepared our son and daughter to be fully loved. I am daily amazed at God's hand in our incredible story. Aside from meeting my children at Jacob's House, my husband and I were also able to invest in many young lives and form relationships that have lasted to this day. We witnessed Penny and Dan pour their all into the dreams and aspirations of the kids. We saw the community step up numerous times to show these children that they are worth it. Jacob's House is truly a unique organization that changes lives. I would know... my life was changed.

The examples they are showing these broken lives that are coming to them are transformed for eternity through unconditional love. I cannot think of a more worthy cause nor one as perfectly aligned with providing life skills to have a perfectly new born life! Thank you for all you do Penny!

We used to sing there when we lived closer- miss seeing everyone now that we're so far away.  Penny is one of the kindest, most caring, loving ladies we have ever met.

Anyone looking to help kids should call and get involved. It takes a village to raise a child.....pitch in, you'll be amazed at how good it makes you feel.
Jacobs House Inc	260575		/users/profile/349151	Regena R.	Donor	5	09/30/2015	My husband and I have been long time supporters of Jacob's House and the work that Penny Robichaux-Koontz and her team have done for years on the behalf of others in need.  We personally visited Jacob's House last summer and were so pleased to find the good work that is being carried out there.  The homes and the grounds were amazing set in a beautiful scenery of hills and trees with horses and cattle grazing on their property.  Personally speaking, Penny is one of the most unselfish, determined, God-trusting, spirited individuals I have ever had the priveledge of knowing and it is an absolute honor of being able to call her my dear and faithful  friend.  She has constantly risen above all that life has thrown her way, and by God's grace remains more than a conquerer.  She is passionate about her work with the children at Jacob's House on Thunder Ranch and they are blessed  to have her.  Penny and her husband Dan are an awesome team in their leadership of this wonderful place called home by children of different ages.  So if you are looking for a nonprofit organization to support, no need to look further; you have found a worthy one.
Jacobs House Inc	260516		/users/profile/349093	Milmom	Donor	5	09/30/2015	I have had the privilege of seeing the success of Jacob's House during visits to the ranch, seeing them at events in the community, and even having the kids in my home and getting to hear their stories first hand.  It's amazing to hear some of the tragedies and consider what a bleak future they would've had if not for Penny and Dan and their good work.  They  also provided respite care a few years ago when we were foster parents and it was great to see how all the kids were so welcoming and eager to help out-a real family!   As a donor we know every dime goes to prosper the future of these kids, it's an amazing organization!
Jacobs House Inc	260152		/users/profile/348724	Julie500	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2015	Jacob's House is a GREAT organization. Penny and Dan REALLY care about the welfare of all the children they come in contact with. They want the children to grow and learn and become excellent. Jacob's House always show appreciation for all the gifts and donations no matter the size or kind. They use every donation very carefully and make the most of it.

Jacobs House Inc	254538	1	/users/profile/342887	Lisa467	Client Served	5	08/31/2015	 Jacob's House saved my son's life!  Before Jacob's House we had tried everything!  Therapists,  hospitals, medication,  your name it we tried it!  It wasn't until he was placed at Jacob's House that we finally starting seeing a difference in our son.  He was very defiant,  had anger issues,  had to be picked up from school more times than i count due to his behavior and he was getting physically  violent.  After almost a year at Jacob's House he is doing well in school,  has a job, is respectful and is working on his anger issues and has come very far!  I was very scared that I would have to visit my son in jail in order to see him but not anymore!  I thank God every single day for Jacob's House and the love and nurturing and guidance they have given my son! 
Jacobs House Inc	251424	1	/users/profile/339371	estherherriott	General Member of the Public	5	08/03/2015	The day I first met Penny Robichaux I knew she was an answer to prayer. I had learned to love the children who lived at the Thunder Ranch (now known as Jacob's House) and had been praying for God to send the perfect person to be a mother to those children.  I could tell immediately Penny had a real love for children and had plenty of experience in caring for needy children. After she was settled in, my husband and I went to visit a number of times and we were so touched by the way the children showed their love to Penny and also that they were very well behaved. She is a gift from God to any children that are privileged to spend time with her. My husband passed away a few years and I don't live in Branson any longer but I have stayed in touch with Penny and her wonderful husband, Dan. I recently went there for a visit andDan and a couple of the children were in the kitchen baking desserts for some function they were going to.  It looked like a bakery. He is an amazing guy and the kids adore him. Penny gave me one of her books, "I Thought You Had a Bigger Dream" which tells about Penny's life and how Jacob's House came into being. Everyone should read it.  It's a "God story" from beginning to end.  This is a great ministry and I cannot say enough positive things about it.  Esther M. Herriott

Kids who are fortunate enough to find Jacob's House get a new direction and hope for their future!
Jacobs House Inc	242131	1	/users/profile/324032	Genesisdawn	Client Served	5	05/05/2015	Penny and Dan have been a wonderful blessing to our family!  I don't know what we would have done without them. We were at the point of having to turn our son over to state custody, since we couldn't afford to get him the help he needed. We had tried so many options with him, including counseling, in home therapy, psychologists & psychiatrists. However his behavioral issues were tearing our family apart. We found out about Jacob's house & called penny, & after hearing our story, she took our boy in right away, no waiting periods or paperwork or requirements, she knew we needed help right then. The patience & knowledge & understanding she has with the kids is amazing! They have blessed our family so much!  We will be forever grateful to them for saving our family!
Jacobs House Inc	210945	2	/users/profile/273763	MsLynn	Donor	5	08/16/2014	Ive known Penny and been involved with Jacobs House as a volunteer and donor since 2002, in Texas. Our family has been enriched by being part of the loving extended family that has always been Jacobs House. Whether painting walls, delivering food, taking children to the zoo or the local park - it was a joy to support Penny in her dedication to give children a loving and permanent "normal" home. It taught my children how lucky they are and how much they have to offer to others. My daughter, who is now a special education teacher, holds Penny up as an example that motivated her in her career choice.  Even though Jacob's House  moved to Missouri, we remain in contact and pick up wherever we left off last! I have over and over witnessed the deep faith, steadfast love and humble trust that are the bedrock of this ministry to children who deserved so much better than life handed them. And I have also been blessed to watch the ways in which these children grow and blossom and generously extend love to others. Jacobs House inspires hope and is instrumental in changing the arc of lives from spiraling downward to reaching upward and outward. I am honored to be a friend and supporter.
Jacobs House Inc	210767	1	/users/profile/273562	Victoria V.	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	My husband and I are personal friends of Penny and Dan Koontz, their children, and the extended family they have of foster kids. We have seen the service and commitment of years and years, to the care of children and young adults in this devoted and tireless couple. They apply christian principles and love to all the kids! We have even ministered there for a season. Their hearts are wide open for those in need, or with a troubled history. I recommend Jacob's House as a place of refuge and restoration to those who have had troubled past, or are presently having difficulties negotiation life and people. Their goal is to help you be the best you can be, reach for your dreams! We love Penny and Dan dearly, and they do not tire in this endeavour of helping young people do well in life , in spite the hand they may have been dealt. They are my heroes, and continue to amaze me and others in their much needed service to the community.
Jacobs House Inc	210742	2	/users/profile/273534	TLWarner	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	As a Registered Nurse who decided to become a full time volunteer and donor for the past year, I have had the PRIVILEGE of getting to know Jacob's House through personal experience.  Many days I've been there as part of the team from daylight to dusk.....overseeing the chores and dishing out the rewards, working through tough times then celebrating their notable accomplishments, encouraging them to DREAM BIG and be the best that they could be, and always ALWAYS talking about our God who made this home possible.  The atmosphere at Jacob's House is that of a normal home environment for the kids who come here, totally opposite of the institutional-style facilities governed by the State.  As a nurse, I've been in those State facilities, and at the end of the day, my heart was always heavy for the kids who were placed there. I saw no improvements; I saw warehousing..... I saw no love; I saw staff going through the motions of putting in their shifts and going home.  What I didn't see, but what I WANTED to see, was compassion and legitimate concern in providing these kids the kind of help they truly needed to succeed in life. That compassion, and legitimate concern is what I found at Jacob's House.  Kids that live there are encouraged to strive for excellence, even when some of them are there for being far from perfect themselves.  But perfect or not, these kids are loved unconditionally; they KNOW it, they FEEL it, and they RESPOND to it. The best example of this that I can personally give is that of a 13 year old boy who was placed there last year when all other State facility options had been exhausted. He failed to get help in every facility he was placed in....this was his last chance at a life of normalcy before his parents gave up on him.  I watched this rebellious, defiant, beautiful kid try to find his way, try to fight through the sedating effects of the multiple psychiatric medications he was prescribed in order to "control" his behavior.  While he provided many challenges during this past year, by the grace of God and the team at Jacob's House, this 14 year old boy has turned into a wonderful young man that any parent would be proud to call their own.  He has learned responsibility, accountability, respect and love for others....without being on any prescribed medications.  It's humbling to think that I was given the opportunity to be a part of helping him find his way.  But he is only one of many kids still out there who need a place like this.  Jacob's House is here today because the founder made a lifelong covenant with God to provide for these kids.  Without the compassion, dedication and unrelenting persistence of Penny and her husband Dan, the Directors at Jacob's House, none of this would have been possible.  Their character is above reproach, their hearts are bound to the Lord.  Jacob's House is privately funded by donors who have the same love and concern for these lost kids as they do. They receive no State or Federal funding, so it's up to all of us to continue providing support so Jacob's House can continue to excel in it's mission.  We are all responsible for children in need.    "And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me"    Mathew 25:40 KJV   
Jacobs House Inc	210576	2	/users/profile/273350	noreent	Board Member	5	08/13/2014	   Jacob's House is a unique private placement home for children.  Unique in a way that whether a child is there for 1 day or 1 year they are part of Jacob's House family forever.  Dan and Penny and all volunteer staff have made a committment to the children who live at the ranch.  That committment is for a lifetime.  Jacob's House is committed to giving love, respect, honesty, christian values and life training to all who enter their home.  Jacob's house is a safe place for children who need hope and a safe place to learn and grow.  Jacob's House teaches them to dream a dream and learn what it takes to see their dreams manifest.   If you are looking for a ministy to support,  and have a heart for children, then this is your place.It will not only change the lives of the children at Jacobs House, it will change your life too!

I spent the day with about 15 kids from Jacob's House.  I have three children of my own, so why would I take a day for someone else's kids??.....because every part of it was wonderful!  A little 2 year old seemed to latch onto me.  She endured my hugs & fixing her hair.  Her big brown eyes, soft and sweet.  She is just one of many children that you meet at Jacob's House.  I don't know her story, she may have been dropped off in the middle of the night, like many of the children there.  Children that have so many stories of why they have been brought to a safe place....Jacob's House.  Jacob's House is a top notch place where horse roam, dogs play, kittens, chickens & a log cabin.  Penny & Dan love them all..... I am honored to be a part of such a great organization! I found out that they are NOT STATE FUNDED, but are funded by loving people who care about the ones who could slip through the cracks....Jacob's House.....Can't wait for the next great day!

Jacobs House Inc	209822	1	/users/profile/272568	ClaudiaStewartFarrell	Volunteer	5	08/09/2014	Is Jacobs House a paradise for children?I am a volunteer at Jacobs House but my role has been unique. Even though, I have on occasion cleaned, cooked and done laundry, my perspective is deeper. While at Jacobs House, I have witnessed the children in all their charm, grace and normal childhood, stubbornness, playfulness and orneriness.   I have seen them dressed for church, and covered in mud from a fun day at the creek. But, I say my perspective is deeper because I have come to know the directors, Penny and Dan Koontz at a heart level by helping Penny write her life story, I Thought You Had A Bigger Dream. I know their dreams, their goals and most importantly their motives. I know their heart cry for each child whose life they touch.  I am very well acquainted with their adopted children, Jacob, Jeremiah and Haley, who I have known for eight years.What stands out to me about this home, Jacobs House, is that it is not just a roof over the kids heads, a warm meal in their tummies and a clean bed. It is so much more. These children, the ones who truly know it as home and the ones who may be at Jacobs house for only a few weeks or a few months are given the opportunity to learn how to live life successfully.How is that accomplished? It is taught minute by minute as they go through their day. It is taught with wisdom and patience. It is taught through perseverance. It is taught through example. The children are taught respect:They are taught to respect each other and their belongings.  They are taught to show respect to all the volunteers who come and go through Jacobs House, performing a myriad of tasks. They are taught to respect their Jacobs House parents who know how to show firm correction when needed, always followed up by gentle affection and encouraging words. It is taught in hopes that the respect they practice at Jacobs House will carry over to their natural parents, teachers, and all future relationships. They are taught good communication skills:Even the smallest voice is heard at Jacobs House. Penny, Dan and the volunteers are very sensitive to the needs and personalities of each child. The children are encouraged to open up, share their feelings, and speak up for any concern they may have. They are taught to ask, not demand. They are taught to communicate with politeness and patience.  Are they perfect in their efforts? No, they are normal kids. But the high standard is set and they are helped along the way each day.They are taught responsibility:Some of the volunteers like to take the kids on nature outings.  If a child hasnt been compliant with the basic rules like doing their chores, they are restricted from the activity in an attempt to teach them the consequences for poor choices.  They are taught there is honor in duty and reward in cooperation and  trustworthiness. They are taught basic social skills and common courtesy:They are taught to share and take turns.  Sometimes, the children come from dysfunctional homes where good examples of common civility are not shown. At Jacobs House, they learn by example, how to get along with their siblings, their friends and their whole, big world which they will soon have to face on their own.     They are taught to be honest: Be honest and you win in the long-run is a rule of the house. Manipulation and lying will only lead to trouble and disappointment.  Oh, that all adults would operate with that understanding. They are taught to recognize and develop their God-given talents:The children are encouraged to step out and try new things that they are interested in. Whether it be playing a musical instrument, cooking, baking, writingnothing is beyond the reach of a child who applies themselves to the task. They are taught to be industrious:While school work and household chores are priority in that order, there is always plenty of time for them to just be kids.  But, being  couch potatoes is highly discouraged.  They are taught to set and pursue goals and are aided in the development of every pursuit when possible.    They have special programs to help nurture their ideas, learning how to make and handle money as well as other basic business principles.They are taught to love:The children are taught to love Jesus. They are taught to love themselves.  They are taught to love each other. They are promised a Forever Family at Jacobs House.  Even when they move away, they know they will always be loved by their Jacobs House family. Over the years, as these kids have matured and ventured out on their own, many have returned to their roots with messages of gratitude for the safe haven offered as well as the firm voice of correction which they eventually heeded. The proof is in the testimonies of those who have lived and loved at Jacobs House. The truth speaks.They are taught life:Jacobs house has farm animals and pets. They have a garden in the summer. They do carpentry projects. There are grounds to keep. Life is full and exciting at Jacobs House. With each new child entering the door for the first time, the kids are taught to reach out to the new kid so they too can feel the love in their Forever Home with their Forever Family.  Come on, Ill show you my pet chickens, Jacob offers. Here, try one of my cookies but be careful. They are still hot, Haley giggles, her pet parrot, Emmy, perched on her shoulder. Jeremiah pauses from his saxophone practice, making it a little easier to hear, and asks, Have you ever ridden a horse? Come on, Jake and I will show you how, he grins, showing his beautiful smile. Is Jacobs House a paradise for children?  Nolife still happens there. The children are not wrapped in a cocoon of perfect bliss. There are often hard choices and tough circumstances to deal with. They sometimes must be told no due to financial constraints or wise judgment. But regardless, they are led in the way they should goin preparation to live a successful life: A life of good relationships. A life of direction and stability. A life which reaches out beyond themselves.  A life which speaks of the love they received at Jacobs House.

I always knew Penny was someone special who does the work of the Lord and always had a special place in her heart for children. Dan is another person who loves Penny and children. together they are a special couple who welcomes everyone they meet to stop by Jacob's House anytime. They open their hearts and home to those in need, with a special emphasis on children that may be troubled, homeless or just in need of some special guidance. They show this through encouragement, LOVE, kindness and respect for yourself and others. I know a few of the children Penny and Dan have helped. I have seen AMAZING things done for these children and others. I was honored to meet the family at a book signing of Penny's. I was incredibly moved by how respectful these children were, how willing to help they were, and just all around Proud to say I got the chance to see the special work Dan & Penny do at Jacob's House.  They make every child or person who is either at the house, volunteers or drops by to visit feel especially welcome and SPECIAL. Jacob has grown into a very special young man! They are to be commended for the time, energy, hard work and all of the love they put into this house.  God has brought Dan & Penny together through his love and they share his work with others.  This is one of the Best Non Profit Organizations I know of. I pray that someday there could be at least one of these Homes in each State to help children around the country. Children need the Guidance, Values, Lessons  and Spiritual Guidance Jacob's House offers. These children will grow up to be very productive adults! Keep up the great work Dan & Penny!

They take them where they are and bring them to the Lord.  They teach responsible, kind behavior so that each child helps the others.  They develop good character that turns the children into good citizens.  Penny and Dan teach the children to believe in themselves, respect themselves and others and not be afraid of the future.  They are proof that God still makes miracles happen through love.
Jacobs House Inc	180766	2	/users/profile/237465	luv4Christ	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2013	As a professional in the field of social work with six years in the realm of foster care I have witnessed first hand the short-comings of the government running programs created to nurture and at times raise children. Many times the hands of caseworkers and foster parents are tied due to the red tape of bureaucracy and many times funding. Some may ask, 'how is Jacob's House different from foster care? Aren't children better off with multiple people working as a Team and with a Judge to determine their permanent placement?'. Regarding the first question, Jacob's House is committed to all children for as short or long of a period as needed. In addition, Jacob's House is able to implement a much more open Christian teaching and guidance than traditional foster homes. In the foster care system sibling groups are split and often not re-united even when adopted they frequently are seperated into different families, a life long trauma as siblings are often the longest lasting bond/relationship a person has in their life. Jacob's House does not split sibling groups. Last but definitely not least if a child is not a good fit for a foster home the foster family can request the child to be moved at any time. I'm not saying this is always a bad call on the family's part, but frequently once the child leaves the foster family moves on to focus on other foster children. Another abandonment, another trauma marking the child's life.With Jacob's House, a child always has the love and support of the program. If their needs are more advanced than what Jacob's House is equipped to handle, the kids along with Penny, Dan, volunteers and staff all continue to offer ongoing support and love through continued contact and welcoming arms if the child/family returns for visits. Regarding the second question: It is often healthy to have a Team to brainstorm and monitor a family's progress, the needs of the child and the process of reunification. However, due to budget constraints, time constraints and manpower constraints this process often takes longer than is healthy or necessary. The foster care system is often bound by statutes or laws in place for the good of those involved; however, can also hinder progress. For example, if a child would do better in a home school environment this is not an option for a foster care child and sometimes these children who struggle in public school systems are placed in residential programs simply because they are required to attend public school and cannot function in such an environment. What does this mean? What is the difference?The difference is with a solid Christian foundation, consistent boundaries, forgiveness and patience being practiced and demonstrated daily without constraints of state or federals, children and families have more room to focus on growing, healing and moving forward versus a legal battle. These same families and children are supplied with a never ending support system through the love of Jacob's House whereas with the foster care system once a case is closed the system moves on to the next case in need unable to offer ongoing support or services. Jacob's House program allows for a stronger degree of flexibility. They believe in building networks and connecting children and families with those who are caring and carefully matching connections and families with areas of interests or specific needs vs. a generalized volunteer program. Children are encouraged and cheered on regarding their individual interests and attempts are made to develop and grow their fullest potential, and presented with opportunities often not available to other teens or children due to the hard work Dan and Penny put in to building community connections.  At Jacob's House, children learn responsibilities and the benefits of hard work through chore charts for household tasks as well as pitching in for ranch work. The pay off for their hard work includes allowance, special outings, and plenty of opportunities to play hard on the property as well. Although Jacob's House is a home for children and teens, guidance and mentoring is also offered to parents as they work and strive to heal and move forward. This is another characteristic unique to Jacob's House. The focus is on the family, not just the children- the whole, not the individual parts. It is this wraparound process that is unique to the Jacob's House program. In summary, Jacob's House offers Permanency. A life long membership to a wide and vast family, regardless if they are there for one day or one year. Some may not realize that even when a child is legally adopted through the foster care system, the child can be 'returned' to the state as a failed adoption and placed back into the foster care system. Jacob's House is 100% committed to the children and families served- ongoing support through respite care, community, prayer- and if a plan were to fall through, the child/ren are able to return to Jacob's House, not placed back into a system for an indefinite amount of time, forgotten, abandoned, and awaiting a new family. The family is found. The family is, and always will be, Jacob's House.

In gym, especially, everyone sees me red and blotchy" confided  scar-faced acne prone 14 year old Jason to Penny on one of his visits to Thunder Ranch. At the Ranch, I personally met Haley, a 13 year old year old girl who had a similar issue, as do many of Penny's teenagers who refer lovingly to heras "Momma."  Appearance is important for a child's self-esteem and  Penny went into immediate  action not only by purchasing the necessary acne  products from me, a Mary Kay Skin care Consultant whom she recently met, but requesting  I write out explicit directions and demonstrate to the teens how to use the products. Once given the instructions and products, it was up to them to follow the routine twice a day to improve their appearance and see how their own actions can have positive or negative  effects now and in other situations.. A good lesson to learn!  A week later, Haley was very happy to notice her black heads were disappearing  and is committed to following a healthy skincare program.  She ran out of product recently  and would like more.  Penny will oblige. Jason, the 14 year old "son" who lives with his alcoholic dad, told Penny  "Hey, Momma, the STUFF is working."  It is not just the "stuff" that is working but the commitment the kids made to focus on a goal and see the positive results of their own efforts. KODOS to Penny and Bob for devoting their lives, loving, listening ears, outstretched arms and wisdom toward making Jacob's House a haven of hope, guidance and respite for neglected, abused and troubled youths and their families .(After visiting the 70 acre ranch and experiencing courteous, chatty and playful youngsters guide me through a maze of bicycles, chickens, gardens, friendly dogs, hair dryers and curling irons in the bath rooms, seeing chore lists hung on the walls and hearing  happy voices after returning from an outing in Branson, I was reminded of my own teenage years living  in NYC and going to a Summer girls camp in Bear Mountain sponsored by the Herald Tribune Fresh Air Fund.  My mom was initially concerned for me being away from home for several weeks to 2 months each summer.. However, i found such peace and harmony being in the woods with plants and bird songs I came to recognize, making new friends and thriving on the creative activities, learning from counselors with unique talents and   taking pride in being given new responsibilities, that I had tears in my eyes each year our camp bus drove us through the Lincoln Tunnel back to the city signaling the end of the serenity, comradrie and exciting, nourishing experiences that have remained a part of me for over 60 years.  Such is the life and memories I envision for the children at Jacob's House.

Jacobs House Inc	177417		/users/profile/233971	JasonR	Client Served	5	10/14/2013	My name is Jason Rodriguez, I was the first to graduate from Jacob's Hose. Much of what Penny taught me then is used in my everyday life. Who would of thought teaching a kid to hang curtains or make his bed would help him understand how to manage an office today.  She always told me never to run from her, but to her because she loved me just like I was her own. It was that kind of love that saw me through the tough times of my teenage years. The van, the clothes, trips, all where building blocks to show me the way. Now that I am married and have 2 beautiful girls, 6 and 4 I know how to build them with some of the same blocks Penny put before me to show me that life is more than broken promises and dead ends, Now I have life and the road seems far from a dead end, now I see the mountains. 
Jacobs House Inc	177158		/users/profile/233679	MarkAW777	Volunteer	5	10/12/2013	    I have been involved with Jacobs House for nearly two years, and have witnessed Penny and Dan pour their hearts into enriching the lives of children.  Whether they are children who reside on the ranch, or are there on a temporary basis, they are treated as family and are raised in a loving family environment. The positive impact made on these little ones is evident almost immediately under the care of this ministry.
Jacobs House Inc	176791		/users/profile/233246	Institutional Donor Advisor	Donor	5	10/11/2013	In 2008, my organization caused an $156,000 approximate contribution to made to Jacobs House. That same year, in the same transaction, we arranged for $599,000 of perfect ranch real estate to be purchased by Jacobs House through approximately $400,000 in financing we were able to put together. The ranch is where Jacobs House operates the private placement facilities. In 2013, my organization caused a $60,100 contribution to be made to Jacobs House. This same year, we arranged approximately $340,000 of re-financing through a local bank in Branson, Missouri. Within an approved budget, Jacobs House is operating with excellence from an administrative perspective. The organization continues its rich heritage from the State of Texas and with its multiple year track-record now also in the State of Missouri, it has operated collectively for well over 20+ years changing the lives of children and parents. We are thankful to be involved in the ways we have. We have no doubt as to the effectiveness of this ministry and the programs it operates.
Jacobs House Inc	176786	1	/users/profile/233240	Harriett F.	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	I have been to Jacob's House and have seen first hand how these precious children's lives are changed, not by psychiatric drugs, or therapy, but by the Hand of a loving God. When they hear Miss Penny pray, and they see results from those prayers, their eyes are opened to hope. All things become possible. They realize they are of great worth instead of castaways, misfits, or unwanted. This is a place where even adults can learn about so many things: educations, music, life skills, and more. They learn to develop a bigger dream. I gladly donate proceeds from the sales of a cookbook to Jacob's House. 
Jacobs House Inc	168834		/users/profile/223807	Jennifer242	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	Lives have been changed as a result of this ministry. I highly recommend the children's home with Penny and Dan at the helm. I first met Penny and Dan through a family member who had been on the same ship as her father over 60 years ago. From the moment I walked onto the land in 2008, I felt as if I was a part of the family. I am continually touched as I see their endeavor to make every person feel loved and at home. I have been honored to be a part of the extended family ever since.  Penny Robichaux Koonz is full of wisdom and gifted in touching the heart of her kids. Every child that walks in is at home. They have immediately have a Mom and Dad as well as a safe place to land.      
Jacobs House Inc	168167		/users/profile/223064	mandagail	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	Where to begin? Jacob's House changed my life, that I know for sure. I was a Junior in college majoring in Psychology and Sociology when it came time to finding an internship site. I began searching the web for organizations that work with children as I have always loved working with them, and came across Jacob's House. It caught my eye in a few ways; it was a Christian organization on more than 70 acres and it was personal. I interviewed with Ms. Penny and went with her to pick up one of the little boys from school; my heart belonged to Jacob's House that day forward. I completed my internship hours but couldn't stay away. In May of 2010 I married the love of my life (and the love of the kids at the ranch) on Jacob's House land. Two years later my husband and I moved to Jacob's House to be more involved; I helped with homeschool and daily activities and my husband helped on the land and kept up with the kids as they endlessly begged him to go on hikes, hunting, play football or soccer in the yard, ride horses, and much more. In May of 2013 I graduated with my Masters in Counseling and found a counseling position in a residential facility in another city. Leaving our kids was one of the hardest things we've had to do, they had become such a huge part of our lives and it felt like we were leaving part of ourselves behind. Though we are miles and miles away, our hearts remain in Branson, MO with "our" kids. We will always be involved with Jacob's House and look forward to what the Lord has in store for them.  
Jacobs House Inc	167889		/users/profile/222519	Jeffdebholden	Client Served	5	09/06/2013	My husband and I first heard about Jacob's House on the radio back in July 2010, where they were talking about a fundraiser for a Christian Based home for children who are generally abused, neglected or displaced.  My husband and myself have always had a heart for children and so felt compelled to call to see how we could help.  Little did we know that God had "a bigger plan" for our meeting Penny and Dan.  Anyways, we started immediately volunteering out at Jacobs House and quickly there after took foster parenting classes for ourselves so that we too could help children.  We have spent many days at Jacobs House, helping out in any way that we could, then one day it came to our attention that our teenage daughter, who was going through hormonal changes and a difficult time of her own, needed support from someone other than ourselves. And that where we find ourselves in the mist of God's Bigger Plan.  God allowed us to be apart of such a loving, uplifting, Christian based home that it was only natural that we would turn to Penny and Dan when we need help with our daughter.  As it turns out, our daughter spent a year at Jacobs House getting the love, understanding, and discipline that we could not give her in a way that would have been received correctly, so for that I am forever grateful to Penny and Dan. I strongly recommend that if anyone desires a honest non-profit place to fund that you contact Penny immediately because she has the heart of God to make sure that your money goes to God's greater purpose, which is stated in James 1:27 (NIV)  Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world. Thank Penny and Dan for your faithfulness! With Love, Jeff and Debbie Holden
Jacobs House Inc	167565		/users/profile/222431	lisagb1	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	I first heard of Jacob's House at a concert in Branson, MO, in which the entertainer described his own experience in foster care, and how this led to a desire to establish a safe and loving Christian home for children.  He "teamed up" with an amazing lady, Penny Robichaux-Koontz, who is the Director of this amazing private placement home for children, and Jacob's House was established.  Having worked in the field, I was seeking a children's ministry to support - one that was run on Christian principles and faith-based...well, I found it!  I read the website, read Penny's autobiography ("I Thought You Had a Bigger Dream") and then had the pleasure of meeting and spending time with Penny, her husband, Dan, and their children at Jacob's House.    Penny is so inspiring in that she doesn't let her own physical struggles (as a result of childhood polio) slow her down or keep her from reaching out in the most loving of ways to the most hurting of people.  Her faith, her love for children, and her example, all shine so brightly!!   The children are raised to be responsible and self-sufficient, with love enough for every one.  The beautiful wooded setting inspires activities in nature and a closeness to the God who created it.   Becoming involved with this children's home has been one of the most blessed experiences of my life, and any child who is in the position of needing such a place to call home would be blessed to be a part of Jacob's House.
Jacobs House Inc	167234		/users/profile/222093	Sierra Applegate	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	My parents are the founders of 1:27 Missions Project. They had volunteered once at Jacob's House before and had spoken of the strong presence of God there, and of the wise and loving, Penny Robichaux. I have been a Christian since I was a young child, and my parents have always been my spiritual advisors, and they are the ones who have pushed me to new spiritual heights. I knew, that if my parents spoke so highly of a godly woman, I must meet her. I went with 1:27 for a Halloween outreach. As soon as I crossed onto the property, I could feel God's presence. I met Ms. Penny, and could see, just as my parents saw, God pouring into, and out of her. The kids, were filled with such a respect, and such a love for her, and for Dan. They couldn't be better parent figures for these kids. 
Jacobs House Inc	167223		/users/profile/222084	You are not Invisible	Volunteer	4	09/05/2013	My name is John Tumino founder and President of In My Fathers Kitchen. We are a Faith Based Nonprofit that helps the homeless and Refugee Community in Syracuse NY. In the early part of 2012 we made a wonderful connection with Jacobs house and Miss Penny and were invited to come down to the Ranch to meet Miss Penny and Love on the children. We arrived at the Ranch and immediately feel in love with the children and the facility. We had the wonderful opportunity to bring down with us one of our Trustees and his wife, they also we struck with the LOVE bug at Jacob's house. Well the plan for the week end was to minister to the children get to know Miss Penny and Brother Dan, Miss Penny had other ideas. Penny arranged for IMFK to do a food presentation tied to a Gospel message and the Children from Jacob's house would feed the poor of that community. The children were so excited to help the less fortunate of the area. While we sat back and observed the children in action is when it dawned on us that they had all forgot about there own personal struggles.  The wonderful thing about Jacob's house is that it brings into the Child's life a sense of purpose and Destiny. When you commit your plans to the Lord your thoughts will be established! We understood now by seeing first hand that Jacob's house mission is to bring value back into a Childs heart. The fact that the majority of the children enter with no sense of self worth but by rallying together in Christ and with vision put in their heart nothing is impossible. Well needless to say that while we were there for a week end our hearts were in turned changed as well. As Miss Penny Says the Land at Jacob's House is teaming with LIFE! The life of Christ!  We would like to say that Jacob's House is a place were the presence of God descends and that true transformation happens to ALL who step on the Land. We would encourage anyone to lock arms with the vision of Jacob's and in turn you will Taste and see that the Lord is Good!  Sincerely,John Tumino
Jacobs House Inc	149305		/users/profile/198953	Julie101	Volunteer	5	02/13/2013	 My advice would be to go visit and see how quickly you fall in love with the kids. They are in a Christian environment where they are humble, polite children who work and play in a loving home. Their needs are huge and they ask for nothing.  Make a call and see how you can help make a change in your life by helping a home where the caregivers sacrifice and gave their lives to helping kids. 
Jacobs House Inc	132197	1	/users/profile/177812	krystadavis272	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	A friend of mine placed her two children there as an alternative to DFS stepping in and taking them when lifes complications arose. Siblings are able to stay together in a Christian Family environment. They have been blessed with amazing educational opportunities and a healthy family lifestyle. Receiving help in so many aspects that are just not available to the run-of-the-mill DFS foster families. I am a single mother still coming out of an abusive homeless lifestyle with no car and no job, and no family to care for my three year old should an emergency arrise. After personally speaking with the housemother, Penny on several occasions, I can not explain the blessing of relief knowing that Jacobs House is available to me and my son. Some days I cling to that thought alone when I wonder what I'm going to do or what's going to happen to my child. It's very scary. I thank the Lord and pray for Jacob's House quite often as just knowing about it has been a light in this sometimes dark world. I see the benefits and the light in the Jacob's House kids eyes, and am thankful! Krysta Davis

Shepherds Centers of America	309855		/users/profile/401207	LindaMB45	Board Member	5	10/11/2016	As a university professor in Sociology & Gerontology at our local university (University of Missouri-Kansas City), I have had many opportunities to interact with several of our local Shepherd Centers over the last 40 years--setting up service learning opportunities and  internships for my students, engaging Shepherd Center leaders and participants in my classes, and serving both on one of the local boards and most recently on the national board.  I have always considered the Shepherd Centers a prime model from which students can learn about the potential for growth that can come in life's later stages through volunteerism, engagement, and relationships of both giving and receiving aid and care. My whole career has been about countering the myth that aging is inevitably about decline, and the Shepherd Centers have provided me with a multitude of examples in this effort.

I was particularly impressed with both the quality and selection of topics offered, and found it a great opportunity for me to meet other seniors with similar interests.  I also have participated in some of the trips organized through the Travel Program,  and have thoroughly enjoyed each experience.  Realizing the many opportunities to serve trough the Shepherds Center, I decided to volunteer my time and energy.  Currently, I am a driver for the Medical Transportation program and also volunteer one to two days a week in the office.  I have really enjoyed getting to know the office staff and find it very satisfying to know that the volunteer work I am doing is so helpful to others.  Diane Larsen-Charlotte, NC

Commercial transportation is too expensive for most seniors and providing free rides to medical and therapy appointments, the pharmacy and grocery has been a life saver for hundreds of seniors.  In 2013, the Center provided 896 rides to medical appointments.  That number rose to 1,507 in 2014 and 2015 figures shows that number will increase to anywhere between 2,100 - 2,200.  Those numbers will only increase in the years ahead making efforts to recruit more volunteers vital.   The Center also has a handy helpers program to do minor chores in and around seniors' homes plus a friendly caller and visitor program to let seniors know they have not been forgotten.

Not only do the various centers across the U.S. do a wonderful job of keeping seniors active and engaged, but they also seek creative ways to assist them when they need help. SCA does a fine job as the umbrella organization that disseminates information and encourages the various centers so they can become the best they can be at their mission.

It is a prime example of how different people can join together to serve the community in a very special way. Recently I was asked how do you get congregations and people of different backgrounds and ages to work together? I believe it is a passion for the mission and we often speak of Shepherd's Center miracles. If you want to add meaning to your life, start a Shepherd's Center!

Shepherds Centers of America	252194		/users/profile/340251	kbockscaletty	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/08/2015	     I have been privileged to be associated with various Shepherd's Centers and Shepherd's Centers of America for over 36 years. As a professor of nursing, I have always used this wonderful model of positive aging to help students shed their misconceptions and negative attitudes towards older people. In their clinical experiences and with stories and visits from Shepherd's Center leaders, they see first hand the tremendous resource we have in elders. Whether helping retired nurses give flu shots, attending Alzheimer's Support Groups, delivering Meals on Wheels, or doing yoga stretches with limber 90 year-olds, relationships develop that transform their thinking. It is impossible for them to see elders actively engaged in life-long learning, meaningful volunteer roles, and caring for one another without having higher expectations for their older patients in the hospital. Their expectations are raised, and they even become more positive about their own aging process!      The work and mission of Shepherd's Centers of America is important, as it promotes the development and success of Centers across the country. I heartily endorse it as one of the top national leaders in the field of Aging.
Shepherds Centers of America	251401	2	/users/profile/339345	JBailey	Board Member	5	08/03/2015	As former Executive Director of the only west coast Shepherd Center and a current National Board Member for Shepherd's Centers of America (SCA), I have seen and helped to facilitate the work being done in support of quality of life issues for America's seniors. SCA's National Executive Director, Sarah Cheney works tirelessly in her efforts to build and support our nationwide network of senior centers. SCA senior centers provide a variety of senior services depending on the needs of the community it serves including meals, transportation, life enrichment, referral services  and social engagement. Most services are not paid for by the senior as programs are fully funded through individual and corporate donors. Volunteers have always been and continue to be the life line of many Shepherd Centers.
Shepherds Centers of America	251350	2	/users/profile/339290	BHM77	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	As a volunteer of 15 years I have always found my work fulfilling. I am a driver and I do other volunteer jobs. The volunteering is always a fulfilling experience. Helping other seniors through the Shepherd's Center has given me great satisfaction. As a participant in programs offered at our Shepherd's Center, I have always learned from and enjoyed the experience. I am currently on the board and serve in many other capacities. No matter what my health status is, there will always be a place for me at Shepherd's Center. Every community needs a Shepherd's Center!

They have earned the respect and trust of people all around the country from different walks of life. This model of older people learning, growing, giving and serving the community is inspiring!
Shepherds Centers of America	231820	1	/users/profile/295384	stloujj	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Shepherd's Center is my "Happy Place" and I have been volunteering for 15 years. I first met Dr. Cole in 1998 at a luncheon and I just remember thinking that's really cool! Young seniors helping older seniors. When our ministries were expanded, I volunteered to work at our Resource Desk and I've been there ever since. Shepherd's Center gives me a purpose and contributes to the good of the community.

Shepherds Centers of America	230625	2	/users/profile/294254	Bill94	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I've been involved with SCA for over 20 years--beginning before I was a senior myself.  My early involvement was largely due to the respect I held for the leaders, including Dr. Cole, who had a vision about a new way of thinking about aging.   Since then I have never ceased to marvel at the amount of volunteer energy that SCA brings to bear on helping older citizens live fuller, more successful lives.  And I'm further impressed that in spite of being an organization for elders the organization continues to re-invent itself year after year to stay in touch with newly emerging issues and concepts.Bill Eddy
Shepherds Centers of America	229716	2	/users/profile/293365	JJCarolina	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	When I retired and relocated to South Carolina I found a newly formed senior group - The Shepherd's Center of the Pee Dee.  It was also new to the community and once I found it - I reorganized my week to make sure nothing conflicted with Shepherd's Center Day.  I have met so many wonderful friends who have also recently retired and relocated and now I am part of a very large "family".  There are so many things to become involved in and the group continues to grow.  I appreciate that it is available and does so many worthwhile activities and helps so many in our community.  Our speakers add so much to our knowledge of the area, the programs we help, the fun and friendships we have grown.  Thanks SCA for all you do for me and my South Carolina family! JJ
Shepherds Centers of America	228840	2	/users/profile/239303	wmekmf04	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	When I retired, I wanted give something back to the community by volunteering for some good cause.  The Shepherd Center provided me with a wonderful opportunity to drive older adults, who could no longer drive themselves, to doctors appointments.  It served the seniors who needed the rides and it provided me with the wonderful feeling and satisfaction that goes along with helping someone in need.  I am sold on the idea that the Shepherd Center is a great way to give back to your community through volunteerism and I encourage others to do the same.  The need to help seniors is there and growing.  And you will be greatly rewarded for the few hours of your time you dedicate to providing a service.  Let's start more Shepherd Centers so more volunteers can help our seniors across the country!
Shepherds Centers of America	182485	1	/users/profile/239303	wmekmf04	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	I retired early and was looking for a way to do some volunteer work.  The Shepherd's Center gave me the perfect opportunity to give back at my own pace.  I became a medical driver for those who could not drive themselves to their doctor appointments.  The riders were so thankful, I felt good about it and the organization grew.  A win-win-win.  I am a real fan of the Shepherd's Centers - they make meaningful volunteer opportunities available and make such a positive contribution to our older neighbors.
Shepherds Centers of America	228703	2	/users/profile/292381	RustyRyan	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I have been involved with SCA for the past 40 years.  I have gained greater knowledge of older adults and their concerns by facilitating an Adventures in Learning program on medicine update at Shepherd's Center Central in Kansas City, MO.  Participants learn rational, safe, effective and economical use of their medications in an atmosphere that is interactive and friendly with discussion and answers.  I am proud of the ways SCA promotes successful aging in communities around America.
Shepherds Centers of America	228445	1	/users/profile/292134	MikeWardSC	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I learned about the Shepherd's Center of Lexington, SC in October 2012. I was invited to attend a class and observe how the Adventures in Learning program operated. During my visit I was asked to stand and talk to the class about my knowledge with technology. That quickly moved from a short discussion to two years of me instructing classes at the Center. Almost one year after diving into volunteering my time as an instructor, I was asked to become a Board member. I really enjoy serving on the board and helping the Center grow. I was honestly surprised at how helpful the staff at Shepherds Centers of America is. No matter what we need, Teresa or Sarah are there to help. The Shepherds Centers of America office provides a ton of helpful information to support the Centers located throughout the entire USA. Without their direction, our entire organization would not be nearly as strong as it is today.
Shepherds Centers of America	226220		/users/profile/289959	gerner	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I have been a part of Shepherd's Centers over 30 years, served on the National Board for about 10 years,  and was co-founder of Mid-North Shepherd's Center, Indianapolis, IN, which continues strong to this date.  Shepherd's Centers are designed to touch the heart, mind and spirit of older adults.  The volunteers are enthusiastic as they direct the programming and activities, from continuing education through their Adventures in Learning, to service through volunteers drivers to doctors, etc.,  to community outreach, through trips which a senior would not take alone.  Socialization is a strong aspect as they make new friends.  Over my professional life on church staffs where part of my portfolio was senior adult ministries I never found a program which could measure up to Shepherd's Centers.  I could relate stories of persons who gave up on life, and then discovered Shepherd's Center, which gave their life meaning again, and they could not only grow themselves but contribute to the wider community.  As is obvious, I love Shepherd's Centers and could go on and on saying why.
Shepherds Centers of America	226064		/users/profile/289812	greenbriershepherdscenter	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	I have been involved with Shepherd's Center for almost a year now and am constantly seeing the benefits of having a local center in our county.  We touch the lives of many in our community with transportation, meals, friendly visits, learning opportunities, etc.  It is so rewarding to see this connection and how it impacts our seniors as well as the volunteers.  I only hope that SCA continues to grow and be all across the United States.  
Shepherds Centers of America	225035		/users/profile/288808	adc66	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2014	Elderly adults are an underserved population, so finding an organization that cares so much and serves this community of adults so well is a blessing and a relief. They have been an excellent resource to our family, and the staff members are knowledgeable and compassionate. 
Shepherds Centers of America	224923		/users/profile/288692	Ann948m2	Board Member	5	10/21/2014	I started with Shepherds Center as a volunteer driver and now serve on the Board of Directors of our local chapter.  Interacting with other volunteers, as wdll as the people we drive,has been an uplifting experience.  It is personally satisfying to serve others through Shepherds Center and has helped me to grow as a person and volunteer.
Shepherds Centers of America	222621		/users/profile/286356	Pegi	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	Eight years ago I came to work for the Shepherd's Center of Webster-Kirkwood and my life changed!  Why?? The volunteers are so spectacular.  Our volunteers answer phone calls from people in need of a ride to a medical appointment ...and maybe to hear a friendly voice.  When the rider is picked up by her/his volunteer driver, they are so happy each time they request one of the people they've had as a driver because they feel like they've formed a real friendship.  Our volunteer drivers say they started driving to do something good to help someone else and after their first rider, they all say they got more out of the ride than the person they drove because they enjoyed it so much.  There is nothing as great as being a part of something wonderful...all because of Dr. Cole's vision.  The Shepherd's Center of America is a non-profit to believe in and stand behind with Shepherds Centers all over the United States..  If you want to give back, become a volunteer with a Shepherds Center.
Shepherds Centers of America	222542		/users/profile/286251	rserlwe	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	I began as a volunteer driver for our Shepherd Center locally and am caught up in the passion and enthusiasm of the many folks I have come in contact with. What we do is helping folks stay independent as long as possible and that is a good thing not only for the individual but also for the community. I am now a Board member hoping to make a larger impact.
Shepherds Centers of America	222296		/users/profile/285999	RightatHomeTriad	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	The Shepherds Center is a great organization and provides a vital service to families all over America!  It is my pleasure to be affiliated with this wonderful organization.
Shepherds Centers of America	222252		/users/profile/238239	Gayle McHenry MSW LCSW	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2014	Over 40 years ago, Dr. Cole was "Leading the Way." He knew there would be a huge "baby boom" and his idea of congregations coming together to serve the community of seniors would be a wonderful way to keep older adults active, engaged and independent. He was a visionary who know that continuing to lead a life of meaning was critical to longevity and contentment. Shepherd's Center of America continues to be an outstanding national organization that is an example of volunteer service!
Shepherds Centers of America	181514		/users/profile/238239	Gayle McHenry MSW LCSW	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	The combination of Interfaith, Volunteer and Senior to Senior is a winner! All those involved in our center see the Shepherd's Center as a place that is warm and welcoming! Whether they are a volunteer, someone we serve or a participant in our programs, we demonstrate that  Shepherd's Center miracles happen every day. Our slogan of "nice is what we do" and "we are inclusive not exclusive" bring the spirit of our group together. Through a small budget and a big volunteer base we are able to have a large impact in the lives of so many seniors in our community! I have been involved for 13 years and had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Cole, I feel blessed, lucky and fortunate to be a part of such an incredible mission!
Shepherds Centers of America	185377		/users/profile/242339	smalljlong	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	Shepherd's Center of America, the headquarters and the network has helped Shepherd's  Center  of Greenbrier Valley to succeed from day one. The model, inspiration, guidance, and mentoring provided by SCA were and still are the foundation of SCGV. It has been beneficial to be part of something nation wide. It lends credibility locally when we work with other service agenciesAnd when we approach donors and congregations. SCA staff help us keep up to date looking at the "Big Picture" of aging in America through web resources, networking, and educational opportunities. I had the privilege of attending SCA leadership training. It was transformational in my work as the Executive Director of SCGV. I came away with a larger view, new skills and most of all a new enthusiasm. Over the years SCA programs and meetings have given great information, useful tools and periodic recharges! We need experts in the field of aging, as the leadership of SCA are to keep the SCA network centers vibrant, growing and renewing.
Shepherds Centers of America	185240		/users/profile/242195	Ron Richardson	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	While a student at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, GA, I was enrolled in a class called Older Adult Ministry.  One of my assignments was to write a paper on an older adult ministry I might be interested in beginning in my home town of Tupelo, MS.  I did some research and came upon the name Shepherd's Center.  I discovered Shepherd's Centers of America and inquired about shepherd's centers.  I was mailed information about shepherd's centers in my area and other general information about Shepherd's Center of America.  After graduating from seminary with a Doctor of Ministry I came back to Tupelo with the goal of beginning a Shepherd's Center.  I contacted Elbert Cole and he agreed to come to Tupelo and help me get started.  I gathered an audience and he presented his materials.  Their was no interest.  I invited Dr. Cole back a year later.  He came and presented again to an audience I had invited.  I was watching the audience to see if I could detect any interest.  I spotted a retired educatiion superintendent who had a sparkle in his eyes that said to me, "This will work."  I went to him after the meeting and asked him what he thought.  His response was, "Let's do it."  Twenty-five years later, we are going strong thanks to Elbert Cole and Shepherd's Center of America.  
Shepherds Centers of America	185203		/users/profile/242161	kirbywp	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	When she was in her 70's, my Mother lost her sight and had to enter a nursing home. I tried in vain to find someone in our small town who could visit her on a regular basis and just have friendly conversation about the day's news. Nor were governmental agencies of any help. If there had been a Shepherd's Center with a friendly visitor program in our town, Mother would not have felt so isolated. Today, with the support of Shepherd's Centers of America, two-thirds of the nearly sixty Centers nation-wide provide either friendly visitors or friendly callers -- or both -- to serve senior citizens in their communities.
Shepherds Centers of America	182406		/users/profile/239222	JDavis0128	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2013	My wife and I were searching for resources for our aging parents.  We were able to connect with the national Shepherds Centers of America office in Kansas City, MO.  At that time, we were fortunate enough to meet the founder Elbert Cole, who had a deep sense of compassion for helping older adults age in place with dignity.  My wife and I are continually grateful for all that Shepherds Centers of America does to support a national network of centers that provide programs and services for families and communities across the country.   
Shepherds Centers of America	182125		/users/profile/238890	TigerBill	Board Member	5	10/24/2013	In January, 1999, my congregation sent me to Kansas city for a four day leadership training session led by Dr. Elbert Cole, founder of the Shepherd's Center of America.  I can say it was a life changing experience.  Dr. Cole, a retired Methodist minister,was the most dynamic man I ever met.  During my training he was 82, but more energetic than many men half his age.  I have often said the training sessions was as good in the last hour on Friday as the first hour on Tuesday.  This from someone who has attended many seminars and training sessions in both academia and the business world, I assure you is high praise. Our Shepherd's Center of Webster/Kirkwood celebrated it 15th year last month.  SCA provides vital support to us and the other Shepherd's Centers throughout the country Dr. Cole's goals for the Shepherd's Centers were LIFE ENRICHMENT (learning), LIFE MAINTENANCE (independence), LIFE REORGANIZATION (health & exercise) and CELEBRATION (acknowledge events with meaning & purpose). As a nation we have always celebrated youth.  The vast majority of today's seniors (85%) are in relatively good health and vigorous.  Society has tended to ignore this population, focusing on the senile and decrepit.  The work of SCA is vitally important.  Aging is an opportunity, not a problem.  The mission of SCA is to change America's view on aging - to recognize the value of an aging population.  The genius of the program is that it is a ministry being done by older adult volunteers rather than a ministry to them. Bill GermanBoard Member, Shepherd's Center of Webster/Kirkwood America needs more Shepherd's Center and SCA can help this to happen.
Shepherds Centers of America	181939		/users/profile/238693	ajacobson	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	It is exciting to see how Shepherd Centers of America has grown.  I was in on the beginnings and helped Rev. Cole in the training of new Center Directors. My expertise was in Volunteer Management. Today  SCA and its many member centers are excellent examples of Dr. Cole's dream for Seniors to have meaningful opportunities for volunteering and life-long learning through our many Shepherd's Centers. Past National SCA President 10-23-2013   
Shepherds Centers of America	181679		/users/profile/238409	mikewood100	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	In the future, aging "successfully" will include those of us who remain vital, engaged citizens in our senior years.  For Shepherd's Centers of America, the future is now--and has been for 40 years plus--as it encourages its local Centers to promote and enable volunteering among its older adult members.  The result is a large and growing community of aging individuals who contribute (and receive) great benefit from continuing to give of themselves.
Shepherds Centers of America	181483		/users/profile/238209	Kay W.	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	Shepherd's Centers of America was a forerunner in the field of meaningful aging. Beginning with one center in a small neighborhood in Kansas City...the vision of a Methodist minister and older adults in the community soon evolved into a national presence.  This community was dedicated to involving older adults in volunteerism while helping others in their neighborhoods remain in their homes.  It was a simple concept that the rest of the world now sees as essential to the cycle of everyone's lives.  "Living a life that matters" is the mantra of all of the 60 Shepherd's Centers in the United States as well as many other organizations that now recognize that older adults with their wealth of experiences and wisdom are an invaluable resource to communities everywhere.    One of the main focuses of Shepherd's Centers of America is sharing what these 60 communities have learned  and help to start other centers so that older adults may continue to live meaningful lives through education and volunteerism.
Shepherds Centers of America	181429		/users/profile/235194	smatthews2	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	SCA was a pioneer in the field of aging over 35 years ago. The vision to capture the experience, wisdom and volunteer capacity of  older adults was 20 years ahead of its time. Now, 58 active centers are in the network. Survey data from across the network shows a projected impact which includes:   42,000 older adults are being helped through informal caregiving services including transportation, home repairs, visitation, etc.  Over 36,800 older adults participate in Adventures in Learning - an excellent life-long learning program Over 8,500 active volunteers donated in excess of 375,000 hours of service in their communities Estimated value of services exceeds $8,300,000, based on the Independent Sectors value for volunteer time

From the Head Financial Director, Ms Ida , to the loan processing Chonda, to the closer Ms. Sandra! I love this financial foundation because its not yes all the time. But Ms. Ida provides you with balance, accurate, financial wisdom to help build your hopes and dreams.  I am now  a re warder of a 3rd loan with them helping me with my non profit child development center.  Their Future's Bright Center was birthed by me, but JP has created the environment for growth.  We help special needs families, middle class, and low income families with daycare expenses.

Justine Petersen	278311		/users/profile/368238	Writer	Client Served	5	01/29/2016	I came to Justine Petersen under the advisement of my business banker.  Initially I was reluctant because I was unfamiliar with the organization.  I was completely wowed with the amazing service we received.  The staff was extremely pleasant and professional.  This nonprofit truly has a passion to help their clients and has the customer's best interest at heart.  Our Loan Officer Shawna Collier was phenomenal.  She was committed to helping us achieve our goals for the company.  Because of her ambition we were approved for a loan that will stimulate and reshape our business.  Shawna is a force to be reckoned with and major asset to Justine Petersen.Kudos Shawna!!  Thank you for being such a tremendous blessing to us.

Justine Petersen is at the forefront of that work all over St. Louis and the greater MidWest region.

My loan is at a good interest rate and my neighborhood is great.  I have been in my house awhile now and I recommend this organization to everyone I run into so they can get a great house, too.  I am still a lower income person, but I have learned how to afford the repairs through the workshops they offer and I feel confident as a homeowner.

Faith Aloud	187577		/users/profile/244600	John218	Board Member	5	11/02/2013	I have worked on the Board of FA for almost ten years. Their commitment to the cause of reproductive choice is admirable. The organization is fiercely dedicated to maintaing the political infrastructure necessary to protect a woman's right to choose. These religious leaders are passionate, articulate, and courageous. They have a network of support for women who struggle with their choices, who seek counseling in times of stress and crisis. Their presence is highly valued by women who are accompanied into clinics while being threatened by anti-choice bullies, when testifying before congressional hearings and committees, or when speaking in public or to the media about a woman's right to choose. I am a proud member of this fine organization.
Faith Aloud	186420		/users/profile/51224	adele1	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	I have worked with Faith Aloud's Executive Director for nearly a decade and I believe strongly in Faith Aloud's fills a valuable role in society-- Faith Aloud has given voice to women's religious dignity at a time when much of the morality conversation is about shaming women.  There is no question that this organization's lean operating model allows the most good to be done for women and families. In fact, the Faith Aloud team mobilizes volunteers effectively to serve women all over the United States and even internationally. The creative use of technology allows a Board of members from all over the country-- I am in South Florida-- to work together to support our shared beliefs and common mission.  Women need Faith Aloud. There is no question in my mind.
Faith Aloud	96352		/users/profile/51224	adele1	Board Member	5	08/23/2011	In the past year or so, Faith Aloud has grown exponentially and has increased its impact so that it serves women nationally.  This isn't a "national organization" in name only-- in the past year, Faith Aloud truly has supported women in nearly every state (and even other countries!), reached out to clergy in a spectrum of denominations,  and supports clinic staff who will, in turn, serve thousands of women. Even though I moved geographically far from the Faith Aloud headquarters, I am informed, involved and my passion for Faith Aloud's mission has not waned.  One of the many things Faith Aloud manages well is communications on a tech-savvy and personal level.   In every way, Faith Aloud is a professional, outstanding nonprofit organization and the leader in its field.
Faith Aloud	50690	5	/users/profile/51224	adele1	Volunteer	5	08/19/2010	The Board of Directors and staff of Faith Aloud (previously, of MORCRC) are pioneers with sense; they respond creatively to the needs articulated by women and clinics and provide a public service in a way no other nonprofit has.  Executive Director Reverend Rebecca Turner is a trustworthy, resourceful and innovative leader and her enthusiasm and compassion are mirrored by the volunteers, staff and Board of Directors.  These are the experts, the leaders in the reproductive justice field.  There is nothing quite like Faith Aloud, and certainly nothing so expertly run.
Faith Aloud	184576		/users/profile/241515	EmilyT.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	As a prior abortion clinic counselor I always felt confident when referring women to Faith Aloud for further support. They stand by their love for women and create a safe, nonjudgmental space for them to share their stories and grow. 
Faith Aloud	125705		/users/profile/51089	zahava85	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	While Faith Aloud's stated mission is to eliminate the religious stigma of abortion--the work and reach of the organization is so much greater. As an inter-faith voice that validates all reproductive choices, Faith Aloud embodies all that is great about the reproductive justice movement. It seeks intersections, makes connections and tirelessly promotes the idea that it is possible to trust women and trust families.  Despite a challenging economic climate, Faith Aloud is doing great work, and I'm proud to be involved. 
Faith Aloud	50573	1	/users/profile/51089	zahava85	Board Member	5	08/17/2010	I have been a supporter of Faith Aloud for several years--first as an intern, later as a staff member, and now as a board member. Over the years I have seen the organization grow in strength and support while holding true to its core values. Over the years I have had the opportunity to work and support a variety of other non-profit organizations, and can say without a doubt that Faith Aloud is among the 'best of the best.'
Faith Aloud	113238		/users/profile/154101	creppsj	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/30/2012	Faith Aloud is doing groundbreaking work on the issue of abortion by providing excellent spiritual counseling materials for women and by combatting violence and harrassment with mesages of peace.  FA shows that people of faith get abortions and that people of faith suport reproductive rights.  
Faith Aloud	113203		/users/profile/154055	kelli.b.whitman	Volunteer	5	05/29/2012	I have been a volunteer counselor for Faith Aloud for several years.  I speak to women who need to be reassured that God is still with them, even as they wrestle with making a decision about abortion, or as they continue to process that decision.  Most of the women I have spoken to end our conversation by thanking me for listening and praying with them.  A woman I spoke with just last week said, "Thanks for reminding me that God hasn't abandoned me.  I guess I always knew that, but I really needed to be reminded right now."  I am grateful that Faith Aloud and their volunteer counselors are available to women like this who need to be reminded that God loves them. 
Faith Aloud	113200		/users/profile/154050	Lynn25	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2012	Faith Aloud is an innovative, cutting edge reproductive justice organization that recognizes the important role of religion and prayer for women in  their reproductive lives. Its strengths include a willingness to listen to women's actual experiences and to then represent those experiences in their education and advocacy work. Faith Aloud tackles hard, intersectional issues and gives voice to people dedicated to compassion, respect, and support for women and families. It is vital that organizations devoted to ensuring women's rights and dignity exist not only in the Northeast and West coast but also throughout the nation. Faith Aloud does national work but, very importantly, does it from Missouri and informed by the grassroots. They are an exceptional group and deserve support for their excellent work.
Faith Aloud	113199		/users/profile/154049	Pat_9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2012	Faith Aloud is so valuable in providing compassionate and caring info to women and girls making reproductive decisions.  One of the few positives in this world full of negatives.  For all the positive messages and daily inspiration, thank you Faith Aloud and Rev. Rebecca Turner!  We've needed this kind of compassion and caring for women for a very long time.
Faith Aloud	113190		/users/profile/154034	Brian32	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2012	As I one time board member who has worked with Rev. Rebecca Turner, and more recently as a person who turns to Faith Aloud as a resource and occasional serves as a phone counselor, I have the utmost admiration for her ministry/service and this fine organization.  Faith Aloud offers a progressive, inclusive and relevant religious voice to the issues of women's sexual and reproductive health, women's freedom to choose if and when to have children and raise a family, and a variety of related rights issues from choice to lgbt concerns.  Consistent, supportive and encouraging at every turn, Faith Aloud and Rev. Turner are voices of conviction in a time of great need.  They support women in the midst of perhaps the worst days of their lives, and lobby to protect the freedoms and choices that women count on but perhaps don't think about until it's too late and that need has been pressed upon them.  The speak a voice for interfaith inclusion, for women in leadership roles, and they honor all people, insisting on fair and equal treatment for all.
Faith Aloud	111391		/users/profile/151671	strawberry.nymph	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2012	Thank you so, so much for having this here. I was once in the horrifying position of being a Christian teen faced with the chance of an unwanted pregnancy. I felt so terrified, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know who to turn to, and I certainly didn't feel as though I could pray about it. Eventually the pregnancy terminated itself, but even then I stayed silent. My family, pastor, and friends never learned my secret.// I never want another woman to have to go through that choking fear and feel as though she has no where to go, and you people at Faith Aloud are helping that more then you know. You should be a staple in every clinic. What you do is wonderful, and something that I believe warms Jesus Christ's heart. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I wish nothing but love and wellness for this group.

The dedication they show to women around the world is reflective of the passion they have for reproductive justice and the empowerment of women.  Faith Aloud works tirelessly in the community, developing ethical and compassionate leaders of tomorrow. 
Faith Aloud	100643		/users/profile/123727	heatherault	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2011	Faith Aloud is a dynamic organization responding to the spiritual needs of women, clinics, activists, and the pro-choice at large with a message sorely missing, that the experience of an unwanted pregnancy is a deeply spiritual journey that can include peace and acceptance through religious counseling. There is nobody more qualified than Rev. Rebecca Turner for organizing and delivering this message.
Faith Aloud	100547		/users/profile/123068	Chrisgoff	Volunteer	5	11/11/2011	Faith Aloud is a wonderful organization that is helping all people to better understand the rights that should be given to all women. Faith Aloud is working to take the socail stigma away off of women that have had abortions. Faith Aloud is working to help women to learn that making a decision for their lives makes them strong not sinful. 
Faith Aloud	100510		/users/profile/122858	Seileach C.	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2011	Faith Aloud's work for reproductive freedom is very important to me and to the community they serve. By showing that people of faith support women's right to make their own decisions about their health and sexuality, not despite their faith values, but as an integral part of those faith values, Faith Aloud provides a much-needed counterpoint to those who continually and loudly proclaim that women are incapable of moral judgement and their health decisions must be made for them by unsympathetic lawmakers and clergy.
Faith Aloud	100501		/users/profile/122813	Kelly2345678910111213	Board Member	5	11/10/2011	I have been involved with Faith Aloud for over 4 years and am honored to be a Board Member for this professional, progressive and compassionate organization.  The growth over the last three years has been phenomenal and I am eager to be part of Faith Aloud's continued success as we penetrate new markets with our messaging. Women are not victims of abortion!  We are victims of religious ideology  that causes shame and stigma around our sexuality and reproductive choices!  One huge mission of Faith Aloud is to eliminate the stigma of abortion by creating what I believe to be a paradigm shift for people of faith.  The message is that God loves you, Jesus trusts you, you are empowered to make your own decisions and do not require forgiveness for it!  It's all so simple!   We also embrace LGBTQ issues from a faith centered perspective; again with the same messaging:  God Loves you, Jesus trusts you, You are empowered and you do not require forgiveness.  We DO NOT pray away the gay here at this organization!  Quite the opposite - we embrace it! This is one organization I will support throughout my life in some way - either financially or through volunteer work, time - whatever is needed that I may provide.          
Faith Aloud	100500		/users/profile/122809	RevMichaelV	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/10/2011	No arena of privacy rights is so fraught with continued assault than sexual privacy rights by people who believe their sexual ideologies ought to govern all people, from with whom we have sex to how we deal with the consequences of pregnancy and the protection of the lives and well-being of women and their families.  Faith Aloud is a premier advocate for such rights, a primary defender of assaults against those rights.  I have worked with Rebecca Turner who serves as Executive Director and deeply trust her wisdom and her integrity.    I wholly identify with her commitments, and the organizational commitments of Faith Aloud.      - Rev. Michael Vosler, UCC, formerly of St. Louis, MO, now of Rohnert Park, CA.
Faith Aloud	100495		/users/profile/122781	ejb528	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/10/2011	Highly professional, bold and savvy, Faith Aloud is  a clear antidote to the idea that all religious people are conservative bigots.  They are an inspiring batch of oprganizers.
Faith Aloud	95718		/users/profile/50919	tammi-k	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/15/2011	Faith Aloud is invaluable to those working in the field of reproductive rights.  Reverend Turner and her volunteer clergy have made it possible for abortion providers to tackle the religious stigma and patient issues with religion and spirituality.  So many of our patients bring up religion as an issue in making their termination decision, and before Faith Aloud came along, counselors and advocates were often at a loss of how to address these tricky conversations.  Faith Aloud has a line of online videos & DVD's that women can watch directly and receive the support, compassion and spiritual connection that they were seeking.
Faith Aloud	50329	8	/users/profile/50919	tammi-k	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2010	Faith Aloud provides materials for use in reproductive health clinics.  These materials have been wanted and needed by clinics for years.  We are so grateful to Faith Aloud for bringing their ministry to our clinic - we are able to put in a DVD, and it's as if the minister is sitting right in the room with you and the patient.  Their DVD's are unique, they speak directly to the client in a calm, caring manner.  I have played the DVD's for many patients, and at the end - patients will say it is exactly what they needed to hear.  Faith Aloud DVD's and other materials are invaluable in our clinic - we use them daily.

Faith Aloud	50901	4	/users/profile/51411	susanpayne02	Volunteer	5	08/22/2010	Faith Aloud provides an affirming, faith-based voice, counseling women who have had or are considering abortion. If it were not for this organization, many women would not have access to an alternative perspective from the faith community that states that they are children of God, no matter what, and that there is nothing that can separate them from the love of God (Romans). As a counselor, pastor, and mother of three daughters, I would not hesitate to refer anyone to this service. They offer guidance, not decisions, and reflect the great commandment -- to love God and to love neighbor.

I have worked extensively with its executive director, the Rev. Rebecca Turner, who sensitively and passionately advocates for women.

Faith Aloud	50669	3	/users/profile/51199	brian-q-newcomb	Board Member	5	08/18/2010	I was a board member with Faith Aloud, during my years the MO Religous Coalition for Reproductive Choice, for four years or so, After attending trainings as an all-options counselor around helping women deal with concerns around unexpected or unwanted pregnancies, I answered and responded by phone to women who wanted to discuss faith and their desires to choose an abortion as the sensible path given their current circumstance.  Executive Director Rebecca Turner and her staff did a consistantly superior job of providing educational training, support and guidance as needs arose.  The program to recognize heroes in the Choice Movement, those committed to protecting the reproductive health and rights of women, and to stand with women who chose to exercise their right to an abortion found me donning my collar to stand silently with and on behalf of women, often carrying a sign that said "pro-faith, pro-family, pro-choice," or a similar sentiment.  Faith Aloud addresses the hurting women's need in our communities, who because of the loud voices of the religious right (which is neither), assume that there are no supportive folk in the faith community.  By honoring these women's stories, and standing in solidarity with them, those of us who believe that God's love and justice requires our graceful presence at the side of the hurting and the "least of these" while many on the other side of the discussion choose to scream and call them names, proved a profound and faith shaping exercise for me.  I apprecate Rev. Turner's leadership, and that of Faith Aloud.  They remind us to speak up and out about our convictions, to not be silent while so many rage like the wind.  Women on the front lines of the war over reproductive rights need allies, support and encouragement, and I'm proud to have played a role in the work of Faith Aloud on their behalf.

Faith Aloud	50542	7	/users/profile/51052	annieb	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2010	Faith Aloud helps people who are in spiritual turmoil find peace that releases them from the drain of guilt and shame when choosing to abort a problem pregnancy. Their writings, phone counseling, and videos are a powerful comfort and strength in the midst of anti-abortion bombardment when women are making a major life decision to end a pregnancy. When patients come to The Hope Clinic for Women, where I work, and are assailed by loud, judgmental protesters as they walk in to the clinic, Faith Aloud materials salve the wounds and strengthen people's faith in a God of love and mercy.  I've seen these materials make the difference between a patient having a distressing, painful abortion and one that is physically more bearable due to their sense of spiritual peace.
Faith Aloud	50540	6	/users/profile/51051	kim21	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2010	You made me see that the decision to carry s pregnancy to delivery can be a very difficult one, and that a woman has to live with the results of that decision for the rest of her life. She also makes that decision based on her hopes and dreams, that unfortunately don't always work out the way she had planned. I feel this organization offers counseling to help girls make informed choices based on their individual situation. Keep up the good work.
Faith Aloud	50514	8	/users/profile/51016	ellen-alper	Donor	5	08/16/2010	This is a great organization that works with the clergy of all faiths to provide counseling to women regarding reproductive choices.  They are honest, sincere, and promote no religious agenda:  just one of openness and honesty.
Faith Aloud	50466	11	/users/profile/51004	mimibeers	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2010	Faith Aloud is an organization I am proud to refer my patients to.  Finally, the support so many women are looking for is available through wonderful pro-choices clergy members.  I am delighted to talk about Faith Aloud with my patients and give them literature and refer as necessary.  Rev Turner has worked tirelessly to promote well-being and reduce stigma.  The materials offered are incredibly helpful and conversation provoking in counseling sessions.
Faith Aloud	50451	12	/users/profile/51002	sranney	Former Volunteer	5	08/16/2010	I have been involved with Faith Aloud for 7 years now. I have watched the organization grow to become nationally recognized through grassroots efforts, largely led by Executive Director- Reverend Rebecca Turner. Faith Aloud (previously Missouri Relgious Coalition for Reproductive Choice), for years, has been seeking ways to give voice to the challenging (and infrequently discussed) issues surrounding sexuality and religion. They have done this through religious counseling, educational services, community outreach, and political activism. As an organization they have provided a safe place to discuss difficult issues within the context of faith. They have struggled to provide support for women and their families who have made the difficult decision to have an abortion. They have provided education in the form of clergy-created literature and videos offering support as well as information on what different relgions really say about a woman's right to choose. Faith Aloud is a unique voice in the crowd- offering something so greatly needed and so rarely offered- a supportive voice for reproductive issues grounded in faith. Until working with Faith Aloud, I thought it was impossible to find a church that shared my view on God and politics. Not only have I seen witnessed this organization helping others, but through my work with Faith Aloud- I have reclaimed my faith and come to understand that my politics are supported by my religion.
Faith Aloud	50442	10	/users/profile/50999	rcgrn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2010	Everyday I get to see the impact Faith Aloud has made in helping the clients I serve explore the spiritual and ethical components of the reproductive and sexual decisions the clients make.  Without Faith Aloud, my clients would likely only be inundated with misinformation by other spiritual leaders who believe there is only path to God (or heaven, or goodness, or peace, or to whatever path the individual aspires).  So many other spiritual leaders teach that only a "certain" type of woman obtains reproductive health services.  Through the work of Faith Aloud, my hope is finally we may show the whole world that, indeed, GOOD women choose abortion. In addition to the invaluable service Faith Aloud provides to individual clients, I can not speak highly enough of the services this organization provides to the health care providers ourselves.  Through in-services, one-on-one teaching, and numerous resources at our disposal, Faith Aloud teaches us how to better serve our clients; and for that, I am eternally grateful.  Thank you, Faith Aloud, for making me a better nurse.    To Faith Aloud: Thank you for helping women, helping providers, and helping the world.
Faith Aloud	50430	11	/users/profile/50995	autumn1	Former staff	5	08/16/2010	Faith Aloud is an awesome organization. Since working with and for them I have received so many emails, phone calls and messages about how much their work impacts people all over the company. So many people never hear positive messages about religion and sexuality but Faith Aloud is working hard to change that. Through their counseling programs and youth and Young Professionals groups they have helped educate and motivate so many different people from every walk of life. I believe that what this country needs is more of Faith Aloud.
Faith Aloud	50406	10	/users/profile/50991	rebekah4	Former Volunteer	5	08/15/2010	I greatly enjoyed my volunteer time at Faith Aloud.  I was able to participate in many events which were both educational and inspirational.  The people associated with Faith Aloud are compassionate and always eager to help a good cause.  I learned a lot during my time there and have been inspired to become more involved in issues like religious freedom and reproductive justice.
Faith Aloud	50335	8	/users/profile/50923	ele	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2010	Faith Aloud has been a tremendous help to me in my experience counseling patients.  I have a Christian background, but do not identify as a Christian, so it can be difficult for me to convey what is so eloquently, kindly and respectfully communicated in the Faith Aloud DVD.  I love the little card, too, because of the scripture on the back: "Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ."  Women need to hear this message who are having spiritual conflict with their decision to have an abortion.  These may be things they have heard before, but not in the context of an abortion experience.  It is acknowledging what they are going through, validating them as women who deserve respect and love, and giving them permission to feel the Lord's presence every step of the way.  If they have this message to hold onto throughout their healing process, it can affect them positively for years to come.
Faith Aloud	50314	7	/users/profile/50894	pegjohnston	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2010	Faith Aloud has produced great resources for the abortion care community in a short amount of time. I have seen patients watching their videos with tears streaming down their faces. One woman said, "This is exactly what I needed." Faith Aloud has created the missing link for a great number of women for whom spirituality and religion is important. The affirmation they offer has a huge impact on individuals and how they cope before, after and during an abortion.I have also given substantial amounts of money to Faith Aloud and they have been most frugal and productive with the moneys they receive. They seem to be good stewards of the funds they have and also make good use of volunteers. They are also remarkable in their use of social media and the latest technology.
Faith Aloud	50236	6	/users/profile/50784	john37	Board Member	5	08/11/2010	This organization has displayed great courage and creative strategies in responding to the needs of women seeking good information about their reproductive choices, as well as offering those women shelter, compassion, and protection in a climate where making certain choices can stigmatize them. They are a group of very committed religious leaders whose theological posistions are consistent with longstanding traditions, and who are able to offer new words to counter the more intolerant voices within their faith traditions.
Faith Aloud	50199	6	/users/profile/50736	choicepursuitsyahoocom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/10/2010	I'm a consultant who works with abortion clinics across the country.  In my work I train counselors and medical staff and have found the Faith Aloud materials incredibly valuable.  Staff get to work through their own religious and spiritual issues while helping women in their clinics do the same.  The DVD that Rebecca Turner created for patients is one of the most powerful counseling tools available to abortion providers.  I strongly support this organization and their work.

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	314090		/users/profile/405448	musicat320	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	Tenth Life Cat Rescue is a great cat rescue as it gives those cats and kittens that really need it, a tenth life.   It takes a lot of dedication from its fosters and volunteers to give those special cats the care they need, whether it be something short term, such a as a URI or a broken bone, to long term such as heart murmurs and paralyzation.  No cat is ever 'put down' due to cost of care.

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	312059		/users/profile/403414	Juniormom11	Client Served	5	10/19/2016	My son found a kitten on tenth lifes website and fell in love with her. I got in touch with them and everything was so easy. We found out they adopt in pairs under 6 months of age so my son saw that she had two brothers so we had an idea that we may want to see Brock also while we were there. We made an appt to meet with the foster mom who had her and her brothers. Well as soon as we saw all three of them we fell in love with all of them! Decided we would adopt all three siblings because we didnt want to split them up. They were almost four months old by then. We have had them since aug.4th and on oct. 20th (tomorrow) they will be 6 months old. We couldnt be happier with the experience we have had with tenth life and their foster moms. I keep in touch with both of them, have gotten their full background and pictures from when they first arrived! They have the kittens up to date on shots, spayed and/or neutered, and chipped before we get them! I cannot praise them enough for the love and joy we have with our three little babies! To preface this we had a cat who passed away in June who was twenty years old, older than my son who is fifteen. We were devastated even though he was sick it was still hard to deal with. My son never experienced the kitten stage and that is what brought us to tenth lifes website.i would reccommend anyone to go to them and rescue a kitten or cat or two.. or three! I have included pictures of my babies.. Brock who is in the basket and is our most vocal one. Ozzie, the little girl who is still tiny and we call her little sissy. And Gibbs (Gibson is his full name) who is a cuddler. When they were brought in they were named for former Cardinals players

Not only do they rescue and find homes for the neediest stray and special-needs kitties, but their storefront is one of the most awesome places in St. Louis. Cats roam free there (no cages). You can play with the kitties on their own turf (they cats really the place--the volunteers are just there to serve the felines). And the rest of their cats are raised in loving foster homes, so all the cats are well socialized before they go to their forever homes. The Tenth Life volunteers are so dedicated and friendly. It's an awesome family!

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	311532	1	/users/profile/395505	Nancy264	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	Tenth Life Cat Rescue does incredible work on behalf of kitties in need.  Last year we found two teeny kittens in our parking lot. All of us are animal lovers but had multiple pets at home. What were we to do with these poor babies over the 4th of July weekend? Who would help us find homes for them?  We immediately contacted a few area rescues. Tenth Life kindly offered to accept them if we could provide a foster home. I said I would foster them. We were so grateful for their help. Tenth Life helped us get them started on their way - with complete vetting, expert fostering advice on how to care for 5 week old kittens and listening to all the stories about how cute they were!  Tenth Life has an amazing network of fosters and volunteers. The kittens were soon ready for meet & greet events so they could be adopted. They had their photos taken,  awesome descriptions about them written and all of it posted on their adoption pages for everyone to see.  One if the kittens had an overbite that would cause trouble if he did not have a special dental procedure done. Tenth Life and their vets found a wonderful vet in the area that specialized in dental care. He had his pulpotomy done when he was about a year old. And is now a healthy happy beautiful cat!  I volunteer for Tenth Life now. My foster work is on hold because I am a proud foster failure. I ended up adopting both of the kittens!  Tenth Life is an amazing organization!

The staff and volunteers rally when there is a cat found in a dangerous situation and they work until that cat is rescued and safe.

It's one of the friendliest places where I've ever worked *or* volunteered! Not only is its mission one that is dear to my heart, focusing on special needs cats, but it's an organization that allows volunteers to do as little or as much as they feel comfortable doing, or are able to do.  Tenth Life has become a part of *my* life, and does a remarkable job of fulfilling their mission. I volunteer regularly, and donate frequently.

To see in person the difference they were making in these cats lives where most people would have given up was awe inspiring. I had to get in on the action and volunteer myself. Everyone truly cares for the cats and have a blast while doing it. I count myself lucky to be able to be a part of such an important organization in my community. Thank you Tenth Life! Xo

If you haven't visited the Tenth Life shelter/office you must come by for a visit.  I promise you a very relaxing, peaceful and playful time with all the kitties that are at the storefront.

You can play with the kitties in a safe environment and possibly meet your forever kitty!  Absolutely wonderful place and wonderful people!

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	304282	2	/users/profile/395449	Elizabeth224	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	My husband and I wanted to add a pet to our little family. I was looking for a bonded pair of special needs cats to adopt toward the end of the year in 2014 and came accross Tenth Life on Petfinder. We adopted a Jerry and Curly, a bonded pair of FIV+ boys. We fell in love as soon as we met them and brought them home the same day (8 hours after) we closed on our new house because we were too excited to get them and didn't want to wait until after the holidays. A few months after we adopted Jerry and Curly, my husband and his co worker came accross a special kitty with an injured leg who really needed loving care and medical help. Luckily, Tenth Life was able to help this special girl, named Goose, and my husband and I inquired about her and got to see her after her much needed surgery to have her leg removed. We kept in contact with her wonderful foster mom and quickly became friends. As much as we would have loved to adopt Goose, we felt she would do best in a home with less rambunctious cats. Thankfully, she was adopted by an amazing couple and we couldn't be happier for Goose, her humans, and their furry family.Seeing the need for more people to foster these incredible and deserving cats, my husband and I had been discussing the idea of fostering ourselves. Goose's lovely foster mom had just the nudge we needed to start fostering when she sent us a picture of a FIV+ boy, Rayford, on the waitlist for a foster. Once we heard his story, we had to help him. We applied to be a foster home, met with some volunteers at our home, and we were approved. Fast forward several months, after getting Rayford back to health and feeling better, and it turns out that he was meant to be ours all along, so we adopted him. We also fostered another FIV+ boy, Elvis, who is a little shy, but such a momma's boy. Ultimately, we adopted him as well. I know, clearly we are not so good at the whole fostering idea. But, hey, if they get a loving forever home, I still consider it a success. We have fostered a handful of other cats, some just temp fostering while other fosters are out of town, and we cannot thank Tenth Life enough for their dedication to helping cats in need. With this organization, we have found a group of people who are so kind, eager to help, and dedicated to helping incredibly deserving cats. We look forward to the future and how many more cats Tenth Life can help. They are making a great impact on the feline community in the St. Louis area and beyond right now. Although we have many wonderful fosters, volunteers, adopters, and supporters, we would always welcome additianal support so that we can help even more cats.

Those turned away by shelters and other rescue organizations as lost causes are lovingly taken in by the special volunteers at Tenth Life who foster them, treat and socialize them, provide therapeutic care and generally give them back their self-respect.

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	128090		/users/profile/173220	rawree	Donor	5	10/23/2012	We love Tenth Life!  This organization helps out so many needy cats with special needs--cats that other organizations either would not take, or would put down because of the amount of work needed.  Not Tenth Life!  As parents of a special needs kitty ourselves, we love to donate to this awesome organization!  
Tenth Life Cat Rescue	128074	1	/users/profile/173202	kissycat	Client Served	5	10/23/2012	Tenth Life is an amazing nonprofit that cares for special needs kitties.  While they also take in regular cats, Tenth Life focuses its efforts on finding homes for cats who would otherwise be overlooked.  It can be scary to adopt someone that may need more help, but Tenth Life has a range of kitties with easy-to-care-for disabilities as well as more challenging ones for those who are dedicated to giving one of these precious lives a second chance.  I adopted a kitty with cerebullar hyoplasia, and my sister adopted one with a mild form of the disorder or spinal cord injury.  The kitties are wonderful, and the group gives you all the support you need to care for your new family member.  No regrets!

Tenth Life Cat Rescue	127989	1	/users/profile/173116	Elizabeth69	Board Member	5	10/23/2012	Tenth Life Cat Rescue is unlike other animal rescues and shelters in that it admits some of the most difficult-to-place cats and kittens. Many of the kitties the organization cares for have a medical condition or special need that would plague them with the label of "unadoptable" in the care of other groups. But Tenth Life's specialty is giving seemingly hopeless cases one final chance... in essence, a tenth life.

Daisys Eye Cancer Fund	167800		/users/profile/222689	jcscan	Board Member	5	09/06/2013	I became involved with this charity, like many people often do, after having a personal experience.  My daughter was diagnosed with eye cancer shortly after being born in 2007.  We were lucky in many ways and our precious child is wonderfully healthy and happy today.  Still, the nightmare of those first few weeks were awful.  My wife and I were terrified.  Our fears were magnified by this exceedingly rare disease.  I mean, cancer in your eye?  I never even heard of that before.  The anonymity of the disease exasperated the terror we were subjected to because there were so few people in our medical community that knew much about it or could answer the 52,000 questions we had.  Somehow, in the midst of the haze of desperation and fear we were introduced to a woman who couldn't help our daughter but certainly saved us.  This non medical person survived eye cancer as a child and has since dedicated herself to helping others dealing with the trauma of such a difficult circumstance.  She had more knowledge than most doctors we spoke with.  She was always there to speak with us.  She was our angel.  That woman started this charity and subsequently asked me to join the board.  I was both humbled and honored.  This is a great charity for many reasons.  This great group of people work hard to raise funds not only to help affected children and their families cope with the devastation of this disease but they also spend so much time bringing awareness (and earlier diagnosis) to families and medical communities around the US and around the world.  Many children are alive today and many more will be saved because of the dedication, commitment and hard work being done at DECF.   I am extremely proud to be affiliated with such a wonderful nonprofit organization
Daisys Eye Cancer Fund	167779		/users/profile/222666	katybishop79	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2013	This charity has a global impact on improving the chances of sight and life for children affected by retinoblastoma. They work hard and continually strive to raise funds and awareness. They have come along huge leaps since their beginnings and now help families all over the world. I personally know people who's support from DECF was the only thing that got them through when their child was diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Their outreach is a vital support network for families who have been thrown into the scary world of childhood cancer.Awareness is vital in the fight to save vision and lives and without DECF, in many countries across the world, more children would lose their sight to retinoblastoma and possibly life too.

Daisys Eye Cancer Fund	167352		/users/profile/222216	treid	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	As a survivor and a parent of a child with RB, I know too well the importance of information and support. Parents receiving a diagnosis need clear easy to understand information in order to make decisions impacting their child's life. From the physical to the emotional aspects that are associated with having cancer, losing an eye, side effects of treatment...DECF helps parents through the process always keeping the child as the first priority.DECF assists adult survivors in staying educated about potential risks for secondary cancers, managing prosthetics and more.  This organization is making a positive impact on children with eye cancer, their families and adult survivors throughout the world. I'm proud to have the opportunity to work with and support this group.

Of all the sites available for information on RB I have found that DECF is the easiest to read and understand but goes further to help familes and not just the medical info one is looking for.   The people involved with DECF are amazing as well.  They try to answer any questions you have and put you in touch with others in the same situations.  The best shoulder to have to cry on so to speak when RB is the cause.

My son was diagnosed with sporadic unilateral retinoblastoma in 2004.  We were absolutely blindsided and were desperate to find other families going through the same thing.  Unfortunately, we went through the beginning of our Rb journey alone.  I recently became aware of DECF in the USA and immediately joined the Facebook groups.  It is wonderful to see the support available to people starting their Rb journeys as well as families like us who are well into them.  I have recently volunteered to serve on the Board of DECF USA as Treasurer.

I had long been looking for a support group and also a way to become involved with RB in some capacity. Through joining DECF as a board member I have been introduced to many survivors and parents of children with RB. The survivor Facebook group has been an amazing resource because I had never been able to talk with another survivor before. We chat about our histories, concerns, problems and even have laughs sometimes. What is great is there is a wide variety of ages, locations and experiences so the information that is shared is very diverse. I am very thankful that these resources have been made possible by DECF USA.

So grateful for DECF on so many levels.  The family and friends I have met through this journey has made it that much easier on me going through this with my son.  I have been given what no doctor can tell me, not because of their lack of knowledge.... Lord know that is not the reason.  The experiences that we encounter, the ups and downs of this emotional rollercoaster, the parents understanding us on a different level that no doctor can tell me.  To hear te words from another parent saying "I get it!" makes me realize you don't and should not have to do this alone.  There is support I am so very blessed to have in my life.

Why are we still funding the military at obscene levels while most of our leaders complain that there isn't enough money for education, social services, taking care of children, infrastructure, health care, or even taking care of the needs of combat veterans!  I'm very pleased with Veterans For Peace.  It keeps me informed about ongoing and new peace issues and opportunities for effective activism to oppose them.I'm equally pleased with my local chapter, which is passionately interested in national, international andlocal peace and justice issues.

I used to be satisfied that I'd done a good job during my nearly-full military career. I began to realize the lies and abuses my country causes while I was in and thought it was enough to remove myself from the military. But our militant attitudes permeate our country. I came home to a different society than the one I left in 1979. I was the one who was different, I guess. Suddenly I saw we couldn't get enough violence at the expense of the world's poor. Since Oct 2001 we've caused such misery at home and abroad by our extravagant, excessive spending to dominate the global scene militarily. My dream is that the work of groups like VFP will help shift public acceptance of this imbalance. I believe in our Constitutional rights AND obligations. We can change our country's focus. JOIN US!
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	221893	2	/users/profile/175919	ARNY	Volunteer	5	10/11/2014	Without VFP I'd be a mental wreck.  I woke up to my military experience (Army, infantry in the U.S. war against the people of Viet Nam) in January of 2003.  I turned on the TV one night and the movie "Platoon" was playing.  I had never read or watched anything about Viet Nam since I left there in early 1971.  I figured I could handle it now.  Wrong.  I saw the children with big brown eyes and tatted clothes and it all came back - like a lightening bolt - the sights, the sounds, the smells.  I was introduced to VFP by Bob Krzewinski in Michigan.  I joined and am now immersed in VFP.  It is my life line.  I wear something VFP everyday and engage in dialogue about our mission at every opportunity.  VFP is the place for me!
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	130443	3	/users/profile/175919	ARNY	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	I woke up to my military experience (Army, infantry, Viet Nam) in January of 2003.  I was overwhelmed with striff/panic/shame/anger for many months.   I have an MBA and I used my research skills to learn all I could about war, violence, politics, foreign affairs, other cultures, and many other topics.  I gained  knowledge, but I needed more than knowledge.   About a year later I attended a peace rally in Ann Arbor, MI .  A guy approached me and asked if I had heard of Veterans For Peace.  I hadn't.   I took his info., went home and researched the group.   I joined soon after that and the association has changed my life.   I thought I was alone with my issues.   I wasn't.  The people I've met via VFP have introduced me to books, videos, and other resources that I would never have found on my own.  More importantly, I've met many great folks all over the country who have followed the same path and are speaking and acting for true, Gandhi style peace.   They give me the strength and courage to oppose violence as a solution. 
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	221844	2	/users/profile/285536	Sound83	Volunteer	5	10/10/2014	I joined VFP in 2001 knowing that we were headed into another long and futile war. The members I have met in the last 13 years are dedicated to abolishing war, are courageously and non violently standing up to the powerful war mongers, and continually educating people that war can be resisted. We need more vets to join us and we could definitely change the national discussions on how to wage peace.

VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	208281	2	/users/profile/191995	P-Mac	Board Member	5	08/01/2014	Veterans For Peace held an incredibly successful 29th annual convention July 23 - 27 in Asheville, NC. For the 2nd consecutive year (also Madison in August 2013), VFP was welcomed by our host city's mayor. The convention lasted 5 days, drawing nearly 400 participants. One highlight was an Iraq and Afghanistan veterans caucus, drawing over 3 dozen young veterans. Our keynote speaker, Cynthia McKinney, was preceded by keynoter Alice Walker at our 2012 convention in Miami, which itself was followed by a fact-finding tour to Haiti with Alice, Colonel Ann Wright (ret.) and 16 other participants. Veterans For Peace is unique in its demographic, institutional viability, and enthusiasm for activism shown consistently in over 100 communities. Veterans For Peace is one of the most reliable groups on the American scene in the fight for peace and equality.

PEACE is what this country desperately needs, & Veterans for Peace has been there.  They know the opposite of PEACE, so they can be trusted by the public.
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	130544	1	/users/profile/176017	Sam F.	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	Veterans For Peace members throughout the nation and in a few foreign countries constantly work to educate the public on the human cost of war and advocate for an end to violence. These tasks help those of us who have wounded bodies heal our wounded souls. We are all still serving our country, but in a higher cause.
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	130375	2	/users/profile/175848	Nancy Nygard	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	When my son joined the army in 2003 I went looking for an organization to help me deal with his deployment to Afghanistan.  I joined VFP in 2005 and have been a loyal member since.  My local chapter and the national office have been very supportive and have offered me great comfort to know that those who have served understand the costs of war.  Although I am the mother that stayed behind when "they" went to fight, these veterans still understand my fears and rage at repeated deployments and apathy of the public.  These veterans are smart, dedicated, loyal and they love their country more than most.
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	130236	2	/users/profile/175705	leomadrid	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/27/2012	I have been a member of the San Francisco chapter of VFP since March 2012 and host a weekly radio program dedicated to the concept of peace. I believe that peace can be achieved and one of the most effective ways of influencing the behavior of others is to set a good example. Be the change we wish to see and others will follow suit.  When I fist arrived on the scene I expected to find a group of forward thinking veterans who are working together to make San Francisco and the world a better place, but instead found myself embroiled in an unnecessary war over the control of resources available at the SF Veterans Building (money, free office space & people), with VFP leading the charge. While the monthly VFP meetings condemn the tactics the government utilizes to achieve their ends, they themselves are riddled with deception, hidden agendas and conflicts of interests, justifying their means with righteousness and self-adoring entitlement while inflicting psychological violence on fellow Veterans.  Where there once was a community of thousands of veterans, there is now only a few dozen at best and the ongoing hostilities and dysfunctional attitudes keep veterans away. From my perspective, this chapter of VFP is indirectly responsible for dozens, if not hundreds of veteran suicides and attempts, because of the lack of positive community. Inside the War Memorial Veterans Building I have opened a museum dedicated to the concept of peace, not with the help of VFP, but in spite of its lack thereof. In summary.... There are 3 P's for some in Veterans For Peace,and ironically Peace isn't anywhere to hear or see.The 38,000 ft. of the WMVB is their golden fleece,a fight lasting forever is one they fight with glee. The first P is for Protest and to thirst for it flagrantly,for every protest there is a themed marching parade,and an after-party to celebrate their perceived victory,the fights must go on with each one custom made. The second P is for Parties at which they crave conformity,spending on them to attend a regular basis is a must.Standing up to take the honorary bow as if deservedly.a celebration for themselves and the few they trust. The third and last P of VFP stands for the marching Parade,pretending to be the war heroes they wish they could never be,remembering feeling great during the short boot-camp charade,and hate the fact that it felt so good being active in the military.
VETERANS FOR PEACE INC - National Office	130232	1	/users/profile/175701	Bettina	General Member of the Public	4	10/27/2012	Respect for the veterans, largely Vietnam era, who have kept their commitment to peace and exposing the lies and commemorating those killed which goes with involvement in war.   Despite their opposition to war, they have not forgotten their fellow vets who continue to suffer-pscyolologically and physically-from wars.  They are committed to not forgetting those who have died and also work with other groups that some mainstream peace groups avoid.   Even before renewed political activism generated by the Occupy movement, Veterans for Peace were there.   They are doing a great job.  Their involvement lends credence to the peace movement.

Veterans telling the truth about War, Veterans Affairs and the world in which we live. Since the Pentagon's crushing disinformation campaign distorts, so does VFP clear the muddied waters of discourse in many ares. Their protest work is superb and effective across the board, since vets are diverse as the US itself.

Educating our citizens, beyond the sound bites on the news, about the people who served and their needs here at home.  With more awareness, the public can understand and support Veterans telling their stories and provide resources to embrace them as they return to civilian life.

Operation Shower	180018		/users/profile/236669	DrPeg	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	I am a staff psychologist for a VA Medical Center & a clinical assistant professor at a medical school. Both of my grandfathers, my father, my brother, several uncles & many dear friends have served in our armed forces. Thus, organizations that support our military & military families are especially close to my heart. Operation Shower is one of my favorite charities. I have donated both money & time to this amazing organization. In January of 2011, I was fortunate to volunteer at one of their showers in San Diego. It was an honor to share in such a special day for so many expectant mothers whose partners were deployed. Operation Shower brings such happiness & joy to our military families, and helps them to realize the support they have from so many Americans. Please help them to continue their mission. In peace, Peggy Hudson, Ph.D.  
Operation Shower	178749		/users/profile/235376	JessFeldhaus	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Operation Shower is such an remarkable and generous organization. I had the great pleasure of being a volunteer at their shower in St. Louis and it was such a wonderful experience. It was so awesome to be a part of honoring these amazing moms and I can't think of a better cause. LeAnn, Amy and Lia do such a fantastic job organizing the events and making sure every last detail is perfect. The moms were so grateful for the generous gifts and I hope that the experience showed them how much appreciation, love and respect everyone has for them. Keep up the amazing work Operation Shower!
Operation Shower	178369		/users/profile/234979	Karen211	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Not only did this organization honor a much ignored group of people who serve our country in relative silence, they helped strength those same people by bring those in difficult situations together to meet and support each other. The bonds these women make at this event last much longer than the event. These bonds and connections are very important to young mothers in new areas where they feel quite alone while worrying about their loved ones out serving our country, many in harms way.  As a young military spouse myself I often felt alone and misunderstood. My family who lived far away thought my life was full of military parties and excitement. They never understood the thankless job I, and all military spouses, did while dealing with newborns and your own illnesses and other issues.  This organization really lets these women know how much they are appreciated and their sacrifices are not going unnoticed. Does a lot for the morale and well being of not only the military families but our troops as well. The less our troops worry about at home the better they can do their job and the more they can focus on doing it safely so all can come home safely. 
Operation Shower	178157		/users/profile/234785	Erika14	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	I have volunteered at two Operation Shower events and collected product for both of them.  Setup is a lot of work but fun.  The shower days are amazing - it is fun to watch the Moms as they socialize and open their gifts.  It's a great way to give back to military families.
Operation Shower	178056		/users/profile/234675	Crafty Cheryl	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	My daughter and I had the chance to be volunteers at the shower that was held at Fort Drum Army Base in July 2013.  This was the first time I had heard about Operation Shower.  My daughter liked their Facebook page and found out they were coming to Northern NY.  We had a blast helping set up the shower and then volunteering during the shower.  They do an amazing job.  What a great idea LeAnn has come up with.   I love all the different themes that they have for all the different showers.  I have donated crochet and knit baby hats for the shower in a box and will continue to do so.  We had such fun watching the reactions for the moms during the shower.  The Mom's were so thankful for what LeAnne, Amy and Lia do for them.  I recommend this organization to everyone I know.  
Operation Shower	178025		/users/profile/234635	jmshepard97	Client Served	5	10/16/2013	If there were more than 5 stars I could give, I would give them 38 stars representing the 38 unit-wide showers they have held as of September 2013.  They have greatly touched thousands of hearts and have made an impact to so many.  Most would probably not have thought to pay attention to a pregnant military wife whose husband is deployed because many would think it came with the territory being married to a service member.  It's been done before and it's nothing special right? OH but it is and Operation Shower took it above and beyond to recognize that it is special and they knew how stressful that can be to the one left behind.  Not only with the added stress of being pregnant and to top it off your husband is not even in the same continent as you.  They showered us with generosity, recognized us, thanked us, gifted us, honored us, and appreciated us.  It has been 2 years since I was honored at one of their showers and came back a year later as a guest and it is just NOW that I am actually able to talk to people about operation shower without getting emotional! It may have been the pregnancy hormones or what I have already been through with my high risk pregnancy and delivery, but probably mostly due to how operation shower and their team made me feel that day and yes hormones! =) When I would talk about them, I relive that moment.   It's like what Maya Angelou says I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel" BUT for me I will never forget what they did because of how they made me feel! I am a supporter for life. 
Operation Shower	178021		/users/profile/234628	Angela69	Client Served	5	10/16/2013	I've never experienced anything like it in my life! To give in the way they do just blows my mind, I was gifted party supplies for my daughters 1st birthday,which will be tomorrow. Operation shower is awesome. Besides everything that was given I won a bed set for my daughter, before I went I didn't know how I was going to afford a bed set for her. Operation shower blessed us tremendously & I am very thankful for them.
Operation Shower	178002		/users/profile/234605	aliciarose	Client Served	5	10/15/2013	I don't know where to begin. Operation shower is the most amazing organization I think I have ever come into contact with! They treated us like VIPs! The shower was BEAUTIFUL, wonderfully catered, and decorated.  The gifts were out of this world! I could not believe the generosity that was shown. These people do so much for military families! I am so very thankful that I had the opportunity to attend! 
Operation Shower	177955		/users/profile/234556	Susi_jc	Donor	5	10/15/2013	This is a wonderful organization that not only honors military families but truly cares for them.  I am so impressed by the thought and love given for every single shower and am happy to be a donor.  I actually have 2 young children and have purchased products from the companies that regularly donate to the showers since I know how much they support them!
Operation Shower	177950		/users/profile/234551	DanielleSmith	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	Operation Shower is a little slice of heaven. From the moment I first learned about their organization a number of years ago, I have been stunned by their committment to the families who serve our country. They have found a way to say thank you, we love you, we support you and we are honored to help in whatever way we can - all in one.  They throw the most magical baby showers for women who might not otherwise have that experience. I have been privileged to host two of their events - one at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and one at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.  On both occasions, I was fully aware I was surrounded by something extraordinary. The moms-to-be are beautifully overwhelmed by how spoiled they are, by the joy in the room, and by the generosity of the many, many people and brands who come together to donate, making each event a spectacular success. It is hard to hold back the tears as you look around the room - sitting and chatting with these new moms and moms-to-be - knowing that they are experiencing motherhood in a way unknown to so many of us - alone - possibly away from family, waiting on the return of their spouses and hoping for his safe return. Operation Shower aims to ease the burden of deployment - and I believe in my heart - based on what I have seen....that it does and in such a lovely way. Operation Shower was started with heart in LeAnn Morrissey's basement and continues today with that same heart..... the added bonus is the number of other people (including her husband and 11 year old son) and volunteers who have added their love and hearts to the mix.  
Operation Shower	177949		/users/profile/234550	Karen210	Client Served	5	10/15/2013	I was blessed to be invited to the March Operation Shower a week before my baby was due. The generosity of this organization is unmeasurable. If it weren't for this organization we would not have had a crib.

We were so greatful for all the gifts and upon leaving we sat in the car speechless. Our little boy is due in 4 weeks and we can't wait to use all the gifts. My husband is now deployed and we so appreciate that he was able to be a part of the baby shower.

Having a child while your spouse is deployed is physically and emotionally stressful and this program truly touched my heart.  It provided me with may things that I could not currently afford as well as provided a day of stress-free activities and allowed me to enjoy my pregnancy and share the joy of other expecting mothers also.  This program Is amazing and while I could never repay the kindness I was shown I can only express my gratitude and say thank you to them and hope that they know I mean that with all of my heart.

The team work, the organization of donations being delivered, food, cakes and the decorating, I absolutely felt like those mama-to-be were going to feel like they were on the red carpet.  Not only was there countless hours put into prep for the shower but I was astounded by the amount of love shown to these women who may otherwise not receive beautiful gifts let alone a baby shower to ohh and ahh over her new bundle of joy!  Hats off to the founder Leanne and her shower team that comes together several times a year to reach out to military mamas, God bless & thank you for your willingness to give amazing blessings!
Operation Shower	177931		/users/profile/234530	Marie F.	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I absolutely LOVE this organization. I have been volunteering for almost three years now and try to be part of any shower that comes my way. I started by donating sweets and have had the pleasure of designing and executing several dessert stations since then. These are my favorite events to do as I feel everything is appreciated and my time is well spent. They always have THE best themes and party professionals involved as well. It definitely gives me something to look forward to.  Operation Shower goes above and beyond to make these events extraordinary. They not only provide amazing necessities for new families, but love, support and encouragement as well. I am always moved to tears when the moms are surprised with their gifts and the outpouring of support. They are filling a great need in our country and I hope more and more people are given the opportunity to experience their events. The level of professionalism, organization and excitement is unmatched. I've also enjoyed meeting other people in various professional industries and have built lifetime friendships through Operation Shower.

Being the spouse of a deployed airman who unfortunately won't be home for the birth of our second child, it meant more than words could ever explain to have such an organization fill that void in your heart. I love every aspect of the things they do and would never trade it for the world. To see such good in the world still gives one hope. My husband was so very thankful of the fact that during such hard times that I still had something wonderful to look forward to. Thank you so very much!
Operation Shower	177924		/users/profile/234521	britter368	Client Served	5	10/15/2013	I am an active duty member of the US Air Force.  I got the opportunity to participate in "Operation Shower" in October 2013, while 8 months pregnant.  My husband, also active duty Air Force, is leaving for six months of training just a few weeks after our first child is born.  We have been through many deployments and separations in the past, but none with children, let alone a brand new baby.  Needless to say this has been a joyful but stressful period in our life.  Operation Shower gave my husband and I a day of fun in the midst of all this.  We truly felt like we were on "Oprah's favorite things"! Every five minutes volunteers came out with dozens of baby gifts for us (items we were still in much need of).  I felt like my best friend was throwing me my shower.  The whole room was decorated, there were gifts galore, food, activities, and the chance to socialize with other moms in the same situation.  I could not believe that a group of people cared so much that they would organize something like this to show their appreciation for what military families go through.  I have been in the Air Force for over 7 years and never have I felt more appreciated than I did during Operation Shower.  I am so grateful to this organization for their efforts.  It is a day I will never forget.

I don't think I've ever been in a room so full of love outside of a family get together. What they did for my family was above and beyond. My husband was actually home at the time of the shower and was able to attend with me. We felt like royalty that day.  Not a day goes by that I don't use at least one item that was gifted to us. This charity does amazing things for moms to be and deserves every bit of recognition and funding they receive.

It was so exciting to see all these women receive their gifts and meet them and hear some of their stories. I now send gifts to Operation shower as my way of honoring our military. I am thankful for each one who sacrifices to keep our country and my family safe here in America.

Operation Shower sent me a huge box full of baby gifts, it really cheered me up and helped me get less depressed about my husband's absence. I really appreciate what they did and I think the staff have a heart of god , thank you operation shower :)

With this upstanding organization, my job was made easier with excellent information, follow through and overall enthusiasm for the great work they do. It was a joy to work on publicity materials for such a positive nonprofit who does inspiring work with military families.
Operation Shower	33558	1	/users/profile/34354	abelleisle	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	If you are lucky, you find that one thing in life that you know you were meant to do. For me, that is Operation Shower. Watching our military families say goodbye or be reunited on television never ceases to make me cry and make me grateful for their service. We often see what happens to our military heroes while they are gone, but what about the families? Operation Shower's goal is to do our part to take care of some of those left behind. Honoring those strong women who go through their pregnancy while their partner is serving overseas is not only a gift we give, but one that we take very seriously and humbly. Whether it is an individual shower in a box to a mom-to-be or a fabulous unit-wide or special baby shower, our singular goal is always the same - make sure these families know how much we appreciate their sacrifice. The bonus? Smiles, tears, hugs, joy, a time to bond with other women in their situation and a lasting memory. THIS is what I was meant to do with my love of throwing a party and events background and I am continuously blessed by Operation Shower.
Operation Shower	33506	10	/users/profile/34301	blairh	Client Served	5	03/18/2010	I received a shower in a box from operation shower. I cant begin to describe the joy and support that I felt. Sometimes being the spouse of a service member can make you feel like you have lost your identity. You move from your friends and family without a second thought. You do this because you believe in the mission of the United States of America, and you believe in your spouse. It was so nice to feel that piece of family and home again. Getting that box was like getting a big hug from all the people who worked so hard to get those gifts for my baby and I. I am so thankful to all of you who made this possible. Thank you Operation Shower not only for the gifts, but for the support that your shower in a box represents while my husband was deployed.
Operation Shower	33483	4	/users/profile/34277	cdot30	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I was lucky enough, and honored to help Operation Shower with their group shower at the Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Va. As a volunteer, I witnessed the passion of the OS team, as well as the appreciation from the mothers receiving gifts for their babies. The specific needs that Operation Shower supports is unprecedented.  So many military mothers-to-be are away from family and friends, and don't get the support in the way of traditional showers, during their pregnancy.  Operation Shower helps fill this void both emotionally and physically with their group showers, and "showers-in-a-box."
Operation Shower	33461	4	/users/profile/34259	boorider67	Client Served	5	03/17/2010	Operation Shower has touched the lives of many "growing" military families.  The thought and caring that goes into each shower is increditable.  It is as if they planned the shower for there best friend.  The expectent Mom's are so greatful that someone who does not even know them would do this for them.  Dad's are thankful that an orginization is doing everything they can to make there ablense during this special time a little more bearable.  Thanks for all you Do!

Operation Shower recognized the sacrifice of him missing the birth and sent her a shower-in-a-box. We were amazed! It contained everything she could possibly need for the new baby. On Dec 4 2009 she delivered a beautiful baby girl weighing 4 lbs 12 oz. Thank you Operation Shower you were a Godsend.
Operation Shower	33268	4	/users/profile/34082	dfischer	Donor	5	03/16/2010	I have attended many fundraising events for Operation Shower.  Also at two of my granddaughter's birthday parties everyone donated books one year and pajamas the next year.  I have seen pictures from some of these showers and it is a true blessing what Operation Shower provides to these military families.
Operation Shower	33258	7	/users/profile/34073	dcatsavis	Volunteer	5	03/15/2010	It is truly a privilege for me to be a full time volunteer with Operation Shower! Over the past year I have experienced the love and appreciation for each military family that goes into every box that is given. I have attended beautiful showers that honor these moms-to-be in the same special way that family and dear friends would treat them. The large "Shower Boxes" given to these deserving women are filled with exceptional gifts for both the babies and the mothers, as well as support materials and services. I have seen tears of gratitude and received thanks in the form of hugs, personal stories, and letters of hardships and struggles these expectant women often face while away from home - with loved ones living in other states while their husbands are deployed. Soldiers have also sent letters of appreciation expressing how Operation Shower helped to ease their stress in providing what they otherwise could not afford, and how happy they were to hear that their wife was treated to such a spectacular event/surprise in their absence! The good work of Operation Shower is a very powerful blessing in the lives of so many men, women, and children! Through these boxes and showers, military families that sacrifice so much to serve and protect our country can feel the care, love, compassion and gratitude that they are so deserving of!!! The families left behind are just as important as the soldiers deployed - and this WONDERFUL nonprofit recognizes that on a daily basis!

The passion and attention to detail by Operation Shower truly surprises the recipients and creates a powerful, lasting experience for all attendees.This organization is making a difference in the lives of our military families and I'm extraordinarily proud to support it.

Operation Shower	33212	1	/users/profile/34031	danielle1	Volunteer	5	03/15/2010	This is an organization that serves with heart.  Operation Shower provides a 'hug' in the form of a baby shower - sometimes in person, sometimes in a box - for women who have spouses serving in the mIlitary.  I was blessed enough to have my husband nearby while I was expecting both of my children - I can't imagine being alone.  These families are separated by distance - and yet Operation Shower makes sure these moms are well taken care of.  A simple look at the pictures from any of the showers lets you know these families are being showered with joy at a time when they truly need it.
Operation Shower	33211	1	/users/profile/34029	angela4	Volunteer	5	03/15/2010	I've been honored to work with Operation Shower for the past couple of years. It's an incredible organization that meets a great need -- supporting families who are expecting a baby and have a spouse serving in the military. Operation Shower supports families by giving them much needed baby supplies, and also supports families emotionally by letting the families know that their sacrifice is recognized and appreciated.

I have been apart of Green Works since I was a junior in high school, now I am a freshman in college. In the program I learned the importance of maintaining the environment and I learned new things in that class everyday. I also got to be in a commercial for water quality to educate the community on why not to litter. If it wasn't for Green Works I wouldn't have the experience of interning at an engineering firm called HNTB. Through this internship I got to meet influential members of the community. Like Mayor Sly James, State Representative Randy Dunn,  and Kansas City Area Transportation Authority CEO Joe Reardon. Being apart of this program is a once in a lifetime chance and if I could go back I would have signed up as a freshman.

Green Works in Kansas City	269687		/users/profile/358411	AlexisPetri	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I conducted an evaluation of Green Works (as a volunteer) that used Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to learn from students how participating in Green Works helps them meet their goals.  Students drew maps to show how Green Works programs is leading them to success. They could define their own goals - most were along the lines of going to college or employment - often both. From the students' perspective, Green Works is building their social capital, helping them feel comfortable in work environments, helping them understand how to manage the money they earn through internships, environmental stewardship, and helping them cultivate what they called a service ethic. Green Works makes a big difference in the lives of urban teens and young adults.
Green Works in Kansas City	257885		/users/profile/346357	Writer	Donor	5	09/16/2015	With a pecuniary outlook, I read "Green Works" as a sentence. Green is currency... cash. Nothing motivates like the promise of success and, for most of us, success and monetary payment are one and the same. Green Works strives to connect persons too young to have tasted success with a real paycheck for the first time by doing work that is clearly worthwhile after helping them learn why and how it IS worthwhile. And then helping them stay their course. Is that worth supporting? Or what!
Green Works in Kansas City	257539	2	/users/profile/345978	dfields2012	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2015	I began working with Green Works in 2010 and I really enjoyed every aspect that was covered. From environmental awareness, pollution, to job opportunities and meeting great people to help with furthering career choices, Green Works was a huge help. Not only did I learn so much about preserving the Earth but I was given a mentor with my exact career interest along with summer internshipd. Expanding this program seems ideal because of its great help for teens in the community. Now, at age 21, I still am connected with multiple contacts through Green Works and I love the involvement with such a helpful and educational program. Definitely would recommend others to get into it.
Green Works in Kansas City	257349	1	/users/profile/345754	VCMaull	Client Served	5	09/15/2015	I have two sons who participated in Green Works programming. They learned a lot about the environment and shared what they learned with our family, but also our friends and neighbors. After the solid waste unit they went up and down our street encouraging neighbors to participate in curbside recycling. Now our street is littered with blue bins on trash day!  Along with the environmental knowledge they both gained significant confidence and improved their soft skills during their internships. One of my sons is currently in college, and the other is successfully employed. His employer told me that the internship experience was the reason he got an interview. I am so grateful for the life-changing experiences Green Works provided for my sons!

This program has helped reinforce in her a deeper desire to use our planet and its resources responsibly. The classes were interesting. But the field trips that showed the students what really happens to our trash, the impact of plastic bottles, how delicate our water cycle is is what makes this program so amazing.

Green Works in Kansas City	254073	5	/users/profile/342380	Terri64	Volunteer	5	08/26/2015	I have been involved with Green Works in Kansas City since Kate Corwin founded the agency and I am extremely impressed by how far this small nonprofit has come in eight short years! From the beginning, Kate has placed a priority on establishing programs that will result in tangible outcomes intended to help Green Works participating students learn about the environment AND gain the skills they need to be productive adults - how to create and manage a budget ... how to write a resume and interview for a job ... how to determine what careers are best suited to their interests and talents ... how to conserve water, not litter and maintain this great city we call home ... how to be be interested in the world, to ask questions and become involved.   It is true that Green Works only impacts a small number of students - but that number grows every year - and while the number may be fewer than other well-funded agencies - Green Works commits to working with their students for two years (at a minimunm) and it is this commitment that allows them to produce fabulous results!  Just read some of the students testimonials included here.  Not only does Green Works produce fabulous outcomes, but under Kate's stewardship, they run a financially lean organization.  When you donate to Green Works, you know your dollar is being used prudently to advance the mission.  Many other large funders know it too -  the EPA, Audubon Society, the Shumaker Family Foundation, State Farm, KCP&L, Whole Foods, the United Way and many other organizations that have high standards for their philanthropic dollars.  You can trust your charitable investment to Green Works! I still don't know why more people don't know about this great organization and I hope that by sharing my enthusiasm for Green Works' programs, others will feel compelled to help share the story about this truly great nonprofit.

Green Works does many different engaging programs, so that the young teens can get involved and really help their community in many different ways, such as planting trees along Brush Creek, or weeding out community gardens, so that the community around them can eat from it and be happy. I have learned many different things from this program, such as a more complex and in depth understanding of the many weather cycles of the world, to making and creating my own resume that I will use for my entire life. This program does wonders for those who take the time to participate in it. Green Works can also give you the opportunity to have internships during the summer. I have had two internships so far, and I've really enjoyed both of them quite a bit. The exposure and the connections that you obtain with those internships are really amazing and can help teens become future successful adults. None of this would be possible without Green Works and I truly appreciate this program.

With Green Works Kansas City we have a holistic approach to not only learning, but to the environment, the economy, city government,  the community, the nation and the planet.  Students learn how these forces are all innerrelated, how one effects the other, etc.  This is an education that some wait a lifetime for and these kids are getting it in highschool.  Despite the challenges these kids face, the information is getting in their heads, and it will remain there and they can teach others as well.

Kate Corwin is dedicated to creating meaningful opportunities and mentorships for students.  This visionary program invests in youth in our community by introducing them to mentors, new ideas, and career opportunities related to the environment and sustainability.  Through 2010, Greenworks interns worked at the Metropolitan Energy Center's Project Living Proof demonstration residence.  With the guidance of engineers, landscape architects, and energy professionals, the students installed the initial phase of a Sustainable Sites Initiative pilot landscape.

One important aspect of successful collaboration is the degree of organization, preparedness, and commitment on the part of our partners.   We can always count on Green Works KC's director, Kate Corwin, to plan well, follow through, and be creative,  responsive, and visionary.

Green Works in Kansas City	88659	1	/users/profile/99995	Connie Campbell	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/12/2011	I am highly impressed with the incredible experiential learning and achievement created through Green Works of Kansas City. I served as the formal evaluator of the program. This evaluation was a research study of participating Green Works students compared to their matched peers taking the same science course in their alternative high school in Kansas City, MO. While there were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the pre-test, the Green Works students made highly significant post-test gains, compared to the students in the control group, in science vocabulary and concepts based on Missouri State Standards. Examples of gains are listed below: 1. Acid rain: Droplets containing pollutants that are products of burning coal, other fuels and industry. 1% correct on post-test by control group; 70% correct on post-test by Green Works students completing the ECOS curriculum and hands-on experiences. 2.	Ecosystem: Living things all interacting as a group and with the surroundings in which they live. .05  less than 1% correct control group students; 70% correct Green Works ECOS students. 3.	Environment: The air, water, light and land and their conditions that affect the living things in their surroundings. .06  less than 1% correct control group students; 60% correct - Green Works ECOS students. 4.	Erosion: Eating away of a surface. .06  less than 1% correct - control group students; 40% correct - Green Works  ECOS students. 5.	Humus: Decayed matter that provides nutrients for plants and makes soil able to retain water. .06 - less than 1% correct - control group students; 40% correct - Green Works ECOS students. 6.	Hypoxia zone: An area of oxygen-depleted waters. .03  less than 1% correct - control group students; 70% correct - Green Works ECOS students.  7.	Natural resource: Materials from the earth like timber, fresh water, coal or oil that have economic value. 12% correct- control group students; 70% correct - Green Works ECOS students.  8.	Organism: Individual forms of life and living things, such as plants, animals, bacteria, or fungus. 16% correct - control group students; 70% Green Works ECOS students.  9.	Soil compaction: Land in which the air and water is squeezed out through pollution and development. .05  less than 1% correct- control group students; 40% correct - Green Works ECOS students.  10.	Watershed: The specific land area that drains water into a river system or other body of water. 12% correct - control group students; 70% correct - Green Works ECOS students. 11.

Green Works in Kansas City	84983	1	/users/profile/94509	Lisa H.	Advisor	5	04/07/2011	Kate Corwin, Founder and President has done an outstanding job of bringing her business expertise and entrepreneurial vision to Green Works. Green Works has grown and thrived in a very difficult economic period through Kate's leadership, partner/funder development, and her consistent physical energy and presence.  Green Works has done a terrific service to the Kansas City community by being an integral part in turning around the lives of some of Kansas City's most "at risk" youth by providing them guidance, structure, encouragement, education, and skills they can put to work as they mature into positive, confident, and optimistic adults. Kate has personally invested considerable extra time and effort to ensure the programs offered provide significant learning and hands-on experience for the students. The only issues that I have witnessed relate directly to having enough funds, materials and volunteers to assist Kate in implementing programs.  The students often need rides, may not have gloves - necessary for working outside in the fall, etc. 
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	155377		/users/profile/116506	Jrobin	Board Member	5	04/19/2013	The Peace Center teaches young people concepts of peace and shows practical ways to implement them into their lives.  All this is done through fun, hands-on activities which tends to be internalized more than lecturing alone.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	115995		/users/profile/116506	Jrobin	Board Member	5	06/21/2012	This is an amazing hands-on experience for children.  It is mobile so can go to many different types of venues to reach many children in various settings.  The hands-on exhibits teach children basic peace enhancing skills in 4 main areas.  Children love to "play" with the activities, while the peace lesson is being reinforced.  Children understanding peace concepts at an early age  will have a positive impact as they grow up, in their own lives and the lives of others.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	98146		/users/profile/116506	Jrobin	Board Member	5	09/26/2011	I have been involved with the Children's Peace Center because I believe strongly in its mission.  If children learn about peace in a fun, hands-on way, it is more effective thn a lecture.  The greater the reach, the greater the impact.

Children learn teamwork and the importance of respect, discipline, and kindness in creating a cooperative world. Their programs are fun, informative, and thought provoking. I'm proud to be part of this organization.

A traveling museum, the Children's PEACE Center is an excellent teaching tool. Individual classrooms and entire schools can  benefit from a visit to the Peace Mobile. 
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	97939		/users/profile/70752	Caroline	Volunteer	5	09/22/2011	I have worked with the Peace Center for two years as a volunteer. This organization has an extremely dedicated group of people. Their Peacemobile is a wonderful way to provide students with hands-on experience in peace-building and the staff of volunteers is knowledgeable and well-trained. They love to bring the Peacemobile to schools and towns where they can offer a variety of materials to teach young people how to peacefully resolve conflict, how to respect each other, how to embrace differences, and how to empower themselves through self-esteem. Their programs are fun, interactive, inspiring, and successful!

They've helped our high school youth develop peace-related service projects over the past couple years.  Now, this year we've been able to invite them to facilitate workshops on listening and conflict resolution with our K-5th grade students.  Our youth loved the fun and interactive activities, and we appreciated the help with teaching them to be kinder, more peaceful leaders!
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	116011		/users/profile/157957	aguckert	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2012	I am intrigued by this effort to teach children to solve conflicts peacefully.  The Children's PEACE Movement mobile classroom is a delightful place to engage in various activities that demonstrate how much better it is to cooperate than to "fight."  I enjoyed weaving a strip of fabric to contribute to others efforts to create a woven blanket.I am impressed with Andria Melham, who also carries out these principles in her own life, demonstrating the benefits of not responding to situations in anger.  Mary Beth Jones, in her book," Jesus CEO" makes one of the most profound statements I have ever heard - "NO ONE WINS UNTIL WE ALL DO!"  If anyone is "losing" then no one has "won." How many events in our world today demonstrate the truth of this statement? How much more we could accomplish if some people were not involved in the useless pursuit of making other people losers?  Children's PEACE Movement, as it teaches children to solve problems without conflict is contributing to improving the future of our world.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	116008		/users/profile/157952	Natalie W.	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	With the Children's Peace Center I got to do what I live most, work with children. I found out about out through this mentoring program I was working with in high school. Ms. Melham came to talk with our students. I really enjoyed the presentation so I hopped on board. A traveling children's museum, what an awsome idea. The program teaches peacemaking skills and helps develop good character traits through Character Education, bully and violence prevention. Their is a traveling Outreach program that goes to public and private schools, homeschools, Day camps, churches, camps, etc. or through Field Trips. Included are fun, hands-on interactive exhibits, activity sheets, arts and crafts, discovery workshops, puppets, and storytelling activities that help children learn alternatives to violence, respect for each other and themselves, and how to enrich their own community and see the beauty of different cultures around them. I have learned so much while working with the programs and I spread the knowledge that I have gained every day.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	116002		/users/profile/157944	Cindy31	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	I have volunteered to assist on several occasions when the Children's Peace Center was available to the community and I am always amazed at how the activities provided help children in so many ways.  It helps with their self-esteem, with knowledge about our environment and how to take care of it, conflict resolution and becoming a peacemaker in their families and communities.   It is a wonderful organization and should be duplicated all over the world!
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	115959		/users/profile/67358	Andria M.	Board Member	5	06/20/2012	I've been involved with this since it' s inception.  As the President and Director I've seen many lives changed as we taught the programs on making better choices, learning to control emotions, getting along with others, conflict resolution, understanding different cultures and our place on the planet.  I've witnessed a boy change from a rowdy youngster that was tearing everything up to a proud mentor of younger children helping them learn what he learned.  I've seen parents learn to communicate better with their children and both learned to listen more effectively to each other.  I've seen CEO's decide they needed to listen more and talk less to their employees.  I've been thrilled when the young children tell others what they learned in the peace centers.  We've been proud to have reached thousands of children and seen lives changed and thought processes change for the positive.  We do this to touch lives, change attitudes and create a more peaceful future for children and families.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	61671		/users/profile/67358	Andria M.	Board Member	5	01/29/2011	I'm biased as I'm the Executive Director. But I've seen so many lives changed by the programs presented and the way they help children learn to work together, see that they can resolve their own conflicts, how to avoid bullies and make better life choices.  I've seen children that were tagged "the bad kids" work together and learn that teamwork is much more fun than being a bully.  I've seen tears and anger turn into smiles and better attitudes just by playing these creative "games" which teach good life skills and being allowed to discuss things and be listened to.  The learning centers are all hands-on, interactive activities that allow children to practice and learn to think things through.  While they may be using puppets, drama, crafts, drawing, desiging, and building things, they all teach some sort of peacemaking skills such as communication, conflict resolution, taking care of yourself, building self esteem, working together, enhancing good character traits, understanding ecology and how things all work together as well as understanding different cultures.   These programs have been used in schools, Homeschool groups, churches, camps, Day camps, After School programs, and special events.  We operate these programs with lots of volunteers willing to take the required training and with many donations.  We try to provide the programs especially to Title One Schools (low income, high risk) free or at greatly reduced fees if we have the donations or grants available to cover the basic expenses.  Because we are an all volunteer organization, our costs are minimal which allows almost all donations to be used directly to provide programs for the children.  The programs are brought to the location to save expenses for the participants.  Many events are done for free just so the message can be shared with the elementary aged children and their families.  As with most non-profits, the lack of funds does not allow the expansion of services that is desired and does not allow the future dream of a permanent peace center where all can come to learn to be a reality.  We also lack regular volunteers that can be on-call.  But the full time volunteer staff are all very dedicated and willing to work out whatever problems comes up in order to provide the programs when requested. As I've worked with these programs and shared with the children I think I have learned much more than the pariticpants.  One second grade girl stated "I learned that if you work as a team, you can have fun and learn a lot, even if you don't like the people you are with."  I have learned that same concept along the way too.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all grasp that concept?  I think the Children's PEACE Center has the basic answers for all of us to learn to get along more and communicate better.  I've really enjoyed presenting these programs since 1996.  We've had the opportunity to present them in locations from Florida to Canada and have helped other groups start similar programs.  I've been asked if I didn't want to do something different and I can't image doing anything else.  Helping children learn to think things through and seeing them make better life choices, avoiding drugs, alchohol and damaging behaviors, has to be the greatest reward anyone receive.  Building up our future leaders as kind, thoughtful and able to manage emotions and conflicts is the only way I can see that we'll have peaceful lives.
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	115957		/users/profile/157890	PeaceMaker	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	I volunteered and donated to the Children's Peace Center many times.  It provides a very unique hands-on interactive fun time for children of all ages (6-80+) to learn about ways to make a difference in the world.    It was my experience that everyone leaving the center, volunteers and children alike were amazed at what they learned about ways to resolve conflicts, manage their own emotions and take responsibility for their own actions.  One of the best parts of the Children's Peace Center is that you don't have to go to it....it comes to you, providing the capability to be used in many different environments, such as camps, schools, festivals, and churches.  If you are looking for a way to teach  children about bullying and how to deal with it, the Children's Peace Center could be your answer. 
Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	115953	1	/users/profile/157884	Kay M.	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	My belief is that God has plans for some to fulfill while on earth to bring peace and happiness to children and families. The Peace Center was begun with a dream to reach out and teach children -who would share the peace and love taught to them, to others-family, friends, school buddies; to intercede in conflicts-to teach by example the lessons learned in this wonderful tool, the Peace "Mobile" Center.  Many children have no roll models because of the broken homes, some with drug addiction, physical abuse, illness....single parents who are not more than children themselves-they learn what they live with and think that cruelty, greed, speed and theft are normal. My hope for the Peace Center who bless children and families, that there will be many volunteers to GROW  this program all over the US, and into other countries.  Peace...If our children learn peace and peaceful means of interaction, they will grow to be peace loving adults who will lead this country with humility, peace and strength of character.  A program such as this MUST be supported to survive -by  helping hands and funds to enlarge and improve the program with new equipment and teaching tools.  Respectfully, Kay Miller  of

I have seen a positive impact on children's lives. Adults that almost accidentally became aware of the activities and tried that were also changed. I have seen old computers that I thought needed to just be recycled used as interactive activities that children wanted to use. The mix of high tech and high touch attracts all children including many who could be classified as "disadvantaged" as well as those with "many advantages". Involving and interacting with each child is done very well. Conflict resolution activities that anyone can understand and apply has changed those that I have personally observed. I know that any funds and support will be used wisely and well. Marvin C. Beadnall, P.E.

Children have the chance to explore feelings, not only their own, but also other's feelings.  They can practice communication skills with blocks, learn how to say PEACE in different languages, work with others on bridge building, acting out resolutions to everyday conflicts and many other activities which promote peace.

It is ALWAYS a great experience for children and volunteers alike.  The use of art just enhances the experience of each child.

Childrens Peace Education and Community Enrichment Center	61828		/users/profile/67555	Crystal Force	Client Served	4	01/31/2011	The Peace Mobile served our school, King Springs Elementary, for 5 years and our teachers' comments showed that teachers found this one of the most worthwhile programs ever brought to our school.  It was full of hands-on experiences which provided creative opportunites.  The children made masks to show their feelings, designed flags for world peace, published their own Peace books, created wonderful imaginative objects out of recycled materials..and so much more.all for peacemaking through the arts.The children were excited about the Peace Mobile each time it came, even though we had it several years in succession.  We actually gave a pre and post test to kids one year to measure the effectiveness of the program and found that it raised awareness of their actions to a very large extent.  The children became more aware of their words and actions, of new and better ways to handle their emotions, and became aware of the extent to which their actions (either peaceful or not peaceful) affect their world.  We have hoped for a permanent housing of the Peace Center since our school was no longer able to set up the exhibits in our media center with our growth and new media projects which took precedence.  We have been waiting to hear that the Peace Center could welcome us to "their house" since we were physically no longer able to welcome them to ours.  We love you, Peace Center!

This organization's activities have great worth for the communities which have experienced any of the varied programs.  Art is a wonderful means of self expression.  Often a child/person can freely share emotions through art that may be difficult to impossible to express any other way.I personally give thank for the work done by the Childrens Peace Center and look forward to many more people being blessed through it.

Corporate America Supports You	259995	2	/users/profile/348528	NBarter	Volunteer	5	09/28/2015	I am a veteran and currently a military spouse too.  After being at our mid-west duty station for one-year, I decided to start my job search.  I found out about and registered for CASYs services. I was quickly connected with an employment specialist who gave feedback on my resume and identified job listings in my region that I might be interested in.  However most of the jobs required a large degree of travel which wasnt an option for me due to adverse winter weather conditions in our area.  Although I had over 5 years experience in instructional design, there wasnt a great deal of job openings in that field in the city that we lived in.  At that point, my employment specialist mentioned that CASY had a Career Corps Volunteer Program that provided mentorship, training and work experience related to my field.  I applied, and I was accepted as a Volunteer Trainer.  My mentor provides me with opportunities that utilize and keep my skills current.  I am able to submit articles providing tips for veterans and military spouses searching for employment that are published in the organizations, Military Service Employment Journal.  I am granted access to software where I am able to design eLearning courses that are utilized and made available to job seekers through the organizations free, online training modules.

Corporate America Supports You	259801	2	/users/profile/348328	Hayparker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/26/2015	CASY/MSCCN is a phenomenal organization to receive employment assistance from AND also to be employed by! Their support is invaluable and it works! Personally, as a military spouse, I sought them out while seeking employment at our new duty station, I choose to volunteer for them, while I was seeking employment as a means to stay active, gain education in a different field and to hopefully fill that "resume gap"... My volunteer position led to an employment offer from CASY/MSCCN! AND, my position allows ME to offer support to other military spouses, vets and transitioning military who are in the same position! CASY/MSCCN was created from a deep passion to give back, help others and do good things...It is refreshing to know that there is actually an employer/organization that is also passionate about wanting those same things for their employees!

Working with them from beginning to the end ultimately resulted in finding employment. During this process I also took advantage of the free online training classes CASY/MSCCN has to offer. I can't thank CASY/MSCCN and my Employment Specialist enough for assisting me during this life changing event.
Corporate America Supports You	259704		/users/profile/348222	cfriel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/25/2015	I did not grow up in a military family and I barely knew anyone who was in the military except for older relatives who rarely talked about their experience. So when I married my husband I didn't think about how his being in the military would influence what I did with my career.  I searched for nearly 9 months before moving to be with him with not even a single call back. I decided to move without a job and spent another 3 months and the only position I could get was cleaning part time even with years of experience and my BA. After speaking to other military spouse they all had the same issues, a company sees a bunch of different cities on our resume or find out we moved because our spouse got new orders. They get concerned that if they hire us there is no guarantee that we will be able to stay there for a long time. I could see it in the interviewers face when they find out I am a military spouse. The look that show they've lost interest and it was heartbreaking. I was so happy that I found CASY&MSCCN. I started volunteering and am now working with the organization.  This organization is made up of the most amazing people who give their all everyday to help as many people in our military family as they can. I am proud to be a part of this amazing organization.

I grew up in a military family, in a military town and it was always instilled in me to help our own, to give back. I can not begin to explain how passionate I am about this program and what it does for our 'military family'. I am so proud and honored to be a part of an organization that truly puts the service member and their spouses first. From preparing them for their search, walking with them on their career journey, to being able to hear the excitement, joy, and thanks in their voices when they are offered a position, is something I think we all strive for. It's been a truly humbling experience and I am so blessed to be on this team.

I register and love the idea of having all this resources for free and not limited to Veterans. Military Spouses left soo much behind to support their family. Relocating and finding a job is always overwhelming and here you can get assistance and support during your job search. One on one also makes a huge difference.  MSCCN is my first recomendation when someone reach out for help and assistance with their job search.

As a veteran and independent contractor I find that this nonprofit organization does what it claim it does. They aggressively engaged in the success of that mission.  Tools and management systems are being touched daily to ensure success.  Brainstorming sessions are conducted weekly with best practices discussed and clarified.  Veterans that are being assisted are expressing a sincere gratitude for the CASY career assessment, resume review and interview consultation and other job search tips being shared.  The tools and resources provided are valuable in securing and assisting these veterans.  Hot jobs and job boards are available 24/7.

What I found was a lot of lip service.  In an effort to make a difference I found employment with DoD and Non-profit organizations that made that same claim, but all fell short of their promise.  CASY has not only lived up to their promise, but has regularly found ways to exceed expectations by expanding services and partnering companies and educational institutions to bring new training and  employment opportunities to our Veterans.

Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	211815	1	/users/profile/274757	osmanajliridona,	General Member of the Public	5	08/22/2014	Coming from a family led by a single woman, I am one of those people who can confirm the need for an organization that aims to to empower women by engaging them in revenue generating activities using local resources. What's more, this organization targets women in more rural areas, and areas harder to reach - which I am assuming - are places where this women do not get much support from other bigger organizations. Also, the founder of this organization has been in those areas and knows the women's real needs - while some other organizations try to help in some areas that are not really as needed. Lastly, knowing the founder of this organization personally, I can guarantee that the money, help & support that goes to this organization will be fully & only used to advance the lives of disadvantaged women. 
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	286783		/users/profile/376853	Colleen_F	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Yang-Ward Foundation is a Missouri based Non-Profit organization which seeks to empower single women in rural areas by engaging them in revenue generating activities such as cash crop production, goat-farming, poultry farming and so on. These women are provided with leased land for cash-crop production, seed money and technical support while foundation staff, volunteers and partnered schools provide guidance and support. The income from these proceeds pays workers a generous wage and parts of the proceeds are used for giving scholarships to underprivileged girls. Similarly, Yang-Ward Foundation also donates library books to local schools where thousands of students are benefiting from these generous donations.How Did I know About Yang-Ward Foundation?I got to know about Nepal through Yangmali Sahadev Rai (who was working as my student worker in undergraduate college), Founder and President of Yang-Ward Foundation. Being an American who has never been to any Asian countries,  I didnt know about the situation of single women in Nepal. I got to know that rural Nepal has nearly half a million impoverished single women, many widowed and abandoned during the civil war. These single women and their children become outcasts in their local communities, no longer supported by ex- husbands families, struggling to survive, and barely able to feed themselves and their children, much less send those children to school. This was something that really touched my heart and I wanted to help.When was the First Time I gave To Yang-Ward Foundation?Yangmali implemented his first project in rural Nepal right after getting his seed funding from the Resolution Project, in partnership with The Clinton Global Initiative. When he came back after spending 2 months implementing the project, I was blown away by their work in that area. Within 9 months, his project was becoming self-sustainable. I was blown away by the transformation of the land before and after his project, and the freshly grown organic vegetables. The hard work and dedication of Yangmali and his team was very clear. I got to know that because of his successful pilot project, people from other parts of the country were requesting him to expand the project. Since he didnt have money to implement other projects, he ran a online crowd-funding campaign with indiegogo in 2013.  That is my first donation to Yang-Ward Foundation because I believed in his work, someone I could entirely trust with my donation as well as I was convinced how my small donation could transform the lives of single women who are the victims of constant discrimination.Now Yang-Ward Foundation has expanded its projects in different parts of Nepal. From cash-crop production to poultry farming and goat farming projects to help single women who were severely affected by disastrous recent earthquakes in Nepal, the work of the Yang-Ward Foundation is highly commendable. The change in the lives of single women in terms of their economic power is amazing.  They are making 5 times their previous salary, working 5 hours a day 5 days a week, compared to 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Now Yang-Ward Foundation is giving away 5 full scholarships to underprivileged girls in rural areas. Because of the change in economic power of these single women, local peoples perceptions about the single women are changing. What This 5000 Prize money would do?A $5,000 prize means one more project for Yang-Ward Foundation in rural Nepal, empowering single women. This project will change the lives of single women.  This project  seeks to turn these outcasts into valued contributors to their communities by achieving three key goals: 1) engaging these women in revenue generating agricultural activities that give them financial independence so they can feed and house themselves and their children, 2) achieving sustainability in which their activities can continue without added external funding, and 3) making significant contributions to improving education in local schools through donating books, scholarships, and equipment to school libraries and computer labs.

Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	273112	1	/users/profile/362302	Emilio U.	General Member of the Public	5	11/30/2015	I've known closely the work of Yang Ward Foundation for about two years now. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with them in fundraising events and develop a close relation with its members. In the time I've shared with them, I acknowledged their devotion for service and for helping, their commitment to leave this a better world than what they found, this makes them a very special group of people that work with passion for their causes.The labour they have done in Nepal has empowered many women through production. Giving them tools not only to sustain themselves and their families but also to effectively exercise their rights on places on which the action of governments has been limited. Moreover I know the passion these people have for serving others and as such Yang Ward Foundation is a non-profit that truly deserves all the support they can get, as the work they perform is actually effective on the field, were people need it to be, and not only on board meetings.
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	273111	1	/users/profile/362301	Writer	Donor	5	11/30/2015	Yangward's  a great initiative that empowers women-in-need in developing countries. Since contributing to their campaigns, I've received constant updates with respect to how the funds are utilised to empower sustainable farming programmes for women in Nepal.
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	273103	1	/users/profile/362290	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/30/2015	I heard about this organization through one of my friends who did a fund raising event for this organization. What I was mostly surprised with was, total proceeds goes to the beneficiary and how within a short period of its inception, it is making a huge difference in single women's lives. 
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	273069	1	/users/profile/362254	KWS44	Donor	5	11/29/2015	Yang-Ward Foundation is continuously taking on new projects and adapting to meet current needs in the populations it serves. Designed to empower single women in rural areas, I have seen it do significant good through its farm projects, particularly its goat farming projects, and its educational initiatives to bring more educational resources to rural schools. The 2 things that keep me donating to this nonprofit are its emphasis on sustainability and its direct work on the ground. Its projects are designed to be sustainable so that improvement in the living standards of the women who are part of the projects does not permanently depend on external support,  as the participants are able to maintain and grow the initial farming projects themselves. I am also confident that when I donate to the foundation, the money reaches the people on the ground. When Nepal was struck by devastating earthquakes, the organization quickly responded with an effort to mobilize aid and supplies. Rather than being deterred by the loss of progress on some of its earlier projects due to the disaster, it adapted and reached out to people to find out what they needed in the short-term to recover. There is a great deal of transparency surrounding their work, so it is always clear what donations have paid for, whether it is farming equipment, educational equipment, laptops, or earthquake relief  supplies. As someone who studies non-profits and knows the many ways they can become politicized and bureaucratized, I see this organization as a refreshing reminder of the good that can come from using networks to mobilize support and implementing simple projects that can improve peoples' lives in meaningful ways.
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	211815	1	/users/profile/274757	osmanajliridona,	General Member of the Public	5	08/22/2014	Coming from a family led by a single woman, I am one of those people who can confirm the need for an organization that aims to to empower women by engaging them in revenue generating activities using local resources. What's more, this organization targets women in more rural areas, and areas harder to reach - which I am assuming - are places where this women do not get much support from other bigger organizations. Also, the founder of this organization has been in those areas and knows the women's real needs - while some other organizations try to help in some areas that are not really as needed. Lastly, knowing the founder of this organization personally, I can guarantee that the money, help & support that goes to this organization will be fully & only used to advance the lives of disadvantaged women. 
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	273061	1	/users/profile/362247	Niraj	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2015	Yang-Ward Foundation's grassroots movement of empowering single women is praiseworthy. Financial independence of single women to establishing a scholarship for underprivileged girl student in rural Nepal is making a differences in so many level. Yang-Ward Foundation's effective role in distributing relief aid to earthquake victims in Nepal was also something that really impressed me.

Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	211640		/users/profile/274564	Chastity A.	Volunteer	5	08/21/2014	My experience working with the Yang-Ward Foundation to say the least was absolutely phenomenal. I found out about the Yang-Ward Foundation through a service learning project. I was inspired by the message of empowering women by giving them the tools needed to survive. On a more personal note, I was raised in a single parent household. When my mother could not find work times were very hard; she would be stressed out constantly thinking about where the next meal would come from. I believe through this foundation Yangmali has found a way to relieve the same stress off of the women of Nepal. 
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	211625		/users/profile/274548	Shree Raj S.	Volunteer	5	08/21/2014	Coming from Nepal and having experienced the repercussions of the 10 years long civil war first hand, I feel YangWard Foundation comes in as a boon to the single women who are still suffering from the devastation of the war that ended almost 8 years ago. The women on both sides who lost their bread winners in the war are still stigmatized by the patriarchal Nepalese culture that inhibits them economically and socially. YangWard Foundation empowers these women form the roots, providing them social mobility and by empowering the educational infrastructures by building libraries and establishing scholarship funds for the needy. Furthermore, by harnessing the capacity of agriculture (Nepal is about 75 percent agricultural economy) itself, I believe YangWard Foundation will continue on empowering single women in warn-torn Nepalese societies and I will keep on supporting YangWard Foundation for its efforts.
Yang-Ward Foundation, Inc.	211464		/users/profile/274391	Shahil S.

The Yang-Ward Foundation is paving the way for a new Nepal, and is an organization to follow closely.

Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council	302380		/users/profile/393510	wonderfulneighbors	General Member of the Public	5	09/02/2016	First of all, I have enjoyed being an ordained clergy serving at Gregg Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Ivanhoe community since September 15, 2013.   My relationship goes back in the 90s when I was an associate pastor serving at Gregg Tabernacle while pastoring in rural Missouri on alternate Sundays, and the Alan and Yolanda Young and others were starting INC backup again. Nevertheless, there are so many things I could capture as a benefactor of this dynamic neighborhood group. I know space is limited so I will be brief. Our church's educational building third floor windows had been boarded up for nearly 40 years. The thirty-six windows' condition gave no life to the area, it looked like blighted property. I was invited to a Faith Leadership Breakfast May 2014  by Margaret May; several clergy persons from different faith groups and business leaders were in attendance. I met a contractor who rehab houses, and I shared my situation. He became compassion about the vision, and was sold on the ideal. Our congregation raised money for each side of the building, our new partner donated the labor for the installation of all 36 windows. The project took seven months to complete, and just in time for regional Conference; we were called upon to host of 54 sister churches. Another project that will have a major impact on the community is the installation of the internet system. Our church was selected to help train young men and women on installing a WIFI network that the community will be able to gain access to the internet. These individuals installed the wiring under the leadership of Harrison May of W.E.B. Dubois Learning Center, and they also donated three computers with more on the way. These computers will help give the residents and church members access to the internet:check emails, job search, electronic business activity, the list goes on and on! Also, our site will be the hub for others with 3 to 5 block radius for the residents in the community to gain access to the internet once the satelitte is affixed on top the building. There are so many things we can say about our partnership with INC. The bottom-line is the faith community must invest in the neighborhood to make it a better place to live!   --Dr. Eraina M.

Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council	262038		/users/profile/350698	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2015	I was asked to assist the Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council with a gardening project.  Through my involvement I have found the INC to be staffed by dedicated, compassionate, and creative individuals who work hard to serve the community.  Ivanhoe faces challenges like many older, urban core neighborhoods, ranging from food access to vacant lots, yet the INC staff approach these challenges as opportunities to start new initiatives that make a difference in people's lives.  A vacant lot becomes a community garden; edible landscaping on the property contributes healthy produce to their farmer's market; a weed infested garden becomes an opportunity to hire a resident and turn an eyesore into beauty.  Their creativity and dedication is amazing.  A great organization with wonderful people.

My little boy has cerebral palsy and the doors to independence that have been opened for him as a result of St. Louis Variety have been so invaluable and have allowed him become a confident and happy little boy.

Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis	249480	1	/users/profile/337301	ReneeFerrier	Client Served	5	07/23/2015	I am 25 years old, and I have daughter who just turned 5 years old. In 2013 myself, my fiance , and my daughter were hit head on by a driver who was allegedly under the influence. This caused my daughter to have a traumatic brain injury and be diagnosed with ataxia. Since the accident recovery, she has become so determined to get back to where she was before the accident. She has to wear leg braces to help her balance and walk properly. When she out grew the ones the insurance paid for... the insurance would not cover for a new pair due to the short time she out grew the first ones. Unfortunately, I had no money to provide to out pocket for my daughter to walk properly... I searched everywhere trying to find a solution so that she could get the braces that were a necessity for her. I feel so stuck because everyone wanted to help but had no resources to.  My daughters Physical therapist heard great things about variety and referred me to them. I contacted them and within a short time (about 2-3 weeks) my daughter had the doctors appointment to get the braces fitted and paid for. Variety provided all costs for her braces. No words could describe how appreciative and thankful that variety could help my daughter! I hope anybody out there struggling to find help like my family was, could be referred to by variety.  They truly are amazing!

Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis	187620		/users/profile/244650	ncvehige	Client Served	5	11/02/2013	As parents to two children with special needs, we are determined to provide our children with the best that life has to offer, despite their disabilities.  When the needs of our children became financially challenging, we reached out to Variety.  Our youngest needed a walker and orthotics were required for both children and were provided immediately by Variety.  Our children desperately wanted bikes, but were unable to ride the traditional ones.  Variety was able to provide both of our children with therapeutic bikes, custom-fitted to their unique abilities.  Our children have also attended Variety Adventure Camp and always have the time of their lives.  With their intense therapies and doctor appointments consuming most of their days, it is wonderful that Variety can help our children experience a more typical childhood summer.  We thank God that Variety is able and willing to help us in so many ways. We are unsure what the future entails and get overwhelmed when thinking about it, but we take great comfort in knowing that Variety will be there when we need them.
Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis	184281		/users/profile/241219	Meper4m	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	I've been an actor in two of Variety's productions.  It is one of the most rewarding experiences I could ask for.  It is wonderful to see children of all abilities get to participate and grow as individuals and to work together towards a goal. It's a fun experience for all and kids who participate are being taught valuable life lessons that they're not even aware of.  Children who are not disabled are taught compassion and perhaps working with the Variety kids might make them want to pursue a career in special education or the medical or social work.  The Variety kids get to be kids; treated like anyone else with the same expectations to do their very best.   It is an excellent rehearsal environment.  The Variety staff and the artistic staff work very hard to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and kindness while maintaining the necessary focus to mount their amazing productions.  The staff also has high expectation of everyone in rehearsal and the kids always rise to the occasion and meet the challenge.   Variety has been a valuable organization in the St. Louis community for decades and I know with the dedication of the staff and help from the community will continue to be a wonderful asset.

We didn't have the extra money to cover what insurance would not. We didn't know what we were going to do! I met a mom with a child in a chair at a fair. She told me about Variety, and gave me the number for Diane. Diane was so gracious and helpful. Variety covered what we couldn't. Then we learned that Variety not only helps with equipment, but many other things too.  My son was invited to an adventure camp put on by Variety. It was wonderful!  They do these camps to provide opportunities for children who otherwise would not be able to go to camp because of their limited abilities.  These camps are helpful in building self esteem and to teach these children they can be a productive member of society.  They also learn there are others out there with similar challenges.

Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis	93850		/users/profile/108227	Tapera T.	General Member of the Public	5	07/13/2011	When my nephew Daunte was born, we made a decision as a family that we would do everything we could to prevent him from being limited by Spina bifida.  We knew he was going to have a long, hard road ahead of him, but we were committed to allowing Daunte to thrive just like all of his siblings.  We had no idea how expensive therapies and equipment to allow him the most basic functions, such as mobility, would be.  Variety Club has stepped up every time Daunte has needed equipment as he has grown.  Daunte rides his bike to the park with his brothers and cousins, speeds through the house in his little quickie, and even goes shopping and runs errands with me in his full sized chair.  By being able to get around with other kids, Daunte has the confidence to go anywhere and play with any child.  That confidence and independence is something that was given to him by not just his family, but in large part due to Variety Club.  We cannot thank this charity enough for allowing my nephew to be the outgoing, confident little man he now is.

Early intervention was called in to assist us in whatever he needed, they got Variety Club involved with us and they have helped out tremendously. They supplied equipment that he needed for the past 4 years. Anytime we need something all we I have to do is call Diane at Variety and she takes care of us. We could not have made it without their assistance. I am so proud of Variety I have recommended them to several people I know with handicapped children and they are thrilled.

Birthday, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  He was later diagnosed with an immune deficiency, a monogenic form of diabetes, low tone cerebral palsy, and kidney disease.  After extensive and ongoing physical therapy, it was decided that Alex would benefit greatly from leg braces.  Our medical insurance had other thoughts on this though.  I shouldn't have been surprised, they have declined everything on Alex..including his cancer treatments.  However, we were introduced to the Variety Club and because of them, a whole new world has been introduced to Alex.  With his leg braces, he can be a kid.  Before them, he couldn't hardly walk without falling over.  We were in the ER every 2 wks. getting stitches from him falling and splitting his head open.  This last December, Alex received a bike that was made specifically for him.  To watch that little boy ride a bike brings tears of joy to my eyes every time.  He is so proud of his new bike and the accomplishments that he has made.Having a child with on going medical needs is very hard on a family physically, emotionally, and financially!  If it wasn't for the Variety Club, Alex wouldn't have made near the accomplishments that he has made.  Because of them, a whole new world has been opened up to him and he get's to be that little boy that he so badly wants and deserves to be.  Our family will always be extremely grateful for the Variety Club ;)

The expenses a family has with a disabled child are enormous.  Variety stepped in right away and made sure Robbie got what he needed and has made our life much easier.  The outings we go on and their camps are wonderful because Handicapped children don't have friends to hang out with like regular kids.

Very much admire the methods Project Las Americas takes in their programs.  The design and execution of the safe water interventions is unprecedented in sustainability, the BioSand filters are great in longevity, but the trick is awareness to the point of acceptance.  The education of community leaders that then pass on their knowledge to their communities is a fascinating approach as it becomes an inside intervention.  I applaud their stewardship of funds to produce low cost, high impact projects and the additional focus on education and empowerment.  The womens group and their little sisters clubs have so much potential for change.  Keep up the great work look forward to collaborating with you again!

With PLA's help, I was able to secure over 60 concrete bio sand filters to distribute throughout the communities within I work. PLA partnered with myself and a local NGO, Agrega tu Luz to execute an educational campaign about these filters in impoverished communities along the Haitian-Dominican border. We ended up distributing filters throughout 5 communities. Additionally, I helped promote the bio sand filters across the country resulting in several other Peace Corps Volunteers implementing bio sand filter projects in their communities as well. Project Las Americas was professional, prompt, and courteous throughout the process. They are an excellent organization to work with.

Bob met me at the airport and drove me around for the next few days showing all of the projects he was involved with. Introducing me to those who were taking their ideas and making them realities, with Bobs help. I was impressed with how Bob would help take  an idea that just needed a little help and give it a lift up to the next level.  He took an approach of engaging the community around the project, getting their direct involvement. The thinking was a community that really believes in something will have a larger impact than just providing money. Empowerment over charity. Education and clean water has been his emphasis since I have known about the group. I was fortunate enough to then take another trip with him to the school in Haiti. The needs there are enormous but with his steady hand I am confident that Bob and Caliph will have an impact on that village for many years.

Project Las Americas	182173	2	/users/profile/238940	Ismail M.	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I am new to the volunteer position, and I was new to traveling outside of the United States. I will say that this organization was very helpful in getting me oriented in the Dominican Republic. This organization has a good idea about empowering the community and not just coming in and just building a house and being done with it. Robert Hildreth was a great help and learning the history of how he started up the business was inspiring to me and changed the way I view life and the importance of my education. I really enjoyed the fact that this organization works with local organizations such as the one started by Sandra Tineo to aid the community of Nuevo Renacer, also previously known as Aguas Negras. I didn't do much outside of Puerto Plata in the barrio Nuevo Renacer but it was definitely an experience and I would not change anything about it because the work that is done within the community I think has been changing not only the well-being of the community but also the mindset of people. I don't know how much of an influence that I made during my time there but I know that I hope to come back one day because the community there on the outskirts of Puerto Plata deserves it. Also I had learned much about NGOs and non-profits but in my own opinion I think the work that is being done not just "for" the community but "with" the community is amazing and I hope I will get a chance to work with them again. Also in this video you can see and hear a better description of the conditions and some of the work done by Sandra Tineo with the help of Project Las Americas. I watched this video and it surprised me how much had changed and it had only been a year. I didn't make the video this is another person's video and I am only adding it to give a perspective on where I volunteered

Project Las Americas	180413	4	/users/profile/237094	KatiPCV	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I am a currently-serving Peace Corps education volunteer in a poor barrio of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. PLA's support (both financially and organizationally) has been absolutely critical to the success of my project. With their help, I have constructed and stocked a library, established a childhood literacy program amongst the local youth, and organized and run a teacher-training conference. They also are the principal source of funds for one of the elementary-level schools I work with, and have provided school supplies, computers, and the actual school building. In my personal dealings with the staff, they have always been professional, well-organized, responsible, friendly, and honest. Thanks to PLA, the children of our barrio have a chance at bettering their lives that they never would have had otherwise.
Project Las Americas	179915	7	/users/profile/236562	Terry A.	Donor	5	10/19/2013	I first became acquainted with Project Las Americas and Bob Hildreth in 2004 on my first trip to the Dominican Republic with the Rotary District 6360 Childrens Safe Water Project.  Since that time our Michigan-based Project has partnered with PLA and Bob on a number of projects and matching grants in several areas.  My wife and I have made numerous trips to the DR to review project work, and have found Bobs approach to helping people to find ways to change their life situations to be realistic and very successful.  Everything done has been very transparent and truly oriented to what the recipients determine that they need and want.  Bobs ability to get people to take ownership for their own solutions is very refreshing. We have made several personal contributions to PLA for specific projects, and my wife and I have found that we would trust Bob Hildreth with our personal checkbooks.  As a District Governor for Rotary this year, I am helping to get several Clubs aligned with PLA so that they can undertake signature international projects in the DR specific to their members particular interests.  I have no reservations about recommending PLA and Bob Hildreth to anyone looking for a partner in humanitarian projects, or considering a donation to PLA.

We have been involved in many grants together to advance safe water.  Over the years we have helped with funding for a variety of projects beyond safe water.  Project Las Americas approaches their work by finding a need and working together with the people to plan for and implement a solution to the need.  Empowering people so they can improve their life circumstance and building community have been hallmarks of Project Las Americas.  Their work under Bobs leadership is inspiring.

Project Las Americas	178852	2	/users/profile/235479	ryanbrowning88	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	As a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Dominican Republic, Project Las Americas was pivotal in obtaining funds for my primary project: the construction of rainwater catchment systems for Dominican families living below the poverty line.  PLA was quick to respond and offer assistance via telephone and/or email, a feat not easily achieved in a country with questionable cell phone service!  Project Las Americas is making a tangible change in the Dominican Republic and doing so in a sustainable, ethical manner.

Community Women Against Hardship	84135	1	/users/profile/93281	mabel6022	Donor	5	03/30/2011	I am impressed with Gloria Taylor's efforts in helping families (that otherwise have nowhere to turn) thrive and prosper through her efforts in Community Women Against Hardship.  I have participated in the various fundraisers for this worthy charitable organization, and I am in awe of the tremendous effort put forth by all its volunteers to accomplish its mission.  I have seen firsthand the center from which the charity is run and how generous donations are put to good use to help families get the help they need to have a fighting chance in these especially difficult times.  I am also impressed with the cultural and educational programs (like the Jazz music program) that elevate this organization beyond just a typical "charity" helping those less fortunate.  Kudos to CWAH for infusing these elements.  I will continue to support this worthwhile organization as long as it is still going.
Community Women Against Hardship	83836		/users/profile/92919	Deb Wilson	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	Community Women Against Hardship (CWAH) is responsible for providing countless young women and their families in the St. Louis area a fresh start. What I like most about CWAH is they don't acknowledge the words can't or impossible.  They only know can and possible! Gloria Taylor is an awesome leader. I was impressed with her and the organization the minute I met her. Her energy is amazing, her compassion immeasurable. CWAH is sowing into the future by providing  tutoring children and also developing an appreciation for Jazz music. They even have a "boutique" where parents may get items for themselves, their children and their household.  I like the way Gloria just doesn't accept "any type" of donation when it comes to furniture or clothing to give to her clients, she wants the best for them because she is giving them her best and expects the best from them.

The fervor and zeal that the volunteers possess is undeniably contagious.  It mirrors the commitment and passion of the Executive Director.  I love this organization  because of the work that is done for children and families in need.  CWAH provides shelter, clothing, food, counseling and educational services.  Every city should have a Community Women Against Hardship, an organization who really understands how our current economic situation has adversely affected all of us, especially children and families in need.  
Community Women Against Hardship	83745		/users/profile/92820	Lisa L	Board Member	5	03/29/2011	I am so very impressed by Community Women Against Hardship and the services that they provide to the community--helping families struggling with poverty issues learn to become more self sufficient.  In addition to helping the parents, they also help the children learn of a better life.  From the transitional housing program, which helps people on the path to home ownership, to the after-school and Jazz programs, CWAH teaches families that hard-work is the key to success and that they are respected and valued.  
Community Women Against Hardship	83425		/users/profile/92409	Sparkle	Client Served	5	03/28/2011	Community Women Against Hardship has literally has aided in changing my life.  Qualifying for services was not hard.  Picking 3 services that they provide was.  I choose their fitness and nutrition classes which were informative and when put to use, very effective.  In 8 sessions I've lost 8 pounds.  Also taking Therapy sessions which has really helped me mentally get ready for the type of life I'd like to live and support has put me on a road of success I couldn' have imagine for myself and family 4 months ago.  Being involved, fully participating, and being on time has put me on lone to work at a major hospital here in St. Louis.  My children have more structure, happiness, and higher self esteem. Also I've gotten to experience events I never knew existed like Jazz at the Bistro, which I've really enjoyed and met lovely people.  While going through hard times and at the beginning not being able to pay my utilities they also helped there.  Keeping my mind focus enough to keep advocating for my son's education , who has Asperger's Autism and Epilepsy of which they've been supportive in advice in that situation which has had a very positive outcome.  Now I'm looking forward to the walk a thon that's being held on May 7th.  CWAH has helped my family's emotional, spiritual, financial, artistic, educational, and social needs.  I couldn't ask for a better organization (family) to belong to.

My children loved the program and at the end of the program we went on a trip to Atlanta Georgia last summer.  My family was in awe when we went into the Altanta's aquarium.  It was so beautiful and my children and I learned a great deal from the trip.  We were able to touch stringrays, learned about sharks, jellfish and the coral reef. We also went to Spellman College and Morehouse.  It was the first time my children were on a college campus.

Community Women Against Hardship	83080		/users/profile/91916	David	Client Served	5	03/24/2011	I received a phone call from a lady who told me I was selected to be a family of CWAH.  She told me her organization would give a hand up to help me.  The day she called was the day after my gas was cut off and I  had received a final electric bill.  I was also wondering how I can make Christmas different from the last few years. I actually was very skeptic when she called.  Who would volunteer to help a total stranger.  I was hoping she was telling the truth.  I soon found out she was.  The first thing she did was have me call this agency who helped get my gas back on and pay down my elctric bill.  
Community Women Against Hardship	83076		/users/profile/91911	Gertrude	Donor	5	03/23/2011	I have been donating to this organization for at least 15 years.

They are always so entertaining. I always enjoy their fall gala.  It is so much fun and the music is great!!!  They also have an auction.  The items are great.  I enjoy giving to this group because I have personally seen them work miracles with little to no money.  They give so much to try to impact the quality of life for some low income families. 
Community Women Against Hardship	83073		/users/profile/91902	Allen	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	I have donated money to a great deal of charities but this is the first non-for-profit that made me want to give of myself and my time.  This entity not only feeds low income families but they also feed their emotions, and their minds.  I was cleaning the center one day when they had one of their programs for non-violence.  The program dealt with anger management.  It was teaching people how to deal with conflict resolutions. They had a expert who learned from Dr. Martin Luther King non-violence center in Atlanta.  He gave examples and did role playing for situations that occur in people's everyday life.  He had the attention of families the entire time he talk.  The teenagers and the parents were able to role play with problems that were occuring in their lives.  It was awesome to watch.

Community Women Against Hardship	42489	7	/users/profile/43194	edmond	Board Member	5	06/01/2010	Although I am a relatively new Board Member of Community Against Hardship (CWAH), I have been aware of and associated with the organization in varying capacity for over 10 years.  I have seen this organization grow into a critical provider of Family Support and Services within the St Louis Region and project the image that is typically reserved for the national and international presence.  When my life took a turn and I was looking for a place to belong, it was without hesitation that CWAH became that place; a place where I can help and at times just as important learn from others experiences and circumstances.  Gloria Taylors ability to smile and bring smile to others regardless of the situation is a true testament to finding your passion and success will follow.  With very little she has been able to help and positively impact so many.  My day to day role as VP with Wells Fargo Advisors provides opportunities for me to sharpen my skills.  My role at CWAH allows me to utilize those skills beyond the corporate arena and visualize immediate results.  I am honored to be associated with such an elite team who continually strive to provide the ultimate best in a desperate society.

During the sixteen years of service and friendship, I have volunteered in several capacities, educated and adopted families.  During my service of giving back to the community, I have obtained a dual Associates Degree, Bachelors of Arts, two Masters Degrees and in pursuit of my PH.D in Educational Leadership.  I am proud to be a part of (CWAH), if the organization had not crossed my families path during the critical time of my life I do not know how far and to what extent I would have grown (excelled).  If any organization deserves to be praised for the service that is renderd, its CWAH.

Ms. Taylor and her staff go the extra mile when garnering resources to keep CWAH up and running. Children receive tutoring, have access to a computer lab and attend field experiences.  The building houses a boutique for women seeking to get in the workforce to find proper attire.  This organization is also an umbrella for The Advancement of Jazz Study and Performance, in which students are exposed to and taught jazz history and performance which culminates into a recital open to the public.  Ms. Taylor is a wonderful human spirit, and her gift of giving needs full recognition.  Sponsorship is truly needed to allow CWAH to continue giving back to the community.
Community Women Against Hardship	38045	6	/users/profile/38871	william5	Volunteer	4	05/05/2010	I am an architect.  I met the founder of this nonprofit in 1988.  She is a very caring woman and has the interest of women and children close to her heart.  The organization takes two or three families a year and make sure they get all the help they need to get back on their feet.  The organization sponsors a jazz institute where young people can learn about jazz music and instruments.  The organization has a library and computer lab.  But as many organizations of this type, it does not have enough financial support.  However, the Founder and CEO Gloria Taylor has managed to keep things afloat since 1988.  Because of the work of this nonfprofit  one of the young women helped went to college.  The organization takes its candidates on educational field trips with the help of a local Church that provided the bus and driver.

Their spokes horse works tirelessly promoting online auctions (I suspect he has human help at times) I have both won and donated auction items, it was a very easy process.  I was very happy with the jewlry I had the winning bid on.  I highly recommend checking their auctions, some great stuff shows up and the more you buy the more horses you help!

Hearing her passion & learning so much about Special Horses, I know this is something I could feel comfortable sharing with my listeners. I am also grateful to Great Nonprofits because without you I never would have found Special Horses & I wouldn't have been able to help them spread the word of their mission &, believe me, their mission is one that needs to be shared.
Special Horses	285312		/users/profile/338884	Nina E.	Donor	5	04/08/2016	I own a rescued OTTB and I have an affinity to help horses - especially those who have come from circumstances similar to my mare.  I appreciate Special Horses as they serve multiple charitable organizations for horses in need/at risk.  This makes it easier for the donor to help while knowing that the money is going where it is most needed.  I also appreciate the auction format that Special Horses so successfully uses as it makes it possible for me to donate an item of value when I may not be able to make a similar monetary contribution.  I have also won items from the auction(s) and I have always been pleased with my purchase and the fact that I helped fund the needs of another equine.   Special Horses has social media presence, and uses it to bring awareness to all the issues that horses at risk may have, including emergency situations, where funds may need to be raised quickly.  As a seller on eBay, I am able to donate a percentage of the cost of items that I sell - to Special Horses - I like having this option as a donor, too!  If I could afford to adopt a second rescue horse, I would be more likely to consider the equines of the organizations that Special Horses assists. 
Special Horses	250984	2	/users/profile/338884	Nina E.	Donor	5	07/31/2015	The non-profit organizations - that Special Horses, LLC, embraces, promotes and financially supports - are dear to my heart.  The experience has always been positive and FUN; I know the money goes where its supposed to go.  I know that it helps.  And, in my travels, I seek out items that I feel may be attractive as donations for future auctions.  It is my way of giving back to the horses that have given us so much and now are in need.  I do it for my mare (a rescued thoroughbred), and all her friends who are not so fortunate and who may be at risk.  It's a noble cause.       
Special Horses	285098		/users/profile/63486	hopelavender	Donor	5	04/07/2016	I have worked with Special Horses fundraising for a large horse seizure in Virginia. We fund raised for hay for the rescues that took in the starved, neglected horses. With the help of the donors and some that offered products whose purchase went to the funding needed;we were able to donate money for much needed hay for the care of the horses from this large seizure.  Special Horses is great to work with; and committed to their cause.  Easy to deal with and open and up front. I would recommend this organization without hesitation

Special Horses	257621	3	/users/profile/346065	J_Smith	Client Served	5	09/16/2015	Special Horses does great work raising money for horse charities.  The spokeshorse, Ted Peeplover (you can find him on facebook)  along with his human  are busy collecting a variety of donated items to put in their online auctions, they always come up with interesting things you didn't know you needed until you see them!  They have some particularly nice art work at times.  I have bought several pieces of jewelry from them myself which arrived promptly and were just as they were pictured.  I was so impressed with their efforts to help horses in need I donated an item to one their auctions myself and will do so again.  Keep up the good work Special Horses, goodness knows there are 1000's of horses in need of rescue and help to find a new home in this country.

Special Horses	250983	3	/users/profile/338883	Holly72	Donor	5	07/31/2015	Special Horses and it's founder, Wendi Neckameyer are extremely dedicated to saving horses. When Special Horses aren't fundraising, they are networking the horses who are in need of homes, donations, and gathering signatures for petitions to change the laws regarding horse welfare. This foundation can always be counted on for the latest horse news and provides addresses for each state's representative. This is a fantastic foundation for horses, and follows all the rules pertaining to being a 501c3. Special Horses, in my opinion, is one of the most conscientiously run foundations I have been involved with.
Special Horses	250917	2	/users/profile/338815	DebKS	Donor	5	07/31/2015	Special Horses does great work.  I can donate to them and be assured that they have verified that the various organizations they support are legitimate 501-c-3 operations, and that my donations are not wasted on providing an income for the fund-raisers rather than going to the organizations and equines in need.  
Special Horses	250849	4	/users/profile/338744	Pamela100	Donor	5	07/31/2015	I donate and participate in the Special Horses fundraisers.  They do great work raising money for equine rescues, retirement, rehab and rehoming at-risk equine.  I have never had a problem with any of my donations and all dealings have always confirmed me of their commitment to the equine and their honesty in dealing with all issues especially their fundraisers.  I will continue to be one of their donors as I can.

St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	111537	2	/users/profile/12083	LKK612	Client Served	5	05/08/2012	As the office manager (and client) at St. Louis LDA, I would like to comment regarding the review by spedteach.  This person's information was incorrect in 2009 and is still incorrect.  St. Louis LDA will help all families, regardless of their ability to pay.  Our tutoring sessions at present cost $59 a session, not $75.  In 2009, it would have cost even less.  What he/she may have misunderstood in quoting that cost, is that it COSTS LDA $74 to provide each session.  Again, it COSTS THE CLIENT $59 a session.  If you look around you will see that this is one of the lowest in the St. Louis area.  Also, all of our tutors are certified special education teachers who work one-on-one with students.  This individualized attention is what makes our program so successful.   In addition, for the last year or so, we have provided tutoring scholarships to those who qualify.  Since 2011, LDA has provided nearly $20,000 in scholarship money just for tutoring clients. Program-wide, in 2011, LDA provided over $295,000 in services at no cost or reduced cost to our clients. 
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	10218	5	/users/profile/12083	LKK612	Client Served	5	09/11/2009	My son was struggling in high school.  An LDA consultant went with me to meetings with his school and was able to get him the services he needed to be successful, whether it was extra time on tests or rewording of material or whatever.  Getting my son what he needed was first and foremost in my consultant's mind and it was obvious not only to those of us in the room during the meetings but also with my son.  He still talks about her.
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	11858	4	/users/profile/13821	Special Educator	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/03/2009	I am a special educator and have referred many parents to LDA so that they can access the variety of services LDA provides.  All parents rave about the services provided by LDA and are thrilled that they have found people who truly understand how their child learns and how it impacts the entire family!  All of them, without exception, have told me they feel like they have a lifeline and that it is a blessing to have a nonprofit organization in St. Louis that actually understands learning disabilities and provides services that are reasonable and many services that are free.  The number of people they help in the community is phenomenal and St. Louis is lucky to have so many professionals that care about kids!
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	11660	2	/users/profile/13598	spedteach	Professional with expertise in this field	2	09/30/2009	LDA provides resources IF you can afford them. Tutoring is about $75 a sesion and they recommend twice a week. Most families can't afford that amount. LDA is a good resource, it is the non for profit that I question.

Then I found out about LDA, they gave me resources and helpful information, then came in to the school as consultants for both children. They were great and gave us hope and guidance and the girls got the services they needed. Today they are both successful in academics and social situations. We owe their success to LDA!

We noticed that she had some reading issues and spoke with our pediatrician.  He recommended testing at LDA.  We went for testing and everyone was very helpful and understanding.  The testing was completed with care and compassion.  The results of the testing were thorough and clear.  Our daughter started tutoring and within a few months we could see a boost in her self esteem.  I wish we would have contacted LDA sooner.

The staff was very helpful, and continued to be helpful for many years.  The workshops and seminars for parents were educational.  It's been a pleasure to watch the St. Louis LDA grow.  The programs that are offered to children with Learning Disabilities and ADHD are much needed. They are a very special organization.
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	10415	4	/users/profile/12294	maryzagg	General Member of the Public	5	09/16/2009	The St. Louis LDA has been a wonderful resource for many years.  With an eye to truly quality education for kids with learning differences and ADD, St. Louis LDA's volunteers and paid staff are always helpful in answering questions over the phone, directing one to resources which our school districts seem to know nothing about, and being informed and current.  I have never been made to feel "dumb" even though at times I think my questions WERE.  The message that parents and students must develop advocacy is delivered over and over, and LDA of St. Louis helps to give people the tools to develop that advocacy.  While my sons have not taken advantage of the after-school tutoring, I understand that it too is very good.  LDA of St. Louis has given me the clear message that is OK and the right thing to do to expect more nad work to get what your kids need in school.  It is OK and the right thing to do to have high expectations and let our kids hold onto their dreams because they CAN achieve them.

I attended countless meetings with the "CARE team" at school and jumped through every hoop they threw my way, and yet I still could not get her the help she needed. In despair I contacted the LDA and they gave me timely and critical information that changed the way the school was looking at her challenges. When I brought an advocate to our next meeting we got more assistance than I would have dreamed possible. We also began using the tutoring services at LDA. The tutors are wonderful and truly understood what my daughter needed and how to motivate her. Everyone at LDA is there for the children and their love and committment to helping these kids is undeniable.

St. Louis Learning Disabilities helped bring sanity and joy back to our household.  Our children were strugging in school. Our relationship with our children was practically gone.  We received guidance from numerous Doctors, but no one was able to help.  Finding LDA was a breath of fresh air.  Trained and caring people that actually understood what we were going through and were able to help us.  LDA helped us so much, I felt compelled to give back.  I've been on the LDA Board for 4 years.  It is a very rewarding experience to know that we are helping so many children and families, everyday!

The number of children, families and teachers who have been helped is remarkable. Children with learning challenges and frustrated parents have a strong advocate in St. Louis LDA. They provide the resources to diagnose disabilities, the tools to understand and improve learning and coping skills, and most importantly they provide the hope that a child's self esteem will grow. One child recounted, "Before LDA my life was like a muddy swamp, after LDA it's like a crystal pool."
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	9783	3	/users/profile/11604	sckuth	Board Member	5	08/31/2009	St. Louis LDA is an organization that provides hope and tangible results to children facing learning difficulties -- and their families as well. As a board member, I've been involved with St. Louis LDA for over a year and have seen the life-changing impact they have on kids of all ages. Their staff is deeply experienced, and they develop individual plans for each child tailored to their unique needs. And the number of children LDA touches each year keeps growing, a testament to their success in giving kids confidence and tools to overcome their learning issues -- but also a sobering reminder of how many kids in our community need help scholastically.
St Louis Learning Disabilities Association Inc	9631	4	/users/profile/11440	ssilvey	Board Member	5	08/27/2009	"You are a lifeline."  "Finally, someone understands and can help my child."  "You've saved our family."  Comments such as these are heard everyday at the St. Louis Learning Disabilities Association.  This organization truly makes a difference in the lives of children who have neurologically based learning disabilities and/or AD/HD.  Children who come for help to LDA have gone from failing grades to the honor roll, from being emotionally paralyzed and hating school to smiling, learning students who love to learn because they finally have someone who understands how they learn and can coach and teach them.  The staff is the best in the area and you will find no one who cares more about children and families than the professionals associated with this organization.  As a board member, it is gratifying to see the difference that is made every day in the life of a child or a family!
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	193219		/users/profile/252382	bushcloverNancy	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/27/2014	As an endangered plant biologist with a state agency, I have been watching the growth of the CPC consortium for two decades. The majority of my experience has been with staff and programs of the Chicago Botanical Garden. Their mission is wider than ex situ propagation. Our program has turned informally to colleagues in member institutions for guidance in locating experts, information on species taxonomy, and climate change modeling.  The Chicago Garden's annual symposia are one of the best opportunities for plant conservation professionals to gain exposure to the work of colleagues and new issues in plant conservation. However, CPC is not the only organization that addresses rare plant conservation. We have been lucky in the level of dialogue we've established with the Chicago Botanical Garden. As an outside professional reviewer, my greatest concern is that recognition of the complementary role of other NGOs and agencies by CPC affiliates appears to be a bit erratic.
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	158159		/users/profile/92886	Shirley M.	Board Member	5	05/17/2013	I first heard of the Center for Plant Conservation throught the Garden Club of America's Partners for Plants.  The latter project was held only on federal lands where groups of members helped botanists maintain and monitor at-risk plants in their habitat.   These efforts were expanded to state lands as well after the Partners learned of the coordinated work being done across the country by the CPC network of professionals.  Guidelines, protocols, priorities and long-range strategies are maintained for the participating institutions and their scientists. It is an exciting and successful concept that is helping the survival of at-risk plants of possible  medicinal or climatic enhancing qualities.   The need is great.  The time is short.  Join  the Center for Plant Conservation  4651 Shaw Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63110-2299 to save a rare plant today!
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	83816	1	/users/profile/92886	Shirley M.	Board Member	5	03/29/2011	The Center for Plant Conservation is the best kept secret in the World of Conservation.   For over 25 years it has been dedicated to saving rare and endangered plants acrosws the United States by partnering with its network of botanic gardens to protect and save our native plants.  From gathering and storing seeds to growing them at their partner institutions, to restoring them in the wild they have been at the forefront of learning and teaching techniques which will assure our children and grandchildren having the genetic diversity available that would otherwise be lost forever.  Today they are the protectors of almost 800 plants that were doomed to extinction.  And they are dedicated to continuing to work to save those plants which are almost daily becoming rare and endngered.
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	88297	1	/users/profile/99251	Derek Norman	Volunteer	5	05/02/2011	Many years ago, in the mid 90's I suppose, I first became aware of the Center for Plant Conservation when I started to volunteer/monitor the rare and endangered species for the Plants of Concern Program administered by the Chicago Botanic Garden.By virtue of the comprehensive nature and the wealth of information the CPC Web site offered It quickly became the "go-to" resource for all my plant identification, conservation and many botany related  questions. And over the years the CPC Web site has remained a steady and a reliable source for plant information especially in the areas of plant identification and conservation.More recently, as a member of the American Society of Botanical Artists I have come to admire the CPC for their enormous support and strategic foresight in co-sponsoring (along with the Smithsonian Institute) the international botanical art exhibition "Losing Paradise - Rare and Endangered Plants Here and Around the World." The exhibition soon to open in London continues to bring the issue of conservation to the wider public audience connecting art to science to people in a way, some would say, only fine art can.This one venture seems so well to demonstrate the enormous breadth and dimension of what the CPC is about. And in so doing has given this writer, conservationist and staunch botanical artist a whole new appreciation of what the Center does and how! Thank you,Derek Norman

Center for Plant Conservation Inc	84606	1	/users/profile/93863	lilyofthevalley	Volunteer	5	04/01/2011	I have heard Kathryn Kennedy, the Executive Director of CPC speak on several occasions.  She is an excellent speaker and makes the valid point that plant species generally suffer from lack of attention and proper care and consideration, to say nothing of funding for study and stewardship.  Habitats are suffering all over the world for various reasons, some natural, many due to GHG and climate change as well as urban development.  We need our plants; they are part of the natural balance that we humans seem so hell bent on obliterating - mostly because plants, omnipresent but under the wire, have such a low profile.  The CPC tells their story.  AND the CPC works overtime to protect plants and educate us all to their vital value.

This is a conservation effort which deserves support from all who are concerned with species extinction.   
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	84194		/users/profile/93354	slblackburn	Donor	5	03/30/2011	 There are few organizations whose focus is strictly on the plant world,  and the Center for Plant Conservation is one of the premier groups whose mission is just that.  It is vital to preserve plant diversity at a time when we are losing it.  Diversity of species will help our world cope with changing climate within planting zones.   Never has there been a more important time to preserve our natural environment.  With all the changes occurring with climate change, human development and habitat loss, our natural areas are under stress and in peril.  Plants are as vulnerable to extinction and invasive species as are animals, and arguably more in peril because they can not just move somewhere else as their habitat changes!  We are increasingly discovering properties of plants that will be useful to humans - medicines, natural chemicals, adaptability, etc that we will lose if the plants become extinct.
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	84123	1	/users/profile/93268	kathy rice	Professional with expertise in this field	4	03/30/2011	 For 14 years i worked as the CPC liason at Desert Botanical Garden.  My primary goal was to build a conservation seedbank of rare and common desert species for recovery and restoration purposes.  CPC supported my efforts financially and professionally with grant money and plenty of advice.  Under the leadership of Carolyn O'Malley, Director of Desert Botanical Garden, my efforts were enthusiastically encouraged and supported.  When, under new directorship, my position was included in the Reseearch Department under new direction, new rules were put into place at DES, limiting my CPC activity.  This caused a major life change for me, resulting in a change of profession.  I am now a botany teacher at a community college, but will always appreciate the time i spent working toward plant conservation with CPC.

Since its inception, the Center has been a consistent -- and sometimes the only -- voice on the side of plant diversity. By combining the assets of existing institutions, such as botanic gardens and arboreta, with those of land managers, CPC provides a pathway to survival for many species that would otherwise face a grim future.
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	83931	1	/users/profile/93034	Dieter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2011	There are many institutions and NGOs that advocate for plant conservation in some way.  However, few actually foster conservation by actively performing the work needed for conservation, including surveys, monitoring, developing ex situ seed banks, and participating in restoration and recovery.  The Center for Plant Conservation, acting through its member gardens, is such an institution, and clearly leads the effort in the United States, doing so with considerable and collective scientific experience.

Center for Plant Conservation Inc	83903	1	/users/profile/93001	Ed Guerrant	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2011	The CPC is a global recognized and highly regarded leader in the field of ex situ, or off site plant conservation.  Indeed, they have literally written the book on the subject, or, actually three of them with another in press. These books all finish with one or more appendixes that provide practical, pragmatic, and highly detailed and specific guidelines about how best to go about the various aspects of keeping endangered species alive.   In addition to their books, the bodies of which provide the scientific, strategic and policy underpinnings to the practical appendixes, the CPC serves as a de facto national network that strives to prevent extinction the the most endangered plants in the USA.  Indeed, the first plant species deemed to have been recovered enough to be taken off the Endangered Species List, Potentilla robbinsiana, was very much a direct consequence of the work by the New England Wildflower Society, a CPC participating Institution.

Center for Plant Conservation Inc	83787	1	/users/profile/92866	Matthew Albrecht	Client Served	5	03/29/2011	As the only national organization dedicated to the conservation of imperiled native plants, the CPC plays a vital role in protecting our precious natural heritage.  CPC supports on the ground conservation work with imperiled plants through its endowed species program, by building partnerships with governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and by facilitating information sharing among its network of botanic gardens and arboreta. The books and workshops led by CPC institutions are world-class and have helped inspire plant conservation work across the US. 
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	83783	1	/users/profile/92862	Sarah Reichard	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2011	I have long admired the work of the Center for Plant Conservation and in the late 1990s I was thrilled to be asked to join their science advisors. In time, the University of Washington Botanic Gardens became part of the network and I became a conservation officer with CPC. I am now Director of the Gardens and continue to believe in the good work of the main office and all of the network. This is an amazing organization that has increased awareness about the importance of conserving plants -  the foundation of living communities -  and they have also increased funding within the network, allowing the members to do more on-the-ground conservation. The collective problem-solving of the network is one of the best things it offers too. When we are faced with a vexing conservation problem in Washington state, we put the question out to the network and get suggestions from Florida, Hawaii, and Colorado. It is great to have that sort of support. What CPC needs more is more funding. Funds for plant conservation are woefully inadequate and we are losing the race against time and climate change.

Because of the support and  efforts of the CPC, these plants are now being recognized and a basis for funding conservation efforts have been mounted.  Their sponsorship of individual plant species has focused attention on the plights of some of our most vulnerable ones, hopefully before it is too late.  Beyond this direct support, I have been impressed by their national advocacy and educational efforts which will hopefully benefit conservation efforts generally.

It is the ONLY national organization solely devoted to the conservation of rare and endangered plants.  It is effective in its work because it works directly  with botanical gardens across the country in addition to the federal agencies.  The staff are top notch professionals.CPC has authored at least two highly respected books that have become the "Bibles" of plant conservation. Anyone interested in the flora of North America (including Hawaii) would benefit by  learning about CPC and supporting its conservation efforts.
Center for Plant Conservation Inc	82025	1	/users/profile/90000	Peter Raven	Volunteer	5	03/12/2011	I have been associated with the Center for Plant Conservation since its start in the mid 1980s.  I then helped it in its move to St. Louis ten years later.  It is quite simply one of the finest nonprofits I have ever known.  I now serve on its Board.  Its magic lies in the outstanding conception that was involved in its formation: that it be a network of botanical gardens throughout the country, each preserving an approved list of endangered plant species from its own area as living plants in its gardens, in seed banks, and by monitoring them in nature.  The formal nature of the agreement allows the CPC to build up a national collection for conservation, a collection that now is nearing 800 species.  There is no finer scheme for plant conservation anywhere in the world, and none that involves so many people in so many different institutions.

The amount of pain and manipulation I went through with this religious group was terrifying and I to this day still suffer from their lies. Thank you society. the volunteer and debaters have little clue as to the program or what we go through.

I am in awe of this mission to get pregnant mother to have healthy children and later become thriving productive citizens.    One women in particular came to the St Charles location after a job loss with children in tow and 6 months pregnant.      I saw how the staff welcomed her first hand. It was as if the woman was a cousin of sister to them.       They had already prepared and decorates the private rooms for the mother with enough beds for her children.    On another occasion, I saw the children happily playing in the playroom with a babysitter while the mother attended life skills classes.

The ladies receive direction for their future lives and help with their children.    The clients are given encouragement that their lives will be better for having been at Our Lady's Inn.  The atmosphere  at either the downtown or Defiance locations shows precious little ones playing like any child you know.

Our Lady's Inn	130949		/users/profile/176466	ERodery	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	A group of ladies in my church provide lunches and dinners every Thursday at Our Lady's Inn in Defiance, MO for the past 4 1/2 years and we have observed the caring, loving, and instructive counseling that these pregnant ladies receive during their stay for up to a  year.  Also their other children are welcomed and cared for as well.  Personally I was very impressed with one young lady in her journey.  One of my high school friends was praising Our Lady's Inn and how they turned her granddaughter around and helped her so much and it turned out to be the young lady that I was especially drawn to and that really impacted my desire to continue to do my part to help the leaders of Our Lady's Inn.
Our Lady's Inn	130919		/users/profile/176435	PLee	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	My realationship with Our Lady's Inn (OLI) began in 2006 when I was working for a local school district parenting and preschool program.  We provided parenting classes and developmental information to the parents who were staying at OLI.  We also encouraged the parents to send their children to our school district's preschool program.  When I reitred in 2008, I organized a team of ladies from my church to cook at OLI every Thursday.  We have been doing this for 31/2 years.  Two years ago, I became a member of their Board of Directors.  Each time I am there, I am blessed by what is happening for the ladies who are staying there.  Not only are they receiving a shelter for themselves and their children, but they are receiving an education in how to make ends meet in this world.  The expectation for having a job or being in school is really helping these ladies receive the necessary skills to gain employment that will enable them support their families.  They are required to save a percentage of their pay to plan for their future as they will need down payments and deposits once they are ready to be more independent.  The ladies are expected to assume duties at Our Lady's Inn, which makes it more like a family.  They support one another well, and I am sure, there are many close friendships that have been formed.  It is such a positive and respectful environment, which is exactly what many of these young parents need as they learn parenting skills, etc.  As a member of the Board, I have seen the passion that the OLI workers have for what they do.  They are all doing good work.  Many of us who are pro-life are not really doing much to make it a possible choice for these young ladies, but OLI is doing it and overseeing all that is needed to make pro-life a decision that these ladies can make and know that their lives will be better for it!

I have met many of the women who are living at the Inn and I am amazed at their strength and courage.  I have been speaking on behalf of the group at their Lunch and Learn presentations and last month a resident named Amber spoke to the group and literally brought almost all 80 attendees to tears!  To hear her talk about how Our Lady's Inn literally gave her the strength to get out of an abusive relationship and stand on her own was incredible.  I continue to be moved at the selfless acts of the staff and volunteers to help these women in need, as well as their children.

Our Lady's Inn	23519	4	/users/profile/24628	Aisa	Volunteer	5	12/08/2009	I don't know how they do it...but they do.  Day in and day out, the staff members I work with collaborate and encourage each other.  They are friends that have come together to serve those in need.  I asked a few of them a question today.  It was: Why do you do what you do?  Each of them shared a different gift that they had to offer and expressed that they saw a need for that gift to be shared.  With God at the center of this organization, it has not only survived, it has flourished beautifully.  I strive to be like the people I work with.  That has never been the case, and I have never been around such an awesome team of people (even in my work with for-profit organizations) that peacefully and collaboratively come together to help a group in need.  This same team brings God into its work setting and does not hesitate to give Him credit; I have never seen such devotion or credit given to the Lord by one group of people, not even while volunteering at my church.  Not one resident goes wanting of anything; each, if she desires it, can receive an abundance of food, advice, friendship, love, shelter (whether at OLI or at a place that OLI finds for them), or any other basic need.  God bless Our Lady's Inn and my friends (the staff, volunteers, and residents).

Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135187		/users/profile/181047	Lea Dingman King	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The Springfield Victory Mission was recommended to me by my Church,  Northside Christian Church to reach out to our neighbors in need,   Upon finding the Mission, I found my home.  A place for growth, a place for character building, a place where you see miracles happen in you as well as the people that come across your path as you volunteer your time.  The people of the Mission are the kindest.  They're hearts are worn on their sleeves, they are always available to those in need with a prayer, a hug, a smile or a kind word.  They have shown me just what mercy and grace is and I am humbled by the opportunity to work with these fine people to help eliminate poverty from the inside out to our Springfield homeless and low income residences......................They are a deserving nonprofit in my book!

Thing is, VM fills a void by changing the lives of people directly.  So much better to come along side those that need help, than to give a handouts.   They have effectively created a solution to a problem, rather than just treating the symptom.   Christ says we are to be salt and light, love our neighbors as ourselves and whatever you do the the least of these, you do to me.

They are training people to help them get jobs they are helping people have a safe place to go when they have no where to go except on the streets  I only wish more people would get involved in helping those in need.

Springfield Victory Mission Inc	136045		/users/profile/181949	ssmith78	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Victory Mission is having a huge impact on the city of Springfield! It's been such a huge blessing to be able to help to change lives with them. As a volunteer i have worked alongside a few people who have personally had their lives turned upside down from this organization. It makes the organization much more personal when you can hear true stories of change. People who were once living on the streets are now working and taking classes which will make their lives different! I plan on working with them for many years to come!
Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135893		/users/profile/181790	SHighley	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I have had the privilege of leading one of the Bible studies at Victory Square for almost a year now and it is truly exciting to see the contributions Victory Mission makes in changing lives. There is one man in the program right now that a few short months ago came to class for the first time unsure of what to do or where to go, and not really sure who God was.  He was literally still in a fog from the drugs he had been using on the streets.  Today, he is clear on many things including who Christ is and who he is in Christ!  He has a real passion for continuing on the path he's on, and now a passion for helping others still on the streets find truth and hope like he did.  Helping people with these challenges is a real passion of mine and I learned about Victory Mission from several former residents who I became friends with through ministry work.  I'm a big believer in teaching a man to fish as opposed to feeding him fish for a day.  Victory Mission contributes in this way.  I look forward to my time there each week and hearing of the good things they've got to share from the previous week, or even the challenges these gentlemen faced during the week. I've been truly blessed by being a small part of what they are doing!!  They are a real asset to the community of Springfield!!

For men they have overnight shelter, programs that meet needs of men and women who are in the process of transition.  They also offer the Victory Trade School that offers professional vocational training in the restaurant business.  They do not take shortcuts in their expectations that the individuals they help take responsibility for their future and keep the commitment they make to the program.

James 1:27 "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction..."   Victory Mission is great and God centered, filling a need for the area,.  May those yet 'having', share so the help can continue!

Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135570		/users/profile/181446	billstgemme	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Springfield Victory Mission is a tremendous asset to the Springfield Metropolitan area.  The administration is committed to assisting the under-priviledge community in so many ways.  These programs include spiritual, educational, food pantry , financial assistance, consuling, shelters, and work oportunities.  The Food Service Training program is outstanding.  This program provides a second chance to men who have a "rough" go of it.  They are trained in all aspects of operating a food service establishment.  The program lasts a year, but it is preseded by a 12-month one step program of religion and social training.  This organization is expanding services and programs to women, too.  Once they establish a "home" facility for the women students, they will be integrated into the food service program.  The BESt thing about this administration is that they raise funds and spend them extremely wisely.  There is no foolish or unwise spending of funds.  Too bad, there is not more programs and facilituies such as the VICTORY MISSION.
Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135551		/users/profile/181425	LanaK	Donor	5	11/08/2012	One thing I really like about Victory is the assurance my donation is going for the specific thing as advertised. I can adopt a family for Christmas and take my gifts to them personally. They are real people with a real need today.  
Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135528		/users/profile/181402	aaronsm0m	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	As a volunteer and a friend I value what the Mission stands for. The Victory Mission not only serves those in need it brings forth a new begining and a change in peoples lives that increase faith, courage, and stability. I am greatly encouraged everytime I am alotted the opportunity to serve. I love the staff and amzing outpour of compassion they grant. The school is awesome and the shelter is incredible. They not only serve those who live and work there but they touch the lives of anyone in need. 
Springfield Victory Mission Inc	135515		/users/profile/181387	djjones	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2012	My most favorite part of Victory Mission is the life changing testimonials of people whose lives were "on the street" and at their very lowest point.  Victory Mission helps develop the hope that there is a better day and that their lives can improve with a deep faith.  And with these beliefs come the skills and experiences for landing new jobs and continuing their "new life" in Christ.  Other nonprofits also help people a lot.  But Victory Mission is not just a hand out.  It provides the real life living skills that folks can again become self sufficient though their very strong faith.  A favorite story of mine is Fred. He was a member of a gang and came to us from a large coastal city through Teen Challenge. He was ready for finding his place in our ongoing world.  He learned to address his own needs and to develop job skills that are in demand in the work place.  At his graduation from Victory Trade School, he was hired as an  extern--getting his feet wet working a "real job."  He has since been hired by the company and loves his new life.  He knows that he will never be able to return to his previous "home".  He has made a new, positive life through his newly found faith.  He is truly a "healed individual" with the faith and dedication of mentors, program instructors, staff and other students.  Thank you, God and Jesus.  Without that faith, it would be easy to knock a man back into the street life that he thought was his fate.

They do such an awesome job in every area. I have had the privilege of seeing them grow over the years and now I have the privilege of volunteering.  I thoroughly enjoy working with the people in charge as well as seeing the smiling faces of those in need. Without Victory Mission........there would be many who would not have the opportunity of being a part of a Christ believing group of amazing people.

While there are plenty of people food pantries, I had no idea there were pet food pantries! Jacqui was an eloquent speaker & explained how easily the need can happen, they don't judge & sometimes it's just a one time need. Again, Great Nonprofits helped me find Bi-State Pet Food Pantry. If you want to help a pet organization, this one is at the top of my list.
Bi-State Pet Food Pantry	152675		/users/profile/140507	Marilin Q.	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	Summer 2010:  Times were tough and getting tougher, and not just at our house. Unemployment, financial losses, foreclosure, was that all the 10:00 news had to offer?  I was about to tune out when I  heardwhat's that? Somebody is giving away pet food?  To keep the pets at home and out of shelters? Stay tuned.   Fall 2010: With unemployment benefits exhausted, I found myself in the (now very long) line of recipients at the Bi-State Pet Food Pantry. I filled out paperwork, presented proof of need, and gratefully waited my turn to accept pet food and compassion.  As I left I  vowed to repay these angels - the very minute I landed my next great job. Spring 2011:  Still no job, great or otherwise.  Pet Food Pantry, meet your newest volunteer!  Sweat equity!   "Keeping Pets and People Together" is the Pantry's Motto and what the Pantry does. With the growing need for help, the distribution  line grow longer every month. And yet, the pantry always comes through and in the process, treats volunteers and recipients alike with respect, friendship and a large dose of humor.

In this economy so many people can't afford to feed their pets alone themselves. Not only to we help keep their animals fed, it helps them from doing desperate measures like letting them out on the streets or taking to the Humane Society. I am so proud to be apart of this amazing group! 
Bi-State Pet Food Pantry	105066	1	/users/profile/141025	brookebreer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2012	This organization is for the "Familys" of animal lovers.  What a fantastic idea that needs a larger platform to really propel this great cause into the lime-light.  Since, I have known the creators of this pantry, they have always had the goal of the animals in mind and have never varied from it.  The Animals Welfare of 2012 is a strong sentence that needs to keep going well into the year and for years to come.  I am a proud follower of this charity and good friend to them when they send out the call.
Bi-State Pet Food Pantry	105041	1	/users/profile/140992	bpierce13	Volunteer	5	01/30/2012	What can I say about this place? They do absolutely great work in the community. They help keep pets with their guardians during financially difficult times. This means less animals abandoned and less animals in shelters. What's not to like about that?  All of the people that volunteer here really do care about their community.  
Bi-State Pet Food Pantry	105038	1	/users/profile/140989	Cathy17	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2012	The unconditional love given by a beloved dog, cat, or other furry or feathered friend is a positive force when life is good, but especially when times get rough. To have to give up your pet  because you have hit a rough patch can make everything so much worse. The work of BI-State Pet Food Pantry allows individuals and families to keep their pets by providing pet food to those in need. This is an important organization, not just because they are preventing animals from going hungry or being put in to the pet adoption system, but because the service they provide enables the human owners to continue to give and receive the love of their pets at a time when they really need it.  
Bi-State Pet Food Pantry	105037	1	/users/profile/140988	Lisa70	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2012	The people who started and run this charity are truly passionate about helping keep people keep their pets during hard times.  It's great, the work they do for animals but, they also provide much more than that.  To a lot of people, pets are their family and some people actually NEED their pets.  Pets have been shown to help people live longer, healthier and happier lives.  So, in short, the Bi-State Pet Food Pantry helps just as many people as they do their pets.  Wonderful charity to give your time, money or food to.  Great people with big hearts doing a lot of work to keep families together.

There are food banks for people, why not pets?  Far too many people have surrendered their pets to shelters in this economic downturn because they could not afford to.  BSPFP steps in, verifies their need, and provides them with the food they need to keep their pets in their homes.  Keeping People and Pets together is what they do and they have far exceeded what I originally thought they could do.

This nonprofit is vital to the pets - and people who own the pets - in the St. Louis area. While I have not had the time to volunteer as of yet, I am a repeat-donor and will continue to donate. This organization was the dream of two wonderful women who wanted to help "keep people and pets together." It helps keep additional animals from being placed in shelters - and in turn keeps the pets in the loving homes they know. They have helped countless furry friends and have given out thousands upon thousands of pounds of food and have helped SO many. I cannot say enough great things about this nonprofit!

Furry Kids Refuge	286708		/users/profile/376778	Jennifer_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give my time, my heart and my soul to dogs that need a second chance in life. In October 2011 I adopted a sweet little Cocker Spaniel at a Petco in Lees Summit, MO.  After this experience and learning about rescue I visited the rescues website and I just kept coming back to it week after week.  I didnt need to adopt another dog but for some reason I just kept coming back to their page.  In early 2012 I saw a little dog on their website, Joe Cocker (a Cocker Spaniel mix) and he needed a foster home.  I thought to myself.I can do this and the rest is history.   Joe was a tough case, he was a biter due to the abuse he received in his former home, he hated people but loved other dogs, and he loves me.  Yes, Joe Cocker is still with me and he will be forever.  Since that fateful day I have fostered over 100 dogs in my home, normally I foster 2 or 3 at a time.  Every time I go to the shelter and see all of the helplessness and the soulful eyes staring at me my heart just breaks.  Its the little guys, the ones that have never had a haircut, matted with eyes almost impossible to see.  Its the seniors whose owners surrendered because they are old or somehow became strays at the age of 10. Its the ones that I know the owners will never come to re-claim, those are the ones I must help.  To go to a shelter and see these dogs, shaking, fearful, not knowing what the heck has happened to their life and wondering when their family will come for them. In some cases I feel they have given up or are hoping their family wont come, they just want to escape the neglect and abuse. Some are so young I wonder if they have ever even experienced love and the older ones I can feel their broken hearts.  It is so hard to explain but until you actually walk the rows at the shelter it is a memory that will haunt you.  Every dog I bring home I help them become healthy and happy.  I love them as if they are my own, and they are mine until I find them a perfect forever home. All of this is possible through the group I foster for, Furry Kids Refuge.  Living in Missouri, one of the states notorious for back yard breeders and puppy mills it is just devastating the number of animals that are in the Missouri shelter system.  Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and I bite off more than I can chew but I always feel in my heart that I always have room for one more. Yes, I miss out hanging out with friends, shopping, vacations and even spending time with my family BUT these little guys are in my heart and helping them is just something I must do.  After my fosters are adopted I love to receive updates, photos and the occasional visit. I even doggysitt for some of them!  I will continue to give my time and my heart to as many dogs as I possibly can for as long as I possibly can.
Furry Kids Refuge	271506		/users/profile/203312	MON5	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2015	Furry Kids Refuge stepped up when we had to find a place to take a beautiful lab-mix and her 5 puppies.  When I called them, they didn't hesitate one minute!  They took all of them in and took wonderful care of them.  They poste videos daily so all that were involved with Momma and her 5 puppies could keep up with their progress.  All the puppies found loving homes and they still have Momma (now named Eloise) but she is in the best hands and they do wonderful vet checks and applications and don't let their foster dogs go to just anyone.In August, my boyfriend adopted a Yorkie that had been surrendered with some other dogs as the woman passed away.  He is a wonderful addition to our family.  I think they do amazing work with fostering.  When you adopt a dog from Furry Kids Refuge, you know you are getting a dog that had been checked out and worked with and more than anything, loved! I have volunteered at other organizations and I can honestly say that they are the most caring group of people there is.  It shows every Saturday when they take just some of their adoptable pets to Petco.  That, in itself is not only a lot of work, but dedication!  They deserve winning this!
Furry Kids Refuge	270614		/users/profile/359332	Writer	Client Served	5	11/01/2015	Wonderful people!  So caring. I adopted an 11 week old lab mix.  After about a week he was coughing constantly I was so worried.  I called Carla and she arranged everything got me into there vet same day!  The vet said he was a very sick boy gave him 3 shots and sent me home with meds.  When I went to the counter to pay they said Furry Kids Rescue were taking care of the bill I almost cried!  They didn't have to do that!  I simply cannot say enough about them.  PRICELESS

They are a wonderful group of people and they will be my first call when the time comes to rescue another. They love all of the dogs that come through their doors and truly save lives. One of our dogs from them had some health issues due to his difficult life before meeting the Angels at Furry Kids and they were very helpful and supportive when the problems became overwhelming. We can't imagine our lives without our fur babies and are grateful to the Furry Kids staff and volunteers for giving them a second shot at life and helping them find us!

We are comprised of mainly Foster homes and have 1 small kennel. Everyone in the group gives 110% into their care, love and helping to raise funds to support the rescue. We are a Non-Profit Organization and depend solely on our dedicated volunteers, fosters and loyal supporters. We have NO paid employees, The volunteers spend their personal time finding FUREVER HOMES for the animals in our program and then go back out to rescue more homeless and desperate animals. As an ALL-Volunteer rescue, we do not have a building for potential adopters to come and meet the animals in our program; we bring the animals to them.We hold adoption events each Saturday at Lee's Summit Missouri PetCo. Each event requires we physiclly set up an environment that is comfortable not only for the animals we bring out, but also for the potential adopters that come to meet them.Our group has operated over the past years with funding from friends, family and supporters to pay for veterinary costs, boarding, transportation and food for our rescued animals. The adoption fees we charge go toward recovering a portion of the cost of veterinary care, as you can imagine the fees can not cover all the costs incurred. Donations are small and every penny is used to care for and save these loving pets.Our organization believes that all animals deserve respect and should be treated with dignity in all circumstances. We strive to have all people share this philosophy, creating a healthier and kinder community for humans and animals alike..
Furry Kids Refuge	103501		/users/profile/138245	fkdoxies	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	I have been with Furry Kids for about 1 1/2 years now and it has been an awesome experience! The volunteers are all very professional and knowledgeable about the rescues they have. They are all very "hands on" when it comes to working with all the animals. I believe that having our animals in foster homes as opposed to being housed in a shelter gives them (the animals) and us (the volunteers) more one on one time making our animals more socialized and ready to enter a forever home. We are able to see how the animals interact with our family members a well as our own animals. We at Furry Kids have a mission to bring loving families and needy animals together in order to build a healthy bond and a lasting/loving friendship. 
Furry Kids Refuge	105085		/users/profile/141064	tmbren	Client Served	5	01/31/2012	    We recieved a mini Aussie pup that has become part of the family. The pup serves as a watchdog and early warning system since we live in the country. If vehicles come turn on to our road, he perks-up.   The dog was in excellent shape physically and well cared for at the recue.   When our vet looked him over, he gave his care a great review. The pup made an easy adjustment to our family with the support of the resuce and their advice.
Furry Kids Refuge	104929		/users/profile/140811	KellyO	Client Served	5	01/30/2012	My family includes two rescue dogs from Furry Kids, and I would recommend this fantastic organization to anyone looking for a pet. The people of Furry Kids made sure they connected me with pets that worked with my lifestyle and wishlist, and they went out of their way to make the adoption process an easy one. I think it is fantastic that Furry Kids offers clients a two week trial period to make sure a new pet is a good fit for the family. The people of this organization do the best job they can to set up successful adoptions, and I could not be more grateful to them for providing me with my dogs, Rudy and Benny. 
Furry Kids Refuge	104893		/users/profile/140761	andyspalace	Volunteer	5	01/30/2012	Ego's are left at the door with Furry Kids Refuge, as volunteer's are too busy with placing, grooming, training, and loving the "Furry Kids".  This is the most unified group I've ever seen!  Last summer, a foster got loose and no less than 4 of us "hit" the Independence Animal Shelter to find him and/or spent hours driving around the area the pup was lost ---needless to say we found him.  Have never seen a "kid" placed for adoption that wasn't "ready to go", meaning happy and healthy when adopted...nor heard of an animal being turned away.  This group is dedicated to the protection and care of these little "refugees" and all of us take this very seriously...Foster care with this group seems very, very special too...these "babies" adore their foster Mom's and Dad's.  I am very proud to be a member and hope to do more in the future (meaning fostering)
Furry Kids Refuge	104890		/users/profile/140045	Bwiliker	Client Served	5	01/30/2012	We became aware of Furry Kids Refuge thru our vets office when we were needing to fill a hole left by the passing of one of our dogs.  Success!  We have had him for 5 years now and cant imagine our home without him.  This last summer we had a stray show up and stay at our home.  I contacted Carla to see if they could take him as we already had 2 dogs and it would be impossible to keep him.  They did not have any vacancies at that time but if we could hold on a little longer, she could see what she could do.  They did find a foster home for him and just recently he found a forever home.  It was such a relief for us to be able to call someone to help and know he would have good care until he was adopted.  Thank you Furry Kids Refuge for all you do and certainly hope you get the support you deserve.  This organization is great!
Furry Kids Refuge	104707		/users/profile/140464	Carol34	Volunteer	5	01/27/2012	I was honored to become a volunteer of Furry Kids Refuge this year.  I have never known a group  to work so hard and never complain.  I have seen many, many dogs & cats brought back to good health and the group work their tails off at fundraisers to pay the vet bills, and never complain.  I  have seen this group foster many dogs & cats, sometimes for months, some more difficult than others, and never complain.  I  have seen this group come to adoption events every week, set up many cages, tables, supplies, and tents, and take it all down and pack it up that night, and never complain.  I have seen the pure joy on the faces of each  volunteer when they have found  the perfect home for one of their dogs or cats, and their have been many, many of  them.  I am proud and honored to be a member of Furry Kids Refuge.
Furry Kids Refuge	104606		/users/profile/140276	Max07	Volunteer	5	01/26/2012	I have been fostering dogs with Furry Kids Refuge for 5 years.  Some of these dogs required many months (and extensive veterinary care) to heal their physical and emotional wounds.  But Furry Kids Refuge and their dedicated volunteers never give up on them, and it is so rewarding (and amazing) to see these dogs blossom when given what most of us consider the basics (food, affection and  necessary veterinary care).  And  pictures, emails, phone calls and/or visits from the our former fosters and their "forever families" spur you to take in another dog who just needs to be loved ... and has so much love to give in return.  
Furry Kids Refuge	104484		/users/profile/140105	dana.conyers	Volunteer	5	01/25/2012	I have been lucky enough to be a foster mom with Furry Kids' Refuge for over a year now.  I have loved every minute of it!  The other volunteers, board members, and foster parents are all wonderful and loving people who truly care about the well-being of the animals.  I have worked with other rescue groups before but this group exceeds them all.  Even while the number of homeless animals seem to keep climbing (and adoption rates may slow down), FKR continues to do their best to help each animal in need.  The adoption process is very fair as are the adoption fees because each animal is spay/neutered, heartworm tested (FIV/ Feline Leukemia tested in cats), microchipped and vaccinated before going to their forever home!  I'm very proud to continue to be a foster mom for this group!

I appreciate all that you do, and I have referred many friends and family to your organization!

Furry Kids Refuge	104401		/users/profile/139990	duchs2454	Board Member	5	01/24/2012	I became an adopter first.  A little Pekenise stole my heart when I was going shopping at Target, right next door to PetCo where Furry Kids Refuge was doing their adoptions.  They were such a neat group of people that I started fostering for them and have been doing so for over 3 years now.  Watching a fostered dog grow and blossom, despite its previoius treatment, is one of the most rewarding things that I have experienced and I will continue to do it for as long as possible.  FKR cares for their dogs no matter the cost.  
Furry Kids Refuge	104395		/users/profile/139981	CJWING	Board Member	5	01/24/2012	I have had the joy of being the founder of Furry Kids' Refuge. I say this with complete honesty that this group would not be as wonderful and productive as it is without the foster homes, volunteers, members and public who support us on a daily basis. Furry Kids' Refuge has the most dedicated volunteers, foster families, members, adopters and donors. The individuals that support us are what make us strong & determined to make a difference in every animal that crosses our paths. WE are determined to do what is needed to ensure the health of every animal we take into our program, no matter the expense. Our group believes that every animal deserves respect, love, proper veterinary care, rehabilitation if needed and whatever is needed to help the animal become adoptable. We are their guardians.

Everyone goes the extra mile and does everything they can to make sure these animals never go back to the abuse/abandonment/neglect they came from. 
Furry Kids Refuge	103510		/users/profile/138302	lbacon1024	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	I have been a foster parent with Furry Kids for about a year now. It started when I adopted a furry kid at their Saturday adoptions at Petco. I was so impressed with the love and dedication all the people involved displayed that I signed up tho foster. It has been a wonderful experience. Everyones main concern is the health and well being of all the animals. There is no facilaty so all the Kids are fostered and have a home environment. 
Furry Kids Refuge	103486		/users/profile/137530	jtiffany_8	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	Furry Kids' Refuge takes such good care of the animals in their care.   They are no-kill, so if an animal needs time to get healthy either physically or emotionally/socially, they give the animal that time - as long as it takes.  This is truly an awesome group that I'm proud to be part of.

I met one of the Volunteers to meet our future prospective cat, and I knew immediately that these people were focused on the well being of the animal so much more than the other places we have visited. They know their animals inside and out, and they genuinely care that they find good and loving homes for them.

Furry Kids Refuge	103292		/users/profile/137462	Catie C.	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	Furry Kids' Refuge is not a shelter and has no paid employees. They are staffed by an all volunteer team who have jobs, families, and pets of their own.   Yet they still manage to save hundreds of homeless and unwanted animals, providing them with the love and care needed, and eventually, a forever home. I have volunteered with Furry Kids since 2008 and I am proud to be associated with this group.

I was immediately touched by the people they serve, realizing that they, through no fault of their own, needed help from an outside organization like Life Skills.  People with developmental disabilities can be productive members of society if they're given a chance, and the wonderful people at Life Skills do just that.  I had always wanted to give back to the community in some way, and volunteering with Life Skills has been an extremely rewarding experience for me!
Easterseals Midwest	181105		/users/profile/237814	jboemer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I have been volunteering for Life Skills since April, and I have nothing but positive experiences from doing so.  Life Skills not only puts together events for a variety of people, but they also chose a variety of places to hold them at.  This is good because every event is different which makes it more exciting for everyone!  You can tell when you attend these event that the staff and volunteers are passionate about what they do and they always have a smile on their face. It makes it a very welcoming environment.  I work at Life Skills and I can say that look forward to volunteering at these events because, overall, it benefits the clients and their families :)

I have volunteered at the yearly golf tournament, the Walk/Run & Roll from its inception, at the various resource fairs and as personal as helping individual clients move from one apartment to the other.  At every event Life Skills shows it's appreciation to those that give their time and energy in the service of their clients.  It is a pleasure volunteering for this organization because their dedication to those they serve is evident in everything they do.  They are entirely committed to making every client an integral part of their community and not shoved aside and hidden from sight.  Life Skills/TouchPoint Autism services is the leader in this field and I am honored to be a part of them.

Easterseals Midwest	135740	1	/users/profile/181622	westmckee	Board Member	5	11/08/2012	Rarely does one find an organization run as well as LIfe Skills.  Most are aware of the deeply compassionate care Life Skills clients receive, along with the massive increase in Autism services provided by the Touch Point arm of the organization.   As a Board Member, I feel it is important to point out a few practical issues LIfe Skills (LS) solves.  As a community based provider, LS clients feel the same pride as we felt when we got our own place.  Living, working and interacting with the community is paramount to our clients.  In decades past, people with disabilities were sent of to habilitation centers (barrack style living) at the advice of doctors. it was the only way people knew how to help in those days.  Now we know greater quality of life for our clients is found in the community, which also exposes neighborhoods to more diverse lifestyles and allows neighbors to interact with our clients. The many LF clients who work, pay taxes and add their talents to their workplace.  I am proud to be a small part of LS, it allows me a way to help change people's lives in a proven and practical way.  -Weston McKee

I can tell the top priority of the organization and the staff is the clients. My favorite event was the Family Event at the Missouri Botanical Garden. Each Life Skills client and his/her family were invited to experience areas of the garden after it had closed. The amount of joy and excitiment coming from each client made me truly believe this organization is changing lives.

My sister and I got together a group to work for a school-wide service day and have loved it ever since. This past summer, we worked mostly in preparation for the auction, and I could not have been more pleased. Each time my sister and I would come in, there was a list of things for us to do and we were instantly put to work. Volunteering was very enjoyable and always productive. While volunteering throughout the summer, my sister and I really got to see the progression of our work as we saw the things we helped with happen in the auction. I would volunteer again in a heartbeat!

It was fun, I got paid a few bucks and my involvement could have just ended there, but the passion and commitment I witnessed in all of the LifeSkills employees stirred something in me. I got in contact with the volunteer coordinator and have been involved in numerous events ever since. Not as a paid entertainer, but as a volunteer! Each and every event I've been involved with I have to just say WOW! And, what else can I do to be involved! And When's the next event? Not only do the many dedicated employee's serve LifeSkills clients, they go out of their way to take care of their volunteers! Their Passion, Commitment, Dedication....it's contagious! In addition to all of the wonderful praise and accolades one could go on about LifeSkills and it's mission to serve, they are just good caring people!

The Life Skills staff members had clearly invested countless hours into preparing for an event of such magnitude; it was really special to be a part of it all.  From the silent auction to the oral auction after dinner, to just the production as a whole ran so smoothly. But at the heart of it all you could really tell all of the staff had their hearts in the right place.  Making the lives of their clients better was clearly at the forefront of everyone's efforts, and was definitely the main focal point of the evening.  I've already committed to volunteering at another event later this year, and I can't wait to be a part of the Life Skills team again!!

USO of Missouri	292212		/users/profile/382707	Clacbl	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	I have volunteered for this USO for 3 years and am continually impressed by what our facilities have to offer. I am also thanked many times each shift by troops that feel our facility has made their travel process much easier.
USO of Missouri	292187		/users/profile/382682	Kristy25	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	The USO has been such a blessing to me!  We are told we by our military how thankful they are for all we do. In reality, it's the least we can do!  It's do amazing to be an encourager to these brave men and women. 
USO of Missouri	292182	1	/users/profile/382676	Charles71	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	I was privileged to serve as a volunteer for 4 years and then it was necessary to leave the area. It was always a pleasure to help the new inductees as they made their way to training. One in particular comes to mind. A young woman came in with her papers for her future. I could tell she was nervous when she came to the desk to check in.  I welcomed her and told her the USO was like a home away from home. She was still apprehensive  and said she was going to call her recruiter. When she returned she was all smiles. I asked her what her recruiter said? She smiled laughed and said " He told me the same thing, "The USO is your home away from home". I know other volunteers have enjoyed similar experiences. It is a great place to share time with our military and their families.

General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2016	Excellent service through 2 facilities and a mobile unit that travels to Southern IL Counties and all of Missouri!!

USO of Missouri	292158		/users/profile/382650	Writer	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	Enjoying 'giving back' to our current and retired military personnel.Seeing new recruits coming and going to their duty stations, wide eyed and ready to help defend our great nation, gives me a great deal of satisfaction. The USO of MO offers temporary relief from their training, or upcoming deployment, where the soldiers can relax for a while and get free amenities and good tasting food. 
USO of Missouri	292147	1	/users/profile/382639	Writer	Volunteer	4	06/05/2016	Veteran now in my fifth year as a USO volunteer. The board, staff and my fellow volunteers are simply the best. Everyone understands  exactly why we volunteer there and contributes accordingly. Careful vetting and regular re-training programs  provide high quality services our guests deserve and expect. Financial support from individuals and corporations is consistent and significant. This USO is a first-class organization. It is a privilege to volunteer here.
USO of Missouri	292137		/users/profile/382622	sheila845	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	The USO volunteers and staff continually strive to help our service men and women and their families in every way we can.

USO of Missouri	292131		/users/profile/382616	lorah	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	Volunteering at the USO has been very rewarding to me.  It is an honor to serve the wonderful young men and women who come through the doors.  They are always so grateful for the services available to them and always comment on the facilities.  Coming from a family with current and past military members, working there is the least I can do. I love it!

USO of Missouri	292121	1	/users/profile/382606	Stu K.	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	I began volunteering at the USO of Missouri 5,700 volunteer hours ago.  Each hour has been the most rewarding experience my wife and I ever had.This past month my wife and I were awarded "the unsung heroes" award for our volunteer efforts.  It was recognition of how deeply we feel toward our troops, their mission and their sacrifice.Every volunteer I work with feels the same, our current and retired troops are wonderful and we would do anything for them.Everything the USO of Missouri does is free to the troops, retirees, reserves and guard as well as to their dependents.The troops appreciate a clean and safe place to sleep, store their "stuff" and get a good hot meal,   We have numerous computers, Wi-Fi and hundreds of movies.  We also supply newspapers and books.  Someone is also at the main terminal 24X7X365.The USO of Missouri is the best volunteer gig around, you won't find better people than our troops or our volunteers.
USO of Missouri	292120	1	/users/profile/382605	BSDRVR	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	I am a new volunteer since January of this year and I would just like to say that I am very proud of what we do. This organization is first class and the rewards of the smiles and thank you's are very motivating. I have worked at Terminal 1 about six times already and now I am a driver with the mobile units. I really enjoy going to Scott AFB and to Whiteman AFB and down to Fort Leonard Wood. Larry Dooley
USO of Missouri	292115	3	/users/profile/382599	sarahcuse	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	I am a US Navy retiree and have utilized many airport USOs during my active duty time and since.   This is a beautiful facility which has beds, recliners, computers, food, books, music and movies and more available for our servicemen and women.   I love it so much that I now volunteer there, so look for me on the overnight shift!  It is always open and a wonderful place to come home to.
USO of Missouri	292113	4	/users/profile/382597	darlenespihlmann	Volunteer	5	06/04/2016	I have been volunteering with The USO of Missouri for approximately 5 years. It is one of the most  rewarding activities I have ever done. Whether it is helping new recruits at the main terminal, a family gathering at Scott AF Base, a BBQ cook-off at Whiteman AF Base or a graduation at Ft. Leonardwood, you will enjoy the time interacting and serving our brave service people. I highly recommend this not-for-profit group as a place to volunteer or a much needed donation.  The USO of Missouri is the way to go!
Ready Readers	274412	1	/users/profile/363811	MissR	Volunteer	2	12/14/2015	The concept behind Ready Readers is powerfully simple and serves a need in every community.  I am pleased to be a part of the program.  Both the children I read to and I learn something every week as we share the adventures within the pages we read.  There are various supports and team building opportunities for volunteers to help ensure success.As an Illinois based Ready Reader, I've experienced bumps along the road that I hope will be smoothed out in the future.  Unfortunately, the rivers divide more than the land masses of Illinois and Missouri.  To be effective in each jurisdiction, organizational representatives must come to understand and work with each area in ways that the prospective community will embrace.  Otherwise we are doomed to fail leaving behind an unintentional but real trail of frustration and second class resentments.
Ready Readers	269996	1	/users/profile/358726	Sarah282	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	Ready Readers is an incredible way to build strong community foundations.  It connects higher risk pre-schoolers with quality literature, exposure to adults that love reading as well as provides the framework for in-home reading.  Strong beginnings yield measurable, favorable results for students, families, and communities.
Ready Readers	269654		/users/profile/358374	Melissa289	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2015	The readers love what they do. In teaching, that makes such a difference. The model of the same reader with the same class for a school year is critical for the relationship between the kids and the reader to develop into one of trust and joy. This is a fantastic organization! 
Ready Readers	269529		/users/profile/358254	Writer	Board Member	5	10/29/2015	Amazing group with incredible volunteers and employees who are trying to combat illiteracy. 
Ready Readers	269517	1	/users/profile/358242	Pat_68	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	This organization has certainly far exceeded my own expectations! I helped start Ready Readers in 1997. Today, I am a just an honorary board member, but I am also a volunteer reader. Like many other readers,  I feel that I get as much from each of my weekly reading session as as the children do, and I always want to give them more. The best thing I ever did for the organization was retire in 2005, so it could evolve into the amazing organization it is now. With its small staff and its strong management, Ready Readers' 500+ volunteers are reading weekly and giving quality books to about 10,000 low-income preschool children in our area. This isn't just talk, but rather a hands-on effort to help break the scourge of poverty and illiteracy, which is at  the root of so many problems in our area and in every city.
Ready Readers	269347		/users/profile/358074	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I have been reading with Ready Readers for well over a decade and it is an absolute joy to see the children's faces when we read to them.  Their enthusiasm and joy is catching.  
Ready Readers	269321		/users/profile/358045	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I read for this amazing program. I have been with ready readers nearly three years. I see the difference in the children as they learn to love books. 
Ready Readers	269312		/users/profile/358037	Ashlee4	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I started at Ready Readers because my mom was doing it and I thought it was one of the most amazing things ever!! I have been reading for almost 2 years now and I have loved every minute of it. Thank you Ready Readers for giving me a chance to make a difference in the lives of the children that I read to. 
Ready Readers	269282		/users/profile/358008	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I have volunteered for Ready Readers as a reader.  It was such an amazing experience for me to get to go to these pre-schools and read to the kids and see the pure joy on their faces when they got to take home their very own copy of the book I read to them.  Ready Readers shares the joy of reading and empowers these kids to learn to love to read.  
Ready Readers	266174		/users/profile/354940	Patjones	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	I have been a volunteer reader for Ready Readers for five years, and can't say enough about how wonderful this organization is!  Led by the terrific Lisa Greening, the staff is compassionate, exhuberant, and genuinely love what they do.  I am honored to be part of this organization, and would encourage anyone who loves to read to little ones to please consider volunteering for Ready Readers!
Ready Readers	265876		/users/profile/354622	Megan98	Board Member	5	10/20/2015	Ready Readers is run by a passionate staff.  The volunteers are given many training opportunities and support.  Volunteers are truly appreciated.  The simple act of reading aloud to low income preschool students results in measurable increases in the skills and activities necessary to help these kids start kindergarten ready to learn to read. 
Ready Readers	265857	1	/users/profile/354602	Writer	Donor	5	10/20/2015	Ready Readers in St. Louis is amazing! The board is committed to their mission, the executive director and staff are devoted professionals and the volunteers are involved and loyal. I donate to this organization and ask my friends to do the same. Ready Readers is a good steward of their resources and gets the job done. I rank them at the top of nonprofits in the region.
Ready Readers	265570		/users/profile/354304	Pokie	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	The continued dedication of hundreds of individuals only makes this program more special. The children are full of smiles ear to ear when you walk in a room to read to them!
Ready Readers	265546		/users/profile/354281	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	I have been a reader and donor for about five years and it is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had.  I truly feel my weekly trip to the pre-school brings extra learning and joy to the children and the teachers!  The children LOVE to read and LOVE to receive the books Ready Readers provides.  They take the books home and read to family members which is so important.  I know they do this, because when we read the stories I have sent home with them they know so much word for word!  A fabulous organization to support - with donations and/or time!
Ready Readers	265530		/users/profile/354265	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Having worked with and for several nonprofits over the last 20+ years, I'm impressed by how much Ready Readers achieves with such a small staff.  Seven incredibly hard working people do a yeoman's job of training and guiding more than 500 volunteers to serve at-risk children across the St. Louis metropolitan area.  No frills here, which I appreciate.  My donations are actually used to serve the children.
Ready Readers	200934		/users/profile/262354	sara.t	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	I have been reading for Ready Readers since November 2012.  I feel it is an honor to volunteer for this organization.  Ready Readers is growing by leaps and bounds.  When people ask what I have been doing since my retirement.  I proudly say I read for West Florrisant Head Start to children ages 3-5.  The kids are hilarious, and they make me laugh.  My name which is one syllable but quicklybecomes a two/ three syllable word when I walk into their class room. To keep their attention which is hard to do some days, I use the tools we are provided in our training session. I hope to be with this Ready Readers for many years,
Ready Readers	196130		/users/profile/256417	8Kath	Volunteer	5	03/21/2014	My sister's friend does this, and when my sister found out about it, she said that she knew that I'd definitely volunteer - and I did.  At the moment, I'm reading at 2 schools - 5 classes of kids of different ages.The days I read to them are the best days of the week for me.  They LOVE the time they spend, and they have their favoriie books.  And they LOVE getting their own books.It's wonderful to see them really love to have someone read to them, and the kids (4- & 5-year olds) are really happy when they start learning to read and are able to pick words out.This is the greatest organization, and I'm so happy to be a volunteer.  If everybody supported Ready Readers,  lots of kids would have a wonderful opportunity to do more with their lives.  Reading helps people in so many ways............Kathy
Ready Readers	195933		/users/profile/256209	lnicole080808	Donor	5	03/20/2014	I first partnered with Ready Readers through a professional networking event. I was inspired to use them as the chartable partner for my company's annual meeting. My contact with Ready Readers, Lisa Greening, was great to work with and made everything simple. The employees at my company enjoyed the book drive and almost doubled our goal of 500 books donated! It was great to be able to help out a great organization, which helps so many children in our communities. 
Ready Readers	195870		/users/profile/256135	Dinah2	Client Served	5	03/19/2014	When I was the childcare director of St. Nicholas Preschool, Ready Readers  volunteered at the center(they still do!).One of their volunteer organizations provided our center with 300 books to start a library.The parents were able to check out books and read to their children in the library. Thanks Ready Readers  for your continuous service to the St. Louis Community and surrounding  areas.
Ready Readers	195857		/users/profile/256123	jenniem38	Volunteer	5	03/19/2014	Reading to my 3-5 year olds has enriched both my life and theirs.  When I get there, the excitement level rises with expectation of fun through reading. I am retired and my Mondays are now the best day of my week. A friend told me about Ready Readers and once I started reading, I was hooked.I also do projects for Valentines day (cards with their pictures on them), bunny baskets are coming for  spring and something yet to be decided for the end of the school year. They love the books they get to take home and can't wait until I bring the next one to give to them. They are gracious and grateful.The teachers have been a great support and help me with everything I do.
Ready Readers	195846		/users/profile/256112	jank	Volunteer	4	03/19/2014	Although I am still working... I wanted to give back to the community in some way.  A client told me about Ready Readers and immediately I thought I should try it.  I read to 5 year olds... and they love it and I love it.  They give much more to me through their love and smiles!!!  I am glad that I found Ready Readers and it truly is a GREAT organization!!!  Janet - Fenton, MO
Ready Readers	195489		/users/profile/255556	Cheryl84	Volunteer	5	03/10/2014	After working in early childhood for many years, I retired.  It was great to find a wonderful organization for which to volunteer that let me continue to interact with young children.  Books, singing, laughing and sharing are the key ingredients of the time I spend in the 3 classrooms.  The children and teachers enjoy getting books to keep at home and for the classrooms, have fun and get to build their love of books, words and learning new things through reading.  It is an amazing organization that supports volunteers, teachers and children.
Alder Hill Farm	149207	2	/users/profile/198790	Brenda35	General Member of the Public	1	02/10/2013	Funds were used for Leslie's own personal desires. Not the horses. Alder Hill is under investigation after Leslie watched her own horse starve while refusing vet care, and feed from volunteers. 
Alder Hill Farm	78625	2	/users/profile/85908	EquineGirl105	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	I have not seen a bad photo on facebook or heard a bad thing about Adler Hill Farms. If I had the money and the transportation I would adopt a horse there in a heartbeat!!!
Alder Hill Farm	78560		/users/profile/85841	Soso Whaley	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	Alder Hill Farm is run by a wonderful group of people who truly address the best interests of the animals that find their way to this shelter.  They have had many successful placements and it is so much fun to watch as they bring these horses in and help them all through Facebook status updates and photos.  It is such an inspiring group that I've even donated a few dollars here and there to help with transport of an animal.  They certainly deserve to win that $5,000 which will help so many more animals.
Alder Hill Farm	64240		/users/profile/70223	Starlene C.	Board Member	5	02/07/2011	Alder Hill Farm goes far and above the call of duty in regards to horse resecue.  All of the horses are well cared for in every manner.  Alder Hill Farms keeps all interested party's involved in the daily operations and development of each and every horse via facebook and thru its website.  Once a horse is ready for adoption and is adopted, Alder Hill Farm continues it's relationship with that horse and new owner to insure the continued safety and health of the horse is maintained. If for ANY reason the horse needs to return it can, no questions asked. Alder Hill Farm plain and simple cares and shows it every day.
Alder Hill Farm	64024		/users/profile/69991	Katie C.	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	This is by far the best horse rescue in the nation. Updates and Photographs posted daily on facebook. Sometimes hourly. Open and honest. This rescue cares about the horses from rescue, to adoption and beyond.  Farm is open to visitors. 
Alder Hill Farm	63753		/users/profile/69694	Patti S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	I have personal experience with Alder Hill Farm and would recommend them highly to anyone.  I visited them in person in Oct. of 2010 and saw for myself that their horses are very well taken care of, and are in wonderful shape.  Their facilities are more than adequate for the number of horses that they have; they have many acres for the horses to live on in a natural herd setting, plus they grow their own hay.  The horses were all in good weight, hooves were in great shape, and the horses were very friendly.  You can tell how much Leslie and Scott, et al, love the horses when you see them interacting with them. I also like very much that the owners of the rescue are professional people, so the rescue is financially stable.  In addition, they are very knowledgeable about horses.  Scott in particular works wonders with horses with problems. The day I visited, Scott and Jonathan (Leslie was out of town that day) took the whole afternoon out of their busy day to show us around the different areas and introduce us to the horses.  I was extremely impressed by their expertise and obvious caring for the horses in their care. Another thing I really like is that when someone adopts a horse, Alder Hill will work with the adopter to make sure that they and the horse are a good fit, and will give the adopter training on the new horse.  I'm sure that this would prevent horses having to be returned and facilitates happy new horse adopters. I have gotten a bit cynical about some rescues because of a few cases where a rescue turned into a trainwreck.  But I can attest that this rescue is one of the GOOD ones, and I look forward to supporting them (and visiting them again) in the future!  Any horse that finds itself at Alder Hill Farm is a very lucky horse!
Alder Hill Farm	62620		/users/profile/68455	Tambie40	Client Served	5	02/02/2011	Alder Hill Farm is a wonderful organization that actually cares about the horses and the people involved with each case.  I have been friends with Alder Hill Farm on FaceBook for a couple months. Enjoying all the stories and pictures. Following their progress and remembering how much I love horses. I have donated what I could and sale items on eBay and donate part of the proceeds them. On Jan 22, 2011 some close personal friends of mine lost their home due to a fire. Worse still they lost two precious children. Both parents were in critical condition also. I contacted Leslie and told her the situation. There was no one to care for Paul their horse. Leslie raised the funds quickly and drove over 4 hours to come get him and care for him while his people were recovering. Leslie has been the best about keeping us posted on Paul's progress and condition. Leslie has offered the family several options for Paul. She never pushes and is kind and understanding. This is what a real rescue is all about. They stepped up when the family and Paul needed their help. God Bless her and all her helpers! Paul could have gotten into real trouble really fast with ALDER HILL FARM'S help. Thank you!
Alder Hill Farm	62600		/users/profile/65117	Jocelyn S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	I have dealt with Leslie and Alder Hill Farm through a Facebook connection.  She has shown me in our dealings to be a very upright, honest person, which I am beginning to realize in the rescue world is a rarity.  If I were closer to her rescue, I would happily adopt a future horse from her.  I feel that she has the best interests of the horse at heart, again, a rarity in the  rescue world.  I look forward to continue our relationship online and maybe one day soon, we will meet in person.  Thank you for what you do, Leslie!
Alder Hill Farm	62598		/users/profile/68432	Jaqhaq	General Member of the Public	5	02/02/2011	I have observed Alder Hill Farm for a very long time. I have watched closely and seen the way that they conduct themselves. I have found them to be completely above board, transparent and open and honest in their dealings. Their love of horses is evident.  They work very hard to help horses in need - no matter the breed, age, sex or ability to work. They are good, honest and hard working people who make a huge difference in horses lives - horses that would otherwise likely be sent to slaughter.  Alder Hill Farm is top notch in my opinion, and this money will be put to excellent use. 
Alder Hill Farm	62597		/users/profile/68431	slack959	Donor	5	02/02/2011	I love everything about this rescue and their work. They always step in where it is needed and no task of rescue is too small or big. Each horse there is treated as indivual not a herd. The Williams and Scott do awesome work and thank goodness they are there to help where it is needed. KEEP up the great work!  They not only save lives, but also heal the horses from inside out. Get them ready for a forever home! 
Alder Hill Farm	60833		/users/profile/66291	Audrey B.	Client Served	5	01/24/2011	   I implore you to read this entire review!   I found Alder Hill Farm on Facebook while in a search to rescue a horse. This would be my second horse, my first had died a few months prior. I was devastated but I still wanted to take my time to find the right fit for my life. I was looking for a horse that would be my new trail buddy and friend.   They were very open and forthcoming to answering any questions I had about their horses. They also have lots of pictures of the horses during their training so you know what they say is fact. Several of their horses had caught my eye and I often visited their page on Facebook to see what was new or which horses were completing training soon.   I spent a lot of time, months, looking at different rescues online all across the United States looking to find the perfect fit for me and this very important relationship I wanted to have with my next horse. I live in California and I just wasn't satisfied with the horses I had met locally, even though they would be great fits -- but for someone else. I didn't feel a connection with those horses and I wanted to expand my search.    Alder Hill Farm has a huge selection of horses and I was drawn to them because of their trainer, Scott Litherland, and his candid descriptions of his experiences working with these horses. One picture of a horse on it's first trail ride was a picture I kept going back to. I liked how relaxed the horse looked, especially because there appeared to be no trail. The picture had a comment below by a person expressing desire to acquire the horse. I sadly dismissed it for a while until I decided to ask if that horse was still available. To great excitement and luck he was! That's when I chose to visit their facility in Missouri to meet this guy and make sure this horse and I got along.    I was very nervous flying out to Missouri from California all by myself to follow my heart. To see about a horse. Leslie Maxwell, the ranch owner, had offered to put me up at her place, which made me feel awfully special, put me at ease, and warmed my heart. Leslie is quite a woman! Very confident, friendly, humorous, sincere, a great person to be around and want to know.    We grabbed some snacks at the mini mart and she took me right out to meet my new friend. Upon arriving to the pasture they were in, they all came up to the fence to see her and this new person she had brought. First I met 5 or 6 of the horses, including the one I came to see. (He is now named Ranger, so yes, I adopted him)    The horses were all very friendly. Ranger kept following me around, let me pet his face and gave up his feet for cleaning willingly. He was a lot shorter than my last horse and this grew to be my only reluctance to adopt him. He nuzzled me and was very affectionate and trusting, sweet and confident. My guard was up but I still fell for him.    While I was there I even got to meet the 'wild' herd. The mass of horses that have had no more than halter training. They get to run and play, be the lovely creatures that they are. Even with a complete stranger (me) amongst them, they were gentle and curious.    During my stay I was reading a book by Louis L'amore. I came across a line that ended up convincing me that this horse's height didn't matter. "In horses, dogs, and men, it is character that counts." This horse certainly had character. I have a test I do with a new horse~ will it let me place my cowboy hat on his head? Well, as you can imagine he passed the test. Still, I didn't decide to adopt until a month after I had returned home. Leslie was very patient and understanding, and probably relieved that I would take such care to make sure he was going to be my new forever friend.   I highly recommend anyone searching for a great horse to make a visit to their facility and prepare to be wowed. They even transported him all the way to California for me at a discounted rate compared to a stranger's service. Amazing! Our future together is looking quite spectacular. 
Alder Hill Farm	60285		/users/profile/65473	lilacvalley	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2011	Leslie Maxwell is open, honest and caring.  I'd recommend her orgainzation to anyone who wants honest horse rescue!
Alder Hill Farm	60268		/users/profile/65450	Wendy E.	Client Served	5	01/17/2011	I adopted two horses from AHF in 2005.  Unfortunately my financial circumstances changed and I could no longer care for them.  When I contacted Leslie about this, she was gracious and understanding and immediately offered to come get them pursuant to AHF's guarantee that all of their adoptees have a permanent place at AHF.  I am so relieved that "my boys" had a safe place to return and hopefully get re-homed.  I have every confidence in AHF and in Lesiie... she is one of the most committed, dedicated people I have ever met.  This organization deserves special attention for the incredible work it does.
Alder Hill Farm	60154		/users/profile/65310	Carly H.	General Member of the Public	5	01/15/2011	Had a wonderful time visiting with everyone! Will have to come back and stay longer! It was a very interesting time seeing how things were at the farm.  It takes a lot of work to keep that place up and running.  I think it was amazing that Leslie and Scott knew all the horses by name.  I would have trouble!  LOL!  I enjoyed talking to Leslie and Scott. It's always nice to be able to share helpful information with other horse folks.  I think its really awesome what u guys do and my hat is off to you all at Alder Hill!
Alder Hill Farm	60034		/users/profile/65156	Carol H.	General Member of the Public	5	01/13/2011	I took my 12 year old granddaughter to Alder Hill Farms first official Visitors Day and we had the best time!  It was really interesting watching the dynamics that went on between a few horses and visitors.   Both Leslie and Scott know each individual horse which is probably the reason they are able to make such good matches/adoptions.  Alder Hill isnt just about finding a home of their horses; they know the importance of finding the right person for that horse. Any horse owner that would happen to find themselves in the awful situation of needing to find their beloved horse a home needn't look any farther than this organization.  The compassion, sincerity and professionalism of those that represent Alder Hill is truly a blessing.  If I were looking to purchase another horse I would most definitely give Alder Hill a call.  Outstanding horses, any breed, any color.    
Alder Hill Farm	60012		/users/profile/65126	JoDeen W.	Donor	5	01/13/2011	Last year we moved and were unable to move our 4 horses.I was panicking trying to figure out where they would go.I contacted several rescues.I did not want my horses to end up in slaughter.Leslie at Alder Hill Farm and 1 other rescue were the only ones who contacted me back.The 1st rescue that contacted me, I felt really uneasy with what she was telling me.Leslie contacted me and I immediately knew this was where my horses needed to go.She has gone above and beyond for them.2 have found forever homes. The other 2 are still in semi training.Leslie and Craig are great folks.I am so happy that I found them when I did.

Alder Hill Farm	59949		/users/profile/65028	kathy	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2011	Tell your story here and help others understand this charity after having a really bad experience with another so called rescue, i was leary of alder hill. it turned out to be a totally different and refreshing experience. leslie, craig and scott were open, friendly and obviously love what they do. i was impressed with the way the horses loved them! all the horses were well nourished and had nice tootsies:)  scott is a true natural with horses and knows his stuff. nice to see  a rescue with a fulltime, qualified  trainer on board. leslie is always available by phone or email.   alder hill is the real deal and i would strongly recommend them if you are looking to  adopt. 
Alder Hill Farm	59942		/users/profile/65021	Sue S.	Donor	5	01/12/2011	I love this rescue!  I donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of some of my horse paintings to help this rescue for several months now.  I choose to support them on a referral of a friend.  I was so happy to see they consistently do what is right for the horses, are straightforward and honest in their dealings with people and their horses look happy and well cared for. Also as a donor they do a great job of recognizing the contribution I and others do for the rescue which is icing on the cake and makes the supporters feel valued.   I plan on continuing to donate and support this rescue so they can keep doing what they do so well!    
Alder Hill Farm	59939		/users/profile/65018	Jammie Dinwiddie	Volunteer	5	01/12/2011	My husband and I and our 13 yr old daughter recently went to Alder Hill Farm and I was impressed with them.. not only are they honest and straightforward.. they are able (and take the time) to answer questions in a way a person (even a new horse owner) can understand..  If u ask to come to look they will do what needs to be done to make sure they can be there to show u the horses.. they didnt give me the run around like other places have done..  I will return to Alder Hill as many times as I can They are wonderful and honest people that will not steer a person wrong on purpose... they do their best to match a person with the perfect horse for them Not letting a first time horse owner get a horse that is too much for them to handle.. They know all the horses by name which is amazing itself!!! Please go visit and talk with them BEFORE u buy a horse or adopt from another rescue U wont be sorry
Alder Hill Farm	59937		/users/profile/65016	Selena W.	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2011	I can not say enough about the awesome job that Leslie and the Alder Hill Farm crew does for all the horses they take care of.  I love the way people can see where all the donations go to and get up to date information and pictures. It's great how all visitors and potential adoptees are aloud to share their experiences to the general public through visits to the farm and spending personal time with the horses. Leslie goes out of her way to make sure everyone interested in the rescue and potential adoptions get a chance to spend time with the horses, trainer and recieve valueable education.  One of the main goals at Alder Hill Farm is to make sure that these wonderful horses find forever homes and are placed with the right person. There are not many places that will evaluate the situation in it's entirty as they do at Alder Hill Farm. No matter what, Alder Hill Farm is NOT about making a quick buck! When all is said and done it's ALWAYS about the horses.  If there were more places that would take time out to evaluate the horse and potential owners properly, there would be less failed adoptions and more forever homes. These horses couldn't have been rescued by any better people than the people at Alder Hill Farms. Now with Scott being on board, you can be assured these horses are properly being retrained. Scott has many years as a natural horseman and couldn't be anymore in tune with the horses unless he became a horse!  Thank you Alder Hill Farm for all that you do and continue to do all over the country to help those in need.  Selena(Missouri)
Alder Hill Farm	59928		/users/profile/65003	Debby	Client Served	5	01/12/2011	One of the most important things to consider in addition to the condition of the animals in the care of the rescue is how transparent the financial activities of the organization are. At any one time we can trace the existence of any animal that AHF has custody of.  And in addition all financial transactions are posted on the site for all to see.  They are SO up front with their records I have never felt a need to even ASK where funds are going. AHF has a full time trainer to help insure a good future to those animals that have a need.  Do your homework....research the facility carefully.....donated funds are only as useful as the honor and integrity of the Rescue allows them to be. AHF is my personal favorite....at the very top with their ability to care for the animals, train them for the future, and ensure that every dime that we donate is used exclusively for the benefit of the horses that we love so much. Deb(Kansas)
Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	191260	2	/users/profile/249671	PSimpson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/20/2013	I will start my 22nd year with SWMOA as an employee in January.  I read an article in the newspaper in 1992 where they needed volunteers for their Income Tax Program (TCE) so I took the training and that's where my story begins.  My very first experience with the Agency were positive, they are a caring non profit organization and their goals are to assist and help change the lives of our seniors and their families.  Providing services & programs has increased the quality of seniors lives in our area.  Families have the support, help & assistance needed to help their loved ones.  I'm proud to work for an outstanding group of dedicated people that are focused on changing lives for others.  They also provide a great opportunity for people to give back to their communities by volunteering at local Senior Centers.  There isn't a greater reward than putting a smile on a persons face and making a difference in their lives.

Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	188948	1	/users/profile/246609	other	Board Member	5	11/20/2013	I have been associated with SWMOA for the past 10 years.  It carries out its mission  to assist  seniors in many ways.  SWMOA serves as a resource for seniors looking for assistance in solving issues concerned with nutrition and health and through its services to   improving the quality of life of seniors.  SWMOA is dedicated to helping seniors remain in their homes through the home delivered meals programs and personal assistance programs.  I personally have volunteered to be a tax counselor for the elderly and volunteer at a local senior center to assist the elderly in  preparation of their tax returns.  The seniors I assist are so grateful for this service as it of a free service to them.I personally refer many seniors and their caretakers to SWMOA as I know they will be directed to resources available to them in the community.  I have received very positive and appreciative responses from the individuals I have referred.

I am now a Silver Haired Legislature Senator and am secretary of its board  I have sent many people to SWMOA for different services as they are the best!

Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	188769		/users/profile/246364	chris52parker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/18/2013	25 years ago, I started volunteering at my local Senior Center, which is funded by Southwest Missouri Office on Aging.  I saw firsthand how dedicated they were to helping seniors in all aspects of aging.  So when an opportunity came to join their "team" I leaped at the chance.  I have been the Marshfield Senior Center Administrator, and an employee of SWMOA, for 3 years now, and I can truly say, I would not want to work anywhere else.  I have the best job in the world: I get paid to help people, to be "the first call for answers" for all senior needs.  It is fun, challenging, and so needed in our communities.  I look forward to coming to work every day, and how many of us can really say that we look forward to going to work? 
Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	188768		/users/profile/246363	HSR1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/18/2013	SWMOA is an organization that goes unnoticed most of the time until services are needed. SWMOA sometimes is the agency who picks up the pieces and puts the family or client back in the right direction.I have worked with the SWMOA agency for 14 years and have seen daily, the different the services SWMOA provides to enrich the lives of seniors and their families. SWMOA works to be the advocate so resources and assistance is available to help others.

Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	188765		/users/profile/246358	aurorasca	Advisor	5	11/18/2013	I have been a part of SWMOA for 3 1/2 years now.  I am involved in a local senior center on a day to day basis.  The work done there is phenomenal.  I see Seniors lives being changed because the Center is available to them.  The  majority of seniors that come are widows and widowers.  They come looking for a place to meet people, make new friends, and enjoy activities with other people their own age.  I hear many of them expressing their gratitude for the Center and how it has changed their life for the better.  They are no longer lonely and friendless.  They make lasting friendships.  They come in and go out with smiles on their faces, a spring in their step, and joy in their heart.

Southwest Missouri Office of Aging	188700		/users/profile/246258	PCB39	Board Member	5	11/16/2013	I've been a Board Member and Officer of the Executive Board of SWMOA.  It is always very gratifying to find organizations with very dedicated staff, willing to go the second mile.  This is not the norm, in today's time. With the Leadership of the CEO (Past & Present), they have built a very fine organization that has their customer's values and concerns at heart. I believe their dedication and accountability, among other things, are one of the primary reasons they are an elite organization.  Staff members at all levels show a caring and concern for all individuals they interface with. The integrity of the organization can be seen from the top down.   SWMOA is very knowledgeable on key legislative and government-related items. In my estimation, SWMOA has proven time-and-time again to be a top-notch quality organization. Paul Brockman

This is not just a job to this company, it is a passion and a voice for seniors!  If it was not for the company I could or matter of fact would not want to know where these seniors would be.  Sometimes we are the only people the seniors even communicate with, they know we care and aren't just going to let them fall in the shadows..... SWMOA provides so many services to the seniors.  The seniors know they can come to us no matter what the question or status they may live without feeling judged.  Technology grows more and more leaving behind the ones who suffered for our country.  SWMOA is very passionate in the goals we have for the seniors and we will not let them fall in the cracks.  This organization is amazing and I am blessed with the opportunity to work for them!  God Bless SWMOA and those we serve!

My passion for working with the senior population grew when I saw the need for public awareness in our community. My skills as a former educator and social worker have prepared me to conjugate resources that are applicable to this industry and develop and embody information beneficial to the community of senior citizens in which I serve.  I became a Foundation Board Member 3 yrs. ago for this very reason.  This institution fulfills all of what's needed to incorporate the needs in our community and the counties it serves.  This agency allows me to be a part of fundraising and volunteering to help increase what services that are available for the aging.

I am a member of the Silver Haired Legislature which the Southwest Missouri Office on Aging sponsors. The Silver Haired Legislature selects issues that will better or enhance the senior citizens in our state.  We then take those issues to our State Legislatures.  We continue to advocate for these issues and many have been formulated in to statute to help our most frail elderly.  Without the support of the Southwest Missouri Office on Aging, the Silver Haired Legislature would be unable to advocate as effectively for senior citizens.

In my career as a banker I have assisted many elderly customers balance the checkbooks, avoid financial scams, and provide advice on financial matters. The directory of resources for seniors and caregivers has been a staple of mine to give to caregivers or seniors that may need some form of assistance in the future. The book gives all the resources an individual may need and the contact information so when a need arises it doesn't take months to find the help that is needed. We call it the Yellow Book because it is yellow and it is just like having the yellow pages for seniors with you at all times!

Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	73472	1	/users/profile/80297	Eddie	Board Member	5	02/23/2011	Ozarks Counseling Center is a vital organization to our community.  They provide counseling services to the most vulnerable of our community, those that cannot afford even the smallest of payments for the services they receive.  The largest referral source to OCC is other not-for-profit health care organizations however OCC does not have the access to funding that these other health care organizations have.  This creates a heavy burden of finding alternative financing to meet their mission.   The staff of OCC are the most dedicated folks I have ever had the pleasure of working with and they are there truly because they are committed to the mission of OCC.

There are very few places that you will find an enthusiasm to help others and place for those who can not afford to pay. 
Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	72642		/users/profile/79407	Brittany W.	Board Member	5	02/22/2011	I am so privledged to be able to work with the Ozarks Counseling Center and see the impact they have on our community and the surrounding areas.  The center it's suppourters work tirelessly to provide counseling regardless of a individuals ability to pay. They help individual's and families put the pieces back together and base counseling fees on a sliding scale. Board and community fundraising is very important to the center so they host many events that have become fun and exciting traditions for the people of Springfield to take part in over the years. The funds raised at these much anticipated annual events is the fuel that helps the center stay committed to doing what it does best, providing quality mental health assistance.

I have been amazed to hear the heart of the counselors, staff, and board members share ways this organization has greatly helped the community.  OCC has been making dollars stretch for many years in order to continue to provide the highest quality services to people in need.  Their sliding scale for payment is a great way to make professional counseling available to those who otherwise may not be able to afford such services.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	Ozarks Counseling Center has provided counseling services to several of the clients I support. Most of the time, OCC was the ONLY resource in the community available to these individuals. OCC has worked with each referral to ensure they can afford the counseling they so badly need. OCC staff have been very caring, understanding, and professional in working with myself and clients. Unfortunately, this is something many of my clients don't encounter in the community when seeking assistance for mental heath, housing, employment, etc.  Ozarks Counseling Center is an invaluable resource to our community and citizens. The only suggestion for improvement I have includes the community as a whole providing more support so OCC can continue to offer services. 
Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	72614		/users/profile/79381	Diane Bailey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	I have used Ozark Counseling Center as a referral resource for several years.  They are one of very few facilities that care for those without the ability to pay or without adequate insurance.   The client feedback I have received is always positive and the clients are grateful for the services.  I will continue to support Ozark Counseling Center as an important community service.

Board Member	5	02/22/2011	OCC has been dealing with expanding needs stretching  resources even before the economy became an issue. The agency receives payment on a sliding scale based on ones ability to pay. Often times that is very little or nothing at all, but OCC turns away no one. As board members, we are committed to fundraising, but efforts are not able to meet demands. Our staff  responded by accepting pay and benefit cuts while dedicated themselves even further to do everything possible to meet the growing needs of people in our service area. The board is actively involved in strategic planning and has  rededicated itself to increase fundraising efforts with the short-term intent of meeting our areas mental healthcare needs and restoring  staff pay and benefits.

I have seen first hand the positive impact that OCC has made on the lives of clients who would otherwise go untreated.
Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	72569		/users/profile/79334	Geoffrey Butler	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I have been involved with Ozarks Counseling Center for many years as a volunteer Board Member.  Over those many years, I have seen the good that this organization can provide.  It is unfortunate that mental health does not get the support that other health problems do.  While breast cancer has victims, metal health problems seem to carry a stigma.  People don't really understand it and many who have problems do not like to talk about it.  Counselling can help these people dealwith their illness and make them productive members of the community.  Sadly, there is not an "Emergency Room" or "Urgent care Cetner"  for mental health where people with limited resources can go to seek help.  OCC fills that void with very limted resources.  Their policy of providing services to the community on a sliding scale provides counseling to everyone based on their ability to pay.  
Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	72493		/users/profile/79251	thomas	Board Member	5	02/21/2011	I have seen from first hand experience, the remarkable impact that the OCC has on individuals and entire families. It is an amazing process to see a person (or family) progress from a struggling environment in which they cannot handle the stresses the hard times that lay before them and become a productive member of society. Entire families turn around and become a healthy environment for parents and children. Without the OCC many of these people would have no place to turn and no hope for the future. This is an area of our society that is under served with a growing need. 
Betty And Bobby Allison Ozarks Counseling Center	72478		/users/profile/79236	ehukai	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2011	I have a friend who sought counseling services from Ozarks Counseling Center. Her husband had been laid off from his job and was experiencing depression and consequently began self medicating with illegal substances. He started lying to her and engaging in dangerous behaviors that put both my friend and her son at risk. She and her 5 year old son moved in with me when she reached the point where she did not feel safe in her own home. i am her friend, but I am not a counselor and knew she needed support through this difficult time. She saw a counselor at Ozarks Counseling Center who really gave her the support she needed. He husband and young son also received counseling. They could not have afforded a services without the sliding scale OCC provides. She was able to reconciliate with her husband and all is well now, but during the crisis moment when she really needed it, support was there because of OCC. I am personally especially grateful for the services her young son received. This child was frightened, confused and was beginning to act out. The counselor at OCC provided him with extra support helped him make it though that difficult time. To me, mental health services are as important and physical health services. Regrettably this community has difficulty accepting the critical nature of these services and mental health is often low on the list of community supported health care providers here. This is a community that still thinks that people can "pull themselves up by the bootstraps" - what they do not recognize is that depression can be as crippling as severe arthritis - neither afflicted person can function without help.

They are personally responsible for identifying and exposing phony POWs, Medal of Honor winners, US Navy Seals and others.  A number of those exposed had been fraudently receiving compensation from the Veterans Administration and other government agencies.

I have had several opportunities to personally meet Chuck and Mary. Their dedication to this issue is something you rarely find in non-profits. They have established a bond with former POW's, especially those from Vietnam who trust Chuck and Mary to expose phony POWs and support them unconditionally. They go above and beyond using many of their own resources to continue their mission. Any donation to them will be used honestly and to the full extent to help other veterans, expose phony veterans and to honor our former POWs.

Pownetwork.org has helped me realize that I am not alone and others do care of our sacrifice or death.     I only know the Schantag's by phone and or internet.  However, they are great Americans that are holding the torch that many don't care about anymore.  This is proof that we may not agree with what is going on and that we can make a difference, and have.     I gain nothing materialisticaly speaking being affiliated with pownetwork.org. Without the grunt work of the supporters it would be difficult to show the truth or deception.  I consider the Schantag's a true friend in this war against terror/deception.

In addition to being the foremost authority on post-World War II prisoners of war, they are ecumenical in their exposing of phonies from all branches. The POW Network through the diligent efforts of founders Chuck and Mary Schantag has made itself an indispensable tool for exposing those unscrupulous individuals who would ride the glory train without having earned the privilege.

They were instrumental in passage of the Stolen Valor Act, which made such fraud a federal crime.Operating a lean organization, the Schantags put their heart and soul into their mission.

P.O.W. Network	32708	2	/users/profile/33527	jim-chefie	Volunteer	5	03/08/2010	My wife and I met Chuck and Mary some years ago in Branson, as they were at an event called the Veterans Command Center. This was during the Veterans week in November. I went to look at all the military things they had and to support my stepson Jason as he was in the military. I began to speak with Chuck and Mary in casual conversation and soon realized that these people knew their stuff and were very dedicated to POW/MIAs in all wars, and being brought up in the military (Navy) this was close to my heart and life's experience anyway. I started to talk about my father who served in WWII, the Korean conflict, built the station at the South Pole, and was involved in the early years of Vietnam. My dad was suffering from cancer, and the military in its infinite wisdom said that my dad could not get all the benefits he was entitled too because after he had retired after serving 24 years then went back into civil service. Dad served in Italy for another 10 years and because of that they said it was double dipping. Chuck and Mary helped my family not only get the benefits for this great man but help extend his life for a few more years. Not only did they help us in finding our way around and through the military maze they also helped us present seven medals to my father that have been trying to find their way to him. They had them presented to this proud Sea Bee at one of their Military Galas. You would have never seen a prouder man stand of when the Admiral (after talking about this Sea Bee) called for Master Chief Lekander to come to the podium and be presented his medals. My father, passed less then a year later but he remembered that night with pride.Since then Chuck and Mary have shown us compassion and dignity with honor. Their organization is beyond approach by any person or organization including any governmental agency.  I am proud to say that they are my true friends, and they can ask anything of this military brat and I will try my best to live up to their expectations.
P.O.W. Network	32542	3	/users/profile/33353	machete	General Member of the Public	5	03/05/2010	My Experience with "POWNETWORK.ORG" I'm the Son of an M.I.A. Chuck & Mary Have helped get the word out as to what has happened to my Father; Vincent A. Scungio Major USAF, Missing In Action 4, Nov. 1966, in North Viet Nam. I have come to Mary many times for information not just about my Father, but to find out what happened to other POW's & MIA's. A few years ago I was at my Grand Parents home in New Castle Pa., my Aunt gave me a bag with the last dozen or so Original POW/MIA Bracelets with my Dad's name on them. Well I went through them & found a bracelet with another POW's name on it; CDR Robert Shumaker M.I.A. 2-11-1965. Mary led me to all the information about this American Patriot, then I wanted to know more, like how his bracelet made it into a bag with all of my Father's. Well I asked Mary to contact him & tell him my story, she did so & I got to talk with him & I found out that after he was released from the "Hoa Lo Prison" in Hanoi, he went back to his home town, same town my Father was from. Not only that but, when he returned to New Castle Pa. he went to my GrandParents home to speak with them. My Aunt that is still living told me about this day when he came to visit them.If I didn't know Chuck & Mary, and didn't have the access to their web site I might never have known the outcome of this story. Besides things like this, they expose these shameful people that claim to be POW's & Veterans, these wannabees Stealing the Honor of Our True American Patriots is one of wrost things anyone could ever do to dishonor Our Country & the Familys of True Hero's.
P.O.W. Network	32389	5	/users/profile/33206	xarmy88	Volunteer	5	03/03/2010	I met Chuck and Mary several years ago and have come to know them personally. I can honestly say that I have never met anyone who is more dedicated to the POW/MIA issues, nor have I known anyone who is more knowledgable. They took a thought and developed one of the first(if not the first) Web Sites that the public could visit and get firsthand the status of a POW or an MIA. Including a Biography. Then, because of so many requests, Mary started helping people expose Phonies and Wannabees. Once again they were the first web site that not only exposed these lowlifes but created a special place for them on their web site for the whole world to see. So complete is their information that their site has been visited by government officials both foreign and domestic. This is because Mary spends countless hours updating the site. But it doesn't stop their, they spend a lot of windshield time taking this issue to the public and it shows. So complete and reliable is the POWNETWORK that they received the blessing of a congressional investigation into the exploitation of those who would use POW/MIA for personal gain.When it comes to dedication to the cause their just isn't words to describe Chuck and Mary. It takes a special kind of person to do what they do and they will always be special to me. Thank you for including me in your work. God Bless
P.O.W. Network	10268	12	/users/profile/12138	jabrehler	Former Volunteer	5	09/12/2009	I began my experience with the POW Network when I asked for their assistance in helping me to uncover the truth behind my Biological Father's claim to have been awarded a Silver Star during peace time. After a brief conversation with both Chuck and Mary Schantag about my Military and Law Enforcement background I agreed to go to work for them on a volunteer basis, something I never regretted. I have since developed an excellent working friendship with the Schantags.I then set up my own website which at a later point a client donated a free website to me because of his appreciation for the work we (the Network) were doing for the veteran community. The victims and complaints of crimes committed by these frauds were some of the best people I have met in my 15 years of law enforcement, wanting to do what it took to bring these vermin to justice rather than being too afraid to do so. And the other Investigators within the Network are definitely the best subject matter experts in their individual fields of expertise available. I am honored to have worked with every one of them, I learned a great deal from each and every one of them. I especially enjoyed working on the Paul Lemmen case which resulted in putting an individual who made his way overseas to Iraq under a civilian contract and took it upon himself to dress up as a US Air Force Special Operations General Officer based with the US Army Special Forces which he lied too and persuaded to allow them to take him with them on patrol with them to various locations throughout Iraq to meet with dignitaries from various other countries from the region that he persuaded to make contributions for various fictitious projects that had accounts he could access directly back in his hometown in the United States. With assistance from inside sources and a Media partner I was able to bring him to justice. Lemmen also claimed to be friends with a member of the Special Forces Group based where he operated his scams out of in Iraq that was Killed In Action. He went so far as putting up a website collecting donations in the name of the deceased soldier which infuriated the surviving family members, friends and Unit members of this soldier beyond words. Yet Lemmen still had the gall to show up at the funeral wearing his General Officer's costume which immediately drew the attention of the bonafide General Officers present at the ceremony including the father of the widow. It truly was fascinating case.

They have the best records on not only phony war heroes, but real war heroes as well. They emphasize the sacrifice of our nation's missing, but they also equally protect the unparalleled valor of our nation's heroes, by keeping their legacy as pure and unencumbered by fraud and deceit. They are always immediately available, selfless, and unbending in their efforts. I often wonder if any of them ever sleep. Their only frailty is that they should promote themselves more, but hey are too humble and too busy to brag on themselves. The POWNetwork.org gets my highest, most enthusiastic recommendation and endorsement.

And they save the taxpayers beaucoups money when they expose a phony VA patient.  They also play an important role in the political process at times, like when they recently exposed a town councilman in WI.  He was forced to resign, because he had won election partly by claiming to be a Navy SEAL!  And the women whose hearts are helped by the "outing" of scores of phony heroes are direct beneficiaries of the Network's efforts.  Mary and Chuck Schantag are the best in the business.

S.C.A.N. creates conditional scholarships to those who cannot afford their nominal membership fee and provide an inclusive, social atmosphere that is crucial to a child's development.Truly a great group of people who want to make a difference.
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	197140		/users/profile/241959	Jerri H.	Board Member	5	04/05/2014	I am currently a Board member of S.C.A.N. and I am also a Social Worker just starting to work in the DD field. I have lived in the community of Lebanon my entire life and this organization is the first to offer ongoing support for additional needs children as well as typical siblings. Parents can meet monthly for support because of assistance with care from volunteers during meeting times. S.C.A.N. teaches additional needs children to give back to their community by allowing them to volunteer and do activities along with their typical siblings. The kids have volunteered with ringing bells, serving dinners and doing walk/runs. This has been an invaluable tool in allowing the children to gain self-confidence and to let their personalities to shine through for the community to see additional children for who they are as individuals.  I love working with the children and seeing how they have grown.
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	185020	2	/users/profile/241959	Jerri H.	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	S.C.A.N. is an organization born out of love. Terry Faust the director and founder is an amazing caring community leader who saw a need and worked tirelessly to fill that need. I have known Terry since our boys played soccer together in 3rd grade. These boys are both 27 years old now. Terry's typical children were raised, her youngest, the 27 year old was a senior in high school when Terry and her husband Jack took in her niece, Connie to raise. Maggie followed after that. Some place in this time I had lost touch with Terry. Both of her girls were additional needs children  and during this time S.C.A.N. was created. Simply a nonprofit organization to assist those in and around Lebanon and Laclede  County in finding resources to help their children with additional needs. I was a student at MSU studying for my social work degree when I saw an article in the paper. I wanted to be a part of this team. Going from meeting in a borrowed building to having our own place for people to come and let their children interact is a blessing to so many. Music therapy, gardening, learning about money, sibling support group and Sensory movies are only a few things S.C.A.N. has to offer. Members do group outings and celebrate holidays together also. My daughter is grown, she suffered from epilepsy when she was younger and a support group such as S.C.A.N. would have encouraged her.   
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	197090		/users/profile/257624	Amarks	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/04/2014	There was a time when this community had nothing to offer our individuals with Special needs.

My wife volunteered with them and to watch her mature through helping the children (who have become like family) warms my heart. Terry and HB are more than encouraging. They helped my wife through college, and she was a volunteer. S.C.A.N. is what every town needs! Our lives have changed since we found out about S.C.A.N.. We love them and encourage everyone to volunteer or become a member!

They are also doing great things with helping those who cannot afford or qualify for services to have an outlet that allows us to get the help that we need for free or with a minimal charge.  They are great to work with and would highly recommend to anyone.
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	185329	2	/users/profile/242289	Karen223	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	Yes, I am a board member for S.C.A.N. but would like you to know how personally involved I am with children and adults with special & additional needs. Special needs have always touched my heart and currently at our church we offer a childs & adult special needs class, I am involved with Camp Barnabas which is a camp for kids & young adults with special needs, and currently just finished up a Miracle League team for special needs adults. We own an Event Center in Stoutland, MO where we plan on hosting many special needs events. I have a brother who is also a special need adult. After all this being said, I hope by reading my review about S.C.A.N. you see the blessings it has gave this community!! TheS.C.A.N. organization offers up support, learning, and activities for children with additional needs in the Lebanon Community and others in surrounding communities. Personally being a board member for less than a year, I have seen this group grow so much. It takes money to run any type of group and when your non-profit it makes it difficult to grow on limited funds. Over the last year the S.C.A.N. organization has evolved from a tiny office to a learning and activity center. The center has been a blessing to children with additional needs. They offer a speech therapist, a computer learning center, reading programs, social interaction, life skills, and so much more. Besides all they offer at the Learning & Activity Center they offer many outside events like movies, bowling, ziplining, canoeing, gymnastics, and so much more. I can't say enough about this organization and how it can benefit the families with children with additional needs. If you have a child with additional needs and are looking for an opportunity to like S.C.A.N. you need to come check it all out!! S.C.A.N. does a lot of fundraising not only to keep their faciltiy running but help other non profit organizations like Down Syndrome, Autism, and more!!  How awesome is that? A non profit helping another non profit!! 
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	185132	2	/users/profile/242093	ksherri	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	I was introduced to this non-profit as a special education teacher.  This non-profit acted as an advocated and support team for my special needs families.  I saw how much this organization impacted their lives in a positive way and wanted to get involved.  I started sending family members there for support and education.  The organization has recently added a building where services are being offerred to families.  They have started support groups for siblings, music therapy, and many inclusion activities.  These services were desperately needed in our rural location, but were not available until the organization brought them in.  This organization has changed my life as well as the lives of many of  my families.  I am glad to be a part of it.

We have several children some with special needs, and some with out. All of our kids have  been able to participate together in social events because of S.C.A.N. The interaction has been great with other children and families.It has been a blessing since we all learn from each other. When we have questions ,we know we  have a resource to help find the answers . Terry the director has worked tirelessly and has always made herself available.   The  center has given us a great place to go for our monthly meetings. The center has also been good for the kids to get help by offering programs that help with homework, sensory issues, among other things. It has computers set up with programs to teach our kids, and an entertainment room were they can watch a movie or play interactive games that get them moving...thus helping with coordination etc. My family is happy to be part of great organization that offers so much!
Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	185010	2	/users/profile/241949	Heather123	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	S.C.A.N. started as an idea to help families and support them as they dealt with trials and tribulations that they faced daily with their additional needs child.  S.C.A.N.  has grown from this into a facility and resource for families.  S.C.A.N. has taught my children who 3 out of 4 are typical to be more respectful to those children that are just a tad different;  including adults.  My additional need kiddo has been able to socialize with other children encouraging him to be more outgoing and socialable.  This wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for that simple idea that grew into a large family.  We at S.C.A.N. have come together in ways that we help our families face their difficult challenges and we offer hope to families when they are in their lowest.  We at S.C.A.N.  dedicate ourselves in making S.C.A.N. what it is, a place to belong.

They have helped me in several different ways. One way is being a shoulder to cry on when I feel I'm at my wits end. Another way they have helped my children is by providing them with a lot of different opportunities to experence things I was afraid to take them to do for fear one might have a meltdown or some other type of outburst. I have children with R.A.D, ODD, PTSD, ADHD, Central Proccesing Disorder & PDD-NOS. S.C.A.N. is so good to help guide me in the right direction when I have a question or problem that I need assistance with. The volunteers are the BEST they know what we are going through because they have been through it themselves. I enjoy the monthly meetings getting together and helping each other.

There is no other organization providing any type of services for kids with additional needs!!  It is really nice to tell new families experiencing the overwhelming news of having a child with additional needs that there is a wonderful organization here in our town ready to help!!  Great job and thanks for all you do Katy Jones OTR/L

With a child with autism and another with ADHD & ODD, they have many resources to offer.  I personally love the monthly meetings.  It gives us parents an opportunity to be around other parents that are going through the same type of things we are.  Since childcare is provided, it gives our children the opportunity to socialize.  Our kids are so accepting of children with additional needs.  Several different programs are offered to meet each family's needs.  We love S.C.A.N. and very much enjoy participating in as many events as we can.  :)

Supporters of Children with Additional Needs Inc	184249	2	/users/profile/241188	Vibbard11	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I have known Terry Faust, the founder of SCAN for most of my life.  Her husband Jack coached my childhood-junior high soccer team and Terry was like a second mother to all of us.  Her dedication to kids and go-getter attitude is undisputed by anyone who's spent 2 minutes or more with her.   Terry has assembled a group of caring advocates who go above and beyond to help reduce the struggle in the lives of children and their families.  They have created an open forum for families to discuss ideas to further progress children's physical and mental abilities with other families with similar lives, creating a support group for those encountering troubling situations that may not have been available if not for SCAN. If you have a child or family member with special needs, you won't find a better group to join.  If you're looking to volunteer, you won't find a grassroots effort more spiritually and emotionally rewarding.  If you are looking to provide contributions, know that your hard earned resources will be wisely invested in an organization that has bettered the lives of many already and undoubtably more to come. SCAN has big plans for the future of their programs and facility that will succeed because they have heart that trumps opposition and drive to persevere any trial.

Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	126926		/users/profile/171951	abraybrooks	Board Member	5	10/18/2012	Lazarus Ministries serves nearly 30,000 meals a year to Kansas City's homeless, in addition to providing clothes and basic necessities every week.  The women's shelter during the cold winter months provides safety, hot meals and most important - an opportunity for these women to focus on rebuilding their lives with the love and support of a community of caring people around them.  The provided food, clothing, life necessities and shelter combine to make a powerful, life-changing process for many of Kansas City's urban core.  Together, we can make this non-profit the foundation for transitioning people into more enriching lives.
Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	125863		/users/profile/61919	Kay1	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I have been honored to serve on the Board of this wonderful group. They are tireless in determining the needs of the sojourners (homeless population) in metro Kansas City. From a heart perspective, they have boundless compassion for the folks who are struggling on life's journey. From a steward perspective, they always evaluate the needs, make sure not to duplicate services of others and adjust to their findings. They are able to balance both sides of the equation.
Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	58254		/users/profile/61919	Kay1	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	Lazarus does a wonderful job of addressing homelessness, poverty and hunger in downtown Kansas City. They meet the continually increasing need with optimism, faith and ingenuity. The staff is always looking for ways to improve the services they offer and to expand what they can do.

This is an organization that ministers to the homeless in KC MO for years.  We provide a women's shelter in the winter as no other is available,  breakfast and lunches when no others are available, clothing that is quality and church services that are open to everyone.  This is a great organization and would leave a gap if we no longer existed,

Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	100983		/users/profile/61927	Patrick S.	Board Member	5	11/23/2011	Lazarus Ministries moved me to become very involved because it puts into practice what Christ taught us - help those who are in greatest need. Weekend meals for the poor and homeless, winter shelter for homeless women, a free health clinic; but more importantly, we get the opportunity to be a friend to those we serve. That is the most important part of what we do.  
Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	58456		/users/profile/62231	Clay	Volunteer	5	12/03/2010	I  have been a part of Lazarus Ministries for approximately 1 1/2 years through assistance with meals, clothing pantry and on committees of service to the community of people.  The most valuable part of the experience is meeting the people that are served which turns out to be all of us that participate in this experience. In getting to know one another through Lazarus Ministries we learn more about ourselves and our gifts we bring to the table to share.  It is truly an opportunity of learning, of sharing, of giving and of receiving the many gifts through this program.  If I thought that I had was coming to bring something to give and that would make me feel better as it turns out I have received more through communication and sharing of words, of touch, of smiles, of music, of bread, than i ever could have imagined and I am thankful for this ongoing program that touches each of us.

Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	58308		/users/profile/61984	renee	Board Member	5	11/30/2010	Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple does a fabulous job meeting the needs of people in the community by showing them the love of God. LM provides food, medical care, clothing, and provides an emergency winter shelter for women. But the most important things LM provides is love and compassion and a welcoming embrace.  Those without a home who are otherwise invisible on the streets are welcomed into the fellowship of the church. Lazarus Ministries provides clothing in a unique way - by providing a personal shopper to help the guests pick out clothing from the "boutique" that will not only meet their needs but may also make them feel special.  It is a blessing to have the opportunity to serve those in need and to see what a difference small gestures can make in their lives.

They have a great location and facility for this ministry.  The staff is wonderful and very compassionate.  My family and church are dedicated to helping this wonderful ministry.
Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	58277		/users/profile/61946	lscambridge	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	Lazarus Ministries (LM) provides meals, shelter, clothing, medical services, and a loving spirit to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the homeless of Kansas City.  Many of those who seek support from LM are people whose families have given up on them and have no other place to turn.  What I've learned from working with those who are served by LM is that life in our society is complicated and not everyone is equipped with the skills to maintain a permanent home, job, car, red tape, insurance, etc.  Some lack the ability because of mental illness and others were just born that way.  Nevertheless, LM loves them just as God does.

It has meant shelter, food, clothing, spiritual support, acceptance, help navigating the red-tape of assistance, employment, counseling, and most of all a place where people can feel they belong. They provide health care exams and services not otherwise availaibe to this segment of the population. The staff is compassionate, understanding, and truly cares about the sojourners who enter their doors. 
Lazarus Ministries at Grand Avenue Temple	58249		/users/profile/61913	bugssis	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	I am a regular donor to Lazarus Ministries and an occasional volunteer whenever am in town (I live out of state).  I am constantly amazed at the dedication of the volunteers, staff, and clients (referred to as Sojourners) to making this program successful.  They have youth groups come for work camps from all over the Midwest, they get boxes of donations from people who have simply heard of their work through a friend, and the Sojourners even pitch in when needed with whatever means they have.   The staff always manages to pull together meals, clothes, medical treatment, and other necessary services on a shoestring budget.  And you can see the appreciation in the faces of those who are helped.   This is a truly worthy organization that fills many needs, both physical and spiritual, in the Kansas City downtown community.  As the needs of the community change, Lazarus Ministries evaluates their programs and changes too.

I have helped fill and distribute the backpacks and always leave with more than I gave.~Debra McMillen

Kathy Acre and BackatYou have a passion to help the homeless and it is contagious.  She tunneled that passion and put together 200 backpacks filled with essentials for the homeless.  My family and I were fortunate enough to be there to help hand them out this past Saturday.  She introduced herself to every backpack recipient and then one by one each volunteer became a buddy and helped pick out their backpack which included a handmade scarf.  Check out BackatYou and consider helping out our homeless friends.  You wont be disappointed.

She is changing lives in St. Louis one backpack at a time! It has been an incredible experience to witness her passion and dedication first-hand as she works to assist the homeless.  She doesn't have homes to give away to them but she has one huge heart with a lot of warm, loving, and caring space, along with an army of helpers who are determined to spread her mission.  I am very happy I came across her organization while searching on-line and now I feel blessed to be a supporter and volunteer.  She makes the street a warmer place to spend the night for those who all they have is a backpack filled with essentials and Kathy's love!  Kathy has started something amazing! Supporting Back@You and helping it grow will allow her to continue changing lives for the better!
Back at You	264983	1	/users/profile/353717	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	This is an amazing story of one woman's effort to help the homeless.  A year ago, Kathy Acre set out to help 20 homeless  neighbors in Saint Louis by providing essentials for living life on the streets.  She began by asking one homeless man what his greatest daily needs were.  From that conversation, Back@You has grown into an organization that has impacted the lives of more than 200 homeless folks this year.  Kathy's passion and vision has inspired many of us.  People from across the country have taken part in this effort by supplying handmade scarves and hats, as well as socks, hoodies, non-perishable snack foods, and personal care items.  She has brought together people from all over the Saint Louis metro area to share in this opportunity to serve the homeless in our area.
Back at You	264851		/users/profile/353576	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/17/2015	I learned about Back@You in Summer, 2015.  Kathy has taken her passion and her compassion, showing us what determination can accomplish. She shows honor and dignity to the less fortunate and reminds us not to judge others.  She is seeking to impact lives with a practical approach while ensuring those on the street feel they have support and care.  To increase her impact tenfold in one year is unheard of but it shows what Kathy has been able to do by being consistent in her efforts.  
Back at You	264387		/users/profile/353108	Judy148	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I've recently had the chance to meet Kathy Acre and learn about her non-profit, BACK@YOU. Within  the course of a year , Kathy has gained great momentum. Starting out by filling and handing out just 20 backpacks she purchased inexpensively, to handing out over 200,  "specially designed backpacks", this year. She CAREFULLY fills these packs with essentials for life on the streets. That obviously didn't feel like enough, so Kathy makes sure that each pack is given out by a volunteer and comes with a handmade scarf to show these folks that they matter. Kathy Acre's desire to help the homeless in this small, but very important way is contagious! I HiGHLY recommend getting involved with this effort.
Back at You	264162	1	/users/profile/352871	Barbiewalsh	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	Because of one woman's passion and caring concern for the homeless and the volunteers that have been inspired by her passion there are many homeless people on the streets of St. Louis who have new backpacks filled with items that make their life's somewhat easier.

Back at You	263951		/users/profile/352654	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	Having known about Back At You  for only a short time, I decided to check them out. What I found was not what I expected. Not a big organization, but a small non-profit run basically by Kathy Acre and her husband Kevin. Last year they were able to put together and distribute about twenty backpacks to help people living on the streets of St. Louis. This year I decided to get involved. Not having much money I contributed some socks and helped out carrying items to the truck and stuffing backpacks. That day I realized that a little bit of money or labor when added to the efforts of others can truly make a difference. On October 10th over 200 backpacks were distributed to people in need, young and old alike. I was one of about fifty volunteers that unloaded the truck and help guide the recipients through the process of selecting their packs and selecting sweatshirts in their size & color.  Each pack was topped off with a hand knit muffler (made by folks here and in other states) so the person could find a pack that called out to them. It was a really amazing day!  I was truly moved and glad I attended.  Through the tireless efforts of Kevin and Kathy I saw what is possible. 
Back at You	263870		/users/profile/352574	GLS1	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	I have never met Kathy personally, but I feel like I have known her for years!  I have spent the past year "behind the scenes" helping her with donations and getting Girl Scouts and our grade schools to help in donations.  You couldn't ask for a more trustworthy, hard working individual to help the homeless!   I am so proud of what she has accomplished in the past year.  I am more than happy to help her meet her goal of 400 backpacks next year.  She puts the homeless 1st in her life.  St. Louis is very fortunate to have someone so dedicated for such a worthy cause.  
Back at You	263869		/users/profile/352573	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	Back@You is a great organization! Kathy has personally developed relationships with the homeless in St. Louis to ensure that the funds are used in the most useful ways. The impact that this organization has had is immeasurable. The gratitude of the recipients of her backpacks was evident In their smiles, tears and hugs. Children and adults both benefit from Back@You.
Self Help Center	240510	2	/users/profile/326695	Beth134	Client Served	2	04/04/2015	If you are in need of Mental Health care this  is not the place to go.  Not all group attendees are treated w/ respect and dignity.  I know I haven't been treated w/ respect and dignity here.    The Executive Director and the 'hierarchy' (peer specialists, group leaders, etc.) coloborate as to whether they like you there as a member in need of being involved in their groups even when you have not done anything to deserve that certain kind of treatment.  It's  kinda of clicky, especially if you have an issue that arises... that needs to be addressed.   My observations have been the following:   It is the Executive Director and staff against the "nut" member and it definitely isn't HIPAA protected. I overheard the Executive Director speaking carelessly about other members and their health diagnosis' when they were not present in an open area.  Also, I was in a group w/ the Executive Director and some of her "peeps" and they were carrying on with a joke and cackling during a PROCOVERY group session which had NOTHING to do w/ the topic.  A new visitor came in and was distracted by the laughing and asked what was the joke was and why were they disrupting the group.  The Executive Director and some of the staff got upset w/ the non "peep" and said some things to undermine how that individual felt and the Executive Director angerily stated that they were free to laugh and carry on as they were even while the group was being disrupted and that they should not be questioning what they were laughing about or expect an apology.  When the non "peep" said they were offended about the laughing interruption during session, the Executive Director stormed out of the room saying didn't see the need to apologize and was later found outside having a cigarette.  I saw and even was aware of how that individual felt seeing them left feeling shocked and uncomfortable w/ the feeling that they were made to feel unwelcome dealt and dealt w/ unprofessionally  In a group that they probably really needed to participate in. Individuals are coming to this 'organization' to get support for whatever life issue they find themselves in and SURPRISED w/ the possibility of  being DISRESPECTED.   Basically, the staff of this organization are so comfortable in their positions and they think they are 'ENTITLED' to make the rules up as they go and treat people any way they wish. They are employed there, treating people unprofessionally, and recieving government dollars and donations without any feeling that they might be usurped from their positions.  PLEASE RETHINK DONATING TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Self Help Center	143552		/users/profile/190011	edithb	Donor	5	11/27/2012	The Self Help Center at 8301 Crest Industrial Dr. in St. Louis, MO 63123 is a wonderful not for profit organization giving  support to people with brain disorders through education and group meetings.  They also have a food pantry to help supplement the members to stretch their money for living.   The activities of the center are tremendous for the participants, and they help with acceptance of life on lifes terms.  I feel the members are empowered in so many ways to improve their lives. The Self Help Center does soooo much on its limited budget.  Any help they could get would be greatly appreciated, and it would enable them to do so much more for members of society that get over looked much of the time.    
Self Help Center	143543		/users/profile/190004	mroy	Donor	5	11/27/2012	The Self Help Center has been a wonderful resource for our family. Our adult daughter, who has a brain disorder, has a place to go during the day. She has met new friends there and found acceptance. The educational programs and training have been extraordinary. Recently, she has taken the courses and tested to become a Certified Peer Specialist. The staff at the Center go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome. It is a tragedy that budget constraints have limited the available hours of operation each week.
Self Help Center	143243		/users/profile/189683	sunshine16	Client Served	5	11/27/2012	I would definitely recommend the Self Help Center to others who suffer from mental illness.  I am someone who has multiple mental problems and, this place is very welcoming it provides a place to come to be social, safe, and to get support no matter what you are going through. There are also a lot of beneficial educational support classes to go to.  I learned that I am not alone in this and that there is a road to recovery.  The Self Help Center reaches out  to staff, family members, members and nurses in the community to make mental illness more aware to the public.  If your in the neighborhood stop by and visit us, we would love to meet you!

I have dealt with many individuals having signifigant problems in their lives and became a school Counselor to many of them.  The Self Help Center offers anyone in need the same assistance.  I have seen the impact on several lives and wholly endorse their programs.  I often can't believe the services they offer free of charge.  If any group would choose to endorse or to fund Self Help Center (SHC) they would be totally in the right!

Self Help Center	128325		/users/profile/173477	Tim Conroy	Advisor	5	10/24/2012	As a Certrified Missouri Peer Specialist I can attest to the fact that Self Help Center has an incredibly positive impact on many lives.  The levels of recovery I have observed at SHC are phenominal!!  Members, staff, and volunteers are all dedicated to the idea(l) of client based recovery services.  The programing offered is based on the wants and needs of the SHC community and provides opportunities for sharing, learning, and growth.  I also hold a Masters in Library Science and Information Technology and have worked in the mental health field (as well as being a consumer) for quite a few years. I have encounter many, many types of recovery - or so called recovery - programs. SHC is by far the best and most dedicated to true consumer lead recovery.
Self Help Center	127684		/users/profile/172777	nsb0201	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2012	Self Help Center is a truly consumer operated services program and is the oldest in the State of Missouri.  The organization hires only individuals with lived recovery experience and encourages participants to do more for the organization, such as participate in town hall meetings and serve on various committees or the Consumer Advisory Board, which helps in improving self esteem and self-worth.  The organization provides its services at its surburban facility and at area hospitals in both inpatient and outpatient settings.  All staff are Certified by the State of Missouri as Peer Specialists and regularly use their lived experience in helping to move individuals forward.  The organization also works in partnership with national agencies such as Abraham Low's Self-Help Systems, Procovery Institute, and the Depression Bi-Polar Support Alliance.  Their years of experience, soon to be 25, have saved many lives and gives a glimer of hope to those in need.

Self Help Center	126528		/users/profile/171545	maureen c	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	Self Help Center is a lifesaver.  I on a lonely path downward and needed help.  I found out about the center and came one day to go to a group.  I found it transformative.  The people were so kind and supportive, it was a home away from home.  I started going daily immediately.  I had a relationship shortly after first coming and if it weren't for the center I would have had a difficult time managing.  I stuck with it and soon was recovering quite well.  I took a certification class to volunteer at the center and passed the test soon after.  What joy and support I had gotten through the arduous study period. I have volunteered here for well over one year. This brought a me a whole new life. It increased my self-esteem and self worth.  I now am happier than I've ever been with wonderful new friends and collegues.  The cener saved my life in more ways than one.  It has saved many lives and will continue to do so for many years to come.  
Kinship Circle	192115	1	/users/profile/250789	animalrescuer	Volunteer	1	01/05/2014	I know firsthand that Kinship Circle has falsely stated that they were on the ground rescuing and raised money when they were not rescuing. 
Kinship Circle	104281	1	/users/profile/66171	niero	Donor	4	01/24/2012	Kinship Circle is a wonderful organization. They are founded on providing solid, very well-researched information, and getting that information into people's hands. (Their website has tons of quick-read pdf files.) And they are very dedicated to rescuing animals in disaster areas. They are a very "boots on the ground, doing the manual labor" organization with strong dedication.
Kinship Circle	60761	1	/users/profile/66171	niero	Client Served	4	01/23/2011	I have found this organization to be very reliable and honest in its reporting. It gathers all pertinent information, making sure it is accurate, and makes it very easy for people to respond where needed. For example, you can go to their website and find an animal welfare issue that particularly concerns you, and immediately see all the contact information, such as emailing gov't officials, listed right there.  They make it quick and easy to respond to an animal welfare issue. 
Kinship Circle	99474	1	/users/profile/119704	dogsncats	Volunteer	5	10/19/2011	 I would definitely recommend Kinship Circle for anyone looking to volunteer or donate to a great organization.  KC has turned into an international animal disaster relief and advocacy organization with volunteers all over the United States and now world. Pretty incredible and shows how dedicated the leadership and core volunteers of KC are. 
Kinship Circle	83360	2	/users/profile/92313	HaltCruelty	Board Member	5	03/26/2011	I became aware of Kinship Circle and its founder, Brenda Shoss, upon returning home to New Orleans and beginning animal rescue work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Brenda was providing invaluable assistance in the form of her website updates, which provided volunteers with essential information related to assisting animal victims of the storm. I and hundreds of other volunteers learned about animal rescue through Brenda. Throughout the Gulf Coast animal rescue operations,   In addition to providing vital communication links for animal rescue responders., Kinship Circle volunteers maintained a direct presence on the Gulf Coast after Katrina  by raising funds and sending volunteers to assist.  More recently, Kinship Circle sent a team of skilled volunteers to assist with needs of animals left stranded or injured after the Chilean earthquakes. One day, Kinship Circle volunteers arrived with pet food and supplies at a camp, just as families were about to destroy their beloved family pets, because it seemed more humane than allowing them to starve. Can you imagine the joy and relief of children who would be able to continue their comforting relationship with their own pets because some food was delivered? Kinship Circle struggles to monitor disasters around the world and provide direct care and support services to animals in need. A rescue team has been serving the areas hardest hit by the mudslides in Brazil  while arrangements are underway to send volunteers to rescue animals suffering in the Japan disaster area.
Kinship Circle	61804	1	/users/profile/67525	Judy Carman	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	Kinship Circle is active, dedicated, full of heart, and does an amazing amount of work rescuing animals in disaster situations, getting letters sent to decision makers to make the world a more compassionate place, informing members of animal suffering worldwide and letting us know what we can do to help--and all this on a small budget. The budget is spent on the work being done to help animals not on glossy, expensive fund-raising materials. A famous poet, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, once wrote: I am the voice of the voiceless; Through me the dumb shall speak, Till the deaf world's ears be made to hear-- The wrongs of the wordless weak. And I am my brothers keeper, And I will fight his fights; And speak the words for beast and bird-- Till the world shall set things right. Kinship Circle is the voice of the voiceless and much more, because they take action wherever they possibly can to "set things right." The Great!I've personally experienced the results of this organization in...I follow their progress online and am amazed at the amount of excellent work they do with a small staff and budget.  Ways to make it better...If I had to make changes to this organization, I would...I would do what I could to help them raise more money so that they can do more rescue campaigns.

Kinship Circle	60867	1	/users/profile/66338	Rockakenny	Donor	5	01/25/2011	Brenda Shoss and Kinship Circle represents what can be accomplished with big hearts and intelligent action.  On a shoe-string budget, many lives have been saved, many minds have been educated, and many hearts have been opened.  I have been a proud supporter and periodic donor (funds permitting) of Kinship Circle for several years.  To me, the world and it's inhabitants are better for having Kinship Circle.  Brenda Shoss is nothing short of a hero to me.  She is a true example of the power of the human spirit.   
Kinship Circle	60821	1	/users/profile/66274	bigdog	Donor	5	01/24/2011	Brenda Shoss and Kinship Circle accomplish more with less than just about any other charitable or advocacy organization I know. When I support Kinship Circle I know that every dollar is used for the animals, and that decisions are made based on what's best for the animals. Aren't those two things we seek in the charities we support? 
Kinship Circle	60807	1	/users/profile/66256	dominos	Donor	5	01/24/2011	I love this group! They go anywhere there is a need for animal rescue/help. They don't have fancy advertising or send out expensive mailings. Most of the information I get from them is sent via email. I greatly admire how hard they work to help animals, especially during natural and other disasters. I have never hesitated to donate to them.
Kinship Circle	60782	1	/users/profile/66204	MaryG	General Member of the Public	5	01/23/2011	There are so many ways so help animals, but it all takes money. Ive spent years researching the best organizations with which to get the most from my hard-earned money. Kinship Circle has no big office or  highly paid staff and they dont mail you those annoying address labels! Every single penny goes for rescue, disaster aid, investigative research or educational materials. Alerts are posted on the web site for current issues and even the most wonderful letters provided so anyone can take action.I give confidently now without the what will they do with my money concerns Ive had in the past. And its tax deductible. 
Kinship Circle	60738		/users/profile/66139	Bugs	Volunteer	5	01/22/2011	Kinship Circle is dedicated, well-organized and gets the job done, one battle at a time.  If you are seeking a really good competent charity to support, I highly recommend Kinship - as one of their volunteer animal disaster responders, I would not commit my own time and resources if they didn't meet my high expectations for integrity and professionalism.   I often get the comment "how can you donate your time and money to helping animals when there are so many humans, including children, who desperately need help"?  Yes, but thank goodness there are "different strokes for different folks".   Animals are innocent victims too but because they are animals, they will never have the opportunity to grow up and make their own choices as humans do, to fight for any rights - they are entirely at the mercy of humans for their entire lives.  Humankind has the responsibility of being the earth's caretakers.  Kinship Circle is their voice and salvation.   Kinship Circle gets the job done.  They are committed and passionate about making the world a better place for animals.  I am proud to be a volunteer for this organization.  For some interesting pictures of our Chile deployments, go to Kinship's Flickr photo site! June TowlerToronto, Canada
Kinship Circle	60694		/users/profile/66081	Bonnie	Board Member	5	01/22/2011	More then any time our world is changing and the animals, the innocent, are suffering. Whether it be from deforestation, global warming, horendous large scale ravaging fires, swift and devasating floods, the razing of hurricanes and tornados, Kinship Circle is there to help the animals. The ones left behind, helpless and the ones who are treated as family members. But we cannot do it alone.

Persistence, Passion, Persuasion is Brenda's mantra.  I have never met someone who is so committed to a cause, and she allows us to give a voice to domestic animals all over the world.  Every penny she generates from fund raising is spent on spreading the word and supporting disaster aid efforts.  My wish for 2011 is for Kinship Circle to receive all the funds required so they can continue making this world a better place.Sincerely, Chris Kiersch 
Kinship Circle	59195		/users/profile/63764	Sherman	Board Member	5	12/28/2010	I am proud to be a Board Member with Kinship Circle.  This organization has been responsible to bring "ugly issues" to the public so they may be aware of what is happening in our world and make smart choices to support change or not.   Kinship Circle was the only animal organization to send volunteers and vets to the Chilean animals after the earthquake and Tsunami, bringing hope, medical supplies and treatments to this under privileged country.  Kinship Circle was allowed to work side-by-side with resources helping during the 2010 Deep Water Horizon Gulf Oil Spill in partnership with World Animal Awareness Sciety.  This was was a unique honor to be part of The All Eyes On The Gulf Expedition Project. Our volunteers come from all walks of life with dedication, experience, enthusiasiam to help all the animals in need.  I love the teamwork they have developed.

Shalom House	253761	1	/users/profile/342000	Gloryes	Client Served	1	08/23/2015	Closing this shelter is a Blessing!   The veteran Staffers (Karen, the very heavy white female Nurse, Tammy, Mary) were repeatedly stalking/harassing/ hating and gossiping about previous Clients.  The general attitude of the "veteran" staffers was  "Once homeless....always homeless".  They had insane difficulty accepting that certain females had moved on/progressed.   Again, the closure of Shalom House is an extreme Blessing!
Shalom House	101063		/users/profile/59225	Robert A.	Volunteer	5	11/25/2011	My wife and I volunteer at Shalom House one night a week, and it has been a life changing experience for us. Shalom House is much more than a shelter for homeless women. Although they do provide shelter for homeless women, they more importantly work with the women to overcome the situations that resulted in their homelessness. They are very sucessful in achieving this, and spending time with the women on a wekly basis provides us the privledge to see the amazing transformation most of the women go through while at Shalom House. It is such a joy to see the women "graduate" and move out to a new life on their own.

I am consistently impressed with the quality of care and love that the staff has for their "clients".  It is seen in everyday interactions, programming, the atmosphere at the Shalom House itself, and more!  It is obvious that the staff is united in their efforts to care for the ladies in such a way as to show compassion and mercy for today while ever moving forward toward independence and victory over the cycle of homelessness in the ladies' lives.  That concerted effort is what sets them apart for me.

Shalom House	100747		/users/profile/124461	sunhalo	Board Member	5	11/17/2011	As a board member for the last year at Shalom House, I've seen first hand the life-changing services that the programs offer to chronically homeless women in the St. Louis area. Women who struggle with mental health issues and substance abuse problems have very few options, but at Shalom House they have a place to call home until they are back on their feet again. I've worked for other nonprofits in the past, and the Shalom House staff is absolutely exceptional and regularly goes above and beyond to fulfill the needs of the Shalom House clients. Their programs are both practical and innovative, teaching women to be self-reliant and empowered. Speaking with both current residents and graduates of the program really demonstrates the power for a few dedicated people to change the lives of so many women. Thank you, Shalom House, for providing essential services and support for women in need.

I have greatly enjoyed my time with the women and staff alike.   It has been an incredible experience that I cannot explain getting to know the women.  I have prepared lunch for the women a couple times along with helping prepare Auction Items for the Silent Auction at our yearly fundraiser, The Signature Event.  These women have been through so much hardship and they are the most caring and compassionate women I have ever met.  Once, I heard about this organization, I immediately wanted to step up and become involved.  I am very proud of Shalom House and our recent improvements.  Shalom House is so fortunate to have Staff and Board Members 100% behind them for support.  It is so wonderful to see everyone pitch in through monthly meetings, regular outings, and constant emails to make the next Signature Event better than the last.  In Shalom House, you will truly feel part of a team and the sincere heartfelt, warmth from the women you are helping.

From the outside everything looks great. It's clean, everyone seems nice, and the director seems like she really truly cares. But after you have been there for awhile you start to realize the turn over rate is very high, the staff she does keep is not trained,under paid, and over worked. The kids have chores while they are here which consisted of yard work and cleaning toilets. She puts grown children in cribs for time out, restrains them, and does things to intentionally embarrass them. Money is more important than children's safety. She has told her over night workers it's ok for them to sleep when the kids sleep as long as they keep the phone close. She tells parents they need to medicate their children so they are easier to deal with or that they need to institutionalize them because she cannot handle them. She is very critical of parents and is not afraid to state her opinion no matter how inappropriate it may be. And if you dare to take your business else where because you fear for your children's safety she will threaten to sue you for thousands of dollars. I would never recommend this facility to anyone not even as a last resort. On a side note I find it interesting that the good comments on here come from her staff and also are all around the same dates a former employee told me the owner had them write good things about her and the center on this site to make them look better... If it was a good facility she wouldn't need to have people write reviews for her.

My grandson was refused by Michelle the owner of Noahs Ark to get   off the school bus and he was  sent back to elementary  school.  My granddaughter was pushed by a teacher. She calls the police on little children.   Non profit my butt All she wants is money.  She tried to convince parents their  kids are horrible and need therapy.  She is a control freak and wants to control you.  Her employees sue her for their pay.  Her turnover is horrible.  Kids have no idea who there teacher is from day to day.

Noahs Ark Academy	178555		/users/profile/235185	TracyR.	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	My first experience with Noah's Ark Academy was as a new foster parent with my first placements.  I was completely over whelmed with being a single parent, working full time and suddenly adding three more kids to my household.  Going from having a 10 year old only, to three additional kids 2.5 years, 1.5 years, and 3.5 months old and all in diapers was crazy to say the least.  I only agreed because my case worker said she knew a great daycare that would accept the kids.My first experience with Noah's Ark was amazing.  Not only did the staff make me feel very welcome but they helped me to work with behavior issues with my first and other groups of kids I had as placements. The facility is always clean, no TV's in the classrooms, structured learning, ample free play time, and daily outdoor activities.The running joke in my circle of friends was that my son was the Army Brat of child care facilities because we changed frequently before he started kindergarten.  We experienced facilities where the kids were lined up in front of TV's in the morning so the teacher could drink coffee in peace, facilities were my son was bitten daily, facilities were diapers were dirty in the evening at pick up, and facilities were his hand and face would be filthy at pick up time.  I can honestly say that I was unsure what Noah's Ark would be like because I had the opinoin that any place that accepts a lot of kids with state subsidies would be similar to some of the worst day cares I experienced.  I was completely surprised by how clean, well run, and bright Noah's Ark  was.I wish Noah's Ark had been an option when my son was little. I became a board member a few years ago because I believe that all kids should have the opportunity to learn and thrive in a healthy  and safe environment.  I've never regretted it and neither will you.

When I first joined the program, the student I was paired with struggled to blend sounds together and could only read a few short pages during the 30-minute session. By the end of semester, his skills had improved immensely. He was reading fluently and was much more confident in his abilities. When we gave the kids their own books to keep on the last day of the program, my student was thrilled and said he could not wait to take it home and read it to his mom. I thank United Way for supporting this program and giving me an opportunity to give back to my community by volunteering!
United Way of Southeast Missouri	188050		/users/profile/245293	Kathy062	Professional with expertise in this field	2	11/07/2013	I was quite shocked at the high reviews for this particular United Way. While I have worked with a number of excellent United Ways during my career, this is not one of them. Another organization I was involved with asked for funding for a specific project, for which the United Way of SEMO said there was no need. Within a year, however, they did the exact same project themselves (even calling it something similar), keeping all that money in house. That is not an ethical way to run any organization.
United Way of Southeast Missouri	184555		/users/profile/241497	ktemp	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	The United Way of Southeast Missouri is an organization that shows true compassion to the people of this community.

The money they raise not only goes to the immediate needs of needy families, but it is an investment in their future. The success stories the United Way of Southeast Missouri brings to the attention of the public is not only what strengthens their capacity for community change and development, but is also the backbone of their mission: helping people.

I've seen the internal workings, and external impact of United Way agencies from many perspectives - an employee perspective, a case manager/service provider prospective, and now from a liaison perspective.  I've stated many times that United Way of Southeast Missouri is truly one of the best examples of what a responsive organization looks like.  I feel this way because of the ease of working with them, their vigor for identifying deep-seeded community issues in partnership with anyone who will listen and play a role.  They are clearly there to support all 'players' who are wrapped up in the process of making their communities a better place - nonprofit/social service organizations, local school districts, and of course, consumers who reside in the area and are in need of advocacy and assistance.  Hands down, one of the best United Way agencies I've had the pleasure to work with.  I consider this United Way a true epicenter of positive change for Southeast Missouri.

Assistance League Of St Louis	78710		/users/profile/85995	Carlotta	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	   We have been receiving the AL Activity Kits featuing "Al Bear" for sometime, and they have really made a  possitive difference. These kits which we receive from Assistance League of St. Louis really seem to break the ice with the siblings of our NICU babies.   Our parents/families are often too worried and focused on the baby in the NICU, to remember to bring along an activity or something for the sibling to concentrate on or play with. The siblings at the bedside are afraid: the NICU is a very scary place, lots of wires and alarms. Children are very aware of how the parents are feeling, anxiuos, scared, worried, and they take these feeling to heart. The activity books help occupy the siblings so the parents can visit with their babies, plus it makes them feel special and loved.    I remember one girl inparticular who couldn't beleive she could keep the coloring book, crayons and bendable toy tiger. She was so happy she couldn't stop smiling, This had really made her day.   We also give the kits to children in our waiting area when they are waiting for a family member to deliver.  It is very difficult for children to wait patiently hour after hour for a family member to give birth to  a baby.   These kits have been invaluable in helping siblings, parents and nursing staff have a possitive experence in our NICU and waiting area.                                      Thank you,                                       Carlotta Corso-Klippel

Assistance League Of St Louis	68901		/users/profile/75291	Jeanne	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	I am a volunteer tutor at Loyola Academy, a non-profit middle-school (sixth through eighth grades) serving financially under-privileged male students.  Loyola's mission is to "end the cycle of poverty through education."  Over 80% of these young men live at or below the poverty level and are on reduced lunches.   They attend school at Loyola for nine and one half hours each day and for five-weeks during the summer. This intense program is designed to prepare them for success at college preparatory high schools.  Assistance League has aided Loyola Academy in two major areas:  school uniforms and computers, both of which the Loyola student families can not afford to purchase.   Assistance League Operation School Bell  has provided the much needed uniforms for these young men in past years.  Last summer, Assistance League donated numerous computers, printers, scanners, and monitors to Loyola.  Loyola students, teachers and administration were so excited to receive this generous donation, which has greatly enhanced Loyola's educational mission.  Most of these young men do not have any type of computer at their home so they need to have access to these tools at school.  Assistance League's computer equipment donations provided additional resources and tools needed to aid these young men in their daily pursuit of a good education. I would like to thank Lynn Dolan, current President of Assistance League, for offering this equipment.  One evening Lynn and I were discussing the Assistance League projects and I mentioned to her that I had recently started volunteeering as a tutor and grant writer for Loyola.  Lynn contacted me the very next day to offer the equipment to Loyola because Assistance League had been fortunate enough to receive a grant for new computer equipment.   I have also attended the Assistance League annual auctions and have seen the tremendous amount of work expended to raise the funds to support the League's projects.    The Assistance League and its volunteers are truly God's Angels. They have inspired not only other volunteers but also the children, whose lives they touch on a daily basis.

My mom and I are both so grateful for the service the OATS bus provides.  We're not sure how we would cope without it.  Patti, the driver of her bus, is incredibly friendly and helpful to my mom!
OATS, Inc.	169272		/users/profile/224349	tmm71	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/12/2013	I have been working in the medical field for 14 years. In this time I have had many experiences with transportation providers. I can tell you that the only one that is trustworthy is OATS. Dependability is a must for our dialysis patients. OATS will get them to treatment on time and pick them up on time. If for any reason a driver believes he may be late in his return, we are made aware so the patient knows they may have to wait. It has never been more than 30 minutes. If they are going to be later than 30 minutes they will often arrange for another driver to fill in. The drivers are the most courteous and friendly. I have seen the same faces on a regular basis for many years driving for OATS, and consider them friends. I see the care and compassion they show when dealing with their riders and others around them. It is my belief that OATS must have a very good system for hiring employees. They definitely have some of the best here in Mid-MO. Thank you, OATS for always being dependable, flexible and most of all loveable.
OATS, Inc.	169072		/users/profile/224090	smh1691	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/11/2013	I work with patients who travel to dialysis 2-3 times a week.  The state contracts with many providers to  offer this service.  OATS stands out among them all! They are not only reliable, the whole OATS organization understands and reponds to the human side of the service they are providing.  
OATS, Inc.	168780		/users/profile/223749	Diana44	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2013	My organization has a contract with OATS and they provide our clients rides to and from work. Our mission is to successfully employ adults with disabilities who otherwise experience barriers. Without this means of transportation to and from our workshop, our mission would be impossible. Our great thanks for the wonderful service to our clientele for what you do for them every day!

We constantly try to let our communities know that there is transportation available to meet their needs.

They are heads and tails about the other transportation providers in town. I know my patients will be well cared for by OATS. The drivers go out of their way to provide professional and courteous service with little 'extras'. The OATS office staff is always willing to help my patients out whether that is for a scheduled ride or figuring out transportation in a pinch.

OATS fills that need with a wonderful service.  Not only does OATS assist with necessary shopping trips, the seniors love the opportunity to get out of the house and visit with other seniors.  Their monthly meetings to discuss fund raising and trips also give the seniors a feeling of pride in their own bus.  Just don't know what our rural area's would do without the wonderful service that OATS provides!

When I became a board member of OATS, after retirement, I really realized that OATS truly believes in their mission statement, that of providing transportation to any individual who needs it. The staff and volunteers work hard to carry out OATS mission and Missouri citizens, and the State, are better for it.
OATS, Inc.	165057		/users/profile/219424	OATS	Board Member	5	08/15/2013	Ever since its inception in 1971, OATS has been serving the Elderly and Disadvantaged with a door-to-door transit service allowing them to remain independent in their own home or residence. It is a vital service for these people and needs public and private support. I have been associated with OATS as a board member for the past 23 years and have participated in many fund raising activities on the local area which I represent. I am proud to be a part of this great service.Sincerely, Dick Keezer, Southwest Missouri

For many of those who depend OATS Transportation, it is the only thing keeping them from being shut-ins to the outside world. OATS has even been recognized nationally for being an innovative leader in the transportation industry!!It is truly and honor and privilege for me to be associated with a company that provides such a great service and has the national reputation providing transportation to those who need it the most!!  We are also so very fortunate to have such a competent and caring staff who keep it running like a well-oiled machine!!OATS is not just for older people.

It allows Folks to remain in their homes and be independent. It is a very safe and reliable transportation. The Driver's are Awesome:) If You have never rode an Oats Bus, I encourage You to give it a try. The Folks are so nice and they become like Family. My Mom started riding in 1985. She loved it because She made so many new Friends! My Mom was an Oats Contact for many years. It was a job She loved. I started riding with My Mom and I still ride today. I am Chairperson for Monroe County and on the State Board. I am so Thankful for Oats:)

When I read about the development of the nutritional peanut butter I was hooked as a donor. The concept as well as the organization is efficient, economical and  benefits the citizens of the countries in so many ways. Employment, empowerment, self-sufficiency. We here in America can learn a lot from organizations like this. Keep up the good work!

I've been watching thier posts on facebook for sometime and they are a wonderful organization. 
Project Peanut Butter	253488	4	/users/profile/341690	jakennedy24	Volunteer	5	08/20/2015	I volunteered with Project Peanut Butter from April of 2013 until April of 2014. My experiences with PPB shaped my future career path (I'm now in nursing school) as well as my understanding of my place in the world as a global citizen. PPB offers its volunteers a unique opportunity to prepare supplies and work in village health clinics. Traveling to local health clinics and working with a Malawian staff of nurses, drivers, and community health workers allows volunteers to interact daily with people who understand the reality of malnutrition. Each day the Malawian mothers and their children walk long distances to meet the PPB team. Volunteers can watch the children heal and transform during their RUTF (enriched peanut butter) therapy. There is an incredible sense of resiliency and determination from both the mothers and the children that is truly inspiring. PPB is doing a fantastic job of working with the local community to create life-giving change, which is building a generation of strong leaders. I highly recommend volunteering with and donating to this non-profit.

For many years he and my sister Mardi have selflessly committed their lives to combat the malnutrition that plaques millions of children across the globe.  Mark tirelessly works to improve products and processes of this RUTF, while Mardi manages the operations and travels to assist Mark with partnering efforts.  I have been a donor for years, not because they are my relatives but because I know both Mark and Mardi's hearts and believe in their cause.  Please help me support Mark, their staff,  and this much needed treatment.

Project Peanut Butter	251793	2	/users/profile/339785	ldiam	Volunteer	5	08/05/2015	I just returned from 8 weeks working with PPB in Malawi as a clinic volunteer. I couldn't have imagined a more fulfilling or inspiring way to spend my summer, working to improve the nutrition of some of the most impoverished people in the world. Spending time in the villages, working with mothers and children and with our phenomenal nurses and drivers, was absolutely one of the best experiences of my life, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Project Peanut Butter	251312	6	/users/profile/339235	Luke11	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	I volunteered for PPB in Ghana for about 10 months, helping to oversee the design and construction of the factory where RUTF is produced for both Project Peanut Butter and for the Hershey Company.  PPB was a fantastic organization to work for mainly because of the hands-off trust in our decision-making processes as well as the expert communication by Martin Histand.  Despite the drastic time change between St. Louis, USA and Ghana, Martin was always willing to find a time to talk on the phone or visit in person. With all of Mark Manary's research on the topic of severe malnutrition, it is no wonder the employees are so engaged and passionate about such a great cause.  PPB is the best nonprofit I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have played a small role is such a great organization.  May the fight against severe malnutrition continue! Kind regards,Luke H.

Project Peanut Butter	251279	2	/users/profile/339204	kclarke717	Volunteer	5	08/03/2015	I am a new mother to a beautiful one-month old baby girl, but when I was discharged from the hospital, I struggled with breastfeeding. It was the hardest thing I have ever done, and when my baby didn't regain her birth weight by three weeks, I was devastated, fearful, and overwhelmed. I live a privileged lifestyle where it was very easy for me to begin to introduce formula for my baby, but the thought of her not gaining weight was terrifying. PPB helps mothers who aren't as fortunate be able to feed and nurture their children in an easy and convenient way for them. In today's world, it is horrific that malnutrition is still an issue. PPB helps to reverse this epidemic; please help to support them! 
Project Peanut Butter	251174	4	/users/profile/339083	Jacqueline_K	Professional with expertise in this field	4	08/02/2015	I volunteered for Project Peanut Butter's feeding clinics in Malawi last year for 3 months. During my time in Malawi, I found a great team of local and international staff/ volunteers that work together for the sake of children's life. Project Peanut Butter not only saves malnourished children's lives with feeding clinics in rural Africa it also produces the food that serves as the treatment (RUTF/ RUSF) locally in its factories that are mostly run by local staff.  As I really appreciated PPB's approach, I started working for the new start- up factory in Ghana. 
Project Peanut Butter	250415	5	/users/profile/338256	kmbr	Volunteer	4	07/28/2015	I volunteered for PPB in Malawian clinics for five months in college. I am impressed by the drive and integrity of the staff. The collaboration and respect between the American and Malawian scientists, doctors, nurses and staff worked well for the benefit of the clinic patients. PPB productively meshes metrics based scientific research and compassionate clinical care. As a volunteer I was very well treated. Expectations for my behavior and responsibilities were made extremely clear by senior staff. I was given enough support in the beginning to learn how to be useful at clinic. With more experience in clinic my responsibilities were increased, but they were never overwhelming. Staff treated me respectfully, I felt appreciated, and I was welcomed into the team even though I was only in Malawi for a short time.  Facing patients and families whose medical and financial needs extend beyond what can be addressed by PPB was difficult for me emotionally, but should not be a reason to shy away. Returning to the U.S. after volunteering in Malawi was a jarring transition. I recommend that any volunteer who has not spent time in a resource limited situation plan a few days of recovery time after their return from PPB before they return to school or work to aid with reacclimatizing.  I continue to support the mission of PPB and follow the scientific publications made by its scientists. From what I saw during my time in Malawi money is fairly well managed, staff treat patients and volunteers respectfully, patient health is by far the highest priority, and the people in charge know what they're doing. 
Project Peanut Butter	250398	2	/users/profile/338236	jgrise	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	PPB offered me the opportunity to work closely with children and mothers that desperately needed help. The 15 months I spent volunteering with PPB introduced me to a number of wonderful new friends and opened doors for me professionally.

The proceeds for fundraising go directly to cancer patients to assist them financially thru their terrible ordeals.  I have experienced this first hand, as my daughter was a recipient of one of their grants.  A grant, you ask?  Yes, a grant of money to be used in any way the patient deems necessary !  This is the only organization I have heard of that gives money directly to patients ! for their needs! at the moment!   The rest I know of are not giving directly to the patient, but give little, if any, to patients that are in dire need financially and otherwise.  This is a most worthwhile organization giving the proceeds directly to those who need it most !! This is THE best that can be given!

She found this organization which has been a great blessing to her. Not only did they offer her a community of other young adults who could share their stories and experiences with her, but they also were alone to offer her some financial assistance as well as getting her in touch with another woman who had been through the same cancershewas facing. She is now thankfully in remission but continues to be a part of this wonderful organization.

Hope For Young Adults With Cancer	185826	2	/users/profile/242798	carmenstl	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	Hope for Young Adults with Cancer is wonderful non-profit organization that focuses on providing direct financial support to young adults who are battling cancer and those who are in remission.  This organization is truly dedicated to what they stand for.  Cara, Billy, and the rest of the H4YAWC team live this out every day.  It's truly touching to witness such a great group of individuals helping out this severely underserved age group of individuals diagnosed with cancer.  Being a young adult myself, I realize that others my age that are going through a cancer diagnosis have many hurdles to face, and are often not insured or are underinsured.  I'm glad that this organization is out there to help them financially and emotionally.
Hope For Young Adults With Cancer	185815	2	/users/profile/242786	LindseySherm	Donor	5	10/30/2013	The compassion that this charity shows for such an underserved part of the cancer community is truly astounding. All members work full time jobs, yet still manage to dedicate countless hours towards planning fundraising events, sorting through applications and promoting the charity. I believe that H4YAWC is doing such amazing things for individuals. To hear stories about the number of applications that come in and the limited number of people they are able to help due to limited funding is heart-breaking, because with greater awareness of this organization they could help so many more survivors and those currently battling cancer. I can't think of a better organization to donate to.
Hope For Young Adults With Cancer	185633	1	/users/profile/242600	Amanda116	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I was recently invited to a Hope for Young Adults Trivia Night from a friend that I work with and since I love trivia, I figured that this would be a win/win. When I got there the room was filled with energy, people were laughing and moving about all over the room. I had a little trouble finding my table, but it didn't take me too long to find it. I was pleasantly surprised that our table was right next to the silent auction section, my husband was extremely happy when he eyed a cool air hockey table (which is now conveniently placed in our living room). The night began with a heartfelt speech from one if the young adults that is currently being supported by Hope for Young Adults. The speech didn't make you feel sorry for him or anything like that, but I did get the realization that this organization really did care about his well being. This night, of course was dedicated to him. The founder, Cara, was brought to tears by his speech you could tell that her heart was filled passion. After the speech the night went on as before with movement and laughter, obviously we got the air hockey table from the silent auction. I left that night after having a ton of fun and feeling great with spending my evening with H4YAWC

Mid America Teen Community Emergency Response Team	310014		/users/profile/401365	EricVaughan	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2016	I happened to come across the Mid America Teen CERT website and was curious how I too could build a top rated youth CERT program. My local EMA already has an adult CERT program and was refusing to allow a teen program to exist. Our City Government is in partnership with our local EMA so there was not much interest or opportunity to create a program unless we started one on our own somehow, without EMA endorsement.  Mr. Rosenblum not only explained to me how to go about forming the program, he put me in touch with all the right people to start the process. It continues to be an uphill battle with our local EMA, but we strive to someday have a quality teen CERT program such as Mid America Teen CERT.
Mid America Teen Community Emergency Response Team	303509	2	/users/profile/394679	Gleich	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	I recall how TEEN CERT director Mark Rosenblum and I first met in 2003 at the first Wentzville CERT class at the General Motors Assembly Facility. He was the training coordinator for the program. A year later, Mark was requested to develop a CERT program for the Wentzville School District. A number of teachers and principals took the CERT training through Mark at the Wentzville Police Department.  Mark really had things organized, everything was functioning smoothly and the number of participants was steadily growing.  It has been my pleasure to work with Mark in a number of capacities over the years and always found him to be industrious, dedicated and of the highest integrity. During my forty years in Wentzville, I have served the county and the city in many volunteer capacities and I became very familiar with the community's residents, and they with me. I believe I am known for my integrity and fairness. With this background in mind, I acknowledge my respect for Mark and for his extraordinary contributions to the TEEN CERT program.

I believe Mark Rosenblum and his daughter Emily have done a great job helping the scouts of Troop 390 to instill some of these attributes into their daily lives. My boys participated in MATC several years ago. There are several merit badges the scouts can earn with the help of MATC, such as First Aid, Emergency Preparedness, Safety, Fire Safety, Disability Awareness, Search & Rescue, etc. These are skills that all responsible, concerned citizens should learn in order to give back to their community. Mark Rosenblum and MATC is part of the reason why my sons earned their eagle rank. We should all be proud to have this valuable resource available to us.

Mid America Teen Community Emergency Response Team	293797	3	/users/profile/384455	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2016	As an adult I was a bit skeptical about taking the Teen Cert training with a bunch of kids last month.  It didnt take long to see that the Mid America Teen Cert program was geared toward everyone and not just teens.  The lead instructor [Mark Rosenblum] held the attention of the class and there was plenty of hands on practice and exercises to keep everyone wanting more.  The disaster exercise the last day was intense and the role players were very knowledgeable about how to act out their injuries.  You could tell that they had worked with Mr. Rosenblum in previous drills because there was an unspoken connection between them that made it even more realistic.  Kudos to a very worthwhile and educational program.

We have signed up again 2 times since then and each time Mark and crew come out and give us 100%+. The playful banter between the instructors (esp Mark and Emily) shows that they love what they are doing and are not being forced or upset to be there. They are organized, responsible and present themselves in a professional manner. I highly recommend this program to everyone!  www.facebook.com/groups/MIDAMERICATEENCERT/

They had a great time and came home with more scout spirit than any other event.  Again, thank you and your staff and the many volunteers who supported this extraordinary experience. 
Mid America Teen Community Emergency Response Team	273648	4	/users/profile/362914	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/03/2015	The culminating simulation was such an amazing experience for my son and myself.  It brought awe and tears. Every detail was there. My son left saying how he thought that might be something he'd like to do. If nothing else, my son has an eye and heart into this very real threat. I am thankful for you, your group and boy scouts for teaching my son some of the sensitivities to our lives.

I had a group of 9 scouts, with 6 being in their first year of scouting.  They had a great and memorable time by the smiles that were on their faces as they came back to the campsite after the disaster drill.  My sons were fighting over who would be the first to tell their father about the weekend as we came home.

Great class and highly recommended for anyone at any age!

Congenital Heart Defects Families Association	182669		/users/profile/239541	Deena K. F.	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2013	My son Max was diagnosed with double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary atresia, asd, vsd, and dysplastic aorta the morning after he was born.  (A simple pulse ox test confirmed our pediatrician's suspicion that something was wrong.  It is not required in Kansas, YET!)  CHD families has members who are working on it!  He was flown to Kansas City Children's Mercy Hospital that day.  He had his 1st surgery at 4 1/2 weeks.  We were flown back up a couple times throughout the year and he was repaired on 12-12-12.  After a little set-back he is healed and thriving!  He will required pulmonary valve replacements for the rest of his life.  CHD families sent us a nice care package in the hospital, matched us with a family with similar defects, and have a support group on facebook where I can ask my "heart baby" questions.  We have spent some time with local heart families through CHD connections.  We love seeing the familiar faces at events like the Heart Walk!  This organizations main help to me was to help me not feel alone in this journey of everything "heart." :)

CHD Families does so many great things, but as a heart mom, the best gift is its ability to connect families in need of support.  Being able to share our stories, fears and triumphs alike, is so comforting.   So thankful to Valerie, her family and heart mom friends for seeing the need and making it a reality for all of us!

Less than 4 hours later he was flown to Kansas City, MO to Children's Mercy Hospital for emergency open heart surgury.  He has a condition called a 3rd degree heart block - he has a pacemaker and will have one for the rest of his life. CHD Families Association made my stay of 8 weeks with him so much nicer.  The package they delivered with a blanket for him and a few necessities for me, made my day. My son still sleeps with his blanket almost 10 months later and it's one of my favorites as well.  The people of CHD Families are warm hearted and inspirational making hard days of parents with "heart babies" so much better.  
Congenital Heart Defects Families Association	52358		/users/profile/53261	coachk	Client Served	5	09/14/2010	Erin Ann Kelley was born in Nashua, NH on 11/1/93. Right before she went home from the hospital her pediatrician heard what he believed to be the murmur of a VSD and recommended that she see a pediatric cardiologist. When she was 8 days old an echocardiogram  revealed a moderate sized VSD, moderate sized ASD,  right sided aorta with left ligamentum,  and aberrant right subclavian artery. These last two defects combined to form a complete vascular ring, encircling her trachea and esophagus.  She was not showing any signs of distress so her parents took her home with instructions to watch for signs of congestive heart failure. When she was 3 weeks old a bout with RSV sent her into heart failure. She was placed on Lasix and digoxin. Over the next 11 months she had recurrent RSV, bronchiolitis, and ear infections. She was in and out of the hospital repeatedly until her first birthday.  At the age of 1 it was revealed during a routine echo that the ASD had spontaneously closed. With these findings her cardiologist felt that it was worthwhile to continue to watch her to see if the VSD would also close or get smaller. He felt that the vascular ring would eventually need to be repaired but that this could wait until she was older. Over the next few years she did well. She was smaller than other children her age but could still keep up. At the age of 8 she began to have problems breathing and swallowing solid food. Her cardiologist felt this was due to the vascular ring which tightly encircled her trachea and esophagus. In May 2002 she underwent a video-assisted thoracotomy to repair the vascular ring. The doctors still believed it was premature to repair the VSD, even though it had not changed in size over the years. After the VATS procedure she seemed to have fewer problems swallowing, although her breathing was still labored when she was active. The doctors did not feel this indicated any problems and recommended continued monitoring of the VSD, which they felt would not adversely affect her over the course of her life. However, by the age of 10 her parents were not comfortable continuing this conservative treatment. Erin seemed to tire very easily. On February 6, 2004 Erin and her parents traveled to NYC to consult with cardiologists at NYU Medical Center. After an echocardiogram revealed that her heart was considerately enlarged and leakage from several valves was occurring, they recommended surgical repair. Fortunately surgeons at NYU have developed a minimally invasive open-heart procedure which eliminates the trauma of a sternal approach. Instead, an incision through the right side of the chest between the ribs allows surgeons to access the heart. This approach is both cosmetically and medically desirable. The resulting scar is cosmetically superior, infection rates are lower, and healing time is greatly reduced. During surgery it was discovered that Erin had developed a double chambered right ventricle, which is a rare and very serious complication of a VSD. Surgeons were able to repair both the VSD and the DCRV and Erin had an uneventful recovery. After surgery she developed a right bundle branch block. She also has a very small residual VSD with a leak next to the surgical patch, so she is in the small group of people who still require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental appointments and several other procedures. She was back to school 10 days post-op and went skiing just 6 weeks after surgery! Today Erin is a healthy teenager who plays field hockey and lacrosse competitively and helps me coach a youth soccer team.

After a perfect pregnancy, a sonogram revealed that something "may" be wrong with his heart. This was the day before he was born. When he was officially diagnosed family and friends got on the internet printing various articles on HLHS. Everything that I read scared me. What I didn't know was that my best friend in Alabama was searching by leaving messages on different CHD websites. A woman named Julie responded to one of these messages saying that she didn't live very far from the children's hospital. That she had a son with a heart defect and that there was a Congenital Heart Defect support group in the area. I spent the majority of my time in my son's room in the PICU. Even though I had a great amount of support from family and friends, I still felt alone. I was thrust in this life and I didn't know what to expect or how I would handle it. One afternoon I left my son's room and an envelope had been left for me. Inside was a folder with information about The Congenital Heart Defects Families Association. Julie had dropped it off. With in the span of an hour I had a renewed sense of strength and hope. Most of what I had read previously about CHD left me with a grim picture of my son's future. But here was a pamphlet showing happy, smiling kids. Most importantly I realized that I wasn't alone. My son faced many ups and downs, and through it all CHD Families was there to support us. They truly become your family. When we went to St.Louis to wait for a heart transplant we received care packages. Those really brightened up the long days. Sadly my son Xavier passed away on May 23rd 2005, one month and one day after his heart transplant. He was 21 months old. After my mom and my grandma, Julie from CHD Families was the next person that I called. She was on her way to a support group meeting with some of the other members. She said that when they arrived for the group and told everyone the news, they cried. CHD Families truly becomes your family. Since my son has been gone, a little over 5 years ago, CHD Families continues to be a source of support with the CHD Families Grief support group. When I met Julie, along with Valerie,  (who became one of my biggest supporters), CHD Families was a small group. I don't know the numbers but they have grown. They have activities to get the kids together, a yearly picnic, they participate in the heart walk every year. There are online and face to face support groups available. They provide care packages to families in the hospital. I can't say enough wonderful things about CHD Families Association. There is a candle lighting in Dec. every year for National Children's Remembrance Day. It is a very nice way to remember your child. I can't imagine having gone through all that we did with our son and not having CHD Families there to support us. They are an amazing group!
Congenital Heart Defects Families Association	49388	11	/users/profile/50585	marie10	Client Served	5	08/07/2010	At two and half days old my daughter was being discharged from the hospital. She was not doing perfectly well so I took her to the nursery to have the nurses check her out. It turns out that she was dying. The nurses and doctors worked very hard and fast to save her life--she was minutes from being gone. Keep in mind that at this point she was already discharged by the pediatrician.After getting her stabilized, Caylee was taken to Children's Mercy Hospital. Later that evening we were informed that our precious daughter has a congenital heart defect called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.A day or so later we were given a box from CHD Families. There was all kinds of information about Heart Defects. Information was provided to get support, so I called. I was contacted by a woman whose son has the same condition as my daughter. What a feeling to hear all the same things I was going through. I no longer felt alone.Later we found out that they are in the AHA Walk every year to raise money for CHD research. And every dime raised goes only to Congenital Heart Defect research. This organization has been so nice to have. We attended their annual picnic. Being at the picnic we were able to meet even more people with the same condition as our daughter.Everyone is so easy to get in contact with. They are working hard to make more people aware of CHD's. I never knew that it was the #1 birth defect. Every person in America should know this!!

She had just had a VSD repair.  I felt so alone and like I didn't have anyone who was going through what we were.  Later, I found out about CHD.  I joined and my daughter and I have taken food to the hospital and walked the heart walk together.  She does not like to draw attn. to her condition, so I follow the website.  I am so happy for all the parents that have this great resource when they need it most. Every time I look at the website I cry... it takes me right back to the moment of her surgery. Valerie does an incredible job with this website.  Any parent, or loved one with a child who has been through this will appreciate this great organization.

It was then that we found out that our son was going to be born with heart defects. We were scared and felt very alone. Of course our family and friends offered support but they weren't in our shoes and didn't truly understand what we were feeling. After searching the internet and talking to people the only organization we could find was CHD Families Association. I talked to Valarie Rexin and she could totally relate to what we were feeling. When we were at the hospital she sent us a couple of bracelets and a blanket. Even though she was a couple of thousand miles from us at least we knew there was someone in the world who knew what we were going threw.It may not seem significant to some but we didn't take those bracelets off until our son was a year old. The year following our son's birth a new nonprofit organization in our area started up and we belong to it but Valarie gave us the support we needed when we needed it. She is very active with her organization, in fact the president of the group we associate with knows her and has worked on the quilt project with her in the past.

Being able to connect with other parents who have been there as well as the care packages when your child is having surgery is such a comfort.

The aspect about the performance that stood out to me the most was how it truly made me think about my opinions about the world and how I view people.  I knew I wanted to become involved because I believe the type of theatre being done here can make an impact on society rather than simply entertain it.  Having worked on one production since I have found the staff to be professional and courteous while still focused on their mission.

Each production was carefully and caringly directed; the performances both nuanced and demonstrative.  The venue setting  the black box at the Kranzberg Center  is intimate and attractive.  Upstream is already a high point in the burgeoning St. Louis theater scene.
Upstream Theater	31883	8	/users/profile/32714	alex2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2010	Philip Boehm, Upstream's director, helped me develop my play, The Polish Egg Man, from very rough draft to production at Upstream. His warmth, care, dedication, and sensitive and generous imagination have been a great gift. Upstream's commitment to developing new work -- and to bringing international work to American audiences -- is unusual among regional theaters, and probably unique among regional theaters of its size. I returned to St. Louis to see another Upstream Production, The Concert/El Concierto. It was moving, funny, and finely crafted. There's a (growing) community of Upstream supporters and collaborators in St. Louis and elsewhere -- all of whom are passionate about the work the theater does and seriously loyal to its mission. I'm glad to be a member of that community.
Upstream Theater	31686	6	/users/profile/32544	ladybug2	Board Member	5	02/27/2010	Upstream Theater es la mejor compania profesional de teatro independiente en St. Louis, Missouri. Pero esto no solo lo digo yo, sino tambien la clasificacion del periodico River Front Times, que ha clasificado a Upstream Theater como la mejor compania de teatro de St. Louis. Hace 22 anios que vivo en St. Louis, pero originalmente soy de Argentina, por lo que me complace enormemente que Upstream se haya creado con la mision de poner en escena teatro internacional, en una ciudad poco caracterizada por presentar obras de teatro de otra extraccion que no sea la anglosajona. En epocas como la contemporanea, en donde estamos globalmente comunicados y en la que celebramos la diversidad, Upstream ha traido un aire fresco a nuestra ciudad, desafiando al espectador a pensar criticamente sobre temas profundos, que nos conciernen a todos como seres humanos, presentados en una estetica sumamente creativa y original, y basada en una depurada convencion teatral, en puestas que conmueven y sorprenden. Upstream saca al espectador de su lugar de confort, para otorgarle una esperiencia estetica profunda, que se lleva a casa y permanece con el no solo en la emocion, sino en el planteo critico y filosofico que le provoca y que debe elaborar. De esta forma, Upstream no solo abre la puerta del mundo del treatro internacional en St. Louis, sino que tambien promueve en el espcetador una apertura mental internacional, intelectual, filosofica, emocional y estetica poco experimentada a nivel teatral por estos lares. Cada puesta de Upstream es un desafio a todo nivel, y un enriquecimiento para el alma.

Woyzeck opened up the whole issue of the depersonalization of this moment in history. And Berlin/Wall also explored the divisions among cultures and nations of our time.Each play was spledidly written, directed, and acted. Upstream is taking on challenging material and mounting it with great skill.The Very Reverend Dr. J. C. Michael Allen

I found each one challenging and very different from the others.  Upstream has chosen to produce plays that stretch the mind.  Woyzak was staged in a theater in the round with three separate focal points on the stage.  Helga's Night was presented in a more traditional box space.  Berlin/Wall was a reading, yet it made excellent use of a theatrical space.  Acting has been excellent in every performance.  St. Louis audiences have responded well to Upstream Theater.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Resources Inc	46000	5	/users/profile/46875	madisonsmom	Client Served	5	06/27/2010	We lost our 3 week old daughter Madison suddenly and unexpectedly in January 2005.  Not knowing where to turn, a SIDS grief counselor was at our house the very next day with a packet of information and the SIDS Survival Guide.  We soon began attending the support group meetings and they were a lifesaver.  Just having a safe place to talk about our loss and the daily struggles we faced helped us tremendously as none of our peers could understand what we were going through.  Suddenly, we didn't feel so alone. I don't know how we could have survived that first year without the support of SIDS Resources.  We were especially grateful for the candlelighting ceremony in December because we wanted to commemorate our daughter's birthday that month, but weren't sure how to do it - so the candlelighting has become a nice tradition to say Happy Birthday & Merry Christmas to our sweet girl.

She was a lifesaver.  We were able to take our older two daughters, 3 and 5 at the time, to the SIDS office to talk to someone, and we were given the SIDS Survival Guide... I read it cover to cover and realized we were not alone.  It was so good to go to the monthly meetings and know I had a friend there, someone who cared and worried about me.  We are still friends 14 yrs later.

Within a week or two of Jenna's death, a SIDS Resources, Inc. counselor visited our home to talk with us and provide support.  We received printed materials, sympathy, condolences, support, and a referral to a peer support.  We immediately began attending the monthly support group meetings with other parents who have experienced a sudden death of a baby.  We have not missed one meeting in the past 11 months as we gain a tremendous amount of support from others in the group.  It's the one place we can talk about anything and everything related to Jenna and her death and know that we are understood.

I cannot imagine how we would have survived the next years without help from SRI.   In addition to the formal group meetings, we made contact with other families on we were introduced to through SIDS Resources on our own.  After our next child was born, we had a host of support and wisdom from people who have been in the same postion as we.  A counselor even made a night-time home vist to our child care provider to go over risk reduction: three years after our loss.  We cannot sing the praises of this organization loud enough.

We were beside ourselves with grief, struggling each day just to breathe.  SIDS Resources saved us.  There is truly nothing more tragic than the death of a baby and many of our friends and family were afraid to talk about what happened to our son. SIDS Resources provided a safe place to come together with other grieving parents and talk openly about the experience of losing a child.  Most importantly, by talking to "experienced parents" and the SIDS counselors, we found hope for the future.  We found a way to celebrate the tremendous joy that Baby George brought to our family for the very brief time he was with us.  When we discovered we were expecting another baby, the SIDS counselors and other parents helped us through the tremendous anxiety that it could happen again.It's been five years since we lost George and we have since been blessed with two beautiful daughters.  We still miss George every single day, but we're living again - and we're very happy.  I don't know how we would have survived without SIDS Resources.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Resources Inc	43733	7	/users/profile/44621	tricia5	Client Served	5	06/11/2010	My sweet daughter, Avery died on July 12, 2007. She was my second daughter and the one to complete our family. After her death I knew my survival for the sake of my older daughter meant finding somebody to talk to since family and friends just can't understand. I am married but my husband is the silent type. I made the initial contact with SIDS Resources since there is no service like this closer to me. A staff member came to my home along with materials for our whole family including teenage cousins and she invited me to attend group support meetings. I was very hesitant, but then very glad I went once there. I didn't just get support, but made new friends. Friends who DO understand. After going to a couple of meetings we did find out my baby did not die from SIDS, but from suffocation at the babysitters house. This didn't matter to my new friends. To them it was still a sudden loss of an infant...my Avery. I can't imagine how I would have made it through those first six months after her death and then been able to go on to have more children if it wasn't for SIDS Resources. Thank you all so much for everything you do for families like us. I wish there wasn't a reason for an organization like this but I'm sure glad there is one.

Our son, Logan died of SIDS at our daycare provider's home.  We were thrown into a world of grief, confusion, and saddness.  We received a phone call and note from the SIDS Resources Coordinator.  Two weeks later, she made an in-home visit and explained how they would help us in our journey of grief.  We were introduced as strangers but found a new family to love and care for us through a very dark time in our life.  They also provided a book of stories and testimonials from families, who had experienced the same.  SIDS Resources Community embraced us and took away some of the loneliness that we experienced.  This is an amazing organization and as long as babies die of SIDS, this organization needs and must continue.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Resources Inc	42717	9	/users/profile/43439	sara16	Client Served	5	06/02/2010	Our son, Carl Matthew Tamburrino, died in 1992 at three weeks of age.  They told us at that time he died of SIDS.  I received supportive services, a newsletter with helps on dealing with this type of loss, as well as support through telephone calls and contacts, when I needed to talk to someone.  Later on I did some volunteer works as a Peer Contact, where I listened to and shared with parents who had had babies die in the recent past.  I feel it so important that there be someone who will listen to these parents going through the death of their child, assure them that they are going through normal reaction to tremendous loss.  About 4 years ago, I began actually working part time in the area, covering the mostly rural area of southern Missouri that I live in. I also still volunteer.  I am currently doing risk reduction education, with both professionals and parents and future parents, as we now know that many of the cases of sudden deaths of infants can be prevented by following Safe Sleep rules.  I also work with parent who have had a baby die suddenly and unexpectedly.  All of this work is partly a give back of the help that I was given initially and a way of hopefully reducing the number of babies dying of these causes.  I do it all in honor of my infant son, Carl who died 18 years ago.

She has inspired the women to reach for more.  She has shown them by example that they can succeed.  Dawn works with the poorest of the poor, most of whom cannot read or write.  And, we have watched in amazement as the women grasp the concepts and turn their efforts into a small business allowing them to send their children to school, to provide better nutrition for them, and to pay for needed medical care.Thank you, Dawn, for bringing your heart for women and your expertise to our women in Burkina Faso!

A healing spirit more powerful than any darkness we may encounter. We sometime lose sight of this force when there is suffering, and too much pain. Then suddenly, the spirit will emerge through the lives of ordinary people who hear a call and answer in extraordinary ways.  - quote by Richard Attenborough  - though often mis-attributed-to St. Mother Teresa -   ...the quote's author though, matters not when realizing that it is but one extraordinary human being, ... Dawn Malcolm, who is quite literally the living epitome of all that these very assimilating words can possibly convey. - One can only be inspired by such dedication, hope, love, trust, all giving, teaching, education, selfless service to others as Dawn so passionately bestows on others  - A phenomenal organization whose works need to be highlighted so that all can see and be 'moved' by  this light in the world. A journey to be followed and emulated in all ways possible.  -  We are thankful to share and experience such a journey with Lighting the Path Enterprises.

One example is a young woman who was deaf, but misunderstood by her friends and families, was shown how to communicate thru sign language by Dawn. Another example is a young woman whose arm was cut off by her husband, and Dawn is in the process of finding her a prosthetic arm, at Lighting the Path/Dawn's own expense.  She has taken used baseball uniforms for the kids, only she can identify all the things she has done.  She has traveled there even with the knowledge that there has been currently some unrest.

Camp Fire	137352	1	/users/profile/183326	calliegirl	Board Member	5	11/12/2012	I grew up going to a really cool summer camp. This camp isn't just any camp, it is a Camp Fire camp. Not only is this camp apart of the organization, it also runs with the values and passions which Camp Fire upholds. I applied to become a National Youth Advisory Cabinet member so that I could further my role in the nonprofit organization of Camp Fire.  As a member of the National Youth Advisory Cabinet, I do not represent the camp or local council that I am from. I represent the voice for all Camp Fire youth throughout this country. Along with 15 other wonderful and dedicated youth, we give  youth voice in many of the decisions that Camp Fire Headquarters  makes, as well as representing youth at national events. Throughout the time I have been involved with Camp Fire, I have become very confident in myself as a leader. I have also found confidence in my voice, because in Camp Fire my voice matters. It is not just my voice, but every other youth's voice in this country that Camp Fire cares about. Camp Fire encourages youth to lift their voices, because they do matter. I know my opinion on Camp Fire matters, which is why I am writing this review. I am not someone who doesn't know anything about this organization, I am someone who has grown up and into Camp Fire's wide open arms. This organization is extremely inclusive, and will accept and treat others with respect and dignity.  Camp Fire wants to help youth members find their spark, through this organization I have found mine.

Some of the most impressive attributes of Camp Fire are the inclusionary nature of the org, the range of programs offered, and the flexibility to suit the needs of all constituents.

In Camp Fire I learned to be a leader, that I was a strong person with many talents, that I could do anything I tried and to try things that I had never tired.  I learned that there were amazing adults who cared about me, our community and giving service.  There were many areas where I was not at the top of the class  but in CAmp Fire it did not matter.  I was accepted for who I was and encouraged to increase my knowledge and skills so I could be successful in life.  I also learned that the out of doors was a great place to learn.  I learned to survive difficult situations, to be a critical thinker, to cook using limited resources--a skill that has served me well, and so very much more.

The schedule was well put together and every detail in place.  It was a life-changing week.  Not only for the orphanages, but for myself and every individual that went to Jamaica. I am looking forward to going on more trips with Partnership International!   If you want to go on a short term mission trip, look no further than Partnership International!

Having an internship for the first time that is related to my field of study will be a great opportunity to acquire skills and experiences that I can incorporate into my career, especially since my internship with Beloved Streets of America is a very hands on and application based internship.

Beloved Streets Of America Inc	322899	1	/users/profile/416991	Nichimyo R.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2017	Hello, my name is Nichimyo Rich and I am a PR agent at Beloved Streets of America. I have been interning at BSA for almost two months and it has been a wonderful experience. It has helped me grow in various ways. Initially, I applied for this internship to help gain better experience in PR and use the skills I have learned in class in a real world setting. I also applied because I want to be a non-profit sector as I advanced in my career. I have not only used my skills that I've been taught but I've learned so much about PR in the last two months that allowed to continue to fuel my passion about that subject. This internship has also allowed me to better manage my time, be more organized and allow me to grow socially as well. I am truly thankful for this opportunity and I can't wait for what the future holds for me at this organization.  
Beloved Streets Of America Inc	322865	1	/users/profile/416944	Toshya	Volunteer	5	02/08/2017	I joined Beloved Streets of America back in September of 2016. I joined because I wanted to gain more skills in Public Relations post college, to show employers that I was still trying to build my media skills. And I must say, the gains I've received from this virtual internship have been more than I could have ever dreamed. My technical writing, scheduling, and leadership skills have all increased tenfold. I've gained connections that I will cherish for years to come. And I have gotten to be a small part of something huge. I always knew I wanted a career in nonprofit Public Relations, but out of college, it was hard breaking into the PR workforce in general. Well, BSA has more than rekindled my passion for nonprofit work, and I will forever be grateful. 
Beloved Streets Of America Inc	322845	2	/users/profile/416906	Ambika	Volunteer	4	02/08/2017	My BSA internship has definitely given me a better understanding of my skill set and where my career may take me, but most importantly, Ive come to learn that I am not alone. This job has taught me that almost everybody is in my same position. Very few college students know what they want to do, and it is something that is simply not worth worrying about. Thanks to my I know that if I continue to work hard things will fall into place. Coworkers have a lot of experience and they have obviously made it in that particular field. Ask them how they got this far and what advice they have for you. You could learn a lot and get some great ideas.

Beloved Streets Of America Inc	322530	3	/users/profile/416420	jaclynsummer	Volunteer	5	02/02/2017	Beloved Streets of America is an impassioned organization run by a dedicated and diverse group of people with a common goal: revitalization. BSA uses the philosophy and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a jumping off place, and rebuilds communities from the bedrock up. There's an understanding at BSA of just what makes a prosperous community tick, of what projects and services will not only make a community safer and healthier, but also allow its citizenry continuous growth and improvement. They focus on building restorations, the implementation of basic community services and public spaces, and other efforts that can give sustainable life to a systemically impoverished area.I've interned with BSA since December of 2016, and have seen the determination of the people who volunteer there. Their efforts began on the Martin Luther King Dr. in St. Louis, and definitely won't stop there. Hundreds of streets in America bear the name of Dr. King, and many are in dire need of BSA's efforts! Please support them today, and help show the nation that caring for disenfranchised communities benefits not only the people living there, but each and every one of us!

I love their mission (it's very unique) and it's something that needs to be talked more about, especially during these times. I am currently a blogger intern and have not only learned about the issues going on related to streets named after Martin Luther King Jr., but also important skills such as time management, leadership, and writing (of course!). Everyone involved in BSA is so down-to-earth and passionate. Definitely would recommend getting involved with Beloved Streets of America if you can!!

They have been a pleasure to intern with and it has been exciting to see their fundrasing efforts succeed. Please donate to this organization and help make a difference!

Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	293177		/users/profile/383763	kriegs	Volunteer	5	06/16/2016	I have been a volunteer in many capacities for ROSL and have found the organization to have high standards towards both the patient/client and horses. The respect and safety maintained as a priority is always evident but is provided with a positive and cheerful atmosphere. I can understand why they continue to get good ratings with organizations like Variety Club and the BBB. 
Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	292392		/users/profile/382908	jannifer	Volunteer	5	06/07/2016	I co-chaired the very first Ride On St.Louis dinner auction fund raiser and it was successful, so we kept going.  I look back and reminisce over how many lives/families have been truly touched by this experience.  I say families because so many of the riders feel this is something they have all on their own that they can do.  Their siblings may have soccer,baseball, etc., but this is all there's and they learn and enjoy it so much, just watch their faces light up!  Besides the physical benefits, the emotional love between rider, horse, and staff is incredible!
Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	290415		/users/profile/380740	AudreyW	Volunteer	5	05/19/2016	I have had the privilege of volunteering on and off for Ride On St. Louis over the last five years.  It is truly a great professional organization.  I appreciate the wholesome environment in which therapy is provided.  The love and care with which the staff and volunteers work, provides a healing environment for the mind, body, and soul of the individuals they work with.  There is a high level of excellence that is maintained in every facet of this organization.  
Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	290414		/users/profile/380739	Writer	Former staff	5	05/19/2016	I came upon Ride On St. Louis the summer of 2013.  Their facilities had flooded out and I volunteered to help with cleanup.  I was immediately drawn to what they do; providing equine assisted therapy to individuals with disabilities.  As a military veteran who had recently returned from deployment to Afghanistan, I had heard so much about PTSD and traumatic brain injuries; and how veterans were using this type of therapy.  After returning, I didn't work for some time and eventually lost motivation and became depressed.  I felt somewhat guilty for coming home without injury.  After volunteering with cleanup, I knew I needed to volunteer with Ride On as a way for me to give back and clear my conscience of guilt.  I ended up taking a position with Ride On that September as their Volunteer Coordinator.  I stayed in that position for two years until the birth of my first born required me to move on.  I had never experienced equine therapy before Ride On.  I didn't know what to expect.  I was surprised and amazed at the little miracles of change and progress seen with so many clients.  I don't understand why, but I can attest to witnessing positive impacts in the lives of so many.  The staff at Ride On have a passion for what they do and make every effort to provide the highest quality of service to their clients.  I will always be grateful for the opportunity to be associated with such a wonderful organization.

I am nearing the end of my first 10 week session with ROSL and it has been an outstanding experience.It is a well run and efficient organization where everyone involved is dedicated to delivering the best possible product to their clientel.

Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	288736		/users/profile/378933	Vinebranch	Client Served	5	05/05/2016	Five years ago my son with multiple disabilities, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, began working with Marita at Ride On St. Louis.  Marita is the founder of Ride On St. Louis as well as a certified Therapeutic Riding Instructor.  Through this program, Marita's skills, and the patience of  horses at ROSL, my son Drew has made such progress!  At first it was a struggle just to be able to sit balanced in the saddle.  Johnny, a Morganhorse (and Drew's favorite) was patient as my son gained the ability not only to stay balanced in the saddle, but to actually keep balanced while Johnny was led through various gaits by Marita.  This brought about an improvement in Drew's walking gait,  as well as his ability to run.  Drew really connected with the horse when he began petting Johnny and helping to groom him, which also increased the strength and range of motion of Drew's arms.  Most importantly, Drew began to attend to what was happening around him instead of "zoning out", an autism trait.  Working with Marita, and Ride On St Louis, has increased Drew's confidence in connecting with other people.  Drew has graduated with working with other horses, among which is Lucy.  After his sessions with Lucy, Drew would enter our home announcing "Lucy!  I'm hooommme!" and then tell me "that is from 'I Love Lucy" Mom!" Now my son and I talk with one another, and Drew no longer staggers about when he walks.  He has gained confidence.   Drew still is learning.  However, I am SO thankful for Ride On St Louis, and for the work Marita has done with Drew.  The results are priceless!

Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	233928	2	/users/profile/297961	LKB9	Volunteer	5	11/18/2014	My daughter and I started volunteering for Ride On St Louis a little over 3 years ago because of our love for horses.  Over these 3 years we have found so much more to love than horses.  We have been working with the same client every session and have formed a strong bond with him and his family.  To watch his progress over the years has been a joy.  We also have built many new friendships with the staff and other volunteers at Ride On St Louis.  We are really just one big happy family that is always there for each other.  We just happen to be a family with several horses, 3 cats and a dog!  We look forward to our Wednesday nights at Ride On St Louis and feel so blessed to have found such a wonderful place to spend our time.
Ride On St. Louis, Inc.	216485	1	/users/profile/279980	NancyR77	Volunteer	5	09/23/2014	As a volunteer, I see first hand the wonderful services this organization provides. Ride On St Louis (ROSL) was founded in 1998 by Marita Wassman. She's been the Director ever since. She provides a vast amount of experience and knowledge along with dedication and compassion for the humans and the horses. ROSL is one of the few Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) programs to receive the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International (PATH) certification. This treatment program is and has been improving the quality of life for children and adults. I can't say enough about how impressed I've been with the professional staff of a Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapists and Instructors that prepare the treatment programs for each and every rider. They are all so dedicated. Many times they are 'hands on' with the riders during the sessions; conducting several sessions throughout the day. Safety for the riders and proper care and handling of the horses are of utmost importance. Therefore, all volunteers are required to go through rigorous training sessions in order to qualify for a position. The real reward for me is to see the happiness that each accomplishment brings to the rider and their parents. ROSL is changing lives!

I volunteer my time to this organization instead of othrs because of the ability to leverage the available funding with the use of volunteer labor and energy in everything they do.  For instance, repairs that are made to the home of existing residents are increased beyond what contrating work funding can provide, because volunteers perform the labor of less technical tasks.  This makes every government and private dollar go that much further.
Lemay Housing Partnership Inc	100918		/users/profile/125631	celinessnd	Board Member	5	11/21/2011	I've served on the board of Lemay Housing Partnership for 10 years. I keep donating my time to this cause because there are so many home owners in the Lemay are that need our services. We impact our immediate neighborhood by helping low-income home-owners improve the safety and beauty of their homes while providing educational opportunities for them related to home ownership. In addition to repairing homes, we are now working with others to replace derelict properties with new, affordable homes.
Lemay Housing Partnership Inc	100494		/users/profile/122774	DIadevito	Board Member	5	11/10/2011	I have had the privilege of working with Lemay Housing Partnership for almost 3 years now and I continue to be amazed at the level of dedication that each and every staff member, board member, volunteer, and community leader has for the organization and the Lemay community. LHP realizes that the "Housing" in Lemay Housing goes beyond fresh paint, a new furnace, or energy efficiency, and really encompasses the entire "home" which includes the residents; healthy housing includes healthy inhabitants. LHP works to ensure that clients needs are met to allow them to sustain their home and live an overall healthier lifestyle. As the organization continues to look toward the future they are committed to expanding their programs to try and strengthen the Lemay infrastructure in many ways, including partnerships with other Lemay organizations that focus on economic development. This organization never stops caring and never stops thinking about ways to improve the Lemay community... a place they will always call home.
Lemay Housing Partnership Inc	100468	1	/users/profile/122661	pmannharddds	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2011	I've worked in Lemay for over 30 years. we have a housing market that is very challenged by a number of issues. The Lemay area has a relatively low/middle income residential population, with a substantial number of seniors, many of whom are on a fixed income. They are challenged to keep up with the needs of their homes.  Many of the homes were built way before the "60s and at a time when zoning and building requirements were quite lax.  The infrastructure of the community is lacking in many ways; streets, curbs, sidewalks, sewer, lighting. all adding to needs of the areas residents. With these challenges the Lemay Housiong Partnership stepped in some 10-12 years ago to try and assist. It has had a great deal of success. And maybe most importantly it has established itself as the place for residents and local and government leaders to turn to regarding  housing issues.  Keep up the good work LHP. The area needs you.
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	317239		/users/profile/408418	William Ye	Board Member	5	10/31/2016	An organization that provides this level of performance free to a community deserves to be supported. Every year for a few weeks in the summer, diverse audiences are served up a truly professional inspiring and entertaining experience. Open free to the public, families and groups continue to make the festival performances a tradition. Its a chance for fans of theater to enjoy Shakespeare in the park and a chance to create new fans. Its not just the performances that make this organization worthy of repeat praise and financial support. They offer year-round education programs including workshops taught by professional actors and teaching artists that nurture an early appreciation for Shakespeare, language and the arts and an apprentice acting troupe for graduates of the Shakespeare Conservatory workshops.  For 25 years, this organization has been part of the growing Kansas City arts community and as a reflection of the cities soul and personality. I cant stress the impressive quality of performances and engagements the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival produces.  Supporting this organization is showing the world how important supporting the performing arts and arts education is to the city.
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	314386		/users/profile/405746	pardav	Board Member	5	10/25/2016	Attending the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival is one of my family's favorite summer traditions. Seeing a Shakespeare play under the stars in Southmoreland Park is always a treat. The high-quality productions feature Equity actors, original music, and professional lighting, sound, costume and scenic design. Come early to take advantage of the preshow entertainment and enjoy a picnic or a glass of wine before the show. You can bring chairs or blankets and take advantage of the free admission, but don't forget to donate what you can. The most convenient option is to reserve great seats directly in front of the stage for just $25 each. Either way, the Shakespeare Festival is the best theatre bargain in town. Don't miss "Hamlet" June 13-July 2, 2017!The Festival also offers  excellent year-round performances and education programs in partnership with arts organizations and cultural institutions throughout the city. Check www.kcshakes.org for details. Children and teens won't want to miss the Festival's highly-regarded summer camps and year-round education programs. My kids had so much fun learning acting, improv, Shakespeare, and stage combat that they didn't realize how much their academic and public speaking skills had improved

Whether thru employment, family experiences or bringing my college classes to productions, the experiences are always positive, educational and rewarding. The impact this festival has on the Kansas City regional area cannot be measured in total. Beyond the dollars and entertainment it provides, the cultural enrichment to 25 years of audiences is without bounds and cannot be underestimated.
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	313554		/users/profile/404921	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2016	The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival is a real asset to the Kansas City metro.  Not only does HASF bring free, high-quality professional theater to all, it also educates adults and children of all ages about Shakespeare and the arts all year long.  As a teacher of Shakespeare, I especially appreciate the numerous opportunities to supplement my instruction with real Shakespeare-related experiences, such as local performances, exhibits, and lectures.    In an age that has witnessed diminishing government support for the arts, HASF continues to provide such programming.   HASF is indeed a great non-profit and deserving of recognition.

This is especially true when it comes to the KC theater community.HASF's student/educational programs, apprentice companies and professional productions are all top notch.  If you have a student interested in theater HASF is the place to start. If you have never been to the summer productions in Southmoreland Park you must go!Our family has been involved with HASF for the past 5 and a half years. All five of our children have participated in the educational programs, the apprentice company.Three of them have even enjoyed being a part of the professional company productions over the past number of summers. In fact, because of HASF and it's wonderful staff, two of our children are pursuing theater as a profession.
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	312476		/users/profile/403846	thekenj8	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival is a theatrical and artistic mainstay in Kansas City.  Their mission is to make Shakespeares works accessible to a diverse audience through professional theatre and educational programs.  Many Kansas Citians are familiar with their summer performance in Southmoreland Park, but they may not realize that HASF is active year round, with an extensive educational program (including classes for children and adults, as well as special performances), fundraising events, and various artistic works the festival undertakes in cooperation with other arts groups in the greater Kansas City area.I have volunteered with HASF for several years now, in a variety of capacities.  Ive dressed in costume and asked for donations at their summer show (which is free to the public so that everyone can enjoy a professional Shakespearean production).  I have participated at various fundraising events, like their Valentines Day gala, in which they aim to raise scholarship money so that any interested child can attend the festivals educational camps, regardless of their financial situation.  At this event you hear remarkable testimonials from the children and young adults who have attended these camps, telling first-hand how their lives have been changed and improved through the experience and confidence they have gained.  Ive also performed in some of HASFs educational productions, visiting libraries and grade schools, and in some cases introducing children to the works of William Shakespeare for the very first time.  I have helped out at arts fairs and other events around the area, trying to raise awareness of the good work that this organization is doing.Beyond the contributions HASF is making to the community, their staff is comprised of a wonderful group of individuals.  Its truly a pleasure to work with them (and lots of fun).  The organization is professionally run, well organized, considerate of their volunteers time and talents, and always looking for new opportunities to bring Shakespeare and the arts to the community.  I cant recommend them highly enough!

Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	309825	1	/users/profile/401179	RTownsend	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2016	During my tenure as Producing Director of Shakespeare Festival St. Louis (2000-07), I enjoyed travelling across the state to our colleague Shakespeare company, Heart of America Shakespeare Festival, to experience their stellar productions in Southmoreland Park. The plays were always well-produced, the stories clear, and the ambiance in the park was always welcoming and festive. I always left those productions enlightened and encouraged about the role of nonprofit arts in our communities.Heart of America Shakespeare Festival is a gift to the city and well worthy of the community's support in every way.  The benefits of HoA's cultural experiences are reflected in the lives, minds, and hearts of those who participate in them, and Kansas City and the region are enriched as a result. 
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	308812	1	/users/profile/400187	merrilyjackson	Donor	5	10/07/2016	The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival has enriched my summers for the past 25 years.  I attend the play at least twice every season; once is never enough. The Bards words, the quality of the acting and directing, the production values, the magic of Southmoreland Park as the sun sets all contribute to making seeing the play an unparalleled experience for the audience. And ANYONE can experience it, regardless of their ability to pay. HASF is a giant in the arts scene in our community, a wonderful gift to Kansas City, and a blessing for me personally.
Heart of America Shakespeare Festival	308335	1	/users/profile/399723	DarrenSextro	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2016	The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival, in its 25 years, has become a necessary part of the Kansas City cultural arts scene. What began as a modest way to enjoy the works of Shakespeare in an outdoor theater environment has expanded over the years into an experience that educates new theater-goers, introduces diverse audiences to great works, instigates discussions about the play topics, and provides opportunities for children to expect this type of intelligent and exciting experience every summer (and even year-round). I cannot imagine this city without the Shakespeare Festival and all that it gives back to its citizens.

They introduce inmates to Jesus Christ and how He can be an active role in their lives.  They provide programs to better improve social skills, and prepare the inmates for life on the outside.  Showing the inmates how to deal with their past failings.  How to deal with the incarceration.  
Beauty for Ashes Ministry	266241	1	/users/profile/355009	Amber78	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	Beauty for Ashes is by far my favorite charity to work with. Not only are they impacting the lives of prisoners & helping them transition outside of the prison system, but it impacts the lives of the volunteers as well. My life changed the day I went to prison & was covered in prayer by a group that was incarcerated - to see & experience that type of humanity impacted my faith so much. I went to help teach them about Christ & experience a church service, I walked out with a whole new perspective on life. Anybody looking to volunteer to change lives & also be impacted themselves I would highly recommend BFA. They are amazing.

A lot of time people want to forget the ones that are in prison and tag them as no good, Beauty for Ashes goes in and not only treats these people as people but teaches them that they are loved and wanted.  If you are looking for a group to help out or to support in any way this is it.  Keep up the great work Beauty for Ashes crew.

My name is Nikki Matney and I actually went through the Beauty for Ashes program in Vandalia, Mo. This ministry has taught me that there is an amazing and loving God that is intimately involved with every detail in my life. Once released, the volunteers in the ministry and Gina herself served as an encouraging and exhorting support system and helped me  abundantly in regards to reintergrating into society. I now, by the grace of God,  have started my own business,  have sole custody of my kids,  and am volunteering in Shawnee County correctional facility helping ladies like myself,deal with addiction while encouraging recoveryin their lives.

I was hesitant to allow her to attend this event due to the cost and just not knowing much about the activities that would take place etc...Although I agreed to let her attend and I am so glad that I did. MASC has been such a positive experience for her and continues to be influential in her decisions and actions after returning from this camp. She is going to be attending a Winter Energizer session this coming week and has been so excited about this since registering in the fall of this past year! I am also excited to see what she is able to learn about herself and her peers again after this next experience. What these teens are able to experience, learn, and development is PRICELESS. As an Human Resources Manager these are the exact types of LEADERS we want to hire in our organizations. The confidence and leadership that my daughter has gained could have never been achieved through a traditional classroom or any other activity. She has played volleyball since she was in 5th grade; one of her weaknesses has been confidence and leading on the court. She is a very capable player however she is her own worst critic at the same time. This past season was incredible. She played with a lot passion, confidence and lead the team in many many areas! It was an exciting change to see and I know it came from this experience with MASC. I am grateful for the individuals who are willing to invest in these teens and make a real difference in their lives. I am so glad that my child has this experience that she will remember for a lifetime. She has made many friends through this experience that she still remains in contact with; I love that MASC has made her world much bigger than it once was. Thank you again and keep doing great things MASC!

Missouri Association of Student Councils	287394		/users/profile/377485	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2016	The Missouri Association of Student Councils (MASC) has left an indelible mark on my students, my school and I, both professionally and personally. Through the MASC partnership with Special Olympics, my students and school have made an impact that goes far beyond beingFans in the Stands. My school and community now benefits from a Leadership Class and a Life Skills class, which came about because of MASC. Students in the Leadership Class are all Class A volunteers with Special Olympics, plan activities involving their Life Skills classmates and partner with their Buddies in the Life Skills class to perform certain tasks, such as run the high school recycling program.  As part of a very strong MASC district organization and state organization, students are actively engaged in district meetings as well as state convention. They collaborate with peers to learn new ideas for community betterment (social, spirit, community-service based activities etc.) as well as learn methods and techniques to improve existing projects and activities. Students forge friendships with peers and host families that transcend grade levels and geographic location.Professionally, MASC has provided invaluable professional development opportunities. The advisors workshop and summer leadership camp are particularly valuable for the depth and breadth of topics addressed and the opportunity for hands-on experiences. I have experienced personal growth and satisfaction personally. I have formed some very strong friendships with my STUCO BFFs. The advisors on the listserv and our executive members are quick to respond to address issues and answer questions and sometimes just provide a much needed pat on the back.I was a Student Council kid in high school; it is amazing to come full circle and see my students learn how to become better citizens, and in so doing improve themselves and their communities.

Two years into college, I still say that MASC has been the biggest influence on who I am today. I know that without my training through conventions and camp, and especially as a Junior Counselor, I would not have the confidence or the ability to do what I am doing now. I owe my public speaking skills. confidence, and willingness to work outside my comfort zone all to my time spent at camp over the years. The relationships I have made through my MASC are my biggest support network, and I still call some of the people I went to camp with my best friends. Thanks to everything I learned at MASC, I helped start successful student organization at Mizzou that several other MASC alums are a part of. I know that we would not have the skills or drive to make this a reality without our past experience with MASC camps and conventions. I am also getting to witness firsthand how MASC is changing my little brothers' lives, and its incredible to see how much they have grown because of their involvement.

Bach Aria Soloists	31504	3	/users/profile/32378	singerskot	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2010	One of the most pleasurable evenings I've had all year was to experience the Bach Aria Soloists' program last June called "Baroque in Motion."  As a collaboration with the Owens/Cox dance studio, it was a wonderful visual and musical event.  The dancers were excellent and original, and two of the players were absolutely entrancing.  Elizabeth Suh Lane and Paula Kosower had me spellbound by their stunning technical and musical playing.  And to hear Rebecca Lloyd and David Adams was like being in the presence of Heavenly Hosts.  Never miss an opportunity to hear this fantastic ensemble.
Bach Aria Soloists	31431	12	/users/profile/32319	sally1	Volunteer	5	02/26/2010	Now in its tenth year the Bach Aria Soloists is truly a world class ensemble, which is largely unknown in the Kansas City area. Founder and Executive/Artistic Director Elizabeth Suh Lane has been solo violinist for Sir Neville Marriner, Sir Michael Tilson Thomas, Andre Previn, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and Leonard Bernstein, among others. Her stature in the classical music world has enabled her to bring Christoph Wolff, preeminent authority on Johann Sebastian Bach, to K.C. and resulted in commissioning two works, which had their debut here. She is particularly adept at collaborations withliterary, theatre, and dance, most recently, "Baroque in Motion," with Owen/Cox Ballet Troupe. BAS' signature series, "Hauskonzert," combines exquisite performances, convivial conversation, and a delicious repast in magnificent residences, replicating what Bach, himself, did in his own home. These intimate concerts provide the rare opportunity not only to hear and see the musicians, but also to speak with them individually.
Bach Aria Soloists	31317	8	/users/profile/32221	olivia-horwitz	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2010	My husband and I have been attending the Bach Aria Soloists concerts for the past few years. It is an evening we look forward to each time! Although neither my husband or I know much about classical music, we have a "moving" experience and are always awed after each performance. The group is not only inspirational but also educates us and introduces us to a world of music we would not normally experience. The hausconcerts are intimate and up close and personal. I can imagine myself back in time listening to Bach.
Bach Aria Soloists	30187	10	/users/profile/31191	roxeanne	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2010	I have attended several of Bach Aria Soloists' concerts over the years.  The settings are always diverse and unique from beautiful Kansas City mansions to the Kansas City Public library to some of our area's finest churches. My experience is always the same: the privilege of hearing world class musicians deliver stellar performances time and time again.  I have also enjoyed the times when BAS has collaborated with other artists and introduced live dance into its performances.  Kansas City is extremely fortunate to have such a fine group within its boundaries and more people need to be aware of our own local hidden treasure!
Bach Aria Soloists	29395	8	/users/profile/30419	abby1	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	Bach Aria offers something no other arts organization provides-regionally or nationally. The idea of presenting Bach and contemporaries in house concerts, with musicians commenting on th pieces,is so engaging. The artistic director, Elizabeth Suh Lane, is an elegant speaker and masterful violinist.  She and her colleagues make the music accessible; concerts are warm and intimate affairs.  Also, the affiliation with dancers and other artists has been fun and adventurous!
Bach Aria Soloists	28584	5	/users/profile/29625	j-kirk-davis	Volunteer	5	02/16/2010	Bach Aria Soloists [BAS] is one of the more exquisite  "hidden gems" in the Kansas City cultural and civic landscape. After 28 years in New York City and 4 in Los Angeles, I welcomed the opportunity this smaller city offers music lovers to enjoy top-flight performances in intimate settings not easily found in larger cities on either coast. BAS is at the top of the list when it comes to their seasonal "hauskoncerts" as well as their performances that reach out to larger, diverse audiences at holiday time. Lead by Elizabeth Suh-Lane, a world-class violin virtuoso, BAS appeals to the highest brow yet in a socially relaxed way that brings people together for an evening of great music and song. BAS performances introduce new, up and coming talent to local audiences while commanding the respect and attention of renowned Bach scholars.
Bach Aria Soloists	27987	5	/users/profile/29048	nancycaplan	Volunteer	5	02/11/2010	Bach Aria Soloists makes classical chamber music accessible to some who would not otherwise think "it's for them!"  Artistic Director Elizabeth Suh Lane is innovative, blending her music with classic dance, as with the Owen-Cox Dance Company collaboration.
Bach Aria Soloists	27609	11	/users/profile/28684	regan	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	My first Bach Aria Soloist event in the spring of 2009 was a collaboration between the Owen/Cox Dance Group and Bach Aria. It was spectacular! The vividness of the music and modern dance performances captured my soul. This concert delivered a very genuine, personal experience that has made me a proud supporter of Bach Aria Soloist.I was concerned that I may have seen their best, but subsequent concerts have produced the same spectacular, high-caliber performances. I have enjoyed the house concert series which has provided me the opportunity to sit within arm-reach of the performers as I watch and listen to the extraordinary talents that comprise this group. It is truly an impactful, personal experience, and I committed myself to applying my own talents to help promote the work of Bach Aria Soloists.
Bach Aria Soloists	27181	10	/users/profile/28224	beth1	Board Member	5	02/05/2010	The Bach Aria Soloists are a Kansas City treasure.  The level of expertise is unmatched- always at the highest skill level of the core musicians and guest artists.  And imaginative?  Oh my- always setting the stage for a higher level experience with the music- world premieres, inventive collaborations, enlightening world-renowned speakers, and the list goes on.  How fortunate we are to have the Bach Aria Soloists, and the founder/artistic director/executive director and amazing solo violinist, Elizabeth Suh Lane, in our midst!
Bach Aria Soloists	26788	1	/users/profile/27803	hank	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	I am a founding board member of this extraordinary group, the Bach Aria Soloists.They are celebrating their 10th exciting concert season this year as a self-presenting ensemble, a great achievement in the fiercely competitive arts marketplace especially in this recessionary economy.  The Artistic Director/Founder, Elizabeth Suh Lane's visionary leadership has brought world-class artists- musicians, dancers, composers, scholars-to Kansas City to collaborate and leading local partners- the KC Chorale, the KC Public Library, Owen/Cox Dance, KC guest artists- have invited the BAS to partner. The KC community is the fortunate recipient of their marvelous talent and creative programs.  The Hauskonzert series is a popular success because both the BAS and our patrons believe in the mission of bringing the brilliance of Bach, Baroque and contemporary to new life in intimate spaces. The audience and artists can make a much greater connection when one removes the physical distance of big concert halls and these artists make a point of communicating with their informative performances, and free BachReach Open education to schools.  Their Community concerts have also been sold out and at capacity in recent years, such a great testament to the quality and reputation of this fine ensemble.  I really hope that the Bach Aria Soloists can be a part of your Arts appreciation campaign, as they are a leading chamber music ensemble in the region.

United International Buddha Dhamma Inc	109825		/users/profile/149595	brenda ie-mcrae	Volunteer	5	04/13/2012	I joined Joshua Tree retreat in early 2009 conducted by Bhante Vimalaramsi and experienced an amazing result of equinimity which I had never experienced before during meditation with other techniques/teachers. Having to deal with my husband's condition who had serious infection but I was so balanced and calm, then I went to the center to continue my practice which went deeper. I knew the teaching is correct and immediately effective so when I went back to Indonesia,  I organized retreats in Indonesia for Bhante Vimalaramsi and Sister Khema, totalling 5 retreats in the last 2 years, so many people benefited in a consistent progress we can witness among the students, and they're teaching with so much compassion, kindness and passion... I can say the teaching which Bhante Vimalaramsi does by following the suttas is excellent and closely following the dhamma, taught by the Buddha... May many more benefit from their teaching and reach final happiness in this lifetime... sadhu3x

I was suicidal when I first met Bhante Vimalaramsi on the internet.  After a rocky beginning he asked me to Smile (mouth, eyes, mind, and heart), and within a week I experienced my first mini-awakening, and this caused a permanent, positive change in my life.  The joy of being arose in me for the first time in almost forty years.  Since then my development has steadily progressed, and as I write this review, the meditation practice has taken on a life of its own.  I am happy, even with the mental issues, and I owe my life to the kind and gentle man we all refer to as "Bhante". Please join us!  Experience permanent joy in your life as a result of practicing Tranquil Wisdom Meditation.  This was the true teaching of the Buddha.  What do have to lose?

Sister Khema 3 times to come to Germany, organised the retreats here, accompanied them and visited most of the retreats in Germany, travelled to the Dhammasukha Center and i witnessed that there were many people (beside me) he helped very much with his kind of teaching meditation. Bhante Vimalaramsi goes back to the teachings of the Buddha (Suttas) and explaines them very well.The progress in meditation is extraordinary if you practise the instructions he gives to you.Also we could answer them a lot of questions which were answered by Bhante and Sister Khema patiently. I wish there will be a lot of more people who are openminded and willing to try and practise these teachings. Then they could compare them with other practises and will see the differences and realize what treasure they have found.

United International Buddha Dhamma Inc	58837		/users/profile/62975	Nelum	General Member of the Public	5	12/15/2010	I got to know about Most Venerable Bhante Vimalaramsi, Rev. Sister Khema, and DSMS in MO  from a friend in December, 2009. I immediately did an online retreat with Ven. Bhante Vimalaramsi. His teaching of Forgiveness and Lovingkindness meditation helped me to let go of past pains  and future worries and live happily in the Present moment. His teaching of Lovingkindness and forgiveness are the prescription for good health ,peace, & happiness. In September I did  two week meditaion retreat under the guidence of Ven Bhante V at DSMS in Anapolis, MO. I am very grateful for all guidence  and care that were given to me. The training I have received is  helping  family  and many friends to make dramatic changes in their lives towards happiness. Even though I am a born Buddhist, I learned true Dhamma from Ven Bhante Vimalaramsi. 
United International Buddha Dhamma Inc	58812		/users/profile/62924	cathy	Client Served	5	12/15/2010	I will be forever grateful for being introduced to Dhamma Sukha and Sister Khema.  After visiting the center at Annapolis, Mo and attending Meditation Groups in Ironton, Mo, I am doing a Forgiveness Meditation in my home with guidelines from Sister Khema and help via e-mail.   I have never been part of an organization that has so many resources available such as the Dhamma Sukha site with talks you can download, groups to join via e-mail, access to Sister Khema via e-mail.   I am finding that this approach to Buddhism can be as simple or complex to meet the needs of each individual.  For me, simplicity is important especially to begin so sending "loving kindness" and the power of smiling have started me on a path of joy and love that extends to all life.

After a short period of time practicing meditation I was finding relief but felt like I was still missing something.  When I stumbled upon the website for Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center I was only looking to pick up a few more pointers for my meditation but found much more. Bhante Vimalaramsi and Sister Khema have developed wonderful tools and programs of study that show how to bring the practice of meditation and the peace of mind it develops into everyday life.  With a practical step-by-step approach and a close adherence to actual methods taught by the Buddha over 2000 years ago, Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation has proved immediately effective for me in the relief of suffering and insight into how mind works.  These simple and logical methods, along with some personal attention by Bhante V. and Sister K. (they always seem happy to answer any questions by email or on their group forum page) have put me on the proper path to living a better life and being a better person.

International Institute of Metropolitan St. Louis	112838		/users/profile/153573	lstrathm	Volunteer	5	05/23/2012	I started volunteering with the International Institute in January 2012.   Once a week, I help tutor immigrants who are preparing to take the citizenship test.  The students' stories of how they came to be in America never fail to inspire me, and their enthusiasm for becoming American citizens reminds me what a privilege it is to live here.  My regular job is teaching high school, and there have been many nights when I get home exhausted and think about maybe not volunteering that night.  I always go, and I'm always rewarded many times over by the students who are so eager to learn and appreciative for help.  Likewise, the compassion and dedication of the teachers and other volunteers at the Institute renew my faith in people.  The International Institute provides invaluable services for immigrants and refugees who find themselves alone and afraid in a new country.

Continued support for the institute is absolutely imperative for the well-being of the community. Our region desperately needs a refugee/immigrant influx; this infusion of immigrants is vital for economic development and prosperity. IISTL is one of the few entities in the area that  provides refugee resettlement and training programs. We're trying to embrace, for the entire St. Louis MSA, the influx of immigrants our region so desperately requires. Our Festival of Nations, an annual celebration of culture, draws in excess of 140,000 attendees. This program is vital to Goal II of our Strategic Plan: to be a leader in building a stronger, positive two-way relationship between immigrants and the wider community.

It is an invaluable asset for the refugees it serves, and it plays a significant role in the development of vibrant international community in the south side. Even though I have just started volunteering at the Institute as a teacher's aide, I already feel as though I am a valuable member of the organization. The classroom teacher goes out of his way to make sure that I am an integral part of the daily plan. Whether I am working in the classroom helping students learn about our Constitution, our government, or our geography or giving students practice citizenship interviews or tutoring students one-on-one, the classroom teacher always makes sure that I am keeping busy. I will always remember what it was like seeing a student return to school after passing the citizenship interview. I had given this student a practice interview the week before the actual one. I had worked with him on a one-on-one basis, reviewing all of the questions he struggled with, and when he passed I felt proud--proud to be a part of his success. The workers at the Institute want me to feel welcome. They want to make sure that I feel like my time is valued and not wasted.  Most importantly, though, for three hours every week they provide me with the opportunity to help refugees work towards a new life, and that is all that I really want out of volunteering and what I think volunteering is all about.

They began this experience because they observed in traditional K12 Schools that ESL students were being marginalized by their teachers. This experience with the Institute gave them the opportunity to work with students from other countries before they got into their own classroom and gave them both sensitivity and awareness. Communications students at Meramec went on field trips with II clients as well to learn about communication among cultures. Our partnership with the Institute has given our students real world experience that they will never forget.

Douglas County Historical and Genealogical Society Inc	59813		/users/profile/64826	Katherine	General Member of the Public	5	01/11/2011	I have visited this museum a few times and enjoyed the tours very much.  Even though I do not live in Douglas county, my family has lived there for generations and I have enjoyed learning about my family history there.  The tour guides are very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. ( We particularly enjoyed the old medical equipment display. )

I will be glad when they have enough financial support that they can be open every day.

Pathways to Independence	207358		/users/profile/270010	bettyb	Client Served	4	07/27/2014	Pathways is a one of a kind organization. They not only offer opportunities for participants to socialize and take part in fun activities; but to learn how to engage and interact with others.  These kinds of activities are always educational as well as enjoyable.  Through these social experiences, many participants are connecting with others and overcoming fears which have held them back for years.  PTI is definitely life-changing for many persons who would otherwise be isolated and lonely with only TV or video games for stimulation and entertainment.

Over the last 10 years of my life working in non-profit, I must say the experience has not always been the best and could be very stressful. However, when I started my journey here with Doorways, this organization changed my total perspective and taught me the difference between management and leadership. It definitely says something about a place when your excited to see what's new on the horizon. In my short time here I have also had the opportunity to watch people be empowered to do what they love and to be supported during the journey. Great Job Team!!!

The staff gave me hope for a brighter day. I began to believe in  life again and that I  had a future  in it. Today I am healthy, happy and living independently.

Housing is a basic need and a critical component to a person's health and life.  This is what Doorways is providing to people who are coping with this chronic illness.  Through the services provided by Doorways--such services as assistance with managing medications, teaching job and parenting skills, and, of course, securing a stable, safe residence--clients are able to achieve renewed independence and higher levels of physical, mental and emotional health.  In addition to delivering life-transforming care for clients, Doorways demonstrates excellent stewardship of its resources, including finances and residential facilities, as well as planning for its future with strategic focus.

The organization has a living wage policy for its employees, offers great benefits and support. The administration conducts itself within all accepted best practices in its management style. The programming staff provides outstanding service to its clients.  As an organization that started in 1988, DOORWAYS has grown into a national leader in both the housing and HIV fields.  Until HIV and homelessness are no longer issues that need to be addressed, I am glad DOORWAYS is here.

They do not take care of the type needs there type tenants require. The Gertrude building comes to mind as a major health hazardous building. It is not energy efficient as doors, windows, and tuck point needs to be done. It has asbestos air ducts in its basements, the back decks are falling apart. The front porch is cracking from foundation issues and walls on inside are cracking. If tenant reports any problems they get the " if you do not like it move" quoted verbatim. All tenant are with severe health issues and deserve better. The appliances are not energy efficient the floors are paper thin and uneven in some apartments to the point you have hard time placing furniture. It is really sad that the tenant's are being treated trash and the landlord's have not even completed there kitchens with baseboards and painting after the did the crap design of an eat in kitchen area. Opal Jones was head of that disaster.

My son is disabled but just like other kids he outgrows things before you blink, normally no big deal but if you look at the price of special needs equipment, super big deal. We were able to borrow equipment that was just right for him and then switch for something else when we needed to, that would not have been an option if we had had to pay for equipment. Regular Bumbo $40, special needs Bumbo $199! My sons toddler years were much improved because of the Community Partnership.

I continue to be impressed, especially having had the opportunity to develop a strong partnership with them.  Over the last 2+ years I have had the honor of sending students to volunteer at The Community Partnership, and it never fails they have a blast!

The Community Partnership	112017		/users/profile/152431	mhstoltz	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2012	The Phelps County Community Partnership is making great strides in bettering the lives of people in our area -- especially the young people. Their young parent mentoring program has not only helped young families in our area, it also helps discourage abuse and neglect by offering life skills classes. And there is a much lower case of repeat teen pregnancies among the participants. The Capable Kids and Families program addresses the needs of parents and children in a family with a special-needs child. They not only help with the isolation so common in such families, but they also lend out more than 1,400 pieces of therapeutic equipment -- equipment that is cost-prohibitive and typically no covered by insurance. The Phelps County Community Partnership does all of this -- and much more -- while still being good stewards of donors' money. 84% of the funds donated by individuals goes directly to programs and the proceeds from the Partnership Resale Shop also go directly back into programming.

Their dedicated and efficient staff are incredibly committed to their mission and have effectively helped to educate and empower PKD patients worldwide.  Through my involvement with the PKD Foundation, I gained the knowledge and support to help me better live my life with PKD with hope for the future.  I can also honestly say that our involvement with this organization and the contacts and information gained saved my father's life.  The PKD Foundation is our best chance for a cure, and already they have hoped get us very close to a treatment.  Education, Advocacy, Support, and Hope.  This is what the PKD Foundation has done for my family.  
PKD Foundation	42800	1	/users/profile/43530	hcambareri	Volunteer	5	06/03/2010	The PKD Foundation has been a resource for information for my family since the late 80s, when my father's kidneys started to fail due to PKD.  Since that time I've turned to the PKD Foundatin for information often, through my own diagnosis, pregnancies and kidney infections.  With a disease that can leave you feeling helpless, I've found empowerment through information and thanks to info I learned from the Foundation I'm now in a clinical trial and hopeful that I might be able to put off kidney failure.  I volunteered to coordinate our local Chapter in 2004 and have been impressed by all the staff at the PKD Foundation, how dedicated everyone is to the cause, and how frugal they are with expenses to ensure that every penny possible goes to programs for patients and RESEARCH!  I am thankful EVERY day for the PKD Foundation and the hope it gives to families like mine.

PKD Foundation	43074	1	/users/profile/43841	one80	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2010	I've been affected with PKD all of my life but it didn't really get hold of me until I got salmonella poisoning which excellerated it. I have also lost good enough vision to drive which leaves me to depend on others to get anywhere other than home. I've had 4 living donors willing but they were all eliminated because of health problems of their own. Sometimes I've felt so alone and forlorn but I could always reach out to this foundation for a friendly voice, comfort and encouragement. I want badly to help to bring awareness to this disease and help to raise funds for the foundation but have not been successful as yet. I will keep trying. There is a boy who is 24 that is in dialysis with me who has been sick since he was 6 years old. It's bad enough when you're older to get smacked with this awful disease but to see children stricken so young breaks my heart. I have 2 grown children and 5 grandchildren and I hope I did not pass the gene down but I do not know. I'm glad for the new laws coming into affect that will stop the insurance companies from punishing people for pre-existing conditions. Then they can get tested. I watched my father die from this in the 1960's. He was so brave right up to the end. And there wasn't much known about it then. I've had to put the pieces together now that I have it. It is an awful feeling to know that part of you is broken and cannot be fixed. A cure needs to be found. There are so many people willing to raise money for cancer and aids but PKD, not so much. I worked most of my adult life in the film industry and have some pr experience. I continue to try to get a celebrity or two to get interested and be a spokesperson but the PKD Foundation is doing all the work on their own and I love you guys for what you do. Thank you. Thank you for being there and for all of your hard work.
PKD Foundation	42773	2	/users/profile/43501	threepeasmom	Volunteer	5	06/03/2010	Four years ago I had two "healthy" boys and was pregnant with my third son. At 34 weeks I was told I did not have amniotic fluid and my son was delivered the next day. His lungs were very underdeveloped at birth and it was touch and go for a few days. When he was 4 weeks old he was diagnosed with ARPKD (the recessive and rarer form of PKD). A few weeks after the baby was diagnosed my then six year old was diagnosed with ARPKD as well.  We immediately began searching for information on ARPKD and found the PKD Foundation. Three months after we learned of our boys' diagnosis we went to our first PKD Convention. SInce then we have participated in 4 Walk for PKD events, gone to 4 PKD Conventions, and for the past 2 years I have been the co-coordinator of the National ARPKD chapter.  The PKD Foundation has helped me learn to advocate for my boys and has given me a lot of information on ARPKD. It has also connected me with the best doctors in the field. And to me the most important thing the Foundation has done is to connect me with other families with children with ARPKD.
PKD Foundation	42767	6	/users/profile/43495	mrsenglish	Donor	5	06/03/2010	When diagnosed with PKD years ago I turned to the Internet for information. For a disease that affects so many, informative sites were few. Those that offered information offered little hope. Though it was small at the time, the PKD Foundation has grown dramatically to become a well-respected organization offering hope, information and community to people affected by PKD. The organization funds cutting edge research, consolidates accurate information, organizes advocacy efforts, and provides a central location for community. Through the PKD Foundation generations of people living with this disease can find everything from kidney-friendly recipes to published medical studies paving the way to finding what will hopefully someday be a cure. Being able to connect with others who live with PKD and knowing that somewhere there is an organization working hard to research, monitor, and most importantly raise funding to find a cure makes living with PKD seem not-so-scary. I applaud this organization for putting a light at the end of a diagnosis that seemed like a very dark tunnel at the time.

PKD Foundation	42755	1	/users/profile/43481	karyn3	Board Member	5	06/03/2010	As a newly diagnosed PKD patient without family history nearly 11 years ago, the PKD Foundation became my source of information and support helping me cope with the uncertainty and fear I experienced at that time. Being involved with this organization has given me the opportunity to participate in education and advocacy programs, fund raising events, and connect with others battling this disease.  Additionally, I have had the opportunity to participate in cutting edge research studies sponsored by the PKD Foundation.  Everything we do takes us one step closer to being part of the PKD solution. Our organization is unique in that all Chapters are volunteer based and supported by one home office in Kansas City MO with only 53 employees. I applaud the PKD Foundation for being the only not for profit organization taking the initiative to positively impact the lives of more than 12.5 million PKD suffers worldwide.

There are many support group throughout the USA and abroad to help others understand this genetic disease.Fundrasing is another important part of this foundation. Money raised is given to doctors, colleges, universities and others to search for a cure.Also another point is the high rate of money that goes to research, and the low rate that goes to executives.Thanks PKD Foundation.

Teens of America USA	317176		/users/profile/408355	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	Great program with a real heart for youth. So many teens have found help for substance abuse, self harm, suicide, etc through Teens of America. They help change and even save lives. 
Teens of America USA	317097		/users/profile/408283	Spanky	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	I know for a fact Teens of America has helped keep countless teenagers from taking their life. Sean Mulroney is one of the most selfless people I have ever met. He has dedicated his life to helping parents understand teens, and teens to understand themselves. He is real with them and doesn't sugarcoat the issues. This organization is worthy of your support.

As a parent I want to know what my kids are up against, and Teens of America has given me the tools and resources to know how to combat the negative things that can harm my kids.Thank you!!!
Teens of America USA	279578	1	/users/profile/369581	Sally68	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2016	I was introduced to teens of America back around the year 2000. I watched an extremely powerful presentation in the school I worked at on the negative issues that teens face. It was very informative! I am convinced that Sean Mulroney and his team is committed to helping our young generation in empowering them with the tools they need to make good choices in their lives. Teens of America has a heart for both teens and parents alike. Whenever I come across a teen or parent that needs advice or help in areas such as drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, self destructive behaviors, and things of that nature I refer them to this organization. I highly recommend it for anyone that needs help or information on how to guide a troubled teen.
Teens of America USA	278393	1	/users/profile/368330	Scott137	Board Member	5	01/30/2016	I come from a policing background.  I worked the permanent overnight shift and, believe me, I have seen EVERYTHING.  I have always maintained the best policing statistics are no statistics at all.  Loss of life hurts us all.  But a life that IS STILL IN EXISTENCE...but still lost...is just as painful.  Everyone is trapped: teens are trapped in an addiction, self-harm or abusive situation and those trying unsuccessfully to render love and support are often pushed away...they, too, become trapped in an endless cycle often devoid of hope.Teens of America REACHES both those teens caught in self-destructive situations and suffering loved ones and friends as well.  It is a proactive outreaching resource that saves lives, enacted by truth-talking adults and teens who have "been there".  The platform is supported by an infrastructure of counseling professionals second to none.  Teens of America reaches troubles teens where they are geographically, emotionally, physically and spiritually.  I know of no other organization as adept at reaching, teaching and "keeping it REAL" with teens on this large a scale.  It works.  They save lives.  Nuff said.   - Scott Ragain, EG Radio Marketing

I have known the founder, Sean Mulroney, since I was 4 years old, and he has taught me so much and given me countless opportunities as a writer. Not only does it help create better lives for parents and teens, this organization helps shape better people, and a better future.  No one would ever regret giving time or support to this nonprofit and finding out just how many lives can be saved, including their own.

Teens growing up now have many roads they can go down and some of them are not so good. This organization has helped me realize that I need to fight for my kids because they are worth more than what this world instills in them. Teens of America gives parents and teens the tools to learn more about how to deal with the society we live in. Thank you Teens of America! I wish more people knew about this organization so they could be educated and help themselves.

Teens of America is a unique organization with a wonderful cause. It deserves all the help it can get! 
Teens of America USA	278031	2	/users/profile/367902	Writer	Client Served	5	01/26/2016	I represent an affiliate radio station of Teens Of America. We quickly picked up the show in 2014 after hearing how Sean relates to teens, parents and the battles they face. In my estimation, there is no other radio resource diving as deeply into the issues as Sean & his team do on a weekly basis. While always compelling and sometimes heartbreaking, Sean has way of lightening the mood with humor at just the right times. Couple that with his "beat the streets" hustle to bring the discussion to school auditoriums and it's easy to see that hope is not lost for struggling teens. My hope is to see others catch the vision and invest in today's youth through Teens Of America.
Camp Encourage	205452		/users/profile/267620	jaimelyon	Volunteer	5	07/08/2014	I've volunteered for Camp Encourage for 3 years now. It's a heart warming and life changing camp. I would highly recommend getting involved with this amazing program. 
Camp Encourage	163887		/users/profile/217684	Audrey F.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2013	This was my first time volunteering as a counselor for Camp Encourage. I can honestly say that it was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. Meeting and bonding with the campers, watching them having a blast just being normal kids, it was like nothing I've ever seen before. And the staff, all volunteers, their aim simply being to help the campers feel good about themselves and have fun. Absolutely incredible. Can't wait for next year!!!!

As a counselor I was able to watch the young boys I was with conquer their fears, make new friends, and be carefree for 4 glorious days. Camp Encourage is the one place these children can be them selves and not feel like an outsider. I will never forget my time at camp and I hope that this was just the first of many summers that I get to be a counselor.  
Camp Encourage	162595	2	/users/profile/215798	eboresow	Volunteer	5	07/13/2013	I have been a volunteer at Camp Encourage for several years.  What happens at this camp is truly incredible: youth on the autism spectrum have an opportunity to explore and celebrate themselves for who they are. For a group of youth that far too often only hears about their weaknesses or eccentricities, the welcoming and accepting camp atmosphere provide a safe environment for kids to be kids.  Preparations for this summer camp are in progress year round and include fundraising for camper scholarships, making and organizing supplies, and training volunteers in best practices for supporting their campers. I have never seen a more dedicated group of individuals and I highly recommend this organization!

The impact of this effort is reflected in the growth of the client base as well as the organization. We parents see our kids return from camp happy, with more confidence and improved social skills. Camp Encourage provides a valuable service to the region, and deserves strong support from the community.

I am simply blown away by the quality people who volunteer their time to run camp, the level of planning and attention to detail put in to EACH camper's stay, and the stories I hear from families with campers on the spectrum.  I selected "client served" because even though my sons are there to be models, they come away fulfilled as well.    It is a wonderful experience for our family.  
Camp Encourage	149937	1	/users/profile/199919	sandyhutdriver	Volunteer	5	02/24/2013	I have  been involved in Camp Encourage since it's founding year.  I  cannot speak highly enough of this organization. They provide children with Autism Spectrum Disorders a safe, fun and loving place where they can be themselves. They provide their parents with support, respite, and a place to send their children where they are loved and appreciated for who they are. A place where parents don't have to explain or apologize for their children's uniqueness. The kids have a great time at camp just being themselves. As an educator it has really opened my eyes about the strengths that children have when they are not pigeon-hold into setting that doesn't always meet their needs. It has changed the way I work with all children. This is a non-profit worth getting to know and definitely worth supporting.

During camp, she receives support in areas that are challenging for her by the area's leading experts that choose to volunteer their time and talents.  The positive impact of camp is life changing! The social skills and confidence built through her camp activities have continued to assist her at school and in the community with peers.  Campers, staff, volunteers and peers in our Camp Encourage family "do life" together, too.  Whether helping navigate challenges of daily life or sharing tears of joy for accomplishments that might have not been, the Camp Encourage experience reaches beyond those 4 days/3nights.

It takes time and patience and money and understanding to build something worth having. It's a fight and it is not an easy one . Lets see some of you naysayers act upon a vision or a task that God has appointed to you, in order to make a difference for The People. Don't be so quick to judge.

Sounds good right.  Then you join and they try every avenue possible to get money out of you.  Meanwhile,  they make promises that go unfulfilled, provide falsifying information,  and string you along until you've had enough and quit the program. They continue this process over and over, but what happens to all the money that people have and are continuing to invest.  They will never disclose that information.

It teaches young people how to start their own business. They also offered Life Skill classes that helps me understand more of life. Everything they said and/or did was everything that I expected. There were no surprises or anything. This is a group of loving and caring people who understand the youth and families in the Ivanhoe Neighborhood.

They aren't like any other group who helps out the less fortunate just to look good in the public's eye; they honestly care about each individual they assist. Front Porch is the type of organization that does the best job in their field and won't ask for recognition of their endevours. Front Porch has taught me lessons about the importance of giving back to my community, and these lessons will stay with me in my personality and the positive actions I take for the rest of my life.

I was facing a hugh challenge, because my assignment was to assist the Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council in reorganing their neighborhood.Project Neighborhood choose Ivanhoe because of the high crime, numerous drug houses, littered streets and illegal dumping sites and the small number of involved residents.Front Porch Alliance came to the rescue by assisting the neighborhood in all of their initiates to revive the neighborhood. Their first task was to fund and assist in organizing clean ups, because they recognized that the apperance of neighborhood was the first phase of revitalization.Front Porch Alliance has since vitally saved the lives of many residents and youth by providing numerous services and programs that were not available  for them before the Front Porch Alliance partner with the Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council

I have had the previlige of serving as a mentor in the Career Builder's Resource Center since its inception last year.  This group was established by the Front Porch Alliance to help men of all ages find meaningful employment.  The level of appreciation expressed by these men for the help they have received in learning basic job search skills has been outstanding.  We have helped them develop their skills in resume writing, locating job opportunities, applying for jobs, and interviewing.  In addition, a course in basic computer skills was recently taught by the mentors and five mentees "graduated".I urge the men of the community to participate as a mentor.

Haven of the Ozarks Animal Sanctuary	271136		/users/profile/359920	Jana9	Board Member	5	11/04/2015	I have been a volunteer and Board Member at Haven of the Ozarks for over 11 years.   It is run just like you would want an animal shelter to be run.  The overriding concern is the health and welfare of the current and former residents.  The Haven takes in any former resident when they no longer have a home.  Dogs have been returned 10 years after their adoption.  Microchipping for all these years insures that they know if their former residents end up in humane societies anywhere.  These dogs and cats are brought back to the Haven by staff or volunteers to find new homes.  Money is stretched as far as possible through ingenuity, do-it-yourself skills, bargain hunting and fantastic volunteer support.

She went missing in July  after being hit by a vehicle at a family members farm. We were heart broken and went to social media to help spread the word to find our girl. Haven of the Ozarks was SO kind when I contacted them by phone and shared Riley's picture and info on their site as well to help us get her home. Their support was very appreciated and I was so happy to call and tell them when we had our Riley back! They are very known in our community and I am often seeing signs for their mobile adoptions in both Republic and Springfield, which are a decent drive for them to travel to find forever homes for their animals. I have only seen loving, caring people involved and enjoy following them on Facebook. I wish them the best of luck in adopting out their fur babies!

The love and care given to the animals is beyond compare. Good people doing good deeds, they won my heart over immediately. There is no animal rescue or organization that deserves support more.Normally, I would volunteer my time and services, but I live quite a ways from them...As a full time student funds are tight, but I try to make a monthly donation.  Please, if you have it to spare, and even if you don't...help out. They are such a worthy cause.

Employees and volunteers are knowledgeable about each animal and very caring. They make every effort to get animals adopted through mobile adoptions in nearby cities, as the Haven is located in a more rural area. I adopted my 14 year old black Persian cat named Princess from them, and I can give this organization my highest recommendation for others looking to adopt a cat or dog.  Cindy JohnsonLawrence, KS

HepC Alliance	244272		/users/profile/331170	evanslk	Volunteer	5	06/01/2015	I, and 2 of my student nurses helped draw blood at a health fair sponsored by Hep C Alliance.   It was well organized and well attended.   In fact it was attended by more than expected I think and they handled it very well.  Great thing for the community and of course a good thing for my students.

HepC Alliance	244225		/users/profile/331115	bburkt	Client Served	5	06/01/2015	I was diagnosed with hepatitis c in 2012, during a hectic time in my life. I didn't know how I contracted the disease, what to do about it or how I was going to pay for it. Research told me that treatment would be upwards of 60,000 dollars. I put off further testing, then finally went to SLU to sign up for a drug trial. I was told that I had to be genotype tested, and that this was to be paid for out of pocket. The trial  coordinator gave me the number for the HepC Alliance. I called and Bruce called back immediately. He was very reassuring and they were able to cover over 60 percent of the cost. I had the test done and nervously waited. Several weeks later, Bruce called and asked if I had ever undergone treatment- I said no, and he told me that I was one of the rare lucky few who managed to clear it naturally. He told me congratulations and sent me a letter which explained everything in more detail. Since the genotype test was no longer neccessary, I also got a check back for the full amount of the second test. I will always be grateful to this kind man and to this organization for helping me through a very tough time. I cannot thank them enough.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	220572		/users/profile/284240	dcfromnyc	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2014	I spent a week at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage in March of 2013.  There was a great deal about the community that impressed me.  They faithfully adhere to their goal of a negative carbon footprint.  Each member's uniqueness is valued and accepted.  Nonviolent communication techniques are used to ensure that differences are settled equitably.  They cooperate in everything from cooking meals, to sharing transportation, to organizing community events.  They have a lot of fun in the process.  Their children are smart, healthy, beautiful and well-mannered.  As a visitor I didn't get to know everyone, but those I did meet were very upbeat, friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  Since visiting, I have been more aware of energy consumption and have significantly reduced by electricity consumption.  I hope to visit them again.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197724		/users/profile/258453	Daniel68	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/15/2014	Dancing Rabbit is a wonderful example of combining heads, hearts, and hands to create a sustainable community that is an inspiration and model for the whole world.  They really care about living in harmony with each other and the planet and really show how it can be done.  I have deep trust and faith in their experiments in living and believe they would make excellent use of any donations.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197506		/users/profile/258195	UncleKurt	Volunteer	5	04/12/2014	Dancing Rabbit members live comfortably and happily CONSUMING ONLY 10% OF THE RESOURCES of the average American. AND with their alternative energy production, they are pumping over twice as much electricity into the national grid as they use! This is only one example of the many experiments that are going on at Dancing Rabbit ... experiments to live more sustainably so that future generations can ... well, can live.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197473		/users/profile/258151	dmmonico	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2014	Dancing Rabbit is an ecovillage where all the members live sustainably, teach how to build homes using recycled materials with a variety of natural methods, use alternative energy sources, grow their food organically, and leave as small a footprint on the earth as we wish we all could. I haven't been able to visit their ecovillage yet, but I read their newsletter and am impressed by the cooperation of the community to help one another on their various projects, to welcome visitors and give tours, and offer the opportunity for work exchange to pass on their knowledge of sustainability to others. If more communities could follow their example, they would go far in reducing carbon emissions and benefiting our environment.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197465		/users/profile/258140	Janani	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2014	One of the things I love most about Dancing Rabbit, is simply that they exist. And that they exist is no simple feat at all. Wow! What this group of people have done together is truly amazing. To bring minds and hearts together to form such an incredible example of HOW we can live life differently, and in a way that is harmonious with what we as humans really want to be doing.  It shows us all that we can make the life that we want to live. It is truly possibly, and these guys are showing us how. Every week that I read your newsletters I feel re-inspired all over again to live my truly best life and to always put effort and energy into what I believe.  Thank you so much Dancing Rabbit! 
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197461		/users/profile/258137	aaron.michels	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2014	When moving back to the Midwest after a decade living in California and working in sustainability, I had a pretty dim view of sustainability efforts in the region until I visited Dancing Rabbit and the collection of communities in NE Missouri. The work they are doing here is on the cutting edge of community living, natural building,  and sustainable lifestyle practices. It's a particularly good spot to learn natural building (what to do, and what not-to-do). Dancing Rabbit is a veritable laboratory for natural building techniques and styles.
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197459		/users/profile/258135	Amanda127	Volunteer	5	04/11/2014	I lived at this residential ecovillage for 2+ years and enjoyed volunteering my time and energy on various committees.

Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	197456		/users/profile/258132	clarkemoyer	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2014	As a large scale example of sustainable living Dancing Rabbit succeeds in its outreach mission and has even signed us up for a full 3 week visit in May to expand on the online information. Great charity and in a great sector.  
Dancing Rabbit, Inc.	187648		/users/profile/244681	robbyboyer	Volunteer	5	11/03/2013	Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage defies the myth that 'truly' sustainable lifestyles will require either self-imposed suffering, a benevolent eco-dictator, and/or hyper-modern technologies. The community demonstrates that a peaceful, abundant sustainability is possible and that the major challenge of the twenty-first century is re-learning to live together.  They are true leaders in the ecovillage movement and one of several dozen enduring ecovillages in North America.  I interned in the community in the Spring of 2010 as a graduate student and my experience inspired my doctoral dissertation in Regional Planning. The community is filled with diverse and entrepreneurial individuals that have made the brave choice to live without the un-sustainable conveniences of modern cities and regions. I am amazed that a community (now approaching 75 members) can thrive in rural Missouri with four shared vehicles, electricity produced on-site, and building materials harvested locally.

Fortunately, when I was first having symptoms, our family Dr. "guessed" that it was MG & sent me to a neurologist.  I have never had a crisis so bad that I've ended up in the hospital (thank God), but my life (dong simple activities like eating and talking) is affected, in varying degrees. Since the beginning of my diagnosis, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to go to a MG support group meeting, even if no one has symptoms exactly like mine.

I had no knowlewdge of the MG, it's origin, effects, etc. I was told of a support group called the MGA and contacted them immediately. Thru their assistance I not only learned of the disease, but was also put in contact with the finest neurologists in my area that worked expressly with MG patients. This organizaetion is vital sourcce of information and assistence to MG patients and their care givers
Myasthenia Gravis Association of Kansas City	43192	6	/users/profile/43993	hal2001	Client Served	5	06/07/2010	I have had MG 16 years.  When one eye closed, I checked with several local doctors, who could not identify the problem then.  Mayo Clinic Neurologist quickly diagnosed the MG, with a simple Tensilon Test.  Then a friend recommended the Kansas City Myasthenia Gravis Association.  The local chapter provided a free clinic; provided a Neurologist that could diagnose and treat the symptoms.  They continue to support patients and family with clinics; monthly education meetings; and contacts with others who have MG.
Myasthenia Gravis Association of Kansas City	43109	9	/users/profile/43885	mh36099	Board Member	5	06/06/2010	My experience with the Myasthenia Gravis Assoc has been wonderful.  Since the disease was considered fairly rare when I was diagnosed just over 2 years ago, I had difficulty finding information.  I was referred to MGA and received information on treatment, medications,clinical research and other resources.  This was invaluable because I was also able to interact with other MGA patients and learn from their experiences.  So I became a Board member.
Myasthenia Gravis Association of Kansas City	43107	8	/users/profile/43883	laughingblueiris	Client Served	4	06/06/2010	I was diagnosed with MG at 40 years of age. I was scared because I had never heard of it and I think a neurologist is one doctor you don't really want to have to go see. I have 2 young children, I am young! The MGA Support Group calmed me down, helped me understand MG and I have always felt that they could help me through this. The newsletter is great, in the years that I have had MG, it has grown as the Association has. They seem to have attracted some very sharp individuals who have really increased the energy and reach of this organization. Bravo!

It has affected my speech,neck muscles and jaw primarily.  The doctor that diagnosed this told me they have no idea how you contract MG. I immediatel;y looked to see if there were any organizations that could help me with more information so I could understand my condition. I contacted the local chapet of MG here in Kansas City and I have never been more pleased with the response of "anything we can do to help you" along with all kinds of helpful literature as well.  The local chapteralso has regular meetings where you can not only learn more about MG but meet other people who have been afflicted with this disease.

Scientific Arts Foundation	8976	17	/users/profile/10761	LarryB	Volunteer	5	08/11/2009	As a hospice volunteer I have attended training sessions conducted by Amy Camie of the SAF, and I am aware of her work with our patients at the de Greeff Hospice House in St. Louis.  Amy's presentations on vibrational awareness and the positive effects this type of therapy can have via the mind-body connection (as suggested by research conducted by the SAF) challenge the tenets of conventional medicine and offer intriguing promise for the future treatment of disease.
Scientific Arts Foundation	8650	17	/users/profile/10392	sljost	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/04/2009	As an author and educator on the use of guided imagery in the medical world, Amy's music has been phenomenal in providing a supportive foundation for many. Because it is ONLY when a person feels strong enough on the inside that they can ever then find the strength to "rebuild" ... and actually "lift" themselves up to a newer and healthier place! What better gift can any musician give but a heart that is filled with the intention to heal?Thank you Amy, for all that you do to "gift" us just that!
Scientific Arts Foundation	8521	16	/users/profile/10256	livingstories@live.com	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/01/2009	I work within the breast cancer community in St. Louis and have had countless miraculously positive experiences with the Scientific Arts Foundation, specifically Amy Camie and her music.  I will TRY to condense these experiences to specific venues.  Most importantly, Amy have gifted me with CD's to put into the hands of patients struggling with the side-effects of breast cancer treatments.  The stories I have heard as a result of my clients' experiences with this music is beyond profound.  I have chills all over my body and tears in my eyes as I recall some of the stories...sleep achieved with the help of her music made many of my clients feel more able to move through the rest of life (motherhood, professional, wife, friend) more peacefully and feeling more 'like themselves'.  Amy has presented to all of the support groups/educational programs I have ever requested.  Everyone loves her and feels the spirit of her intention instantly.  I've witnessed miracles within these 'presentations' as well...tears and joy too.  Some women, feeling consumed by sadness or anger, felt relief as she played her music for them in person.  A day after one of Amy's presentations, a woman I knew for years struggled with grief and anger said she resisted coming to the Amy's talk because she only liked the 'clinical' presentations to keep up with research, etc.  She said with tears in her eyes, "I felt different after Amy played.  I took her CD and played it when I got home.  I cried tears that I hadn't allowed and slept more deeply than I have in years.  I plan on making her music a part of my every day, thank you."With years of stories like this one accummulated in my heart, it's difficult to put into words the "experience" I've had with Amy and the Scientific Arts Foundation.  I also want to note I appreciate the foundation's commitment to clinically document the effects of the music...I know that is what it will take to get it into the hands of more cancer patients and others who would benefit.  As a caregiver, I use Magic Mirror and the other CD's as a way of taking care of myself.
Scientific Arts Foundation	8403	15	/users/profile/10153	deborah	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/01/2009	As a researcher and individual who has come to value the work that the Scientific Arts Foundation is accomplishing on a person to person level that I am amazed that cancer is still around.  The director, Amy Camie is so dynamic and purpose driven that with such great energy behind the SAF efforts it seems that cancer does not stand a chance.. and when it comes to the dramatic research they are doing it seems that a cancer trouble spot  "chemo brain " can be lessened significantly.  My hat goes off to the effors of the SAF for their public educational seminars, low cost distribution of research music proven to reduce chemo related stress, personal intervention on a case my case basis and of course the time and talent of the director Amy Camie.

We are a hospice organization, and we have all of Amy's CD and use them all the time with our patients and families. Music has always been a source of comfort and enjoyment for most people, but Amy's harp music is theraputic and holistic...the body, mind and spirit in rhythm.She made a personal visit to one of our patients who stuffed all her emotions inside. While Amy played for her, the patient had an emotional release and wailed for quite some time. Amy just continued to play. She stopped playing when the patient stopped wailing and had drifted off into a deep sleep. The patient's response to the music was a life changing experience for one of our nurses present. It touched Amy too, and was an awesome example that what she is doing at the Scientific Arts Foundation is what she needs to continue doing in the art of music and healing.NamasteMary MagillFounder and Executive DirectorAlternative Hospice

The last time I saw my urulogist he said "13 years cancer free."  I attribute a lot of this to my change of lifestyle by using the music on the CD.  Since then I have given other CD's to friends and family who  had cancer and informed them of the research proving its effectiveness on cancer patients.  As the Scientific Arts foundation continues it's goals and objectives, I want to help spread the word to others facing cancer to use the CD to improve their quality of life.

Second Wind Lung Transplant	56082	1	/users/profile/58367	Grandma Jan	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2010	My husband received a double lung transplant 4 years ago at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.  We (I am his caregiver so it is WE) started the process with many trips from our home in Central Illinois to "qualify" for the transplant list.  The attention from Second Wind members made the pre-transplant time much easier and when the actual "gift" came we all celebrated together.  The Second Wind meetings help all realize that there is emotional, finacial and physical help if needed.   My husband has chronic rejection and returns frequently for Photopheresis treatments.  We meet with local members and anyone who is in town for medical updates for dinner and a long, warm social time.  I always feel like we have been with family.  Being a caregiver can be a very lonely time.  Second Wind closes that gap.
Second Wind Lung Transplant	55908		/users/profile/58164	timbelford	Client Served	5	10/29/2010	I received a double lung transplant in July of 2006.  I joined Second Wind of St. Louis right before surgery and have been a member since.  Not working due to my illness, I had to relocate to St. Louis to wait for the transplant.  This took a heavy toll on my family's budget draining most all of our savings.  I'm four years down the road from my surgery and I'm currently in chronic rejection of my lungs.  After surgery, everyone is on some very expensive medications to stay alive.  I also receive a treatment each month that helps reduce my rejection.  Second Wind of St. Louis helps me with gas money to travel to this treatment which is over 100 miles from my home.  They have been there for me since day one.  This one kind jesture by Second Wind has helped my family tremendously with our budget in these trying financial times.  Without them, I would not be able to take this important treatment.  I have a lot of great friends in the St. Louis chapter of Second Wind.  They have become part of my family, so to speak.  Their support, whatever that may be, is always there. 
Second Wind Lung Transplant	55871		/users/profile/58120	Kami F.	Volunteer	5	10/29/2010	Second Wind the name says a lot. But what some do not know is the way they go out of their way to ensure that each person has a safe and comfortable stay when they have dr appts which include overnight stays, sedations that come along with ct's and PET scans, not to mention starting new meds that require one to be close to the hospital. Some people do not understand that the cost itself to stay overnight in a hotel can become expensive, but for transplant families as well as for families with any illness that are in hospitals 3, 4, 5 or more times monthly. Second Wind helps to take the burdens off these families and gives them someone they can ask for help when the time arises. Thank You Second Wind!!
Second Wind Lung Transplant	55863		/users/profile/58111	cwefrank	Donor	5	10/29/2010	Secnd Wind Transplant is one of my favorite charities. It provides absolutely necessary material support for persons waiting for lung transplants.  The waiting period can be long and it is often necessary for transplant candidates to pick up stakes and move near the transplant center so as to be available when and if the call comes.  I know of people living in Winnebagos on the parking lot of the transplant center here..  Not surprisingly, these hopeful yet very ill people need support that is simply not available to them through conventional public support systems.  Second Wind receives applications for help, discerns and discusses work-around solutions and if necessary, provides cash.  It has no overhead.  All of its work is done by volunteers.  Every dollar I give Second Wind I know goes to people who are really in need and whose urgent needs would not otherwise be met.
Second Wind Lung Transplant	55814		/users/profile/58057	fentonac	Board Member	5	10/28/2010	Second Wind Lung Transplant Association helps pre and post-transplant patients who need financial assistance during the long transplant journey.  Last year Second Wind awarded $60,000. in assistance for pharmaceuticals, medical co-pays, lodging and transportation needs.  This is an all volunteer organization.

After providing a bit of information to the board of directors, I was given the assistance to pay for the piece of medical equipment was essential to a healthy recovery. Ever since that day, Ive been dedicated to Second Wind and its mission to help those dealing with lung transplants. Second Wind also provides open support meetings for those needing personal support, which I have utilized on several occasions. This organization has become so important to me, that I have recently become one the board members. Im so thankful for finding Second Wind and looking forward to a long future with the organization.  
Second Wind Lung Transplant	55518		/users/profile/57689	amc5875	Board Member	5	10/27/2010	St. Louis (STL) Second Wind is an entirely volunteer staffed organization.  Every dollar raised or donated goes directly to the support lung transplant patients.  The Second Wind Assistance Fund provides financial support to meet emergency needs for patientswho are pre and/or post transplant. Unlike many other organ transplants, those waiting for lungs must relocated to be near their transplant center - often for many months until a donor match is found.  Even after transplant, the patient must remain near the center to be monitored and for phyical rehabilitation.  All of this and maintaining their permanant homes often results in expenses that are beyond what can be met with their disabilty or family income.  That's where STL Second Wind comes in - help with utilities, medication costs, travel expenses - there is a myriad of ways the The Assisatance Fund can provide relief to qualified lung transplant patients with unexpected or emergency costs.While most of the Board and membership is comprised of transplant patients and their families, there a a large number of people, myself included, that have become involved with STL Second Wind just because of the great work this organization does.  And by being involved with STL Second Wind, I've been witness to miracle after miracle of new life through organ transplant.
Camp Barnabas	116889		/users/profile/159068	Sarah66	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	I have volunteered here twice both times took me on an amazing journey. The most recent one was a journey to find myself. While at Camp Barnabas you have to rely on God and you have to put absolute trust in him. You get so tired that you can't stand any longer and you have to just call out to God. I went wondering where I belonged in my faith. I came back knowing who I was made to be and knowing that God gave me trials because he knew that I needed some polishing. He wanted to give me mountains to climb and valleys to walk through and none of that I had to do alone. I had two campers and as a girl in a guy cabin it was tough it was long and tiring. And even though I was tired I spent one whole night writing letters to people in my cabin because I knew they needed some inspiration and motivation. I even wrote to staff and when I was too tired to work I stayed up all night praying and reading my bible I felt so renewed and so ready to take on what challenges I would be given. The best prayer that I prayed that week was "Lord, please give me mountains to climb". If you go to Camp Barnabas be ready to give with all your heart until you have no more and be ready to keep asking for more energy. Camp Barnabas was amazing and I encourage everyone to go because it is truly a life-changing experience.
Camp Barnabas	116742		/users/profile/158902	Funk F.	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	The camp is heaven on earth. This year I totally enjoyed getting to be with and share with several campers that I had seen in other years. Also got to meet some new campers. The highlight was after getting one camper to talk to us, we were so excited. An incident happened that made him mad and he internalized for about an 8 hour period. The team work of leadership along with cabin staff, he came out of his mood. He was an absolute joy to be with the remainder of the time. He caledl all of us by our names and that was just to most wonderful feeling. His family was a very loving and kind family as we got to visit with them on closing day. This camp is just one of the most amazing places.
Camp Barnabas	116727	1	/users/profile/158885	Robin40	Client Served	5	06/27/2012	Our son has been going to Camp Barnabas for 8 years now and I can not express enough grattitude for what they do.  For 1 week out of the year he is just a typical kid at camp having fun and enjoying life.  They provide a wonderful service to the campers and the parents, for many like us that is the only week we are away from our child and it lets my husband and I focuse on just us -  with no interruptions.    Camp Barnabas is truely a worthy nonprofit.  They provide an invaluable expirence for campers who are often on the fringes of society due to an illness or disability which is not of their choosing.  Also for the CIA (the campers buddy who is with them the whole week through the good and bad, such as....not sleeping much), it provides a chance to give of themselves in a way that is challenging and lets them grow personally like no other expirence.   These campers are kids who don't have friends, they are not asked to go places or to do activities such as a movie and when they go to camp and realize they are just like everyone else, that they are worthy and loved it opens their life to a whole new world.  As a parent I truely believe Camp Barnabas is the best experience my child has ever had and that you could not find a better nonprofite for your Children and Families award.        Thank you,  Robin Gunter.  
Camp Barnabas	116712		/users/profile/158861	Beth41	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	I have volunteered at Camp Barnabas for the last 6 summers, and am scheduled to return again this August.  The original goal of this camp was 'Kids being Kids' - to provide opportunity for children with special needs the exciting moments of camp life.  In the years I have attended, that goal has been met and exceeded.  An additional experience has grown out of that goal.  That is, ordinary people have continual interaction with special needs.  The volunteers are challenged by the lives of the campers in the way that campers live with physical limitations, but they live excitedly and joyfully.  Those campers press themselves into the lives of all around them.  I am not aware of any other place that offers that experience to individuals.  Camp Barnabas would be a worthy recipient of your recognition.
Camp Barnabas	35512	3	/users/profile/36333	kidzx6mom	Client Served	5	04/12/2010	My daughter with Down syndrome was tremendously changed by her first summer at Camp Barnabas -- her teachers the next fall asked me, "What happened to Sarah this summer?  She's so much more outgoing and independent!"  Camp Barnabas has been a part of our family ever since!  Two siblings have also attended and one of those is now going as a counselor.
Camp Barnabas	35446	5	/users/profile/36276	beth11	Client Served	5	04/11/2010	This camp is so much more than a 'summer camp' for kids with special needs.  My son with DS has been to camp & loves being able to spend time with 'kids like him.'  At this camp, the focus is on everything our kids CAN do, not their limitations.  It is empowering for the campers.
Camp Barnabas	35433	2	/users/profile/36264	sweet1	Client Served	5	04/11/2010	Our 12 year old son has Down Syndrome and has very limited speech as well as ADHD.  We have never been able to really relax on a vacation with him because he is so active.  Camp Barnabas was a genuine answer to prayer.  After touring the camp, we enrolled our son for the following summer.  We were worried that he might miss us or be too much for the camp staff to handle. However, as soon as he arrived at camp, he pushed us out the door and never looked back.  His "buddy" and all of the camp staff took care of our precious son and insured he had a great time.  He was sad to leave Camp Barnabas and asks about it all the time.  We had 6 days of  peaceful rest while Sam was at camp.  We knew he was safe, having fun and enjoying his "independence".  He is already enrolled for this summer and is looking forward to camp again.  My husband, daughter and I can truly relax guilt-free during our "vacation" knowing Sam is having such a fabulous time as well.  The camp was clean, well managed and staffed with incredible people.  They were prepared for every concern we had such as medical needs, safety, and general fun factor.  We loved Camp Barnabas and can't say enough wonderful things about the Teas and the outstanding camp that ministers to the child as well as their families.

Second Harvest Community Food Bank	93873		/users/profile/108271	Mike	Volunteer	5	07/14/2011	I have worked with the Backpack Buddies Program through the Second Harvest Community Food Bank the past 4 years.  Backpack Buddies provides elementary school children with nutritious food for the weekend every friday during the school year. The Second Harvest staff is exceptional to work with in this program.  They all are very concerned about the "needy" children that the Backpack Buddies program provides for.  The staff continues to strive to be able to provide more for the St. Joseph School District 750 students who receive the backpacks each friday.  They/we would like to provide for more students to participate in this program and the Second Harvest staff works diligently in trying to come up with ways to promote funding for this program.  Second Harvest does so many wonderful things for our community and i really am "touched" by their focus on our elementary students not going "hungry" over the weekends during the school year.We are so fortunate as a community and as a school district to have a local organization that strives to "reach out" to our community members that are in need.Finally, the great rapport that Second Harvest has with the businesses in our community is exceptional - the St. Joseph community comes together when there are people in need and Second Harvest plays a vital role in providing avenues for those who are "hungry".

Even now in my 20s I will visit with my friends and remember some of the fun times we had learning about peace. You're never too old to learn about peace!I can't wait to take my children there in the future, because they are such an incredible program with incredible staff and volunteers.

Through activities that encourage understanding among cultures and our world, children learn how to recognize the needs of others and promote peaceful relationships that embrace the diversity and uniqueness of creation. Designed for preschool and elementary children, it provides ideas not only for learning, but for the challenges of daily life; lessons that instill caring which can last a lifetime. 
Peacepathways	316489		/users/profile/407736	rocks1949	Board Member	5	10/29/2016	Eyes pop open and excitement builds as children enter a world of exploration and learning. An artificial tree standing 8 feet tall greets them as they scan the opportunities in this space. Games and interactive experiences that teach skills in Peace for Me, Peace for Us, Peace for Everyone, and Peace for the Planet lead them into a deeper understanding of the world in which they live. Stop! Think! Peace! puppets emphasize a practical way to face and solve conflict. I have seen new understanding on the faces of so many children as I have volunteered as a docent. What a critical  and essential  resource for our community.
Peacepathways	316467		/users/profile/407717	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2016	The Peace Pavilion is a unique interactive childrens museum designed to teach the concepts of peace through creative, fun, child-centered learning activities. Every element in the museum is designed to empower children to incorporate peacemaking skills into their everyday lives. Our current outreach is primarily to elementary age students. But in addition to this, we plan to have programs, activities and exhibits that we can offer to middle school and high school age students as well as adults.
Peacepathways	316244		/users/profile/407507	Writer	Client Served	5	10/28/2016	The staff at the Peace Pavilion is so kind and patient. The exhibits and lessons make the very abstract concept of peace more concrete. We will definitely use the lessons we learned at the Peace Pavilion in our classroom.  We will absolutely return for another visit. I am so thankful they are sharing this wonderful resource with our community. They are helping prepare future peacemakers. We love the Peace Pavilion.

They help bring peace into the lives of children in their homes, schools, and communities.  I love seeing the children's eyes light up when they realize they can make a difference in the world.

St Louis Senior Dog Project	102221		/users/profile/62641	dianne	Volunteer	5	12/12/2011	This group has many caring volunteers.  Some foster dogs, some fund raise, and some help at events.  The volunteers are wonderful, hard-working people.  St Louis Senior Dog project saves the lives of hundred of dogs each year.  They help small dogs, large dogs, older dogs and young dog.  They find home for strays, abused dogs, puppy mill survivors and any dog who has needs.  They can use your help as a volunteer, an adoptor, or with a donation.    
St Louis Senior Dog Project	58652		/users/profile/62641	dianne	Volunteer	5	12/09/2010	I am new to this group since March 2010.  It has been a pleasure to meet the individual volunteers who do so much for all the dogs for whom we find homes.  Great love for all dogs energizes the group to find the best home for each dog.  Our fund raising committee works many hours to raise money to pay for medical needs for our dogs which often the adoption fee is not enough to cover the dentals, shots, microchips, spay/neuter, and any other medical care needed.  I am proud to be a foster parent for this group.
St Louis Senior Dog Project	60131		/users/profile/65278	Pamela K.	Volunteer	5	01/14/2011	I adopted a dog from St. Louis Senior Dog Project in 2006.  He was a difficult foster but they stuck with him for almost a year and waited for his forever home (mine!). I will be eternally grateful to them for that.  I have been a volunteer since Fall 2009.  I love that we are able to give dogs that would otherwise be put to sleep a second chance.    As a newer volunteer, there are plenty of experienced people within the group who I can reach out to for advice.  I had the unfortunate experience of having a foster dog escape from a yard.  A lot of the group volunteers  helped search for the dog for almost a month.  Their physical and emotional assistance helped my sanity. One of the great things about this group is that as a foster parent, you can choose the dog you want to foster so it fits best with your household.

St Louis Senior Dog Project	59753		/users/profile/64727	Brandi L.	Volunteer	5	01/10/2011	The St. Louis Senior Dog Project is a non-profit dog (&, occasionally, cat) rescue organization that specializes in older dogs, but takes in and finds homes for dogs of all ages. They understand that, no matter the pet's age, every animal deserves to find happiness within a forever home.  I fostered several dogs through the St. Louis Senior Dog Project over the course of a year & a half. The volunteers were always professional, caring, & respectful to both the animals & potential adoptive owners. They understand the the needs of the animals, & they work hard to ensure that the dogs & cats are placed with the best-suited human. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this organization. I only stopped fostering because I fell in love with one of my fosters, & I knew that she was more than just a foster: she was destined to be part of my family!  The St. Louis Senior Dog Project is a fantastic animal rescue, & I continue to recommend them to anyone looking for a forever friend!

St Louis Language Immersion Schools Inc	187634		/users/profile/244668	lmdorner	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/03/2013	I moved from Chicago to St. Louis in 2007, with a 3 year old and a baby. My son had attended a Spanish immersion preschool, and I thought I'd never find similar options in St. Louis. I was lucky enough to soon meet Rhonda Broussard, Executive Director/Founder of SLLIS, and hear about her dream to open elementary language schools here. Only 2 years later the dream was a reality. My two children now attend the Spanish School. They have not only had the chance to develop fluency in another language, but work alongside students who come from many different linguistic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds: something we as a family treasure. As a professor of education, I have been impressed with the schools' drive for continual improvement, creativity, and dedication to inquiry-based learning. They are moving against a strong tide of accountability, testing, (and more testing), and their moves are impressive. 
St Louis Language Immersion Schools Inc	182967		/users/profile/239859	Sugako Anderson	Client Served	4	10/28/2013	My husband and I made the decision to choose SLLIS over the AAA, blue ribbon awarded school system up the street from our house.  This was a risky decision to make, and every day that my child smiles going to school provides us the reward for making the best decision for our child. Visiting and sitting in at the Chinese School, I was impressed that our English speaking children were communicating in Chinese. They were all very eager to learn and were proud of their ability to speak a second language.  I am thankful for the Title 1 teacher, who continues to test the children for their English learning. This support allows us to focus the needed English learning at home. The support in both their English and Chinese learnings will provide the foundation for an incredible future.  The vision of the founder, Rhonda Broussard, is grand. I am really exicted to see my child flourish and to be a part of this vision.
St Louis Language Immersion Schools Inc	177508		/users/profile/234069	mphillips2	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	We chose SLLIS for our son's education for two reasons.  First, we wanted him to be fully bilingual - not just able to understand his French father, but entirely fluent and academically literate in his second language.  Additionally, we want him to have the wider range of university options - in the US and abroad - that become possible with an international baccalaureat diploma.We feel lucky that such an exceptional school is available to us tuition-free in an otherwise struggling district.  Beyond our family, we are also extrermely proud that this resource exists and is growing global citizens in St. Louis, Missouri.
St Louis Language Immersion Schools Inc	176181		/users/profile/232575	Apellas	General Member of the Public	4	10/09/2013	 I grew up with a Spanish mother and siblings. Being the youngest I was not taught Spanish nor was it spoken in the house as my sibling got older and my mother was living and working in an American world.  I tried to learn Spanish but no matter what I did it just would not take.  I went to very expensive schools with "good" teachers and curriculum.Nothing worked.  All through my life I wondered what it would be like to be able to speak my families first language. As a parent I realized that sending my kids to that same environment and schooling they may miss that same opportunity.  I found the Saint Louis Language Immersion School by chance.  And ever since it has been both an exciting experience and a scary one.  You wonder can they really learn and be thoughtful and educated people when learning a language that is not the primary language spoken at home. That question has been answered. My children are all the above and they are learning to be world citizens. Meeting people of all backgrounds, races and religions.This school had changed the projectors for our children to be be ones who look at differences as a positive and challenges as an opportunities. We need more schools like this and more funding.  When I see my mother and son to speaking in Spanish, I swell up with pride and a bit of regret that I didn't have this opportunity.
St Louis Language Immersion Schools Inc	176131		/users/profile/232519	MeganBittle	Client Served	5	10/09/2013	My husband and I chose to send our daughters to St. Louis Language Immersion School's Spanish school 3 years ago.  Even though we have excellent public schools in our area, we believed that the benefits our children would receive from a bilingual learning experience was well worth the disadvantages of leaving our neighborhood schools.  We are thrilled with the progress our girls have made and the community of SLLIS that has become our home. Just last night, during dinner, my oldest daughter, Clara, said "Kate and I are going to speak only in Spanish and you and dad need to see if you can understand us. It's okay if you need to speak English, Mom."  They spent the entire dinner telling us about their day, asking questions, sharing jokes - all in Spanish! Clara is 9 and Kate is 7.   We hope that being truly bilingual will make them more adventurous, global citizens.  I can't wait to see what they become and where they go in life.  I have SLLIS, Rhonda, and the entire staff to thank for this wonderful gift they have given my family.- Megan Bittle  SLLIS Spanish School Parent

Missouri Wildlife Rescue Center	96660		/users/profile/112869	snakeandphoenix	Volunteer	5	08/26/2011	This organization is awesome!  Before I started volunteering here I had a different view of nature and squirrels especially.  Now that I have helped raise baby squirrels I have a greater understanding and appreciation for them.  There is nothing like holding a baby animal in your hands and feeding it.
Missouri Wildlife Rescue Center	96635		/users/profile/112836	smargraff0824	Volunteer	5	08/26/2011	This organization does so much for the wildlife of the surrounding area.  In caring for the animals of St. Louis and the surrounding areas, they are connecting us back to the nature that coexists with us every day.  We often forget about our nature neighbors, but it is comforting to know that Wildlife Rescue Center does not forget them.I found a baby bunny once that had been injured at Webster University campus and Wildlife Rescue Center was the only organization I could find who cared to help the poor animal.  They did everything they could, but the animal was already in shock and passed away.  Still, the volunteers and staff care so much about the animals, they actually gave me a call later to tell me what had happened to the bunny.
Missouri Wildlife Rescue Center	96515		/users/profile/112666	Tessa H.	Volunteer	5	08/24/2011	My first encounter with the Wildlife Rescue Center was making a phone call to them asking about a rather friendly raccoon. They took the time to explain to me why the raccoon was acting in such a way. I hung up feeling more educated about an animal that humans encounter regularly and felt inspired to spread the word! My second experience with them was when I took in a bag of dog food to see if they could use it. I was greeted by the person at the front desk with a warm smile of appreciation.  I had been thinking about volunteering somewhere and so WRC spoke to my heart. My brief positive experiences with The Wildlife Rescue Center did not prepare me for the amazing experience I would have as a volunteer.  Every single person I have been in contact with thus far has been friendly, warm, caring, helpful, and committed! I cannot believe how hard these people work for the sake of our wildlife OR how many have dedicted a number of years to their committment. The Animal Care Staff is unbelieveable!!!! They are incredibly serious and unbelievably good at what they do, but still find time to listen to you, help you, and laugh with you.  What the Education Department does in teaching children the importance of our wildlife is wonderful! They are very knowledgeable and dedicated to this effort. Constantly researching and looking to create the ultimate experience for the youngest members of our society. The Administration Department, the Volunteer Coordinator...I cannot stress enough the words dedication, committment, caring, organization, knowledge, friendliness..the positive words could keep flowing! EVERYONE has made me feel as if I am needed and important and making a difference no matter what! I have learned so much that I continue to share with others in my life. There are so many animals, that because we share their world, end up injured, sick, or orphaned. Because there are a great many individuals among us that care very deeply about and realize how important wildlife is to our environment, I get a great number of phone calls with questions and concerns. I get many visitors bringing in wildlife! And I only volunteer one evening a week! I am so grateful for WRC!

Since starting work two years ago, I have been wonderfully impressed with the level of professionalism that the center brings to the field of animal welfare.  Particularly in the field of wildlife rehabilitation, the Wildlife Rescue Center excels in their attention to detail and community support.  Our wildlife rescue hotline provides a valuable resource for people of the world to call and ask about wildlife related issues.  We help individuals make humane decisions, even when things seem out of control as in the case where a squirrel might be running around an attic with her babies!  By giving the public the tools they need to make humane decisions, we support animal welfare in an exponential manner.  I am proud to be a staff member of this incredible organization and family.

I can say I honestly hated it and guarantee your girls did to, to the point where theyll lie about it! You sent your girls here for a reason such as LIEING so why believe them now. I wont say I think everything there was right but I dont think lieing will fix anything. Brother house NEVER spat in girls faces or deprived them of eating. If a girl didnt eat it was because she refused to eat what was given! We had school like trays and they were always full! No girl was ever shoved in there own vomit. Ive seen girls there throw up even on purpose they were just requested to clean it up. If a girl did push-ups in horse manure it was there fault for not moving. But no one ever made them. A lot of crap is said. So really dont say stuff unless you really no.

Gateway to Peace Museum Inc	241406		/users/profile/327944	pdmanning	Volunteer	5	04/20/2015	The Gateway to Peace Museum visited McKendree University on March 24, 2015!  It was exciting, fun, educational and so beneficial for all.  The McKendree students, staff and Lebanon elementary students traveled through approximately 30 stations experiencing peace activities for themselves, others, and the planet.  PEACE is PRICELESS for our society, in times like these.  The students learned peaceful resolutions, how to understand their feelings, and how to be empathetic to others.   The Peace Museum members were professional, nice and team players at all times.  It truly was an enjoyable and very educational experience for ALL!

I am a counselor at Keeven Elementary School in Hazelwood School District.  Keeven Elementary students have been enjoying Peace Museum activites for many years.  First only a few representatives from Keeven attended Peace Days at the Science Center; however, for the last four years, all Keeven students have the opportunity to actively participate in activities right at Keeven school during our annual Peace Day.  Students learn how to be peaceful with each other, how to understand and respect our difference, how to be peaceful in our communities, how to take care of the environment and how to promote peace in the world.  Keeven students and staff are very grateful to have the option of this experience!

This summer was our first experience hosting the Peace Museum and it was a huge success!!  The students LOVED all of the activities and, four months later, students are still talking about it and asking when we'll have it back again!  Julia Paul is wonderful to work with, very flexible and accomodating to our school's unique needs. We have initiated an anti-bullying campaign and a Peacemakers group in the school and the Peace Museum was a wondeful compliment to and inspiration for these programs.  In an agency and in a school where special programs and projects are incredibly scarce due to lack of funding, the fact that the Peace Museum was offered to us at all and FREE OF CHARGE was an incredible gift to us.  We look forward to hosting this program again this year (fingers crossed!) and are continually spreading the word about what a great opportunity Gateway To Peace Museum is for our children and our community!!

Marineparents Com Inc	192462		/users/profile/251293	mattm59	General Member of the Public	4	01/12/2014	Like most of the others, my son is a Marine, and like several others, this came about by total surprise. My son gave up a free college education, headed cross country without any notice, and enlisted on the west coast. I found this site in a state of bewilderment, and got some great support from a few of the fellow parents here. Things have become much more stabile since my son graduated boot camp, but this site is a great source of support for those with "new to the marines" children. The young marines I met are a great group of men, and I'm quite proud of my son and his comrades. It's nice to support this branch specifically, and though I donate to the USO as well, it's nice to know my support to MFN goes directly to the best branch of our military OoooooRAH! I especially like the gift packs, as you see exactly what your $22.50 is buying for a deserving Marine. No CEO with his hand out taking the lions share.I'd give 5 stars for a rating, but find the message boards a bit hard to follow at times.
Marineparents Com Inc	171464		/users/profile/227046	Michelle168	Client Served	5	09/24/2013	My son (at 17) decided to be a Marine.  I knew NOTHING of the process or anything about the military since the only veterans in my family have passed on; I found MarineParents by accident looking for information.  They have been a wonderful support tool for me and my family.  I also will only purchase my Marine products through this organization because I KNOW that the money is going back to Marines like my son.  I love this company. 
Marineparents Com Inc	171415		/users/profile/226961	mgoose	Client Served	5	09/23/2013	MarineParents was an amazing support organization while my son was at Parris Island for recruit basic training.  They provided details of what my son was experiencing on a day-to-day basis --- because as a new "military parent" I was not sure at all what to expect. The camaraderie of bringing together the parents of those sons & daughters who have devoted themselves to our country is priceless.   Most importantly, I am confident that I can rely on MarineParents when the training is done and the activity begins.

I'm a Marine mom, with his son preparing for his second deployment.  I donate throughout the year whenever I can, and have designated MarineParents.com as my payroll deduction in my company's annual Giving campaign. This non-profit was started by a Marine mom more than 8 years ago, when her son started his Marine journey, and she discovered it was almost impossible to find a place where Marine parents could get honest, reliable information and support.  Over the years, she and her team have built this organization into an international source for all family members, with a deep on-line library for every phase in the Marine life.  In addition, when it became apparent that there was a need for a service that didn't exist they filled:  care packages to thousands of deployed Marines every year, coordination of letters of support to wounded warriors by request, services for all members of a Purple Heart family -- home cooked meals for the wounded warriors, information and organizational support for the family members trying to track all the medical information, personal support for the members and their families, including simple things like moving help, babysitting, clothes adapted to fit over prosthetics.  They also have a private and very rich support environment for Gold Star families -- those who have lost a Marine in war. Besides all that, they host the richest on-site community of Marine families that I've ever seen.  A place where you are not alone in the middle of the night when you can't sleep because your son is deployed. It's a wonderful place.

Further, while we were at the hospital, Marine Parents had a wonderful meal for the families of the injured as well as some of the injured themselves who were able to attend the dinners.  Marine Parents is ALL about our injured, of all brances of service.

As a person entirely unfamiliar with being  the parent of a Marine meant, I found information and support on the RecruitParents Message Board.  After my son graduated from bootcamp, MarineParents was still there to provide answers about post-bootcamp training, PDS assignments and deployments.  I also discovered their Outreach Programs that include programs such as Purple Heart Family Support, The Care Package Project, Operation PAL, Operation Freedom Ballot, Gold Star Family Support, Combat Recovery, etc.  All of these programs offer even more support to Marines and their families who are at all different stages in their journey with the USMC.  I'm not sure how I would have handled being a Marine Mom without the help, support, advice, caring and concern of MarineParents.com and its members and programs.  I am extremely honored to be a member of the Board of Directors and hope to be able to help continue and expand the services offered to Marines as well as their families and communities.

I have enjoyed and still enjoy working for this program immensely. I have known Marsha McCleod, the Executive Director over 20 years and knew early on that she had a strong interest and passion for teaching. Also, a lot of energy and tenacity to pursue a career in Early Childhood Education and Elementary Education. As a retired, Registered Nurse who has past experiences in tutoring all ages, I too am concerned for the future education of young people. Marsha is a confident and encouraging person who equips students and those who work for her emotionally, socially, financially, etc. In addition, ICYT makes sure its tutors are supplied more than adequately with all they need to carry out various educational tasks students need during weekly tutoring. For this I am greatly! These students need our concern and willingness NOW to share our time and education to become productive citizens in the future. There is a lot of satisfaction in working with this organization.

It was a good example and a great experience for me because I didn't realize that people still love and care for each other. The weekly tutoring helped me a lot because before this I was failing all my classes very badly, but when I started my tutoring this year I began passing all my classes. I am proud of myself for the first time about my school performance, because my grades are a lot better than they ever have been. I have been maintaining more A's, B's, and C's instead of D's and F's, and I am thankful and grateful, especially because my tutors, Mrs. Eleanor and Ms. Marsha were hard on me and now I see why. I am also happy because I had been chosen to give the speech at my 8th grade graduation on May 22, 2015, because I had the highest grade point average, and I was the most improved student in my class.

I appreciate all Inner City Youth Tutoring has done for us and my son's weekly tutoring. His tutors, Ms. McCleod and Ms. Schmitt are awesome and the fact that he actually looked forward to his weekly tutoring sessions was something to see.  Inner City Youth's program is an excellent program that is dedicated to their students and has exceeded all my expectations for my son. The work, time, and energy their tutors put in showed during his weekly tutoring sessions, his daily and weekly school work, and his 6 and 12 week progress reports.

Partners In Sustainable Development International	319513		/users/profile/411034	RJScanlon	Donor	5	11/27/2016	I have been supporting PSDI (and it's predecessor IIRD) for more than 15 years.  I am a former student of Bill Christensen, it's founder, going back to the '60s, and have since become a lifelong friend and supporter of Bill's efforts to work with the poorest of the poor in Bangladesh.  His model is impressive in its comprehensiveness and the integration among the many elements that are aimed at addressing the most basic needs of its target families first and then move them slowly but surely along a path to self-sufficiency.  Where it is applied over time, the poverty rates of the "extremely poor" have been reduced by more than 75%.  I visited Bill and his team in Bangladesh in February 2016.  It was very gratifying to meet his very dedicated team and visit with many families who have benefited and "graduated" to a position of independence through this approach.  It is a model that should be replicated wherever the poor are found.

The Guadalupe Center was the center of my life on the West Side.  Mi Mamagrande la Dona Cruz Garcia, had the confidence of Dorothy Gallagher, to the point that Dorothy wanted to adopt my Tio Nino, the former Frank Garcia, who is the Father of Chachi!  I owe much of my identity as a Chicano to the Guadalupe Center which in the 50's, helped my build a sense of responsibility while helping build the Fiesta stage and afterwards attend Boys Scout meetings in the old basement room that opened out into a play-ground back before the remodeling.  It was at the Guadalupe Center where I learned to play the piano, taking lessons from Miss McGuire. It was there when last year I found my old friend Salvador "Chava" Gomez, who asked me where I had been the last 50 years!!!!  So YES, I have good things to say about Guadalupe Center and all the people who work there.   Jose Francisco "Chato" Rios de Garcia......

I started as a fan of StoneLion and after seeing several shows and hosting performances as a librarian I just knew that I wanted to do more to work with them.  The Artistic Director and puppeteers are a very talented, artistic and dramatic bunch.  The puppets they create are accurate, educational, beautiful and most of all fun!  As an audience member I have gotten to witness spectacles that I never would have dreamed of including giant puppet pageants with huge puppet trees, pirates and even floating puppet turtles.  As a Board Member I have gotten to witness a worthwhile not-for-prophet arts organization grow and flourish and become a part of the community in a long lasting and deeply impacting way.  Creating amazing puppet shows is just one of the many things StoneLion is doing.  Using grant funds StoneLion is responsible for planning and executing many Green Festivals in Kansas Citys urban areas.  They work with the Parks and Recreation Department to provide puppets shows, arts and crafts, community information and fun to families that might not have the opportunity to be touched by the arts if it wasnt free.  StoneLion Puppet Theater is also deeply committed to educating people about working to save our environment.  Using grant funds they were able to provide 50 free puppet shows about clean water to Kansas schools.  I am proud to be a fan, volunteer and Board Member of this amazing organization. I am already looking forward to seeing their next show!

Responder Rescue	266187		/users/profile/354956	Christine157	Client Served	5	10/21/2015	Responser Rescue came to the rescue of my family.  My husband is a retired firefighter with Stage IV colon cancer related to his fire service.  When our resources ran out they were there to help.  This organization is there to support first responders when they are at their most vulnerable.  Because of Responder Rescue we were able to get back on our feet and start to move forward.  They gave us hope when we felt there wasn't much left.  As far as I am concerned Responder Rescue is deserving of all our support! Christine Schall

If a first responder is no longer able to work due to illness, injury or other traumatic experience , and has used all other resources, Responder Rescue can help them.   I started volunteering with the charity just over a year ago, and can tell you the charity truly cares and wants to help this first responders. The charity puts on many fundraising events throughout the year to help raise money.  Grants are also going to be submitted to help meet the needs.

Responder Rescue	89222		/users/profile/101153	dale	Volunteer	5	05/25/2011	Responder Rescue is a 501 C (3) not for profit organization that supports police, fire and other first responders who are injured while performing their assigned duties in the Greater St. Louis area.  When a first responder is injured in the line of duty, their public agency insurance covers most of their medical expense, but all too often there are copays and other expenses that drain savings.  Responder Rescue supports these first responder financially by paying monthly bills and assisting with some of the medical expenses.  The organization's staff are all volunteers from the public and private sector.  Each volunteer averages over 75 hours a year in supporting fundraiser to help meet the demands for assist by these injured public service personnel.  In the organizations first year, it gave out over $40,000 in support and the second year already has more than $60,000 in requests for assistance. If you would like more information about this worthwhile organization, please contact Dale Bailey at (314) 694-2368.

Harvesters Community Food Network	151838	2	/users/profile/202743	NanGreg85	Donor	5	03/29/2013	Response to Ray_7 as to whether $170,000 CEO salary is "fair".  Please read Charity Navigator's 2012 CEO Compensation Study.  CN classifies Harvesters as a "large" charity; ie, expenses in excess of $13.5 million.  Harvesters' profile: 2011 expenses $73 million & CEO's salary 0.23% of expenses.  CN's Compensation Study indicates that, for large charities in the Midwest the median salary was $233,672 and based on size category: 2010 median was $245,671.  For charities with expenses in the range of $50-$100 million, the median was $297,454.  So, I think Karen Haren's salary of $170,000 is definitely fair. 
Harvesters Community Food Network	151194		/users/profile/201775	Ray_7	Volunteer	2	03/17/2013	Read that the CEO makes more than $170,000 per year.  Is that fair?

Harvesters Community Food Network	68142		/users/profile/74452	catwrangler1	Volunteer	3	02/14/2011	Our group of mostly older adults volunteered one afternoon.  We lifted frozen meat ranging from lunch meat up to roasts and turkeys from large deep boxes into 30-lb. boxes, which we then carried to a table to be weighed.  This was rather strenuous work requiring repeated bending, and involved comparatively heavy lifting considering the average age of the volunteers.
Harvesters Community Food Network	58265		/users/profile/61932	meichan1029	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	His name is Harvey and he's our Mascot. He's the newest, freshest Turkey around (having replaced "Classic Harvey" from previous years). He also has this uncanny ability to make kids and adults alike break into smile.Harvey the Harvesters Turkey made his appearance at the Liberty Price Chopper days before Thanksgiving. A constant flow of people in and out of the store passed us by in a rush to buy their last minute goods. A near immediate transformation took place when Harvey made his first appearance, though. A congenial Star 102 employee offered to parade around in a lovely (warm!) turkey suit to draw attention to our food drive and boy, did it ever!I was touched by the faces of children, eyes lit up and broad smiles glowing as they watched him strutting his stuff. Even the parents couldn't help but smile! Little ones would rush up for a high-five and laugh excitedly, even commenting on how Harvey's fur tickled their hands. One little girl threw a fit when Mom picked her up to get in the car - she did not want to leave Harvey's presence! There was the occasional outcry when a particularly young child would scream and drag Mom the other way but this reaction was by far the exception. Their parents smiled, enjoying the laughter a simple costume brought to their children. They were more open to listening to us explain the needs of the hungry and quite often left the store with goods in hand for us. Some lucky children even gave the cans directly to Harvey! (sort of...feathers aren't ideal for holding cans) By far, the most startling transformation were the adults without children. Before his appearance, they would walk by briskly and avoided eye contact at all costs. Yet when Harvey started wiggling his tail to old Christmas tunes, they would watch with a bemused smile and a slight twinkle in their eyes. Their guards dropped and they listened, often asking about specific needs in the community. Who knew what an impact a turkey costume could make?
Bollinger County Museum of Natural History	185613		/users/profile/116728	eva238	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	This museum is a jewel for the whole region.  It has the Missouri Dinosaur fossils and the life-sized version and lots of other dinosaur and fossil artifacts.  The kid's room allows young ones to learn science in a fun way.  For people history visitors, we have Civil War displays, Lewis and Clark, Native American and lots of regional history too!  It makes a great day trip!
Bollinger County Museum of Natural History	184640		/users/profile/241577	loverocks	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I've worked with the Museum project since it was just an idea in 1998.  It was born out of a community effort to find a new purpose for the Art and Science Building that was built for Will Mayfield College around 1926.  Several members of my father's family and two very good friends in Marble Hill attended the college before it closed in 1934 due to financial setbacks brought about by the Great Depression.  I grew up around people who had a deep affection for the old school so it was not difficult to interest me in a project that would bring this beautiful old building back to life and give it another chance to make a positive impact on people's lives.  Having been involved since the first steps toward restoration, our growth sometimes seems slow; but when I walk through the Museum and see these classrooms and halls filled with the exceptional paleontology, natural history and American history exhibits that Guy Darrough and his crews have created, the childrens' activity room and the local and Will Mayfield College history that our local volunteers have built, I am impressed.
Bollinger County Museum of Natural History	184401		/users/profile/241341	AnnO	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	It's amazing that a museum of such high quality exists in such a tiny, rural community. The exhibits are world-class, housed in a historic building that sat vacant for years. A small, committed group has worked tirelessly, first rehabbing the building and then procuring and curating exhibits of all kinds: fossils from all over the world, artifacts from the Civil War, replicas of ice-age megabeasts, and of course, a life-size replica of the hadrosaur discovered just miles from the site of the museum. They dedicate a room to kid's activities, put on several programs for children throughout the year,  and make learning fun.I know they have dreams & aspirations for the 3rd floor of the building, but financial constraints are real.

The volunteer effort has been amazing and they have accomplished a whole lot.  I love that our little community has the only Missouri dinosaur.  I grew up in Chicago, able to visit daily the Museum of Science and Industry or weekly go see the Art Institute, the Field Museum of Natural History or the Aquarium.  That made me the person I am today.  So, I'm very grateful that local youth have the opportunity to spend time at our local museum.  The great exhibits there and the experiences expand their horizons in ways that are only beginning to be explored on the Internet...the only option for thousands of other youth not so lucky as to live near their own museum.  Bravo BCMNH!!! and a big THANK YOU to all the volunteers whose hard work that has made the museum the gem it is today.

Getting nothing more than passion pay for their dedication, they are operate  the organization lean and have strong volunteer support. The greatest strength of HALO is that they are small enough to easily react to challenges and strong enough to overcome them. What they don't have is a lot of corporate and foundation support and very few major donors ($250 and above). At least 60% of Individual contributions are in the range of $5/month to $100/year.  I am a volunteer, a donor and a huge fan of the organization and the people who work here.

Program participants come to HELP after worrying and stressing over their health situation, expecting more bureaucratic obstacles.  They leave relieved and comforted with useful medical equipment and aids for themselves and their caregivers - all at no cost, no deposit, and no hassle!
St. Louis Health Equipment Lending Program, Inc.	36144	9	/users/profile/36932	susann	Volunteer	5	04/19/2010	The first drive for donations was held on a very hot summer day.  Volunteers were situated in many places, often parking lots of stores or municipalities, to receive items.  Ms. Cannon had no idea how well this drive would be but arranged for volunteers to staff the locations and having trucks on site to receive the donations.  The response was overwhelming!  People coming with donations were pleased to be able to contribute to others in need of the equipment that they no longer using.  Much of the equipment was practically new.  Along with the supplies many made small donations to St. Louis Health.  This program was the dream of Laura Cannon who spearheaded the birth of this great charity.  She continues her dedication and energy with no limitations.  This program assists individuals and has helped direct much of the large equipment donated to areas at home and abroad (even arranging for technicians to go to the locations to instruct users).  This is the heart of a wonderful charity and
St. Louis Health Equipment Lending Program, Inc.	35999	1	/users/profile/36796	scsimons	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2010	I have helped with equipment drives in the past. Ms. Cannon began this business with the dream of helping the under/uninsured obtain equipment they could not normally afford. One of the most remarkable things about her service is that she works from donations ONLY, and often times doesn't get those from people recieving her services. Yet, she continues to supply. Her overall care for recycling goods is something that I don't know anyone else to have done in the healthcare business. A few examples include, but are not limited to:- St. Louis HELP provided over $540,000 of home medical equipment to the uninsured, the elderly, the poor and disabled  all without charge or fee to the recipient!- St. Louis HELP served 2,500 uninsured, underinsured, disabled and low income program recipients.- St. Louis HELP received donations of over 5,000 pieces of home medical equipment(45% lent to HELP recipients,17% forwarded to developing nations, 16% in current inventory and 22% responsibly recycled)- St. Louis HELP diverted 90 tons of unwanted home medical equipment out of area landfills.- St. Louis HELP has organized and trained 60 volunteers who through regularly scheduled visits to the warehouse have provided more than 2,000 hours of labor.Imagine what this woman could do if she had more funding available? As is stands, she works with grants and donations. Without this help, St. Louis Health Equipment Lending Program may not be able to provide the services it currently does, and the people that rely on it, will again be without. I would hate to see that happen. Thank you for your consideration.

St. Louis Health Equipment Lending Program, Inc.	35907	8	/users/profile/36695	lauracannon	Volunteer	5	04/15/2010	St. Louis Health Equipment Lending Program (St. Louis HELP) is an organization that provides Home Medical Equipment (HME) to any individual, for as long as necessary, at no charge.  It is a program designed to remove some of the limitations placed on the elderly, disabled and low-income community and to provide an outlet for those who would like to give back to the community through volunteering, equipment donations and recycling.       Why recycle and reuse?  This common sense approach makes a positive impact on the environment, providing usable equipment to those who need it, and responsibly recycling items and parts that can no longer be used.In the past year:- St. Louis HELP provided over $540,000 of home medical equipment to the uninsured, the elderly, the poor and disabled  all without charge or fee to the recipient!- St. Louis HELP served 2,500 uninsured, underinsured, disabled and low income program recipients.- St. Louis HELP received donations of over 5,000 pieces of home medical equipment(45% lent to HELP recipients,17% forwarded to developing nations, 16% in current inventory and 22% responsibly recycled)- St. Louis HELP diverted 90 tons of unwanted home medical equipment out of area landfills.- St. Louis HELP has organized and trained 60 volunteers who through regularly scheduled visits to the warehouse have provided more than 2,000 hours of labor.    The uninsured, underinsured, disabled and elderly are at particular risk of facing barriers to accessing HME.  These vulnerable populations continue to experience reduced access to health care services demonstrating a continuing need for a strong and viable safety net.    HME devices include, but are not limited to, manual and power wheelchairs, scooters, canes, crutches, walkers, shower chairs, grab bars, elevated toilet seats, portable commodes, folding ramps, seating cushions, back supports/positioning devices, dressing aids, electric hospital beds, van lifts, lift chairs and stair lifts. St. Louis HELP accepts donations of nearly every type of home medical equipment device from individuals, vendors and manufacturers.

We repeatedly asked this organization to remove her from their list and they refused or forgot or something.  When they called and we answered the phone they would ask for her and refuse to leave a message.  Only when she answered would they go into the sales pitch and eventually be promised a donation.  I have attempted to call the 800 number on the donation slip and it is always busy. I have now resorted to emailing them to remove her from their list.

We are supported only by donations from the public; and that's all we have. I see the love in each employees eyes when they take in and care for the homeless animals. I volunteer on the Wine Whiskers and Wags benefit and each year it amazes me how an idea can come together and present one of the best events of the year. It is hard to watch an animal be put down because they are not adopted; but a wounderful experience when you find a home for homeless animal. Our shelter needs a lot of things but it is one of the best shelters I have seen.
Franklin County Humane Society of Missouri	95171		/users/profile/110326	csaxonm	Volunteer	5	08/06/2011	The very best pet I ever had came from these motivated, caring people.  She was a tiny surrendered dog, and the staff knew she would not do well in a kennel with big dogs, so THEY called ME because they knew I would provide a perfect, quiet home for a dog like her. FCHS is not just a shelter. It is a matchmaker!  Who could ask for more?
Franklin County Humane Society of Missouri	95122		/users/profile/110253	libkizzy	Donor	5	08/05/2011	Their main focus is to the animals and their welfare. I have seen animals that have come in under less desirable circumstances. They are immediately seen by medical staff and their needs cared for. The best and most wonderful part is when these animals are ready for adoption. Even better is when they go to their forever home. The smile on the animals faces (and trust me there is one) when they go home is the best feeling anyone can have. To see them come in looking awful and in a few short weeks turn around and be adopted to a family. Priceless. 
Kansas City Rescue Mission	56517	5	/users/profile/59049	Tim Q.	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2010	I'd lived on the streets, (literally), for 5+ years from 1988 to 1993. Several of us homeless men lived in an abandoned bank building in KC's City Market. I think I am the last surviving member of those homeless men.  The Mission was located down the street from the bank building. This was before the Mission was evicted  for the City Market Renovation. Thank You Jesus that KCRM would open in a new location 2 years later. We were always welcomed in the Mission to shower, eat dinner, get warm clothing coats socks and underwear, and of course  attend services, (we were always allowed to fill up our 1 gallon milk jugs with precious water),  and get an ecouraging word from Joe C. or Steve K. When I decided to stop drinking and start my life over, the Mission and Joe C. were there to help me. I voluntered there for 3 years during the crucial early recovery stage. I moved on with my life for the next 10 years working at Job Corps and almost 10 years with Jackson County Family Court. I had unexpectedly lost my job and moved to Tuscon, Az. working with homeless addicts and alcoholics. 10 months later I returned to KC Mo. and I was encouraged to apply for a Case Mgr. position at where else KCRM. Truely a dream come true. I had college credits and 10+ years of experience working with addicts/alcoholics. Astonishingly I was hired! That was almost 3 years ago. Working at the Mission has been the most gratifying job I've ever had. I was also able to get closer to the Lord, Jesus Christ and I have become continously grateful for the roof over my head, the clothes on my back, and to the Lord, who worked his wonders in me because of the Kansas City Rescue Mission.  Thank You so much KCRM and I will forever remain at you beck and call...                                        Tim D.

Kansas City Rescue Mission	56337	2	/users/profile/58773	Marisa	Volunteer	5	11/03/2010	I've been a part of KCRM in one way or another for most of my life. I can honestly say that I've never been in a place with more love for every person that walks in the door than KCRM. The people there are treated with respect and dignity. The staff and C-COR members exhibit their love for Christ in a real and contagious way. 
Kansas City Rescue Mission	56223	2	/users/profile/58577	Bingoj	General Member of the Public	4	11/01/2010	I was not a direct client per se but nonetheless benefited from KCRM more than they could ever know. A very long story short, I had known this man, "Ron" for about 3 years. He worked where I volunteered. I had no idea that he had personal feelings for me (I was seeing someone at the time). He left town for about a year but then came back. Shortly before Ron came back, my relationship with "Mitch" had ended. I have never gone from one relationship to the next but I thought I was going to marry Mitch and finally get to be a mom (he had custody of his son and we got along great). When Ron came back he said all the things that I longed to hear from Mitch. I fell hard and fast for him. It was my choice to get involved with him and I realized it was too soon. I told Ron and things went downhill from there. I knew that he had previous problems with alcohol but I had no idea how bad they were. He had started to drink again prior to our relationship falling apart. He began to drink more and I did not know how to respond to him. I should have made more of an effort to understand alcoholism but at the time, I saw it as his problem (I don't drink or do drugs). Ron became someone I no longer recognized. I will sum it all up by saying he was violent and very scary.  He was charged with more than one crime against me and left town before the trial. He eventually wound up back at KCRM and that is where the story takes a turn...for the better and I want everyone reading this to know that.With some stops and starts and setbacks, Ron, a man I no longer recognized became whole again. Through the love, patience, and guidance shown to him through KCRM, he became the Ron that I once knew. They took a truly broken man and healed him. When I think about what they did for him and what they do for so many others, it is an awesome feeling! I do not have contact with Ron anymore but I know what he has accomplished through other sources and he deserves so much credit. Because of the things that he did to me (many of which he truly does not remember because he was having blackouts), I am still to some extent fearful of him. That's my problem, not his. When Ron is not drinking he is a good man and KCRM helped him to find himself again. My biggest regrets are not having made more of an effort to understand his lifelong addictions and having gotten into a relationship with him far too soon. Again, that is on me. What I really want people to know is that when KCRM helps a male client, they don't just help him, they help every person that person knows or touches. By helping Ron to heal, they helped me to heal. I don't live in fear anymore and I can think back on my own actions and what I should have done differently. The ordeal made me turn back to Jesus and I now belong to a great Church and am very active in it and other places that I volunteer.  I so believe in KCRM and the miracles that they perfect each and every day, there is nothing that I would not do for them. And they never even met me face to face...
Kansas City Rescue Mission	23759	2	/users/profile/24883	Jacques777	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	In two-thousand and six, I made a lousy decision.  I had a live in girlfriend that came here from Florida.  She stayed with me for a year, then she told me one day in Sept.2007 that she wanted to go home.  I told her that I wanted to go with her.  Stayed in Florida for two months, couldn't find a job and we got evicted from the run down trailor we lived in.  Her mom took us in the follow November.  Gave me a week to find a job.  I couldn't find a job, so they sent me back here to Kansas City.  Couldn't go home to the family, so I checked into the Kansas City Rescue Mission the following Monday as an overnighter. During Christmas a news reporter from one of the local stations was interviewing the guys from the shelter behind a Salvation Army truck and they asked me how I felt about it.  I told them that I feel like there's hope for the homeless.  Little did I know that my niece was watching the news that night.  She told my sister that I was on TV.  The following February, my sister took me in and it was nothing but day to day problems.  The following May I came back to the Rescue Mission.  Then one day the next month, a guy that's in C-corps told me that I should get into the program so I wouldn't have to carry my bags around all day.  Been in the Transistion program since last June.  I now have a job waiting for me next January.  Jesus loves you all and so do I.
Kansas City Rescue Mission	23173	2	/users/profile/24245	Robert	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/01/2009	5 years ago I had lost my job.  I had been unemployed for 6 months.  I had to return my vehicle to the loan company and I was behind on my mortgage by three months.  The bank was already threatening to make me homeless.  We had no where to go,  I had considered living in the woods under a blue plastic tarp. My story starts in July, 7 years ago.  I moved out here from Wellsville, NY.  A little town in the hills of the southern tier of NY where I worked for Verizon as an installer.  I made good money and My wife and I lived very comfortably. As Christians we know that is when God moves in and asks us to do things. I was an associate Pastor of a small church in our town.  Then I got this calling from God to come west to start a church in the holiness denom. that I belonged to.My target destination was Omaha, Neb but in route to Omaha my wife's brother had a heart attack, he lived in Belton at the time.  Our course was diverted and we hauled everything we owned to Kansas City. I worked for two years at a hotel in the area to support us while I tried to start a new church.  For two years I got no where, I prayed and fasted and fasted and prayed, but for some reason nothing would happen. I questioned God at times asking if I had made a mistake.  We faithfully asked people to come to church at our house but we never had more than two or three show up. Then I lost my job at the hotel.  I tried and tried for six months to find work.  I work temp jobs for a while but never long enough to pay to many bills. I had started going to the 1st Church of the Nazarene of Blue Springs about three months before and they prayed for me to get a job and helped supply food so we wouldn't starve.  But when it came to the bills we had nothing. Then one Saturday I was at a Sunday School class dinner and one of the people from the mission (Gordon M.) asked me if I had a Job yet, and half jokingly I said,"hey, get me a job where you work.  That Sunday I was introduced to Joe C. I handed him my resume and cover letter, Wednesday the following week I was called to fill out an application. By the following Monday I was working. But, I still have a problem, I have no ride, and I am about to loose my home.  There was no way I was going to catch up with my mortgage and I had already talked to the bank,  I was at a lose. But when we see nothing God always see something, Joe C. got wind of my situation and call all of the KCRM resources to bear, Jan B.(case worker) Found money to keep my utilities on and caught up. Joe C. Put his name on the line to support a loan to catch up my mortgage, and Jan B. persuaded the bank to rethink foreclosure and give me a chance. At the same time Paul M. made sure we had plenty of food. As I settled into my new job I found family I didn't know I had. I also realized that this is what God was calling me to those years ago back in NY. Today I can pay my mortgage payment, God gave me a ride to work, and My handicapped wife received SSSI  as she should, all thanks to KCRM.  I still don't make enough to buy groceries every payday but I am not starving thanks to Tara R. and her kitchen staff. Since I have worked here at KCRM I have had my hands in stuff most people would shy away from, I have done things most people would not think of doing and i still love the fact that God finds me worthy enough to do his dirty work.  I must admit, not all of my jobs are dirty; and being a recovered alcoholic at the hands of my Lord and Savior is one thing you will never take from this Maintenance Supervisor.  I love you all and now you know the rest, of, the story.
Owl Hollow Farm	246168		/users/profile/333412	bjallen88	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I only recently discovered Owl Hollow Farm and I have yet to be anything less than thoroughly impressed with every aspect of how they run this non-profit ministry. They rescue abused and neglected horses, and fit them with the indispensable purpose of ministering to hurting and special needs children. Kids come weekly for several weeks per session to learn horsemanship and riding. You can just see the joy on the faces of Bob & Cathy, OHF's owners, and all of their staff and volunteers, not to mention the parents and kids who receive the benefits of their services. I have yet to see a single person that is not happy to be there! Every single time. God's hand of blessing is on this ministry and I encourage anyone with a love of horses or children to find a way to donate and/or get involved.
Owl Hollow Farm	246165		/users/profile/333407	farmerswife2009	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I work with the woman who is the owner and she is absolutely dedicated to helping others through her horse therapy farm.  The children learn responsibility, empathy, hard work, and improved self esteem, as well as simply the feeling of love and enjoyment!
Owl Hollow Farm	246163		/users/profile/333405	Cathy92	Board Member	5	06/23/2015	I find it a previledge to direct this children's charity. From the beginning of it's inception this program has been blessed with donars and volunters. I love seeing the joy in the children and volunteers as they work together during mentoring sessions. We have been so greatly blessed to serve. 
Owl Hollow Farm	246161		/users/profile/333403	Cindy177	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I'm a mentor/volunteer. I love what WE do for the children & the horses. It's the best feeling......watching the kids come to life when they're around the horses. They smile & laugh - a lot! They learn to listen, follow directions, care for, groom & ride the horses. But most of all, they know we care about them and we love what we do.
Owl Hollow Farm	246158		/users/profile/333399	Kristina20	Client Served	5	06/23/2015	My daughter has been participating in this program for almost three years. It is a great opportunity to bond with a horse and a mentor, learn valuable life skills and encourage self confidence. 
Bread of Life Fellowship Inc	158489		/users/profile/58668	Wanda K.	Advisor	5	05/22/2013	I have been involved with Bread of Life Fellowship for many years.  First as a volunteer at Food for Families, an event that takes place at Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This event brings the community together to sort, pack and deliver food boxes for families in need.  Now as an employee of Bread of Life, part of what I do is work with a leadership team to carry out this event that has been on-going for over 20 years.  It is amazing that so many families consider this event as part of their own holiday traditions.  But everyday, Bread of Life is busy gathering, sorting and helping to feed over 5,000 families a month.  This ministry is the REAL THING!

His deeds, when it comes to Bread of Life backs up his beliefs that NO one should go hungry or NO one should not know the Love of Jesus Christ. What a way to spread the Gospel - As Jesus did when He was here amoung us! Our organization Care4Kids deals with many food banks and pantrys and you Do Not find many who share what Mark shares with everyone that he  comes in contact with him. My hat if off to Bread of Life for it is truly an organization that is the Bread of Life
Bread of Life Fellowship Inc	157880		/users/profile/156434	Jeff1983	Volunteer	5	05/14/2013	What better way to help in these times is there than to put food on the table and hope in the hearts of those who are down but not out.  If you haven't experienced a BOLF outreach, you are missing out on a special opportunity to meet and serve those God cherishes. 
Bread of Life Fellowship Inc	157869		/users/profile/209367	Tim_25	Volunteer	5	05/14/2013	I have been involved with this BOLF for years now and I can say this organization is absolutely outstanding. I have seen first hand over the years this organization help hundreds of thousands disadvantaged families with their donations of basic necessities (food, clothing, school supplies, spiritual counseling). This endeavor is spearheaded by one man who all too frequently uses his own money to keep this dream afloat. This organization deserves all the help it can get because it gives all the help it can.
Bread of Life Fellowship Inc	157867		/users/profile/209365	John167	Volunteer	5	05/14/2013	One of the best experiences my kids have ever had as volunteers. Kudos to Mark and staff!

It's amazing to see and hear the parents talk about the progress their kids have achieved after finding ETC.  If you have or know of a child that needs therapy this is the place they need to be.

I am also a therapist and know many families of children who are in the program.  The results of this unique kind of therapy are amazing! And ETC has been unmatched in the services they provide. My daughter's increased strength, agility and physical skills including balance and stability are a result of being part of this program! My role is multi-faceted!  I am a parent of a client,  a professional therapist and.....because I believe in this program...a board member!

With the utilization of horses, clients and patients receive the benefit of treatment in a manner that is engaging and noninvasive without the emotional anxiety that can be a part traditional treatment approaches. 
Equi-Librium Therapy Center	290894	1	/users/profile/381234	Abbie3	Donor	5	05/24/2016	I volunteer, work, and donate for ETC. I've seen miracles happening at this place!! By using the therapy horses as connectors emotionally and by their natural movements to improve therapies for clients, it helps vastly improve results. I've seen kids coming in from local homes who have been abused or in trouble to children with disabilities enjoy themselves all while improving whatever they need to emotionally and physically. I highly recommend anyone to get involved in any way whether volunteering, donating, connecting or having a family member becoming a client!! It's totally worth it! 
Missouri Girls Town Foundation Inc	38138	4	/users/profile/38999	sue10	Donor	5	05/06/2010	I have occassionally donated items for clients and the Missouri Girls Town Thrift Store.  I believe the treatment the girls receive from this organization is among the best in the state.
Missouri Girls Town Foundation Inc	38122	5	/users/profile/38976	desertpat	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	For two years,I've been priviledged to meet monthly with MGT residents and helped establish an on-campus Juniorette Club as a youth club of the sponsoring General Federation of Women's Club (GFWC) - Tuesday Club of MO.  Juniorette Clubs are sponsored on Sr. & Jr. High School campuses across the country but the Club at MGT is unique because all of the resident girls are State referred from severely neglectful or abusive homes.  To be part of a skilled, professional and caring service to such a special population of young women is both daunting and inspiring.  Each month I personally witness the impact of consistent caring and counseling by skilled staff, administrators and committed volunteers in restoring self-esteem and self-determination in the girls.      The Juniorette Club specifically targets leadership development and volunteer service as tools for self determination and personal development.  It has been amazing to see these wounded young women learn to enjoy serving the needs of others and heal themselves through this service.  Specific projects, selected by group consensus, have included: community civic beautification; serving at a local soup kitchen; writing valentine cards for people in Armed Service; hosting a campus Career Day and planning a campus-wide celebration for graduating Seniors.   The leadership roles rotate monthly so that each girl can benefit from serving and from receiving critiques from peers.     Most importantly, it is a privilege to be part of an organization that prioritizes the worth of every individual person, especially young abused or neglected women, and devotes itself to preparing them for useful, fulfilling lives.  When I came to MO three years ago, after many years in volunteer service to women's organizations, I only wanted to work with a group that valued diversity and personal potential of young people.  I'm so pleased and proud of GFWC's founding and dedicated support of the awesome work at Missouri Girls Town -- changing thousands of lives since 1959.

Though I have attended events at Missouri Girls Town before, the volunteer experience of their General Federation of Women's Clubs -Calloway Juniorette Club's Career Day was truly inspiring as the young women showed deft talent in preparing, presenting, and debriefing an extraordinary Career Day event for the residents. Conversing with residents after the event, I was humbled by their heart wrenching experiences that brought them to Missouri Girls Town and the phenomenal transformation I witnessed from the extraordinary mentoring accomplished by the faculty, staff and volunteers who interact with the residents. Kudos to all who serve Missouri Girls Town!
Meds & Food For Kids	118792	1	/users/profile/161520	mikimaru55	Volunteer	5	07/18/2012	I volunteered in MFKs administrative office in St. Louis, and was very impressed by the impact such a small organization can have in changing Haitian children and farmers lives. What I find truly amazing about this organization are its efforts to address the root cause of severe malnutrition in Haiti by creating jobs and spreading knowledge about farming practices to produce better yields. During my time with the organization, MFK was in the middle of building its new factory, whose completion will produce enough Medika Mamba (the Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic Food) to treat 80,000 children every year. The organization has come a long way from its humble beginnings with a hand grinder in a church schoolroom, and I believe MFK will continue to accomplish great things and save thousands of lives. I would highly recommend Meds & Food for Kids for interns and volunteers looking for a worthwhile experience.
Meds & Food For Kids	118791	1	/users/profile/161519	hjbick	Volunteer	5	07/18/2012	Meds & Food for Kids is not only a life-changing source of nutrition for thousands of malnourished children in Haiti, but also a sustainable business endeavor that employs local workers and gives families a real opportunity to end the vicious cycle of poverty. I was fortunate enough to serve as an intern to this incredible organization, and was constantly impressed by the network of dedicated and passionate individuals that contribute their time and resources to ensure the success of this non-profit. Dr. Patricia Wolff is an extremely intelligent, creative, compassionate, and inspiring leader whose reputation alone earns MFK an enormous amount of respect amongst the St. Louis, medical, and development communities. I wholeheartedly believe and trust in the mission, model, and performance of this organization, and I'm excited to see their impact grow even more after the completion of the new Haitian factory.  
Meds & Food For Kids	118565	1	/users/profile/161247	Michael96	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	I was a student intern with Meds & Foods for Kids. My role involved working on the MFK's supply chain, helping the organization to develop its end to end supply chain strategy as MFK began scaling up with a new factory in Haiti. The work was very rewarding, and I had a chance to interact with the staff at the national office, as well as work closely with the Director of Operations who is currently located in Haiti. My experience with MFK was well spent as I learned a great deal about how this social enterprise is supporting a worthy social cause while utilizing sound business principles.  It was truly fascinating to work with MFK's Global Supply Chain, and to learn that the challenges MFK faces are the same faced by any global business.
Meds & Food For Kids	118533	1	/users/profile/161202	julialwong	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	I first learned about Meds & Food For Kids one year ago at the nonprofit career fair at Washington University in St. Louis. MFK was distributing information about its cause and the work it does to WashUs social activists. I was immediately impressed with the work the nonprofit does for the farmers and malnourished children of Haiti; MFK simultaneously stimulates the Haitian agricultural system while curbing starvation in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Since the career fair, I have started working at MFK in an internship position. During my time here, the organization has continually surpassed my expectations. Most nonprofits settle for raising money and awareness for a cause, but MFK lives its mission statement- it doesnt seek to feed hungry children, but rather fix the system that lead to their starvation. Yes, fundraising is a large portion of the work that goes on at MFK, but the work is personally gratifying. I know that for every $69 that MFK raises, one more child can be cured of malnutrition. I am inspired by the work MFK is committed to and moved by the stories of those MFK helps. Having extensively browsed photographs from our clinics in Haiti, I can say that the results are visible and blatant. Children that only weeks ago were not strong enough to support the weight of their own head or stand up can now play with other healthy children. Families that were devastated from the loss of a child to starvation now have a way to save the lives of their other children. It amazes me that one organization can have as much of an impact in a country as Meds & Food For Kids has in Haiti. I highly recommend Meds & Food For Kids and its work in Haiti. Please support this organization so that 80,000 children can grow up to be happy and healthy.
Recovery Chapel	239109		/users/profile/324730	mrdynamyt01	Client Served	5	03/11/2015	In 2012, at the age of 55 I was in a car wreck in which a local small town policeman ran a red light with no lights or siren and collided with my 2003 Mustang, resulting in my vehicle being completely totaled. I am not a street person, I have a bachelors degree in Business/Marketing and a teaching certification. For several years I had been a grocery merchandiser traveling around southwest Missouri calling on Walmart stores to build displays, put up advertising and just do various forms of merchandising within the stores, earning about $13 an hour. I only had liability insurance on my car and the insurance company for this small town refused to pay for my vehicle. Thus I lost my job, I was unemployed, unable to pay my rent and in the meantime I became completely bankrupt. As I had to have a car to do my job and I could not find any work where I could take the bus. I was bankrupt and unable to pay my rent and full of fear as to where I was going to end up.Many well educated, good people find themselves homeless due to misfortune and not necessarily . I had heard of Recovery Chapel, and being in recovery myself, I called Farris Robertson and he explained their program to me. How I could become a resident of RC for about $400 a month, including meals and receive Spiritual Guidance, and group support through group studies and individual counseling with Mr. Robertson and other volunteers that came in to deliver a message of hope. If you have ever found yourself totally helpless, financially destitute and with no idea where to turn, then RC is truly a God send. Many good men and women find themselves homeless, jobless and with no place to go, through no real fault of their own. I was not drinking or using drugs, I just got myself into a hopeless situation I had gone through a double bypass in 2009 so I was already struggling financially. I did have another heart attack in 2012 while living at RC and the staff and my friends helped me tremendously after I had 4 more stints put in my heart. At RC along with the encouragement, housing and food I received I also got some assistance in renting a car so I could again get a merchandising job. As I sit here in my own apartment (self sufficient through Christ) in southeast Springfield, with a nice dependable car in the parking lot, and a great part time job with CROSSMARK merchandising, it is hard to imagine that my life has been restored, or better yet, not just restored but renewed and I live a better quality life than I have since my 30's and I owe it all to God, Recovery Chapel, Farris Robertson, Terry St. Clair and then rest of the staff and the board of directors. Philippians 4:13 paraphrased; "All things are possible through Christ who strengthens me". Terry Ponder

Watching men grow and recover from seeming hopelessness is a real blessing to them and our community.  As they move away from the revolving door of prison to productive citizens in our area and around the country.  This organization is well worth the support of our community.

The various issues and needs that Recovery Chapel extends is more complete than any medical or psychological program offers.   I was hospitalized for alcohol in my 30's, and I was able to stay away from alcohol.  However, I was left with depression to overcome and became suicidal.  I was once again hospitalized and treated for depression.   I remember one night leaving the treatment center and I wanted to find what love really was.  I had never experienced it myself.  What I was in need of was a personal relationship with Christ to find what true love was.

This job had provided a company vehicle so I had to buy a used car for cash. I was still unemployed and going to school a year later when my front brakes started to make a squealing sound. I spoke to Butch at "An Honest Days Work" automotive and Butch explained the least expensive way to get the car fixed while keeping it in good running condition.  Butch replaced my front brake pads for less than half of the cost I had been quoted around town. He didn't try to talk me into doing a bunch of things that really didn't need to be done at the time. Just now I have had a ticking noise inside my engine and took my car to 5 different places. Only Butch from "An Honest Days Work" automotive gave the correct diagnosis that the car manufacturer gave and he quoted the  work for about half the price. Out of all the auto repair places I talked to, Butch is the only one I would trust to do the work as he is not in it just for the money. He is honest and will not give you some shuck and jive story trying to get you to spend a bunch of extra money on your car. I would recommend this part of the ministry to anyone that has a car that needs major or minor repairs. You will be treated with honesty and sincerity, something you don't always find in the auto repair business. This place left me with a healthy attitude and peace of mind, and no worries or stress usually involved with expensive expenditures on ones car. I left knowing that I wasn't being taken advantage of and that my car was going to continue to run properly because of the work they did. Stress and worry is a killer. It not only affects your mind but also your body and as a person that has had a double bypass, I don't need that stress and worry in my life. They could call this place "Peace of Mind Automotive" as they remove the fear of dealing with unscrupulous mechanics.
LAST - Latin American Sea Turtles	302260	1	/users/profile/393380	Sophie6	Volunteer	5	09/01/2016	"My experience at LAST was one of the best experiences I have had! Although it certainly was something out of my comfort zone, I don't regret doing it. It opened my eyes to how prominent poaching is, and how important it is for there to be patrols to help. The people and the activities that I had to do made me feel so helpful and supportive to the community, certainly a trip that you come out from realising how much off the world you are normally secluded from. Would recommend it to everyone! Best food and everyone is so friendly and happy that you are there."
LAST - Latin American Sea Turtles	263684	1	/users/profile/352389	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	I have worked on several sea turtle projects, and this by FAR was the most professional and meaningful. Here, it is the science and the reserach that counts - I felt like I was positively contributing to the future of the project - rather than just being treated like a tourist as in many projects. The work is quite tough - but then most conservation work is. The staff were extremely knowledegable and keen to involve volunteers in all aspects of the project and the community. I would definately go back, and play a bigger part in sea turtle conservation.
LAST - Latin American Sea Turtles	148138	1	/users/profile/196111	TortugaVol	Volunteer	3	01/16/2013	I was a volunteer for Widecast for three weeks in September 2012.  The work the organization does is incredibly useful for the preservation of the sea turtle population in that area of Costa Rica.  In the time I was there, at least four grown turtles were saved from poachers, roughly 10 nests hatched and the baby turtles were protected on their way to the ocean, and the hatchery was guarded 24/7.  That said, the work is not easy, can often be tedious, and the management present could use some... reworking.  Your sleep schedule gets very off, as you work for 4-6 hours each night, with shifts beginning at 8pm, 10pm, 12am, or 2am.  During the day you have a hatchery shift for 2 hours, with the rest of the day to yourself.  The time during the day can pass quite slowly (especially if there are relatively few other volunteers there at the time), but the location is gorgeous and on a completely isolated strip of beach (only populated by a few locals and a handful of drug dealers/poachers).  The night hikes are physically brutal, and can be quite frustrating if either a) you find no turtles, or b) you spot a turtle that poachers have already claimed (there is a "no confrontational" policy).  And in terms of how the project is run... it's honestly hard to say who's in charge.  The research assistants (long-term volunteers) basically ran the project, yet they had received little to no training, and were often left without support from the people "in charge," (who were rarely present).  There was a lot of griping about management. Note on meals:  The food is not disgusting, yet the meals are very repetitive, food is only available at meal times, and the lack of fresh fruits and veggies is disturbing.  (If you love fruit like I do, I recommend asking locals to knock you down coconuts or pippas from the trees.)   The project's mission and work is worthwhile, and the experience is quite enjoyable thanks to the other people (volunteers and locals who help out) that are present.  But I feel like, until the project comes under new guidance, a short-term volunteer project is best here.  Your body will thank you, too.
LAST - Latin American Sea Turtles	123195	3	/users/profile/167808	AES2	Volunteer	2	09/26/2012	Let me be clear:  the turtle work you will be involved in is incredible.  I worked as a research assistant at the Pacuare Project from April-August 2012.  I led night patrols, PIT-tagged and skin-tagged leathbacks and greens, collected eggs, relocated nests to the hatchery, etc.  This work is extremely important to sea turtle conservation in this area because the beach is loaded with poachers.  The poachers take the eggs of the leatherbacks, and they take the eggs and the turtle if it's a green turtle.  Without this project, turtles would vanish from this small stretch of beach in just a few years.     That said, Widecast as an organization has a lot of problems, and these put a dark cloud over my experience.  I recommend going as a short-term volunteer only, because there is a serious lack of food.  We got three meals a day and that's it; the meals were a small portion of rice, beans, and some other starch.  Very little protein, no calcium, and barely any fresh fruit or vegetables.  Much of the work takes place at night, so sleep is of the utmost importance.  The camp manager would regularly start the generator/water pump at ungodly hours of the night.  The camp coordinator would regularly stand outside the cabin the research assistants slept in and have loud conversations, waking us up out of our much-needed sleep.  (Requests for her to stop this behavior were ignored.)    We received no formal training from any Widecast employee.  The Outreach and Education coordinator (Daniela) offered us endless advice and guidance, but we were told by an office employee (Cristina) not to listen to Daniela because Daniela was "not in charge."  Safety rules were constantly changing, and Cristina told us that we did not need to know what to do in an emergency because "nothing would ever happen."  (Say what?!)  The unprofessionalism of the Widecast employees was endless and I won't detail it all here, but I will end with this:  Just before the other research assistant and I left the project, the head of Widecast (Didiher Chacon) sent the message that we were not to say anything negative to the incoming research assistants.  He did not apologize for all the mistakes, and he did not say thank you for all the work we did.  Widecast has a lot of work to do if they want to keep attracting a large amount of volunteers to the Pacuare project.     Final recommendation:  if you're interested in visiting Pacuare, volunteer with La Tortuga Feliz.  You will still be volunteering with Widecast, but you will be living in a much better place with sufficient amounts of very good food.
Proyecto Bienestar	207159		/users/profile/269736	KaLa Rae E.	Volunteer	5	07/24/2014	I started volunteering with Proyecto Bienestar last month. I have learned so much about so many different talented woman! I believe this program is amazing because it empowers woman and influences people of all races, ages, and sexes to do whatever their minds and bodies desire. What a great organization!! 
Proyecto Bienestar	207127		/users/profile/269695	beccaj	Volunteer	5	07/24/2014	I started volunteering a couple of months ago with Proyecto Bienestar. I have learned so much about these wonderful ladies that Proyecto Bienestar helps by helping them get started in their own home based businesses. It is so amazing what these ladies do and what all they have been through. I am so glad that I have started volunteering for this group, it makes me stop and think about how the things that I think are bad in my life are nothing compared to what others are going through. Proyecto Bienestar is a GREAT organization and are doing so many wonderful things! They are all awesome people and I hope I get to work with them a lot more! Proyecto Bienestar THANK YOU for all you are doing to help these ladies!
Proyecto Bienestar	207106		/users/profile/269668	Kim Estes M.	General Member of the Public	5	07/24/2014	I have watched Proyecto Benestar grow from a dream to reality. The ideas of empowering women,building confidence and giving them a toe-hold on the ladder of success is powerful, enlighteningand humbling. It is important in life to always put yourself in another person's shoes. When we do this, we change our perspective and point of view. This non-profit  does that from all angles. Those who donate get the benefit of making a difference in the lives of others. Those who are recipients gain some much needed momentum to help themselves for a lifetime. They also become part of a giant pay it forward campaign that is literally life-changing.
Proyecto Bienestar	206162	1	/users/profile/268530	cmmcynthia	Volunteer	5	07/15/2014	Proyecto Bienestar is a great organization that I volunteer with from time to time.  It helps women in the United States and Mexico begin new homebasesd businesses and it changes their lives even though they may not make a fortune.  It gives them a future and a new sense of life.
Mitrata-Nepal Foundation For Children	226456		/users/profile/290182	Ambrose B.	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	I've been on the Mitrata's board for 6 years and been helping them fundraise for 9 years through a Mt. Rainier charity climb that I organized each year. Mitrata really does good work in Nepal with it's education projects and I've visited them personally several times. MItrata's strengths are the great team that's managing the sponsorship and school programs in Nepal; the integrity of the founders and board members and their unwavering focus on doing what's best for the long-term well-being of the children we support.
Mitrata-Nepal Foundation For Children	224772		/users/profile/288532	bboydcpa	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I've been volunteering with MItrata for more than 6 years.  Mitrata helps children in Nepal with education, housing, medical and other needs.  I'm a CPA and have helped with tax and accounting work for Mitrata over the years.   I can tell you that the organization is VERY lean - almost all monies raised go directly to help the children.  Some of the children are now university-aged and Mitrata is evolving to continue to provide life-changing support for these kids.  This is a great organization, full of dedicated and inspired volunteers.
Mitrata-Nepal Foundation For Children	224703		/users/profile/288465	Jim_123	Board Member	5	10/21/2014	I've been involved with Mitrata for many years now.  I started by sponsoring a child in Nepal when she was in 5th grade and now she is completing high school.  Three years ago I went to Nepal to meet Sushmita.  No other charity I know of offers this type of personal connection to the child you sponsor.  Mitrata was founded by Dr. Christine Schutz when on a visit to Kathmandu she met a young girl living on the streets in Nepal.  Even though the charity has grown over the years to where we now help over 100 children, the focus on helping one child at a time hasn't changed.  If you wan to make a difference in a child's life, in a country where desperate poverty is often the norm, then I don't think there is a better charity than Mitrata.   
Mitrata-Nepal Foundation For Children	108005		/users/profile/146726	nwilliger	Board Member	5	03/18/2012	I have volunteered with Mitrata since the beginning of the organization.  I know it to be a well run and honest organization dedicated to helping children in Nepal.  The organization has helped over 100 children get an education in Nepal.  It continues to grow and gets stronger every year.  
Communities Creating Opportunity	168511	1	/users/profile/223437	StephenKC	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I have worked with CCO for many years.  They are well organized, excellent communicators and fight hard for "the least of these" in Kansas City.  I'm always impressed with how well they work with people of various faiths.
Communities Creating Opportunity	167946	1	/users/profile/222816	msmrabon	Board Member	5	09/06/2013	  CCO is a faith-based, non-partisan organization focusing on the primary initiatives that cause concern for our families and neighborhoods; i.e. housing and community development, safe neighborhoods, healthcare, economic empowerment, and youth development, to name a few.    Foreclosures bring blight, empty homes, crime and dumping issues to communities and my neighborhood was no exception.  After weeks of trying to get the City to come out and remove an ever-growing pile of trash and furniture, I called on CCO for help.  We had an action, right there in front of the pile of trash, publicized it through the media, and our City Councilwoman joined us and with a couple of phone calls, had that whole mountain of garbage hauled away.     CCO and its leaders and staff have worked tirelessly to improve not only  Kansas City neighborhoods, but the entire metro area, including Kansas City, Kansas, and throughout mid-Missouri.  Our Executive Director, Eva Schulte heads our organization and under her leadership, CCO has helped secure funding for housing, neighborhood improvements, and health care initiatives, to name a few.  These improvements have brought hope and high expectations to our communities that together, we can accomplish even greater things.  
Communities Creating Opportunity	131664	1	/users/profile/66004	PastorDonna	Board Member	5	10/31/2012	Our church has been working with CCO for six years now, and we love the organization.  We have watched CCO more than double its capacity in that time, under the great leadership of Executive Director Eva Schulte.  Eva manages to hire simply outstanding organizers and to make them even better.  Working with CCO has allowed our church to be involved in important change in our city and state; it has greatly increased our own capacity to make change as well.  We've been particularly involved in the campaign to cap Missouri's outrageous interest rates on short term loans, which currently average 445% APR.  When we are successful in that effort, it will change the lives of thousands of people in our community.  We have also been strengthened by the ability to work side by side with a diverse array of persons from nearly every sort of faith community in the Kansas City metro.  We look forward to many more years of organizing with CCO.

Board Of Religious Organizations	43650	1	/users/profile/44523	giddings-lovejoy	General Member of the Public	4	06/11/2010	BRO is a great organization that contributes to the well-being of underserved residents in the City of St. Louis and surrounding communities.  Their work all year long makes it possible for families to enjoy a wonderful CHristmas, older adults to have support in their difficult years, and provides for all of the community a unique ministry.  How do I know? I watch them serve over 1500 families out of the basement of the office building where I am currently the Executive Officer.
Board Of Religious Organizations	42163	7	/users/profile/42895	dnmr	Volunteer	5	05/31/2010	BRO is a great group.  They provide toys for children at Christmas.  They also provide layettes for new babys.  The families that are served are going through such a tough time and the BRO helps the children get a feeling of normalcy.  BRO also provides an opportunity for the volunteers to make a differnce.

My volunteer job is to keep the children's books organized by reading level, look for opportunities to get free books, buy new books with donated money but at the least expense and convince family, friends, neighbors and church members to donate new and lightly used books for children infants to 10 years old.  I get a great pleasure out of sharing these books with the parents, helping them pick out what their children will like.  Usually each child receives one new book and one or two slightly used books.

We work with 25 Social Service agencies in the St. Louis area to screen clients. We also provide  layettes for new moms in need.
Mastodon Art-Science Regional Fair	190308		/users/profile/248458	benjaminfranklin	Board Member	5	12/10/2013	I moved to the Jefferson County area a little over 4 years ago and I was told about the Mastodon Fair.  I really didn't know what to expect but it did intrigue me as I am very interested in science and art.   When I got to the fair I was immediately blown away, both by the quantity and the quality of the projects the Fair brings in.  Not to mention that the Mastodon Fair is the nations largest Art and Science Fair and it awards over $55,000 in prizes and scholarships to students each year!   Another amazing fact about the Fair is that a handful of participants each year have the opportunity to go onto National and International Competitions and many of these students win! The Mastodon Fair is changing lives and helping cultivate the future leaders of Jefferson Count, St Louis County and Missouri.
Mastodon Art-Science Regional Fair	189786		/users/profile/247758	Sonja E.

This organization has always been very professional in the handling of all of the children's entries and they make it a pleasure to volunteer. For me it has always been something I look forward to each year because you get so much more out of it than the time you put into it. Being able to see all the exceptional work that is being created by our local children in art and science makes it all worth the effort.
Mastodon Art-Science Regional Fair	8752	14	/users/profile/10507	MathSciTeacher	Volunteer	5	08/06/2009	The MASRF has provided science and art inspiration to thousands of students.  As a teacher, I often hear from students and parents about how the fair has helped determine their career choice.  Also, heartwarming stories like this - At one of our early award ceremonies the students would come on stage, say their name and school, and then receive their blue ribbon award.  After one of the students recieved her award, her parents starting quietly crying.  Unbeknownst to us, the student was austistic and this was the first time she had EVER spoken in public!!
Mastodon Art-Science Regional Fair	8601	17	/users/profile/10325	MakingaDifference	Board Member	5	08/04/2009	The Mastodon Fair started as a grass roots effort by ladies in the community. For 30 years volunteers and donations from the community has kept it going. Why? Because the Mastodon Fair makes a difference in the lives of students - helping them to excel from the inside out.  Skills can be taught. Self-esteem has to be earned.  The Mastodon Fair creates opportunities to have students self-esteem radically improved. It is a prestigious art and science Fair with the local reputation that "If you win at the Mastodon Fair, you have really done well!"  Our professional judges keep the quality standard very high, and students stretch themselves to exceed those standards.  The Mastodon Fair is truly an organization that makes a difference in student lives!

Harp And Shamrock-The Bob Reeder Fan Club Inc	12100	7	/users/profile/14112	Lady Morgi	Board Member	5	10/06/2009	I'm on the board of the Harp and Shamrock in Kansas City, Missouri.  We are an Irish Music Fan Club and we raise money for the Hearing Aid Clinic at Children's Mercy Hospital.  We've been around for 10 years and have put 120 children in hearing aids.  This is important because Medicaid in Missouri will not cover hearing aids, because they believe children can learn to read lips and use sign language.If you've ever seen a child when they receive their hearing aids and can hear music, or hear their mother say "I love you" for the first time, its just amazing.We're challenged this year, due to the economy, but our members have managed to earn enough this year to hopefully add another 5 children to the list of kids we have helped, maybe more.Unlike most charities, the Harp and Shamrock is a totally volunteer organization.  Not a single person receives a salary or stipend for their work.  The only money kept by the club is to cover the costs of supplies for our booths at the local festivals, supplies for our benefit concerts and for our float in the St. Pats parade, and we generally get a cash prize for our organization that equals the cost of the float or exceeds it.I'm proud that we are a "just for the kids" charity and that we have helped so many children.

City Union Mission	121521	2	/users/profile/165245	Dan D.	Donor	5	08/28/2012	Someone recently wrote a review that I want to respond to since I'm named and described as dishonest.  City Union Mission did indeed transfer management of our thrift stores to a service that specializes in this area.  Thrift employees who were interested in continuing their employment with the new management service were invited to apply for new positions.  Several did and were hired.  Our thrift stores are still owned by City Union Mission and profits continue to be used for the various programs of the Mission.  Those dollars raised and given to the Mission are used to help feed and shelter the up to 400 men, women, and children in our shelters each day and night.  Our thrift stores continue to be used as training sites for men on our 1 year Christian Life Program and our northeast Kansas City store continues to be our "give away" store because about 80% of what goes out the doors is given away to the poor.
City Union Mission	121238	1	/users/profile/164963	bobmcintosh654	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/22/2012	 In December of 2011 the City Union Mission terminated all of there employees from the thrift operations.  This was over 25 employees.  The Mission then hired a management company to take over there thrift store operations.  This operation went from a not for profit to a for profit operation.  In tough times tough choices have to be made.  But questions of honesty have to be raised when the Mission continues to make the public think that donations and money from these operations are going to the Mission.  On August 15th the Mission CEO Dan Doty gave an interview to local TV station KSHB about the grand opening of there new thrift store.  They have also posted stories on there web site about there new thrift store.  This is misleadign they are not operating these thrift stores.  The donations to these thrift stores do not go to the Mission.   The employees of these stores are not Mission employees.  Unlike previously the staff do not even have to be supportive of a faith related belief.  The profits of these stores are not going directly to Mission operations.  At the worse the Mission and Mr. Doty are lying at best they are misleading the public into thinking this is a mIssion operated business.   There is a lack of FULL DISCLOSURE.  Shame on you Mr. Doty and your alleged Christian organzation.
Columbia Art League	320414		/users/profile/412886	Kecha0725	Volunteer	5	12/22/2016	I don't agree with the super negative reviewer about misappropriation of funds---that is such a strong term that implies criminal action.  Though I don't know where this perspective came from, I do know the board is active and has oversight.  I think almost every board in Columbia struggles to represent the diversity of the community; everyone can do better. To have this happen means that underrepresented people take the initiative to offer and/or agree to serve as volunteers, including board members and that's is tough for anyone with a busy life.   Sorry this person had such a negative interaction but I would encourage support of CAL.  As a non-artist, I feel supporting those with this talent is so important.  
Columbia Art League	230755	1	/users/profile/294314	kes9kf	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Wow! I feel like the person who wrote the negative review here is way off the mark and I agree with the other reviewer that I have scarcely heard a negative remark about the Art League from anyone.  The comments regarding excessive gallery decor are especially difficult to comprehend for anyone who has ever visited the Columbia Art League. The Art League's gallery is minimally adorned, reasonably sized, and practical.  Perhaps the reviewer wasn't  favor of the fact that at the time they posted these remarks, CAL had recently had the chance to build it's own gallery to it's own specifications for the first time in 50 years of operation.  It was a step up that this organization is more than deserving of after being bounced around from one ill-fitted retail location to another.  The gallery and classroom spaces are essential to enabling the organization to fulfill it's mission "to provide the community with a stimulating environment for experiencing the visual arts through exhibitions, education, appreciation, promotion and creation of art."  The idea that CAL caters only to the rich is also a bit odd, considering almost all of its events, including openings and Art in the Park (a major arts festival), are free and open to the public.  Art in the gallery tends to be relatively affordable, compared to other galleries in the area, and as a non-profit, the artists receive a higher percentage of the sales than anywhere else in town.  CAL also does a variety of outreach and educational projects in the community in order to bring the arts to a wider audience. Lastly, the current president of CAL's board of directors is, in fact, an African American male,  and there are at least 5 other males on the board that I am aware of.  These are strange and unfounded accusations.  It seems that the reviewer may not understand that even a non-profit organization has to raise money in order to stay alive and grow.  CAL manages to bring to the community 6 stellar exhibitions of community artwork each year, a huge arts festival featuring 110 artists from all over the country, a variety of classes and educational opportunities, arts advocacy, and a whole host of other events and services, with only two full time employees and a committed team of volunteers.  If CAL doesn't sell art, solicit memberships and donations, and raise money through the occasional ticketed fundraising event, none of these contributions to the community would be possible.   For many artists in the community, the Columbia Art League is the first place they are able to step out and show their work.  I have heard several other artists comment that selling a piece out of the gallery, being recognized by an award, or just seeing their work up on a wall in a "real" gallery, has helped them to turn over a new leaf and begin to believe in themselves as artists.  In my book, that equals mission - fulfilled.
Columbia Art League	141096	1	/users/profile/187330	Art Volunteer	Volunteer	5	11/18/2012	I can't say enough good things about the Columbia Art League. I have been a regular volunteer for several years because I think it does so much to promote art in the city of Columbia,  Missouri. The previous review was a shock to me because I have never heard anyone say anything bad about the organization. By the way, the board of directors has a balance of males and females, and the president of the board is an ethnic minority. I don't know what motivated that bitter review, but I can say that it does not reflect the organization accurately. Those who read this should know that the CAL director works hard to include everyone, regardless of skill level, background or age, to participate in the art classes and exhibits. The Columbia Art League runs the biggest art event in the city, Art in the Park, attracting artists from both inside and outside the state. The Columbia Art League is a gem in this charming university town!

Veterans of Foreign Wars Foundation	99519		/users/profile/119892	justinricklefs	Client Served	5	10/20/2011	The VFW Foundation is a partner of the Kansas City Chiefs Football Club.  They have significantly enhanced and accelerated our efforts at supporting our nation's finest, our servicemen and women.  Through their Return the Favor program, Chiefs fans have been able to witness firsthand the class and dignity in which the VFW Foundation takes care of our troops.  From providing tickets to Chiefs games, to highlighting stories of active duty military around the world, they play an integral part in the way we encourage our fans to Return the Favor.  VFW Foundation has gone above and beyond as we have gone to military bases and veteran's hospitals around the region to spread goodwill and encourage the men and women in uniform.  We are eager to continue to build on the strength of our partnership in the years to come.  
Veterans of Foreign Wars Foundation	99512	1	/users/profile/119864	Stacie J.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2011	Unfortunately, many American soldiers and veterans do not have access to the financial support and essential resources they need while on active duty or when they come home. VFW Foundation realizes it is up to us to serve them when they need us the most.  Funded solely by generous and dedicated individuals and corporate sponsors, the RETURN THE FAVOR campaign, sponsored by the VFW Foundation, creates awareness for our veterans needs and financially supports programs to assist our deployed soldiers, retired military veterans and their families.  I am deeply impressed by the Foundation's dedication, compassion and perseverance to help our country's brave, selfless veterans.
Veterans of Foreign Wars Foundation	99406		/users/profile/119394	dustinkuhn25	Volunteer	5	10/18/2011	I had the opportunity to work with the Veterans of Foreign Wars Foundation on several of their military appreciation events with the Kansas City Chiefs and Michigan International Speedway. I have found their staff and board members to be extremely informative about the Return the Favor campaign and it is clear they have a true passion for supporting our military, veterans, and their families.
National Council of Jewish Women, Inc.	190051		/users/profile/248128	malps0929	Volunteer	5	12/06/2013	As a volunteer, it is amazing to know how important my role is to this organization.  They respect my time, my needs, my resources that I bring to the table, and the fact that I have knowledge outside of my area of employment.  You are treated with respect, not left to file hundreds of papers or enter countless data into a database, you are doing work that furthers the mission of the organization.  That makes me feel good.
National Council of Jewish Women, Inc.	50926	5	/users/profile/51455	marilyn7	Board Member	5	08/23/2010	I have been a board member for 3 years and a volunteer for many more.  The depth and breadth of projects on behalf of women, children and families is immense. I am actively involved in Kids Community Closet where new clothing is provided for children in several schools where the poverty level is substantial.  In addition, we continue to advocate/legislate for social justice issues that positively effect those who cannot effectivley speak for themselves.
National Council of Jewish Women, Inc.	50515	6	/users/profile/51019	karen34	Volunteer	5	08/16/2010	I've been volunteering with NCJW - St. Louis Section for over 10 years. This organization not only does great things for the community, but it also really values its volunteers. Volunteers really are the heart of the organization, making all of the programs happen. One of the things I really like is that there are so many different programs and roles needed, that when you are ready for a new challenge, there are plenty of things you can do without having to seek out a new non-profit. Recently I have been most involved in the Back to School! Store. I've done everything from shopping for clothes for the kids, co-chairing the event to developing a website for the event.
National Council of Jewish Women, Inc.	50512	6	/users/profile/51016	ellen-alper	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2010	The National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) is a grassroots organization of volunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.The St. Louis Section, founded in 1895, has operated over 100 service projects and programs throughout it's history to help women, children and families in our community.  With a small staff and a large corps of volunteers, they currently serve over 1000 children at the annual Back-To-School! Store, now in its 10th year and another several hundred children annually through Kids Community Closet.They operate lean and mean--tight budget--with tight controls on every dollar spent.  I highly recommend supporting this organization.
Gateway Festival Orchestra Of St Louis	32123	7	/users/profile/32926	gary6	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2010	This is an orchestra assembled of area professional musicians performing high quality music for the public. The programs are often based on themes and culture. Making this these programs free to the public provides people with an opportunity to hear symphonic music in a relaxed atmosphere on the campus of Washington University. Parents can bring their young children, whereas the youngest ones are not allowed in a St. Louis Symphony concert. People who might be intimidated by a more formal setting can have a chance to experience repertoire. Concerts are outdoor and people bring lawn chairs or blankets. By keeping this orchestra funded, musicians are kept employed during a very financially challenging time of year and audiences are presented live music.
Gateway Festival Orchestra Of St Louis	30285	7	/users/profile/31284	jan-scott	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2010	Orchestral music is usually presented with great formality in a lavish performance space which promotes this music as intended for the elite and sophisticated.  Not so, the summer GFO concerts in Washington University's Quad.  The power of great orchestra music is presented outside with the informality and serenity or the space a part of the listening experience.  Sandals, shorts and a lawn chair are all that is required to soak up the magic of the concerts of classical music.Special memorable performances are more unique when experienced under the stars and in stunning quietness in our bustling city.  The GFO is an excellent professional orchestra providing summer concerts of high quality performances.
Gateway Festival Orchestra Of St Louis	27649	6	/users/profile/28726	kwrtetaolcom	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	The GFO has been providing free, public concerts for over 45 years. As a child it was a chance for me to experience symphonic music in a comfortable setting with my family...that we could afford. FREE. I am now a music educator and often work with children who would not have an opportunity to go to concerts but because of the outdoor venue and cost, I encourage them to attend. They always are delighted with the concerts.
Gateway Festival Orchestra Of St Louis	26774	2	/users/profile/27780	Mike	Board Member	5	02/01/2010	I am the Secretary and Webmaster for the Board of Directors of the Gateway Festival Orchestra.  I also regularly play viola with the orchestra every season.  The organization's goal to provide professional orchestral music to the St. Louis area during the summer (when our local professional orchestra, the SLSO) has been achieved for forty-six seasons, and even through good times and hard economic times, the board and its members have worked hard to ensure that this goal is met annually.  The GFO provides orchestra concerts on Sunday evenings in July on the beautiful campus of Washington University in St. Louis, MO.  Our patrons are encouraged to come, bring a blanket or chairs, maybe a picnic or wine & cheese basket, and relax in the summer evening while our orchestra performs some of the great orchestral literature, with some popular and jazz standards occasionally thrown in!  Before each of our concerts, we provide mini-lectures and discussions relating to the concert program.  Soloists, members of the orchestra and even our music director share their thoughts and knowledge with the audience, giving them a greater insight into the music.  We also spend late spring and early summers engaging children and youth in outreach concerts and performances.  Members of our orchestra go to various schools, daycare centers and youth groups to share classical music with young people.  In recent years, with the economic downturn, we have been working diligently to increase our audience base, as well as our donor base to ensure continued seasons of great orchestral music.  Our board has been recently restructured to streamline actions taken and make things run more smoothly.  More member involvement on our board has seen more active interest in our organization's success, be it through a recently launched eNewsletter to our patrons or through seasonal letter-mailings to our donors.  Our organization's main source of income, through the Music Performance Fund (formerly the Music Performance Trust Fund) will cease to exist this year, causing us to look for newer sources of income.  While we have been unsuccessful in filling the need thus far, our board members have been searching for grants and donations high and low, filing applications with various organizations through which we are eligible.  The last few years have seen an upswing in donations, and our greatest help has been through the Roland Quest Matching grant.  We are currently on our way to meeting our fourth grant with this organization, but it is still not enough.  To combat budget constraints, we have been fortunate enough to receive assistance from friends of the orchestra, as well as other organizations (such as the Boy Scouts of America) in helping run several concert-time endeavors (such as stage management, program disbursement and concessions).  My personal belief in helping our organization grow financially is that we find ways to engage our patrons during the off-season, or autumn, winter and spring months.  As a board member, I am aware of several possible actions we could take that have been in discussion, but we are yet to take steps to see that they are done.  I look forward to seeing them organized and planned soon!This organization is truly a blessing for the St. Louis area.  No other professional orchestra is performing regularly during this time of the year, and it is my hope that we could find funding to perform more concerts than we do now (from early June to mid August), with a stronger rehearsal schedule.  This takes money, of course, but it is my personal goal for the orchestra, and one I hope to see happen in the next decade.
HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program	322283		/users/profile/411583	Laurie102	General Member of the Public	5	01/28/2017	As the host of Talk of the Town, a Public Affairs show that airs on 3 different radio stations in St. Louis, MO, I'm always looking for new & different non-profits. I found that with HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program. Karen Kalish was a breath of fresh air & is passionate about her program & all of the people working in it plus it's obvious that what they're doing works. Big thanks to Great NonProfits for having this organization in their listing!
HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program	195129		/users/profile/255053	pstieple	Client Served	5	03/03/2014	February 16, 2014 Dear Karen: I am pleased to write this letter of support of HOME WORKS! The Columbia Public Schools has been participating in parent engagement strategies for a long time, but it wasnt until we connected with your organization that we felt we had a focused plan for connecting with families. The Columbia Public School District has seen rates of poverty increase considerably over the last 10 years. Over that period of time the percentage of students qualifying for free/reduced lunch has climbed from 25% to 46%. The number of English Language Learners has climbed from 450 four years ago to 990 this school year. We are a community that is urbanizing at a staggering rate and it is going to take two-way, parent and school engagement in order to give our children the very best chance for success.    During this past year, two of our low performing, high poverty elementary schools began participating in HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program. Teachers attended the high-level trainings before setting out in pairs to conduct home visits. The relationship with families was strengthened by the two family dinners hosted at the school by the teachers and the principal. Your program promised we would see improvements in both attendance and discipline. And we have. We are all working hard to be allies for Missouris children. What will matter for a child from Poplar Bluff and Cape Girardeau and Independence is that we strive to remove barriers and improve communication with families. We believe that HOME WORKS! will reduce opportunity gaps (attendance and discipline), close enrichment gaps (access to college and career coursework), and give us a better tool for achieving our ultimate legacy  the elimination of academic achievement gaps. I can be reached at 573-214-3400 or pstieple@columbia.k12.mo.us should you have other leaders interested in talking more about HOME WORKS!  Sincerely,   Peter StieplemanAssistant Superintendent for Elementary EducationColumbia, MO
HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program	189400		/users/profile/247243	Amy Murphy	Board Member	5	11/27/2013	I have been associated with Home Works! from its inception and continue to serve on the Board because the program has transformed the lives of the students, teachers and families it has touched.  Many of the parents visited had negative school experiences and don't know how to change that dynamic for their own children.  The teachers trained by Home Works! help a family's adults understand their importance in their child's educational success. As a team, the adults in a child's life can make day in and day out decisions that make all the difference for the child's sustained success.  Home Works! works.  
HOME WORKS! The Teacher Home Visit Program	189273		/users/profile/247000	Gay G.	General Member of the Public	5	11/25/2013	I am thrilled to donate to this organization.  It is the only program I know of that is working on parent engagement and getting parents to read and talk to their children every day.  Their results are very exciting.  I know it's going to take a long time to change parent behavior and increase academics for kids but this organization is starting the ball rolling. Please consider supporting this organization
Guardian Oak Growth by Giving Assc.	305885		/users/profile/397157	stormychica	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	Horses have always been a big part of my life, when I moved away from home for school, I lost a lot of my time with horses. Guardian Oak has become a place I can go to relax, to free my mind. I am 3 hours from my own horses, but Guardian Oak is just down the road from me. When my family comes to visit, we go out there as well. It is a family friendly place where we can all get hands on with a horse, no matter the size, all while we get to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.

What a wonderful place. Their community is lucky to have Guardian Oaks. They encourage community involvement. We need more rescue like this that put their heart and soul for a worthy cause.  
Guardian Oak Growth by Giving Assc.	305252		/users/profile/396496	Kimberly152	Board Member	5	09/17/2016	What an amazing organization to have in this area!  GO has helped so many animals; and, two of those amazing animals have landed safely with us.  RD, a white mammoth Donkey, immediately fit in with the rest of our herd; and, Lefty Louie, an injured homeless young cat who has received the surgery that he needed and is now safe.  Who knows what would have happened to these two sweet animals if it wasn't for GO.  I know these animals are so grateful to be given a chance; not to mention how grateful we are to be given the chance to meet and fall in love with these two.   Since then we have tried to become involved in ensuring that this organization continues to grow so that more of these amazing animals can be safe and healthy. 
Guardian Oak Growth by Giving Assc.	305242		/users/profile/396489	Tori8	Volunteer	5	09/17/2016	Love being in nature and for me it is very therapeutic. Being around some of the rescues who have very heartbreaking stories and being trusted by them also helps with my confidence. Love being at GO. Can't wait for my twins to be old enough to be active volunteers!! 
Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc	149572	1	/users/profile/199386	sherutim	General Member of the Public	1	02/18/2013	The CEF seeks to infiltrate the public schools in order to indoctrinate small children with the viewpoint that their fundamentalist Christian principles and dogma are the only truth. They operate so-called Good News Clubs whose mission is to convert the children to their religious dogma and use them as a cadre to induct other children (and even their parents) into their circle. Their message to the children is that any other religious beliefs (or none) will bring down the wrath of God on them, their families, and their friends.  They bring adult leaders (armed with cookies, candy, and balloons) into elementary and middle school classrooms immediately following the school day and engage the children in Christian-based activities.  To the children, the adult leaders are indistinguishable from their teachers, giving them the same mantle of authority for everything they say. The schools are virtually powerless to resist this invasion because of a bizarre 2001 Supreme Court ruling (Good News Club v. Milford Central School) which, stated simply, their practice of religion was merely free speech of a "viewpoint" and thereby protected by the 1st Amendment "free speech" clause. Their activity has divided and destroyed communities, schools, even families. The complete story is extensively documented in a book entitled "The Good News Clubs", by Katherine Stewart.
Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc	119830		/users/profile/162894	Psalm66	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/01/2012	I noticed that the review of CEF had a negative mark for "Process for determining CEO compensation". Did you know the reason for this? The reason is that the CEO serves as a volunteer - without salary compensation. What appears to be a negative is actually a strong positive!
Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc	86211		/users/profile/96413	Jeff Boodle	Donor	5	04/18/2011	Child Evangelism Fellowship shares the Good News of Salvation through Jesus to thousands upon thousands of children around the world- each year.  Many organizations make current living conditions better for children- Child Evangelism Fellowship offers an eternal difference!  I know of no other missions organization that sees more people brought to salvation each year than CEF. 
Habitat For Humanity Kansas City ReStore	109935	1	/users/profile/149739	Mary77	Volunteer	5	04/16/2012	I was a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity KC for a short time.  It was only a short time due to first to knee problems and then becoming employed again full-time.  But I truly enjoyed my volunteer time with this organization!  They are a great group and they try to have a good time when working.  Everyone is - at a minimum - pleasant; always smiling and very appreciative of the time you dedicate to them.  They were also very flexible with that time.  When I return to the KC area, I will definitely visit them for more volunteer opportunities!!
Habitat For Humanity Kansas City ReStore	109896	1	/users/profile/149680	David76	Volunteer	5	04/15/2012	A truly satistying experience. A great cause, supportive and accomodating staff; a diverse, interesting and appreciative customer base. Every shift is different, fun and rewarding. I feel useful, appreciated by staff and customers many who greet me by name and "thank you's" are common. Best volunteer experience of my retirement. Looking forward to a continued relationship after almost [I'm told by those who track these things] 1000 hours of volunteering!
Habitat For Humanity Kansas City ReStore	109876	1	/users/profile/149655	Heidi S.	Volunteer	5	04/14/2012	I was a volunteer with ReStore for over 5 years.  I had a wonderful experience there.  I was made to feel like I was an important part of the team and given the training and assistance to enable me to do the work asked of me.    The organization is great a recognizing and thanking their volunteers.  I will be back as a volunteer again. 
LIFEWATERS	310955		/users/profile/402292	marcyharold	Volunteer	5	10/15/2016	I had the privilege of diving with the Lifewaters group in the Cayman Islands and wow, what a fantastic experience. This organization opens up the world of scuba diving to those who may not thought it possible. Being able to support the adaptive divers so they had the best experience possible was very rewarding.  I am honored and humbled to dive with Lifewaters. 
LIFEWATERS	302845		/users/profile/393995	jillknapp60	Volunteer	5	09/07/2016	This is a wonderful nonprofit organization providing SDI scuba diving training to both the disabled divers and their buddies so that they can participate in one of the sponsored dive trips through this group.  I've had the opportunity to assist with training their Dive Masters and Dive Instructors as well as participate in the 2015 and 2016 trips to Cozumel.  Awesome experience for both the buddies and the divers that participated!  Anyone who is disabled, especially Vets who are spinal cord injured, this is the group for you!  Please contact them. 
LIFEWATERS	297863		/users/profile/388680	Jessi H.	Client Served	5	07/24/2016	Peaceful, serene, other worldy. You know, all those clich terms people throw around. They are all true and yet do not begin to describe the experience I had SCUBA diving. Over the last few years I have had the great privilege to become part of the Lifewaters family. Trained by and then finally christened on my first ocean dive during the summer of 2013.  Yes, I said family.  It is a group of individuals from all over the country and yet it feels like family. All abilities, all backgrounds, all ages. Most people would look at Lifewaters and think, They are doing something great, something amazing, helping people learn adaptive diving. Giving people that freedom in the water. Yes, that is very true and very important. I get it, Im an adaptive diver and being 60 feet under swimming along with the sea turtles and fish, f-r-e-e-d-o-m. However, to me that is not the greatest gift Lifewaters is giving. If you sit back and watch during an ocean dive, you see a group of people who probably just met working as a team. Learning about each others abilities and weaknesses and letting community and the ocean heal whatever is burdening them. They may not recognize it right away, but it is happening. That is such an amazing thing. Even more amazing is to watch that phenomena happening between a group of Veterans. Veterans from different branches, different eras, and of different abilities. As the wife of a USAF Veteran I was touched to see that bond surface and to see how during the dive and since the dive those Veterans have inspired, encouraged, and challenged my husband. Even if we were never given the chance to dive with those individuals again I truly believe we would continue to remain friends, to share life together.Diving is so much more than being blown away by the majesty of the underwater world. Its about bonds, friendship, teamwork. Its about remembering that we need each other and can be healed by nature and by the community of people around us. This is the gift that Lifewaters gives.
Kids Across America Foundation	161446	2	/users/profile/214109	Tiffany14	Volunteer	5	06/25/2013	I have 3 daughters 16,15 & 11 and they absolutely LOVE KAA & HG (Kids Across America & Higher Ground) the teens have been for the last 4 yrs & the 11 yr old has been twice. My girls have grown in Christ by leaps & bounds. Their prayer life gets better every year that they go. They have a better understanding of God's will & His word. The have embraced service to others & have gotten awesome leadership skills. KAA/HG is a safe place where kids are free to praise & worship God in their own way with their peers & celebrate and not be ashamed of their love of God. My kids have embraced one of the main principles taught at KAA which is "God first, others second & I am third." I can only say I had a true mountain-top experience there in which I felt the presence of God in a way that I have never felt before so much so that it is a little hard to come back down off that  mountain & get back to the "real world" but what I learned & experienced there has equipped me & encouraged me to bring that spirit of God back home to let His light shine in me. I would encourage you to see for yourself what KAA/HG has to offer for adults, but especially youth because words can not do it justice.
Kids Across America Foundation	161284		/users/profile/213869	Kesha T.	Volunteer	5	06/24/2013	Loved this camp! The reason I know so much about Christ and how to be a servant is because of KAA! I was exposed to so much that has shaped me to the person I am today. I also met awesome people that I still talk to today (5 years later). KAA is the best thing that has happened to me! KAA...YOU KNOW!
Kids Across America Foundation	161230		/users/profile/213794	greggbettis51	Donor	5	06/22/2013	Truly a premiere sports camp for urban youth and their mentors!  Love their Vision: To transform urban youth to impact their communities for Christ; and their Mission: To Build Christian Leaders by encouraging equipping and empowering urban youth and their mentors through camping and education!  All of their camps and leadership training programs are Outstanding! They offer some 35 exciting activities and sports. KAA1 is an incredible camp for 9-12 year olds;  KAA2 is an amazing camp for 13-15 year olds;  KAA3 is an awesome "extreme" camp for 16-19 year olds; KAA Kaleo Camp is the greatest resource under the sun for urban group leaders and their KAA Higher Ground Leadership training camp program is directed by one of the most respected urban leadership training directors in the nation!!
Feed My People	57491	1	/users/profile/60772	gtw5	Volunteer	5	11/20/2010	I have volunteered in the food pantry at Feed My People for more than two years.  I have seen the way Feed My People meets the needs of people in Jefferson County by providing healthy food on a regular basis, supporting those looking for jobs, and giving helpful advice as needed.  I have also witnessed the support of local churches, schools and the business community who provide items necessary to meet the increased demands of people who are hungry and in need. 
Feed My People	56935		/users/profile/59699	ceilpie	Volunteer	5	11/14/2010	As a recently retired volunteer, it has been great learning about the work done by Feed My People.  This organization has excellent links to the community which helps to provide the resources gathered for the "people" that are the heart of the mission for Feed My People.  They are able to provide emergeny help every day, but continue to work with the families to help them achieve long-term stability.  Many of the volunteers are in fact ex-clients, putting into practice what they learned at Feed My People, that we all need to care for each other and share what we have.  
Feed My People	56659		/users/profile/59301	Carole	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	     I have volunteered in the food pantry at Feed My People for a few years since I retired from teaching.  The number of people needing food assistance has grown a great deal since I started.  We used to finish at around 12:30 PM and now it is around 2:00 Pm although another day was added to the food distribution schedule.       It is so heartwarming to get in donations of food from people and organizations.  You should hear the cheers from our Tuesday bunch of workers when we get cereal, or how greatful we are to get meat, eggs,  milk or produce from the grocery stores.    I wish to thank those individuals, organizations, stores, and businesses who donate.  I see the look in the peoples eyes and the smiles on their faces when I deliver a basket to them.  I wish you could see it too, because it is your caring that has put the smile there.

JOYCE MEYER MINISTRIES INC	245161	2	/users/profile/332271	ChristianDonor	Donor	5	06/12/2015	JMM does a great deal of valuable work world-wide, and when I was a contributor to this organization, I received reports of where the money went along with amounts spent for overhead.  Although the other reviewer criticizes (without providing supporting documentation) the use of a corporate jet, this person should also consider the issues involved with travel on commercial airlines.  As a business flyer, I cannot tell you how many times I have had to re-schedule meetings due to airline issues.  As a public speaker with thousands of people waiting for each appearance, Joyce Meyer does not really have the luxury of saying "oops - the airline bumped me, guess I won't be there."  This ministry has made a positive difference in my life and in the lives of people world-wide.  The recordings of those public appearances (most of which are free to attendees) offer hope and direction to a struggling world.  I stopped donating to this ministry for financial reasons, but still receive their monthly magazine and occasional free offers even though I no longer send any money to support them.

Costs just to operate these jets are in the thousands of dollars per hour of flight time in addition to their purchase price which for a jet like Joyces is in the 20 to 25 million dollar range.  The Bible tells us to shed our worldly belongings and follow Him.  Joyce should reread that section.  Joyce, fly commercial and feed tens of thousands of children every year.

It is amazing how much what they have accomplished in the past 20 years in rural Nicaragua.  Seeing the pictures of those lives being changed and the stories of lives changed with so little, just amazes me.   I definitely recommend anyone that wants to be a part of changing lives (not only others but yours too) go on one of their trips to see the works of Rainbow Network in action.

Through letters to and from her and a mission trip there and meeting her in person, I have been blessed by God's love over and over.  Knowing I have helped someone receive an education has enriched my life as well as hers.  Rainbow Network is an organization like none other; I thank them for what they do.  Now, I am starting the same experience with another student in the same area. I hope to begin communication with him soon.  With God's guidance, my life and his will be rewarding.

No doubt God sent Leanne & him to Europe as they have a big and warm heart for this continent ... the same is true for his family as they stay faithfully very close together.  Personally, it is an honour to have Leanne & him as my friends and a real brother & sister in whom I can trust in good times as well as during my struggles.  I love him as a leader and a mentor who sets, keeps, and doesn't extinguish fire and life in a person.  Deep LIFE  diving together with him and Leanne, far beneath the knowledge of mind ... but into the humble understanding of heart is blessing, pleasure, adventure for me;  and always means meeting the Lord's heart.

Started with Basic Observing class, I got used to the Astro-terms very quickly. This organization has lot of resources forthe members to use. To begin with the club has a wonderful observatory site on the western outskirts of St Louis, and some good telescopes - 10" and 16" ones.With 32" already under way and equipments to do astrophotography, this club offers ample opportunities to grow as a amateur astronomer. The club is headed by Jim Roe and is supported by many others who are well-learntand well experienced in this field. When I joined the club, all the members warmly welcomed me and allowed me to learn at my own pace. There are monthly meetings which are very useful in keeping abreast of latest happenings in the nightskies, many community outreach activities like volunteering for scouts, schools, etc.The club also undertakes special class like the recent beginning digital imaging.The members of this club comprises astronomers with different knowledge and skillsets,from mere observers to beginner telescope users and advanced astronomers who work ondeep sky astrophotography. Anyone involving with this group will amply benefit from the members' experience and resources this club has to offer.

The members were very inclusive and outgoing. Most have a great deal more knowledge and experience than I and were very willing to share what they knew.Then I found out about their outreach activities and I became involved as well. Our group, with the leadership and boundless energy and enthusiasm of Jim Roe, has developed an Astronomy outreach program and viewing site unsurpassed in the state.Every Friday night, the group hosts outreach events at Broemmelsiek Park in West Central St. Charles County. This section of the park was specifically developed for Astronomy purposes. At the moment, it houses a 10" F10 Schmidt and a 16" F5 AltAz reflector. Soon, it will hold a 32" AltAz reflector. Additionally, there are 9 concrete pads with electrical service as well as drinking fountains and a restroom. This park is the only park open 24/7 in St. Charles. Again, Jim Roe was instrumental in the creation, design and implementation of this wonderful resource.I certainly would be a lesser person for not knowing Jim and the rest of the members of ASEM and the Alliance for Astronomy organizations.

It has been a rewarding experience for me, to see the smiles on the faces of the children receiving brand new shoes, that they pick out of  the local shoe stores. Some children 2000 Feet, Inc. have served, walked around with holes in the only pair of shoes they have.  Thank God 2000 Feet, Inc. step in on time to make a difference in their lives. I love it!

Children are faced with so many challenges today, social and economic, 2000 Feet, Inc.,  helps erase some of the stigma they may feel by not having the economic means to purchase shoes for the new school year.  Who would not like a pair of shoes that fits well so you can run and play and keep your feet dry and not be constantly reminded that your toes are cramped or that your feet are wet because you have holes in your shoes.     The reason I am a donor is I can see the difference my contribution can make and how dedicated 2000 Feet, Inc., is to the local communities as well as areas that have suffered economic distress due to Mother Nature, earthquakes, hurricans, etc.  A teacher contacted 2000 Feet, Inc., about a young student who needed a new pair of shoes.  The letter the student wrote back thanking 2000 Feet, Inc., for his new shoes was so thankful and appreciative.  But his most awsome words were about his desire to give back to others. There are so many  situations where just a little support and kindess can change the life and spirit of a child.

They feed and rescue dogs in the greatest need in the St Louis area from extreme situations and provide the best medical care, rehabilitation and foster homes available so that every dog can have the wonderful life that they fully deserve.  Stray Rescue uses professional dog trainer/behavioralist evaluation of dogs before they are adopted into their permanent homes and every dog has the opportunity to demonstrate the amazing power of their canine resilience.  Stray rescue depends largely on dedicated volunteers who give of their best to the animals.  St. Louis is incredibly lucky to have Stray Rescue and it's professional staff as well as the devoted volunteers who give innocent animals compassion and care.

Friends Of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge	286559		/users/profile/376629	Robbie_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I first heard about Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge while on vacation in July 2014.  I immediately started looking into the place and booked a suite during Veterans day weekend.   The staff was very knowledgeable and told stories about how each cat was rescued from deplorable conditions.  What impressed me the most was that they were working so hard to get all of the animals out of small concrete floored cages and into large grassy habitats where they could run and play and enjoy life.  At that time there were still a few animals in the small cages and you could definitely tell the difference in the demeanor of the cats in cages and the ones in habitats. Thor the lion was still on concrete during my first visit. His feet were sore because his foot pads were cracked from walking on cold, dry concrete, and it took him a long time to get up and moving.  It broke my heart to see how pitiful his condition was. The staff would put Vaseline on the concrete in hoping he would walk in it and get some relief.  When I returned in May 2015, Thor was in a habitat and thriving. He was running around and playing and appeared to be actually enjoying life.  It was during my second trip that I met Duke.  He is a very large tiger and was in Thors old concrete cage. It was so sad to see him pace back and forth in such a tiny cage. I was so excited for him when he was released into his habitat a few months later.  I recently returned in October 2015 and all animals were in habitats and the concrete cages were gone.  The staff talked about how excited they were to be building more habitats so they could rescue more animals, and that no more animals would be housed in tiny cages without grass and room to run.  I saw Duke and he looked so happy lying in the grass. All of the animals look happy, and they appear to really enjoy the staff and interns.  I never saw a staff member or intern who did not seem to be thoroughly enjoying their job.  I believe TCWR is the best place a captive animal could hope for.  They strive to make sure that all of the animals are fed, medicated, entertained, and are living the most comfortable life possible and in a forever home.  I will be making at least yearly trips (five hours for me) to stay a weekend at TCWR.  I tell all of my friends about them.  TCWR is my Amazon Smile charity and I ask all my friends and colleagues to use Amazon Smile also.  As long as TCWR is rescuing and providing excellent care and forever homes for these majestic animals, I will continue to give as much as I can, as often as I can, to their mission.  As long as they truly care about the animals in their care and constantly strive to improve; and because they use all donations to help the animals, Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge will be my charity of choice. 
Friends Of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge	286558		/users/profile/376628	Nancy_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	#MyGivingStory about www.turpentinecreek.orgTurpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge located in Eureka Springs, AR. Turpentine Creek rescues Tigers, Lions, Cougars, Bobcats, Black Bears, a Grizzly and other assorted creatures that come from private homes and facilities that can no longer take care of these beautiful creatures.My husband and I were struggling financially, my husband needed a second job. Scott Smith hired him to drive the tour trolley, he has many skills but was grateful to have this job. This blessing of a job helped us make ends that were far from being met, to being met. About 6 months after my husband started working at TCWR they got a call that turned out to be their biggest rescue ever. A woman in Mountainburg, AR had a very large collection of Tigers in very poor conditions and, as we found out later, very poor health. My husband and I went from being grateful for this income, to having hearts sold out to helping these magnificent creatures. In order to rescue all 28 cats, that were eventually transported to TCWR, homes needed to be built for them. My husband took his vacation from his full time job and helped weld homes for them on Rescue Ridge, the new area for these new residents. We saw some very sick animals come to Turpentine Creek and we wished we could help financially but we were barely getting by. I volunteered time in the office while my husband worked but we wanted to do more. Specially for the ones needing extra healthcare.Today, if one of the animals is sick and they can not be treated on site they need to be anesthsised, transported to the vet (about 40 miles away) kept under anesthsia while being treated and then while being transported back. A very serious situation for the animal, as well as staff. It's always been a dream at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge to build an onsite Vetinary Hospital. Something my husband and I wished we could make happen. Something that seemed totally out of reach but very necessary.In April of 2014 my husband and I were blessed with a very big windfall and one of the first things we did was make a very large donation towards building the Vet Hospital at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. A campaign kicked off and all the money for the building has been raised but what good will the building be with no equipment? So now there is a big need-some $150,000 or so to equip the Vetinary Hospital-I believe about a third has been raised so far. It would be such a blessing to have this project completely funded. Building has begun on the Vetinary Hospital, we feel so blessed to have been able to help build the Hospital, won't you please help fully fund it? BamBam, the Grizzly, Duke, one of the Tigers, Elvis, one of the Bobcats, and all the other 100 or so residents of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge would be so grateful...we humans would be pretty thrilled too!
Friends Of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge	286557		/users/profile/376627	Michael_F	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Turpentine Creek Animal RefugeWhile vacationing in Eureka Springs, Arkansas a few years ago we saw a sign for Turpentine Creek Animal Refuge with pictures of Tigers. We, being cat lovers, decided to visit the refuge and see all the big cats. What was a tourist activity became much more. It became a learning experience when we took the tour they offer a couple of times daily. We were amazed to learn just how many big cats are in the hands of private owners. The regulations vary from state to state if there are any regulations at all. The thought that their could be a full grown tiger in the basement of your neighbors house was hard to believe but it is true. We learned that there are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild. The big problem here is proper care. Most people who own one or more of these big cats are ill prepared to care for them. That included diet, medical, and habitat. The tour guides at Turpentine Creek can give you the back stories on all of the animals now in their care. These stories are pretty sad, often tragic. It would have been unbearable for us to hear these stories if not for the fact that now these cats have been taken in and cared for by the folks at Turpentine Creek. This is a very costly operation and this is a worthy cause to support. Some contributors make big donations others like ourselves are very modest donations, but all are welcome. Our first move was to adopt a tiger named Tami and we pay $150 a year which goes directly to the care of Tami. We now make several trips to Turpentine Creek every year and we have taken bowling pins, boxes, and other items for the enrichment of these cats. We occasionally will send other modest monetary donations. We love this place and we love all the cats. They also have bears, lions, leopards, bobcats, cougars and a duck that just wandered in a stayed without going through any formal adoption. I like to say that duck just kind of slipped through the quacks.

The organization seemed nice enough, so I was a casual donor for a while. By 2009, the organization's Executive Director, Christen Parker, invited me and my socially-conscious friend to travel to Haiti with her to chronicle the progress of MPM Haiti programs. The group that I travelled with to Haiti in 2009 saw the good that's done firsthand, and we have since established a more formal Board of Directors. I am currently the Communications Director, and am highly involved in the coordination of philanthropic aid to deserving Haitian individuals and families.
Moun Pou Moun Haiti	27675	1	/users/profile/28757	rodney1	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	I am the co-founder of Moun Pou Moun Haiti. Moun Pou Moun means "people for people" and "person by person" in Haitian Kreyol. We started this organization 5 years ago as a way to foster relationships formed in Haiti during a 10-week international rotation I had in my 4th year of medical school. Over the years our group has sponsored on average about 25 children and adults in school, built a home for a needy family, and provided food and financial relief for our families when it was needed. More recently, we've dispensed 2 microcredit loans with the intent to build a microcredit community in support of more loans. We spent a week in Port au Prince shortly after the earthquake at the UN hospital provided medical relief. We hope to be instrumental in obtaining prosthetics for amputees. We're busy! And, we're proud to say that 100% of donations go to Haiti for work there. Our Haiti coordinator, Samuel (a Haitian), has proven to be honorable, hard working, and an impeccable steward of our funds. He oversees our work there and serves as guide for future projects. We hope to get him a visa to come to the US to raise awareness of Haiti and our work together. Please visit our website www.mpmhaiti.org - and feel free to find our emails there to ask questions or provide feedback. We'd enjoy hearing from you! And, if you're impressed by what you see, we'd appreciate your donations, as well.Sincerely,Rodney Yarnal, MD Co-founder and Board MemberMoun Pou Moun Haiti

St. Louis Crisis Nursery	145891	3	/users/profile/192488	plasteringandtuckpointing	General Member of the Public	5	12/04/2012	I have a family member that uses this organization regularly and they are a gift from GOD to her and to the children she has and to my own family.  I would love to be able to help her out more often but unfortunately I can't-health problems get in my way.  I do not know what she would have done had the Crisis Nursery not been able to assist her.
St. Louis Crisis Nursery	128309	1	/users/profile/173461	CAMc	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	I have volunteered with this organization for six years.  I was first drawn to the Crisis Nursery because of its mission: to prevent child abuse and neglect by providing temporary shelter for children whose families are in crisis.  (Preventing child abuse "breaks the cycle" of abuse, since children who are not abused are less likely to become abusers themselves.)  I like the fact that the Nursery, now in its 26th year, uses funds effectively and efficiently, staffing five locations 24/7, 365 days/yr, serving the entire St. Louis and St. Charles County areas.  The staff helps families resolve crises and keep families together.  I have met young mothers in the community who, when they find out that I volunteer with the Crisis Nursery,  tell me they are grateful for the support of the Nursery when they needed help.  These women are now employed, some attending school, and successfully caring for their children.  They are also "paying it forward", trying to help others.   When I first became a volunteer with the Crisis Nursery, a staff member related a story to me that really demonstrated the effect that the Nursery has on the lives of children in our community.  During introductions at one of the new volunteer orientation meetings, a young woman (a new volunteer) told the group that, at a young age, she had been a "child in the Nursery".  As the Volunteer Coordinator gave the group a tour of the Nursery, the young woman looked around and observed, "it looks different, but it feels the same."   This is just one example of how the Crisis Nursery impacts and changes lives, not just today, but for future generations of parents.

Doulos Ministries Inc	199264	1	/users/profile/260161	wisey3.dw	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/29/2014	   I cannot imagine how tough it would be to send my child to an organization for a long period of time and trust that they have yours, and your child's, best interest at heart. Shelterwood is an organization that truly does love and care for their clients. There are many, many examples, all over the country of people that have had life changing experiences through Shelterwood. The organization, from top to bottom, has the parents and adolescents growth and well being as their most important goal.    I worked at Shelterwood in Denver from December, 2001 until May, 2005. My time there cannot be understated. I grew as a person in every area of life. And this can be attributed to the love and care of the staff as a whole, from Richard Beach to the teens that were there during my time.    The growth of the relationship between parents and child was behind every decision that was made. I understand that due to the number of families that come through the program not every client will be completely 100% satisfied. There will be mistakes and people learn from them. We all experience growth and change through mistakes that we make in life. This is an important part of the Shelterwood  philosophy. God uses these decisions we have made and turns them into good. Shelterwood is no different.    In my experience, the staff is completely dedicated to growth of the parents, teens, and the big brothers and sisters. I would not hesitate, if the situation ever arose, to send my own child to this caring organization.    
Doulos Ministries Inc	198829	3	/users/profile/259626	Pprewitt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/24/2014	It is a difficult thing to leave your struggling teenager at a facility for treatment for 7-12 months. As a professional that has referred families to Shelterwood, I have seen them time and time again guide the teen and parents through this difficult transition and help all members of the family change. Parents struggle oftentimes with letting go of their vision of how their son or daughter should move forward and the Shelterwood staff does an excellent job of helping them see that their vision may not be what is best for the teen or God's plan. Some parents struggle with this more than others and the staff have  repeatedly modeled boundaries with love for these struggling parents. Knowing the counseling staff personally and professionally has shown me that they are committed to care of the teens that have been entrusted to their program. Treatment plans are tailored to their individual needs and they are paired with post college aged mentors that have an equally committed heart to service of these teens and families. Treatment includes "family weekends" where family members join therapy sessions and have to confront their own contributions to the family struggles. These conversations can be especially challenging for parents but can radically transform the family dynamic.The staff work long hours in service for these families and are generally underpaid in comparison to industry rates of private practice, agency work, and administrative capacities. They continue their hard work because they believe that what they do has rewards beyond monetary compensation. 
Doulos Ministries Inc	196753		/users/profile/257167	loricburgan	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/30/2014	Shelterwood is an example of a Christian nonprofit agency that had a genuine desire to help troubled teens when it was founded over thirty years ago, but has lost its integrity with a change of leadership in the past three years when they moved operations to Missouri.  The system of Big Brothers and Sisters continues to be the heart and soul of the program, and the school is staffed by well-qualified and compassionate teachers, but the leadership and clinical teams are totally lacking in authenticity and transparency.  Initially, I chose to believe that the CEO and Director were well-intentioned but lacking in ability, but I have come to believe that they are driven by greed, putting the desire to make money above the best interests of the teens and parents who have put their trust in them.  Many good things are done at Shelterwood and some hearts are changed because of the relationships established with the devoted Bigs and teachers.  But these efforts are hindered by arrogant and unresponsive leaders and counselors.  Examples of the lack of authenticity on the part of the leadership and clinical teams include:  According to IRS Form 990 for 2013 (available at guidestar.org), Shelterwood had a SURPLUS of revenue over expenses of $1,290,726 in 2012!  (Revenue was $5,534,345 and expenses were $4,243,619).  I have worked in nonprofit management for over 30 years, and have never seen an agency with anywhere close to almost a 25% annual surplus.  Parents are so desperate to get help for their struggling teens that many take out second mortgages or drain their retirement funds to afford the $4500/month expense.  An agency truly committed to helping families would use this profit to reduce the high cost of services. While Shelterwood leadership talk a lot about how much they help families who cant afford this costly service, they only gave scholarships to 15 families in 2012 at a total amount of $87,468 ($5,831 per family).  The devoted Big Brothers and Sisters who are with the teens 24/7 make $12,000/year, while the CEOs total compensation in 2012 was $170,901 and the Shelterwood Directors compensation was $99,927.  This salary is way out of line for someone running a $5.5 million nonprofit in the Midwest.  (As a point of reference, according to IRS 990 forms, the Executive Director of a similar program in Texas, Heartlight, made $46,550 in 2011, and Heartlight had a surplus of revenue over expenses of $180,000).  One of the expense line items for Shelterwood in 2012 was a $100,000 payment for settlement of a claim.   Some of the Shelterwood counselors are young and inexperienced.  It is not uncommon for 17 and 18 years old males to be paired with a female counselor in her twenties who has no experience or competence in working with adolescent male issues such as addiction and defiance.  In essence, many teens are used as guinea pigs to help counselors new to the field gain experience.  Rather than embrace and appreciate the great work of the Bigs, the counselors look down on them.  The Director of Counseling made several derogatory comments directly to me about one of Shelterwoods most loved and effective Bigs. Many promises are made at intake about the level and types of care that will be provided that are ignored as soon as the teen is placed.  When questioned, the typical response by the counselors and leaders is to just trust the process.  Despite the fact that the leadership espouses a philosophy of family healing and parental involvement, parents who have concerns are basically told that their choice is to follow everything the counselors want to do without question, or pull your teen.  This poses an unnecessary dilemma when the teen has already invested time in the program and doesnt want to start over at a new program. Leadership sometimes resorts to unethical scare tactics to get you to keep your teen at Shelterwood. Less than a third of teens actually graduate from the Shelterwood program, with an average time to graduate of about eleven months.  I pointed out to the CEO that this graduation rate was really low (I was originally recruited by the CEO to do pro bono fundraising).  Rather than invest the time in making critical program changes to enhance the graduation rate, the CEO instead developed a new classification in which he now claims that 65% of teens complete the program.  So now, any teen that leaves after making any type of progress is considered by the CEO to have completed the program.  Considering that five stages have to be completed before a teen can graduate, it is misleading to tell prospective parents or funders that the program completion rate is 65%.  While many teens who graduate from the program truly have worked hard and have made critical heart changes, other graduation decisions are too subjective, based on who the counselors like and who is best at playing the game.     The Board of Directors appears to be part of the good old boy network, and have no interest in helping Shelterwood return to its days of authenticity and transparency.  I sent a certified letter to every Board member asking them to address these concerns.  My intent, according to Biblical directive (Matthew 18:15-17), was to deal with these grievances through the proper channels internally.  The Board provided no response to my letter, even though I explained that I was willing to take my concerns public if I didnt hear back from them.   This is just a sampling of the ethical and clinical problems running rampant at Shelterwood. The bottom line is that too many people treat Shelterwood as a sacred cow, choosing to blindly trust the leaderships authority.   We need to always remember that God  not Shelterwood  is the true authority.  I do not believe there is any way that the practices outlined above are part of Gods will. Unless new, authentic leaders are brought in, I would NOT recommend sending your troubled teen to Shelterwood.

Wyman Center, Inc.	4442	21	/users/profile/6156	Appreciative	Client Served	5	05/02/2009	I'm very grateful to have experienced the entire Wyman Center Inc. Teen Leadership Program.  As a parent of one of the teens Wyman has included me, made me feel important and also has educated me on how to raise and listen to my daughter.  Our relationship has grown tremendously and we actually can laugh at our not so happy moments withought the attitudes.  I can see the growth the program has had on my daugher as well as myself.  Since our family was broken up early in my daughters life due to my divorce, it wasn't expected for her to accomplish much due to the rough start.  Thanks to programs like Wyman where it doesn't matter where you started just that you have a willing and cooperative desire anything is possible.  This is my daughter's last year with the program and I mean she has traveled to places we never would have been able to afford, she has been exposed to the environment:  surviving outside and the awareness of trees, plants, birds,etc., met people that have really helped her along the way - the staff is OUTSTANDING, developed relationships with other teens and the list continues to grow on and on.  The program encourages her to do good in School, Home and the Community.  Thank you for this opportunity to share a few words of appreciation.

All New Hope Animal Rescue Llc	299081	4	/users/profile/389973	h8badrescues	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/03/2016	This charity operated for 3 YEARS at PetsMart without a 501 C3 certification. During this time the Founder openly told her volunteers she filed her personal income taxes and took a 70K "Business loss" each year. Because of this, the Charitable section of the IRS refused to give her a number till she re-filed her personal income taxes. She refused to because your charitable tax deduction is NOT a $ for $ donation, as a business loss is. She then defrauded a charity that was going inactive to get them to sell/give them their number to use. During her entire first 3 years, she only accepted CASH or had people pay her vet directly to hide cash. I personally witnessed her refusing to give her volunteers donation receipts for the money they spent of materials for the dogs, which is tax deductible. In one case she had a woman make several $500 donations to her vet bill and told the woman "she couldn't prove she EVER made a donation to her"! To the day of this review, she STILL accepts cash ONLY and pockets it herself, even after an accountant specializing in charity 990 Forms and issues , told her she must never take cash for adoptions. This woman does only puppies and takes some of the momma dogs, but she repeatedly has been caught dumping the momma dogs at KILL SHELTERS if they don't sell quickly enough! She even was caught by the rescue community when she dumped a sick litter of pups at a kill shelter because she didn't want to pay to try to save their lives! She is being investigated by the MO State Attorney General and all 3 branches of the IRS! She currently works out of the Brentwood PetsMart. There's also another rescue that does adoptions there, so don't mistake the two!
The Mission Continues	277179	1	/users/profile/365644	Bobby18	Volunteer	5	01/19/2016	The Mission Continues is a wonderful experience for Veterans, their families, and friends. I highly recommend any veteran to join your local platoon and get out to get some fresh air, reconnect with your brothers and sisters in arms, and give back to your community.  I recently joined the San Diego 1st Platoon after moving down this way. I was looking to make friends and open up my social network and couldn't be happier. I know after the military, many of us do not feel as if we have a "mission" in life anymore. We found a job and go through the day to day grind, but after giving up 1 Saturday morning each month to do some simple handy work, it has given me a new light. I really enjoy working with my hands and hanging out with people who want to give back. It gives me a good sweat, some Vitamin D, and the ability to connect with those silly people who used to make us laugh in the smoke pit.  The Mission Continues also has a Fellowship program which can be a true life saver for any transitioning veteran who is looking for a career change. I refer many of my clients to the program and their feedback has been extremely positive. These stepping stones back to the civilian workforce is having drastic positive influences on my client's lives. Thank you for doing what you do. Please support this program, if not through donations, then with a physical presence. Thanks.

Over the past years I have served in various capacities - most recently as PTO president. The teachers and staff were always so grateful of all of the things PTO was able to accomplish. They were especially excited when we were able to add to their yearly classroom budgets - allowing them to buy more resources for the children in their classes. We spent time and money updating the technology available to the children because the school recognizes the critical importance of children having technology at their fingertips and knowing how to navigate the new media landscapes. Making a difference through volunteering is one thing, but it is quite another when you are able to work with such an amazing group of people who are dedicated to the quality of education - it makes the experience so much more gratifying. I'm so grateful that my child is a part of such a wonderful community of Christian educators and staff who are dedicated to educational excellence and are continually raising the bar on it as well!

Special Olympics Missouri	94390		/users/profile/109141	Shiver B.	Volunteer	5	07/26/2011	Blue Springs Students Give Up Crowns to SOMO Athletes Prom can easily be considered one of the most important nights of a seniors last year in high school, and what could be more of an honor than ruling this night as prom king or queen? For most high schools, the race for prom king and queen takes the form of a popularity contest with weeks of anticipation for who will be named prom royalty. However, this year, on May 2 at Blue Springs High School, the prom king and queen stepped away from their thrones to give their crowns to a duo they felt were more deserving. The prom king and queen, Joe Malone and Lauren Anderson, gave up their crowns to two special education students at Blue Springs High School, Whitney Bowlin and Brent Roberts. Joe, a graduating senior of Blue Springs High School, came up with the idea to give up his crown. Over Christmas break I kind of went through a maturing process popularity mattered a lot to me before, but during this time I got closer to God and realized what is really important.  Joes initial thought was to have a separate prom king and queen for the special education kids, some of whom he got to know by coaching a Special Olympics flag football team, but Joes idea was turned down by the school. So as prom neared, Joe instead decided that if he won he would give up his crown to a special education student. When the ballots for the king and queen were tallied, Joe Malone and Lauren Anderson were found to be Blue Springs High Schools 2009 prom king and queen. Joe had already told Lauren about his plan to give up his crown, and Lauren thought it was a really cool idea and was excited to be a part of it. The duo chose two senior special education students, Whitney Bowlin and Brent Roberts, who had big hearts and a lot of Wildcat pride. They are two people whom Joe described as always happy and always so good. Their prom was held at Westin Crown Center in Kansas City May 2, and Whitney and Brent arrived there clueless of their destined royalty. Whitney brought her grandpa along as her prom date, and Brent arrived solo. After Joe and Lauren were announced king and queen, they took the stage and announced that they were giving their crowns to two more deserving students. This is when Brent and Whitneys names were announced as the new prom king and queen. When Whitneys name was announced she ran on stage and began yelling, Im the prom queen! Im the prom queen! Brent, who cannot speak, simply smiled big and gave Joe a classic Brent -- two pats on the shoulder and a light slap on the cheek.  The news of the new prom king and queen traveled quickly around Kansas City, getting a lot more publicity than anyone involved ever imagined. We didnt expect all the publicity, Joe says. We just did it because they deserved it  but I think its nice that people hear something good is happening, when there is so much negative out in the world being covered by the media.  Whitneys mom was touched by the thoughtfulness these two seniors showed to her daughter and Brent. Its neat to know there are kids out there that still have that kind of heart  to me, its just like a storybook.  The 2009 prom will not soon be forgotten at Blue Springs High School or even in the Kansas City area for that matter. Life is about making impacts and making people a little bit happier, Joe says. If I were to die today, its good to know that Lauren and I made an impact in their lives.  Being prom queen means more to Whitney than could be imagined. Its just awesome being the prom queen, she says. I will always be the prom queen.

Birthright of St. Charles Inc.	189115	2	/users/profile/246858	brockagain	Board Member	5	11/22/2013	I love volunteering for Birthright of St. Charles.  They provide a much needed service to women who are facing the surprise of unplanned pregnancy.  As a phone volunteer I have talked to many women who don't know who to talk to at this difficult time.  They are scared and want unbiased feedback from a caring person.   Birthright helps the woman who is facing an untimely pregnancy one-on-one, face-to-face, and never judgmental.  We see women who are single/married, in their teens and in their 40s -- all different financial situations and religious beliefs.  They are shocked that they are, or could be, pregnant. Some say I could never have an abortion - can you just give me a pill.  Or I love my children but I not handle another one.  They are scared, confused.  We have professional counselors who give them time to pause and think through their decision, help them with budget issues, give them information about community resources, and when necessary, financial aid and baby items.   What I like most about this organization is that all their services are FREE and they take confidentiality very seriously.  80% of the people that work there are volunteers and have been volunteering there for many many years - some as many as 30 years.  And they commit to working at least 3 hours a week.  An organization HAS to be doing something right in order to retain volunteers for that long!

The managers are rude, they lack class and have little tact. They are nice to the residents faces most of the time but, gossip to others and spread drama. They watch from the office with binoculars to see what residents are doing outside their homes, invading the residents privacy! They let themselves in and out of apartments whenever they see fit and if they don't like anyone that lives there they will find reasons to serve that person with violations to get him/her out of there. The parking is horrible there, those poor people have to walk a great distance to their front doors and it is not ideal at all for a disabled person (wheelchair) inside, sharp corners, tight places. There are even a few residents there (asked by the office managers) to let them know what everyone is doing. It's a really crappy place to live.So if you can avoid moving there.....do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. My friend is miserable there!!!!!!!!
Ben-Nor Apartments Inc	195656	1	/users/profile/255833	Jane_Doe	General Member of the Public	1	03/14/2014	I know several residents at this apartment complex. Office staff is rude and cause nothing but drama for the residents. Incoming and outgoing mail is not kept private nor is anyone who comes in or out of your home. Staff and other residents are always being nosey. I have contacted the board in the past and that got me nowhere. This is not a suitable place for senior citizens/disabled persons to peacefully live. 
ST LOUIS PSYCHOANALYTIC INSTITUTE	138564		/users/profile/184633	Donald Andy Simpson	Donor	5	11/13/2012	Three years ago, as I completed a graduate degree in Professional Counseling, making a career change, I first explored St. Louis Psychoanalytic Institute's psychotherapy training offerings.  I have since been a donor and member of this extraordinary learning community, in which my intellect and deeper capacities to serve others have been engaged and enriched.  In Institute training programs and other community offerings, in countless encounters with genuine and respectful faculty and staff, I have been helped to see new possibilities for my professional life.  Likewise, in personal therapy with a dedicated and skillful Institute clinician, I am experiencing not only a career change, I am enjoying the change of my life.  
ST LOUIS PSYCHOANALYTIC INSTITUTE	137310		/users/profile/183279	Henry Luepke	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Two years ago, I volunteered to serve on the Board of the St. Louis Psychoanalytic Institute without knowing much about it.  I have since been amazed by the brilliant and dedicated professionals behind this wonderful organization that does so much for the St. Louis community.  The Institute not only provides much needed mental health care to individuals and families, it educates and trains the analysts, counselors and social workers that staff the many public and charitable organizations that are serving the less fortunate in our city -- the children, the homeless, and those facing abuse or mental or emotional turmoil.  The work done at the Institute and the collective impact it has had throughout the region has made me proud to know that such a dynamic group has found a home in St. Louis.

The atmosphere of the old depot enhances the experience of watching several trains doing their thing on the high iron.  And don't forget:  these trains are O scale--big, heavy, and imposing.  It's much easier to get the feeling of TRAIN when watching these than the little HO or N trains on most layouts.This group is dedicated to preserving our railroad history, and they would appreciate your help, but they don't demand it:  you can just go, watch the trains, and leave.  But please consider even a modest donation to help with upkeep and repairs on the building.  Their operation is unique in the area and worthy of appreciation from us all.

This Society receives NO funding from the City, the County, the State or Federal government.  Volunteers are very helpful.  But the Society needs everyone to give a little to keep so much of the Arnold history alive.

PALS is thorough about placing animals in homes where they will be well treated and if they aren't - they will take measures to find another home for the animal.  As was the case with the other review. Please check out their YouTube videos and see what a difference they make in the life in an animal.

Loving music and having a father who fought in World War II encouraged me to become interested in veterans and our history; therefore, I joined the American Legion Auxiliary. Before joining the Auxiliary, I attended many patriotic ceremonies at the National World War I Museum and the Harry S. Truman Library. I noticed that the American Legion Band of Greater Kansas City was always the band playing for the special event. I was fascinated and always tried to sit near the band so I would be sure and hear their music.  It was the largest band I had ever seen. I observed the following: They looked sharp in their well-pressed uniforms; their instruments would glitter in the sun from being highly polished; they were always on time; they were organized and well rehearsed. I have admired the band for at least twelve years.

Happy Dogs Rescue	89652		/users/profile/102008	Niqoal	General Member of the Public	1	06/05/2011	IS THERE ANYTHING LOWER THAN ONE START????This organization, basically Michelle is unethical.  She is not trying to rescue dogs she is exhibiting her power. Michelle is using the farce of this non profit to over power unsuspecting members of society.   Please be prepared when dealing with her that there is only one way-her way.  Michelle scorned me for letting a stray dog wander into my yard and keeping it.  " a proper fence would have prevented this:..  All of my dogs are rescued dogs that lead happy healthy lives and have free range to romp and play over 7 acres.  The true meaning of we sent the dog to the farm.  This is  unacceptable to Michelle.  The dog must be by your side 24/7 with absolutely no alone time-Don't plan on working if you get a dog from her!  The dog is the master, the human is the animal.  If you are willing to abide by this logic then by all means proceed.  
Happy Dogs Rescue	58701	2	/users/profile/62724	Darci O.	Client Served	1	12/11/2010	I adopted a puppy from Happy Dogs Rescue in September, 2010. They were  at  a Pet Co in Lee's Summit, MO. three days after receiving the puppy, which they gave me while still being treated for cocidia, he came down with Parvo. We spent $1200.00 to keep the dog alive. They offered another dog 3days after he was in the hospital as well as the adoption fee back. We declined knowing of there financial hardship. Our puppy recovered and all has been well until Monday, December 4th 2010. Our pup got out of our backyard along with our other dog Max. We searched all night for them.We posted fliers,contacted local agencies,and did all we could to find them. On Tuesday morning we went to animal control to find our older dog Max in custody. The pup was not turned in. We were frantic. I called Happy Dogs rescue as well as e-mailing them to let them know and to get the micro chip info on him. They e-mailed me back and asked how he got out and that they reported him missing to the micro chip Co. By Wednesday morning we were beside ourselves with worry and broken hearts. Around 9:00 am a neighbor called and stated that he found the dogs and contacted the micro chip company who in turn gave him Happy Dog Rescues phone number. He called them and says they came and picked them up on Monday around 2:00pm. I called Michelle from Happy Dog Rescue immediatley confused why she had not called to tell us she had him. She waited 3 hours to respond to my call and did so by e-mail. She stated we broke the contract by letting the pup get loose therefore she was taking him back!!!!!  She never called us to let us know he was safe. We later found out that she also took our other dog from the neighbor saying he belonged to her as well. She kept them both overnight than took the older dog Max to the animal shelter and lied to them by saying he was found at a shopping mall 3 miles away. There really is so much more that she has done when conducting business with us but at the end of it all she has stolen our dogs and taken the law in her own hands. If indeed we did breech a contract it should of been handeled by a court of law. She lied ,had no compassion for our families feelings . The fact she confiscated the dogs and did not contact us is unethical,immoral, disturbing and unexceptable. To profess to be a non for profit caring animal rescue makes me want to throw up. How can a company like this be in business? They still will not give us back our pup. Each time I comly with her request she places more ridiculus demands on us. Saying she wants to draw up a new contract stating we can not talk of this incidence in any way shape or form. I really believe these people are not dealing with a full deck and should have  there license revoked. I am just not sure who I can contact in the Federal Goverment to do some sort of investigation on Happy Dog Rescue. It has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a human being and I can not stress enough how awful they have handeled this situation.

Was a willing and cheery donor until I saw how they treat people at intake.  I donated (I do NOT anymore) money to this organization to help animals in the area.  My donor dollars are from outside of Joplin, and I never considered that a problem.  Until I saw their intake, and realized that, while they're perfectly willing to take out of town donations, they don't take out-of-town animals.  So I'm going to find somewhere else to send my money until they turn down out-of-town money as quickly as out-of-town animals.

Animal Protective Association Of Missouri	320931		/users/profile/411583	Laurie102	General Member of the Public	5	01/07/2017	I host a Public Affairs show on WIL in St. Louis & Stacey Switzer and Jennifer Blome were guests to discuss fundraising events and several programs benefiting the APA. Not only do they have pets for adoption, they have spay/neuter programs, days where kids come in & read to the pets, birthday parties that often end in an adoption & volunteer opportunities. When we spoke, it was time for their Canine Carnival which is their biggest fundraiser. The APA is a great place to get a pet, volunteer & donate some funds.

Usa Athletes International Inc	274628	2	/users/profile/364081	Bach7557	General Member of the Public	1	12/18/2015	This company is all about profits. My daughter clicked on their contract thinking she could make a decision in 30 days stated. At the end of the 30 days she told them she couldn't go. They told her she owed $600 for clicking on the contract even though she never sent the initial $300 to confirm commitment.  They also told her that if she didn't pay she would be breaking NCAA rules and regulations.  I contacted them and they sent me by laws she would be breaking. We confirmed with the  Compliance Office at her university that it was untrue and this company lied. This is a warning to all parents. This is a shady company and the staff gives incorrect information. Threatens people who don't follow through. Not a business student athletes should deal with.
Usa Athletes International Inc	48715	2	/users/profile/49887	kingkong	Client Served	1	07/26/2010	The invitation my daughter received to play in Holland sounded really exciting.  The organization was big no promises, but short on fulfillment.  Instead of playing against teams from 6 or 7 different countries, they played a team from Kansas, and a local team from Amsterdam that didn't even seem to know what was going on.  Really disappointing, especially after my daughter raised close to 5 grand for the trip.  Be careful of their accounting.  They have some fees that pop up and the explanation for the fees is really weak, especially the "convenience" fee when you send them a donation.  The good part of the trip was the touring that they did.  My daughter met some really nice ladies from across the country but was really looking forward to playing some high level competition.  The lack of current "testimonies" on their web site should have been a big clue.  Save your money and reduce the stress and pass on the invitation should you receive one.
Ella Ragland Art	176317		/users/profile/232726	John T Watts	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2013	Ella Ragland was my Aunt and she was a fine person and also an outstanding artist. She died of complications related to Alzheimer's disease.  Joyce Ragland is her daughter and also my cousin as her father and my mother were brother and sister. I cared for my mother in her home and my home from 1999 until she died in 2006. She was confined to her bed for the last 14 months of her life and also suffered from dementia during that time. It was not diagnosed as Alzheimer's but was dementia just the same. So I am very much in favor of anything at all that can be done for anyone who is suffering from dementia of any kind. I know that my cousin, Joyce Ragland, is very dedicated to this cause and will do a fine job with anything she does using Ella Ragland Art as a means to help. Thank you. John Watts.  
Ella Ragland Art	176084		/users/profile/232472	Joyce R.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	This is a wonderful charity; they raise funds for Alzheimer's patients. The officers all donate their services, no one receives any pay. They have a two year project at a nursing home with Alzheimer's and other dementia patients called Inter-Active Music.  They do pay a musician to provide activities with patients three times a month. They have also donated activity aprons, dolls, prints, and greeting cards to patients and staff in several different skilled nursing facilities.

We witnessed first hand the intense passion and desire of the National Child Safety Foundation- Saint Louis to do good in our community.They have been responsible for assisting the rebuilding of our community parks and the cleanup and rebuilding of several local schools. It's nice to see nonprofits actually more concerned about doing good then just collecting donations.

All Paws Rescue Inc	286056		/users/profile/376110	Writer	Client Served	1	04/17/2016	They lie about known issues with their animals.  Part of the adoption process, is to know what you're getting--pluses and minuses.   When I asked why my newly adopted animal was showing concerning behaviors, they were very rude and acted like it was my fault. I was not impressed by them.

Flawdogs Adoption	234285	4	/users/profile/298436	edreamboats	Client Served	5	11/22/2014	Several years ago I traveled 1600 miles each way to pick up my Marvin, a 9 year old Dachsund that had spent most of his years in a puppy mill.  I had found him on Pet Finders and knew I had to bring him home. He was scared and timid and didn't have any teeth (puppy mills don't take care of teeth) but we got along ok with that. After the long ride home, Marvin hid under my bed for most of the first four months. Little by little we bonded.  It took over a year to get him to trust me.... just as Sally Ives had said it would.  He just needed security and love.  Finally, Marvin realized I wouldn't hurt him and would lay in my arms for hours.  He was finally safe... and home.  Like any normal dog, he began demanding his dinner and jumping up and down when it was time for his walk. He was curious about all things, especially outside. There were so many things he had never experienced before; birds, cats, grass and trees, the sounds of cars and motorcycles passing by, his first vanilla ice cream.For seven years Marvin and my  female doxie, Taylor, did everything together; play, sleep, romp in the yard, eat ice cream and hamburgers from McDonalds on their birthdays.  When she died at 14 late last year, Marvin (and I) was lost without her.  He rolled around frantically; searched for her everywhere.  He became  more attached to me and followed my around the house.Then four months later (Feb, 2014) my grand old gentleman of 16, Marvin, died in my arms of old age. It broke my heart.  He was a good little man; one of the best dogs I've ever had; and I am better for him loving me.  I thank Flawdogs and Sally Ives every day for saving his life... so he could be a special part of mine. As for Sally, she's the best!  She takes in hundreds of dogs every month just to save their lives and find them forever homes.  You have to love your work (and animals) to do what she does.  She is a Godsend for these little guys.  Without her, they wouldn't live, period.  They would be put down.  That's what puppy mills do when the breeder dogs are no longer useful to them. And for those who might complain that their new pet had something "wrong" with them ......... Sally didn't name it FLAWDOGS for nothing people!  These little guys have had a hard life and yes they sometimes have a health problem or two.  That's what life is like in a puppy mill.  Well, that's where we come in; you and I.  It's up to us to love them, to help them, to give them a better life.  They aren't perfect, but neither are we and they accept us for who we are too.  All they want is a warm bed, food and love, lots of love.   As far as a fee?  Of course there is a fee.  What do you think it costs to run this place?  Sally's up before dawn, in bed way after we are, and feeds, shelters, provides medical care, and cleans up after all the babies that come through her doors.......... 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  Do you really expect her to do all that for free? Listen... Sally is the best thing that could EVER happen to these puppy mill dogs.  She is the first step in giving them a better life.  She is there for the dogs and YOU!   So now I'll ask you this:  If you have room in your home or heart to bring one (or more) of Sally's beautiful babies home with you, GO NOW!  Don't wait a minute longer! And if you don't, or can't ....  at least send FLAWDOGS a donation.  Sally has a lot of precious little mouths to feed and she could use some help. Tell her MARVIN sent you.  She'll know..............
Flawdogs Adoption	88991	1	/users/profile/100727	parvokills	General Member of the Public	1	05/20/2011	A friend of mine got a puppy from Flawdogs this week and just found out that the dog has PARVO.  Not a good place to get a dog. They get their dogs from puppy mills--'the puppy mill rejects', and then sell them to the public for $150.00 to $300.00 which is considered a 'donation'.  No puppy date of birth, vet records, information, nothing other than a puppy whose health has not been verified by a competent veterinarian.I feel for the poor puppies; sad conditions.  I'm sure we saw over 70 puppies and dogs being cared by 2 women--impossible!!!!
Society Of St Vincent De Paul Archdiocesan Council Of St Louis	149934		/users/profile/199915	James72	Volunteer	5	02/24/2013	Each Conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul helps the needy with food, clothing, utility assistance, rent, prescriptions, advice as to how to get a job, medical needs,shelter, and how to try to escape poverty. No one at the conference level receives any compensation. The Council assists these conferences and needs to raise funds directly from the public.
Society Of St Vincent De Paul Archdiocesan Council Of St Louis	147488		/users/profile/195005	Ken C	Volunteer	5	12/31/2012	The St. Louis Council has approximately 140 Conferences.I am a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Conference at St. Peter Parish in St. Charles, MO. All Conferences operate independently of each other although if a Conference has a need greater than they can handle they can contact another Conference to "twin with them on handling a case. Our Conference has an emergency food pantry.  We provide assistance to those in need regardless of their religious belief's if any.  We provide monetary assistance with rent, utlities, medicine and emergency lodging among other assistance.   All Conferences in St. Charles County, where I reside, operaate within their Parish boundaries thereby covering the entire county.  Our Conference is based in St. Peter Parish.  We raise probably 95% of our own funds   In 2011 we spent approximately $90,000.00 on services to the less fortunate.  Our expenses were probably less than $1,000.00.    This is possible because our Parish provides us with an area for a pantry and a meeting room.  There are no paid members in our Conference which is typical in all Conferences.  Our phone line is provided by the Parish.   Many of our members spend their own money on stationay, mailings and food if necessary for a family.  Two  members make home visits to the person(s) seeking assistance to ascetain the needs of the person or family.   Our Conference also provides home furnishings where possible.  We also have members that cook and serve meals at the Salvation Army in St. Charles. The motto of the St. Vincent dePaul Society is "No charity is foreign to our work"

HOPE 4 TODAY	121556		/users/profile/165408	DotCaesarea	Volunteer	5	08/28/2012	I believe that the previous comments are grounds for liable and I am forwarding this post to Mr. Wayne Kennon, who Ms. Gray indicates is the attorney for this foundation.  I believe that there is more to the story and I also believe that once that is uncovered, Ms. Gray will be required to retract these statement.  Finally, I do not believe that anyone can "force" anyone to do anything. 
HOPE 4 TODAY	121476		/users/profile/165283	kgray623	Donor	1	08/27/2012	I became a widow in 2010 and I put my home for sale in May 2011. Initially I was contacted by Dr. Linda Sue Warner of Hope 4 Today asking if I wanted to donate my real estate and I declined indicated my financial position prohibited such as I was a widow and this was my future income. I was then contacted by George Briscoe Chairman of the board for 501 c Not for Profit Hope 4 Today at hope-for-today.org who came to see my real estate in person with his wife Elizabeth and son and a young veteran Ray who is according to George used by the foundation for grants from the VA to the foundation. In this meeting as well as written correspondence Mr Briscoe indicated the foundation wanted to make my farm the national headquarters for the foundation moving it from Chesterfield, MO. He affirmed the beauty of the farm and said the foundation wanted my beautiful farm for a kids camp and children's literacy. He indicated he understood my love for the farm and that I would not loose the farm I would sign it over to the foundation who would have the federal funding resources to make all the improvements that needed made and I could enjoy it at my leisure and not have the work of maintaining it. Having lost my husband only the year before I felt that the farm going to the good of children would be something my husband would be happy with and I knowing I needed income the foundation provided a letter of intent offering me a lease option for 1 yr. I accepted it as the foundation said they were awaiting their federal funding and would then pay off the farm once they received the funding and begin making all the millions of dollars in improvements. However the lease terms later were revealed were unacceptable and I declined their offer again. Then Mr. Briscoe requested he met with me personally and in Sept 2011 he offered the following on the terms I donate my farm to the Hope 4 Today foundation; In lieu of the donation I was to receive a 3 yr employment contract from Hope 4 Today and a position with the foundation. My 2 daughters were also offered employment. My contract terms included wages, living and vehicle expense of 60,000 per year tax paid and health insurance. I was also promised a new home to be built on Mr. Briscoe's beautiful farm in Miami which I and my daughter visited and he showed me the home he would have the foundation provide which I accepted. On the second meeting with Mr. Briscoe in Oct 2011 he agreed to hire my 3rd daughter for 10,000.00 per year for 3 years and increase my daughter Jennifer's pay to 30,000.00 per year for 3 years. These terms were accepted. For 3 years; Jacquelyn was to receive $30,000.00 salary with health insurance as the foundations travel agent, Jennifer was to originally receive $10,000.00 as foundation photographer subcontractor salary which changed to a $30,000.00 verbal contract for web designersalary, and Jessica was offered a 10,000.00 per year photographer subcontractor position verbal contract. In addition to employment contracts I was offered a verbal agreement from George Brisco who as chairmen offered me 50% partnership and lifetime income on every project the foundation does in OK, KS, MO of which George gave many details about numerous multi-million dollar projects in St. Louis and Kansas City the foundation was part of for VPM Management which I gladly accepted the terms of his offer and verbal agreement at this meeting. I initially was requested to donate my husbands truck a 1 ton 1996 Ford flat bed and I declined. Then Mr Briscoe said there was an investor, "John Thomas" in New Mexico who needed to see I was serious about the farms donation. George assured me I could have access to the truck anytime I needed it. I signed the truck over as required around early Oct 2011. That investor never materialized and my truck was never returned and I did not bring it up to Mr. Briscoe because I supposedly had use of it whenever I needed it. Then I was required to release by quit claim my real estate which after the employment contracts were executed I signed over by quit claim to Mr. Briscoe in late Oct 2011 and the foundation registered it in Jan 2012. In around Jan 2012 my 3 horses which I did not donate were moved from my farm as I was promised by Mr. Briscoe it was to take care of them. I was promised I always had access to the horses and the farm and I could use any time. The horses were moved to a location I was told by Mr. Briscoe to the Miami, OK area. On my farm was a semi trailer of personal items which George agreed to move to his farm for me so I could unload as it contains my husbands personal effects. George advised me in April 2012 I needed to unlock the trailer to prove the contents and I agreed to but no apt was everscheduled. I contacted his assistant in Justin in July 2012 who said he could not get a truck to move the trailer. In May 2012 I was advised the quit claim deed was not legal and I needed to sign again the real estate over which I did and the property closed to a "new investor". George said the buyers were going to be paid once the foundation had its federal funding a 30,000.00 profit for paying it off now and preventing foreclosure as the real estate was in foreclosure. I was promised every month the foundation "soon would be able to make payroll" and by June the foundation would be able to do so. AS of July 2012 George Briscoe not only no longer takes my calls his last response from his secretary was for me to contact their attorney Mr. Wayne Kennon of Miami and that they "would gladly see me in court". In addition to all today Aug 28th, 2012 I found out that the new owners of the farm who called me, Larry at 402.617.4885 won't permit me to take my belongings off the farm because the contract between he and George was only 2 trailers were to be moved, which were to be removed in 15 days from the closing which I was never advised of as well, and was not done. Larry says calls my semi trailer and its contents "abandoned property" and I am not permitted to remove it. Of course I have no money to pursue them and they know it which is apparently how they operate. I have been bilked out of my home and farm which George promised me I would always be able to enjoy as the foundation would care for it. We have defaulted employment contracts from a foundation who hides what it is behind the cloak pf a 501c. Additionally I was informed by "Larry" that I am not allowed on my former property. The farm was donated for children's literacy, it is clear this is just more lies which it is not being used for. There are more issues such as dozens of large round bales of hay hay taken and not compensated for, and thousands of dollars in inventory I left on the farm I was not ever advised I had to move and was told such would be used by the foundation, instead I now discover the new owners are using and in possession of which I was not compensated for. Part of the outrageous conduct in all of this is the fact that in addition to all of this I recently found out that the 70,000.00 state tax lien on my farm was released for $200.00. Why is that a problem? Because Mr. Briscoe indicated the total payoff was $260,000.00 which included a $70,000.00 tax lien. However the state only released a partial lien and I am still liable for the balance which was not the condition I agreed to as I was to be free and clear of all liens and tax liability as part of the condition of the donation which the pay off was 70,000 and this was made very clear to Mr. Briscoe and he assured me it would occur. In all of this I lost all my equity as they sold the real estate for the balance of the liens which I could have done myself but had no reason to as i HAD EQUITY IN MY REAL ESTATE. According to Mr. Briscoe the foundation has had its Dept of Education multi-million dollar grant approved but not released. I would have continued to wait for my wages though I have been reduced now to food stamps and applying for disability as I can not work having an unusable right arm and being right handed because since April 2012 I have torn rotator cuff and I need surgery. I can not work for anyone else other than the position I was to have with the foundation as I was to have insurance provided since Jan but the foundation has defaulted on health insurance so I now suffering physically, mentally, financially and emotionally as a direct result of the actions of Hope 4 Today and its board of directors. "Larry" the now owner of my farm informed me that George wanted him to sign a petition that would take an $11,000.00 insurance check I got from my homeowners insurance for roof damages from last years f-5 Joplin tornado when I owned the real estate but he said he refused to do so it appears they were as it appears George Briscoe was also trying to bilk me out of that as well.....and so it continues. Despite the fact that the foundation will do its level best to invest in lawyers now to fight the truth from being heard instead of honoring the contracts it provided the facts are now out as freedom of speech is a 1st amendment right.  The MO Attorney Generals office is launching an investigation upon hearing the facts herein. After researching I now understand 501 c have Liability and Protection Board members and officers of a nonprofit can be sued for a wide variety of breaches, and their personal assets can be at risk, so most nonprofits protect themselves with directors and officers (D&O) insurance. Lawsuits generally cover claims of fraud and manipulation, personal financial gain, breach of fiduciary duty, financial mismanagement, negligence and mistakes and errors. Even when an association has insurance, every board member and officer must be proactive in protecting the organization from such claims through detailed record-keeping, maintenance of paper trails covering all decisions and management activities, and full compliance with best practices for human resource management, civil rights and anti-discrimination laws http://www.hope-4-today.org/ http://www.hope-4-today.org/#!__our-board George S Briscoe IIChairman of the Board Gerald Gipp, Ph.D. Before joining Hope 4 Today, Dr. Gipp's career includes such executive positions as interim Director for The National Indian Education Association (NIEA) and the Executive Director of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC).

Missouri Botanical Garden	188628		/users/profile/246171	carbonfixation	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2013	My wife and I have each been going to the garden since we were little kids. Today we live nearby and go once a week on average. It is an amazing place and one of my favorite attractions to bring Saint Louis visitors to. The Japanese garden (Seiwa-En) and English Woodland gardens are my personal favorites and I have volunteered in maintenance of the Japanese garden which is one the largest Japanese style garden in North America. So go there, feed the fish, buy a cactus, relax, see a rain forest, take your kids to the hedge maze, and learn something new. Peter Wyse Jackson, the current President of the Garden is a great new addition as well!

During the marriage, I would regularly flee my ex-wife's yelling by leaving the house for a few days. Against my better judgement, I always forgave her and returned. Eventually she filed a divorce petition in which she claimed I was the abusive one, and then she parentally kidnapped our children. The Guardian ad Litem appointed into our divorce at Mother's request suggested I engage hope house's guardian program as a place where Mother would bring the children so they could see me, which I agreed to do as otherwise they would not see me at all. Hope House Guardian program from the beginning has treated me like some kind of threat or dangerous criminal, and hope house's "court" and "civil legal" programs have been completely non-responsive to my requests for assistance, since I have exhausted my savings on lawyers, and am emotionally distressed to where I cannot hold a good-paying job trying in vain to fight Mother's frivolous, spiteful, and poorly formed allegations, which she somehow convinced the family court judge to go along with, even though in doing so the court ignored the court's own impartial experts and gave a judgement beyond the authority granted in RSMo Chapter 452.Contrary to their own brochures on "what domestic violence is," Guardian Program turns Mother's unfounded fears into additional rules of conduct during visits at guardian program -- rules which must be followed under pain of losing the one time the children can see me. In conclusion, they may be doing a great job when it comes to couples who actually hit each other, but in a situation where the domestic violence consists of the woman yelling at the man (and at the children) and then abusing the court system to further her agenda of abusive control, they seem dumbfounded, and absolutely refuse to provide me the assistance their promotional material claims they provide to survivors, in particular the "attorneys who are well versed in the complex issues of domestic violence" who are supposed to be "available to represent domestic violence survivors in the civil legal system at no cost" which is listed as part of Program 2 at http://www.guidestar.org/profile/43-1265685 from where I clicked to get to this review form.
Hope House Inc	201754	4	/users/profile/263272	Cocamo	General Member of the Public	1	06/03/2014	My husband and I were assaulted by three men and two women several years ago on New Years Eve. They were subsequently found guilty of assault and property damage after a day long trial. As part of the court imposed punishment the five were to do community service. We received verification from the Court that an affidavit had been signed by Kelli S that one of the defendants, RA whose wife is a personal friend of Kelli's had performed his community service at Hope House in Independence. We were doubtful that RA had performed community service at Hope House so we called Hope House. In four separate conversations with four different persons associated with Hope House we were told that because Hope House was a shelter for domestic violence victims and their families that NO one with charges such as these would be allowed to do community service at Hope House. While talking to these people at Hope House it was obvious that NO one could remember a time when men were allowed to do community service for Hope House. We could find NO one except Kelli Stallman who would say that RA had performed community service at Hope House. The conclusion made was that either RA performed his community service without anyone knowing about it OR Kelli and Ryan were not being honest  We contacted members of the board at Hope House where we were told that in all probability NO one found guilty of assault would be allowed to do community service ay Hope House. Based on this information we were told that an investigation would be forthcoming. We never heard from anyone again. This program while being beneficial for those who needs it's services is being operated by people who are not honest or transparent. It is our opinion that Kelli filed false documents with the court thus possibly committing perjury. We feel that as victims of this crime we deserve an honest answer from Hope House as to the circumstances behind these events.

They are known for drugs, partying with underage females, and also they threaten women and children. They also steal parts off of cars when they get mad for being reported for their disgusting behavior. They get weekly/daily visits from the police for a multitude of reasons. They are trash and a disgrace to the University of Central Missouri and should lose their Charter. It would be wise to stay away from these people.

It was tough at first. At the age of 67 I still need more sleep than the average person.Lupus opened many doors that I never could have imagine. After the birth of my 3rd child I became involved with others who had lupus. The years that followed were wonderful. I still take prednisone, and cytoxin  drugs as I have for the last 34.I firmly believe that the longer one has lupus the better one gets. This is due to the fact that one is able to know what triggers flares and deal with it right away.

They drive the streets of the city, looking for animals without adequate shelter, food, water and medical care.  We absolutely need more groups like Chain of Hope as long as tying your animal outside for unlimited periods of time remains legal and as long as animal control remains understaffed and unconcerned about the torture and suffering of animals in our community.  I've personally witnessed the work that they've done and can vouch for them.  Go to their website and read Kate's blog to see the heartwrenching stories of these animals. I will support this group as long as I can and as long as they are in existence.

Animal Rescue for almost 10 yrs now.  They are a no kill animal rescue that takes animals from death row, from hoarding situations, from abuse and neglect situations and work with the Dept of Ag to rescue all types of animals.  This is the most caring and dedicated rescue I have every seen or known about!   All animals are spayed/neutered, given all vaccinations and medical conditions all taken care of before they are put up for adoption  in their loving forever homes.    The director, all the staff and volunteers are top notch, trained in classes on how to handle all the many issues that arise with each rescued animal.  C.A.R.E. is working with the city of Springfield to abolish the BSL of pit bulls and is the only rescue that is allowed to pull adoptable pit pills for adoption.  C.A.R.E. also has a 300+ acres sanctuary  that allows hospice animals, unadoptable animals to be able to live out their life in a wonderful loving environment.  At the sanctuary you will find pigs, goats, horses, chickens, ducks along with cats and dogs.  All the animals there received the medical attention they need on a daily basis and some becoming available for adoption.   Our website  www.carerescue.org has many pictures and lots of info about C.A.R.E.  They are a 501c3 non profit and solely depend on fund raising events and the kindness of the public with donations.  This rescue is top notch and has found homes for over 1,000 animals in 2016 alone.  They also have a thrift store that is run solely on donating items with the proceeds going to the care of all the animals that are rescued, CARE's Closet Thrift Shoppe.

Staff worked with us during every step of assessing his hearing loss, preparing for cochlear implant surgery, educating us as parents about hearing loss, and teaching our son how to listen and speak.  He's now turning 4 years old, and measures at or above average in all areas of development including language skills in comparison with hearing peers.  His success can be attributed to the skilled, compassionate staff who work with him daily.

Small World Adoption Foundation Of Missouri Inc	86010	3	/users/profile/96140	Mom7232	Client Served	1	04/16/2011	My role is actually ex-client not served, and I had to give them 1 star, I do not think they deserve any.   My husband and decided to add to our family of 2 adopted children by adopting 2 more.  My husband had diabetes, and I have depression which I take medication for, we knew some countries would not allow us to adopt.   In early 2010 after extensive phone discussions with the former Director of this agency many of which were specifically around the issue of the diabetes and depression and this Director consulting with their facilitator in Ukraine we were told it would be no problem to adopt from there.  We sent in our application which clearly states on it that my husband has diabetes and I have depression and signed the contract with this agency in March 2010.  That same Director also assured us it would be no problem to get 2 children under 5 years old without health problems  and we would have children in time for Christmas.   We found a WI social worker this agency approved of and on May 21st she e-mailed a rough draft of our home study to the social worker at this agency.  There were a few changes that needed to be made and on June 24th it was ready to be sent for apostille.  Just before sending it we were told by SWAF that we needed copies of our social workers license and the license of the agency she worked for apostille too.  This caused a 3 week delay in getting our home study done and apostille, to find out the copies of the licenses were not needed!  On July 17th i was set to over night our home study to the agency when we received a phone call that the last page of our home study had to be redone.  Then my husband received a phone call from the facilitator in Ukraine urging us to up the ages of children we would accept and say we would take three.  We did not have an issue adopting 3 it was the ages that scared us and one of the reasons we went with this agency was because right in their info brochure it stated: "Children between the ages of 8 months and five years are available for adoption thru Small World.  The Foundation does not generally facilitate placements for children beyond five years of age.  Our experience has been that the families who adopted children beyond the age of five years often encountered frequent and intense adjustment and bonding difficulties, with intense behavior problems.  These problems create significant difficulties for both the adopting family and the child.  On the application, clients may select an age range; eight to eighteen months, nineteen to thirty-six months, or thirty-six months to sixty months."   We agonized about it for a week and decided we would go up to 6 years old.  Finally August 26, 2010 our home study got registered in Ukraine and we received our official submission date of March 31, 2011!  We were not happy but waited out the summer, fall and winter.   Finally it was time to assemble our dossier and send it over for our official submission.  On March 4th with almost all of our documents ready to go we scanned our medical statements to the facilitator in Ukraine to make sure they were in the right format.  On March 6th after several e-mails back and forth with Ukraine about my depression diagnosis I was e-mailed that due to my depression I could not adopt, and if we wanted the facilitator to proceed with translation of our dossier he needed money from us.   I was crushed we had been honest from the start not only with the former Director, facilitator in Ukraine but also the Executive Director SWAF.  My husband Skyped the facilitator in Ukraine and the facilitator swore he never spoke about it with my husband and when my husband insisted he had the facilitator asked my husband if he had it in writing that they had spoken about it and my husband said no the facilitator called my husband a liar.  SWAF gave us two choices to fix the situation, get my Dr. to change my medical form (illegal) or we could redo paper work and my husband could adopt as a single parent.   After considering my husband adopting as a single parent we decided that at this point we had lost all confidence in SWAF and the facilitator in Ukraine not to mention that the facilitator in the Ukraine now made us uncomfortable with how he had treated the whole situation.  We did not want to go thousands of miles to a foreign country without total confidence and trust in our facilitator.   Just when we could see the end, when we could see travel and children in sight we lost it all, without cause on our part.  Now came the hardest part explaining to our two children why we could not adopt after all of this time.  That all of their excitement to help decorate and get ready for siblings was now not going to happen.

Childrens Miracle Network Of Greater St Louis	286721		/users/profile/376791	Brandon_K	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The gift Children's Miracle Network Hospitals gave to meWhen I was a college freshman, I was simply going through the motions like many of my peers. I would go to class, sleep ( a lot), and even hit the gym sometimes. I was new to UCF's campus, and was just trying to find my place.That lead me to join my school's Student Government Association. Being a part of such a large network of student leaders on campus was great, but what I didn't realize was that joining SGA was my first step in discovering my true passion. You see, that first year I was highly encouraged to participate in our school's largest student-run philanthropy which fundraises money for our local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. That student-run philanthropy is Knight-Thon, UCF's Dance Marathon. Like many other freshman, I was an expert at procrastinating. It was about a week before the big event, and I realized that I had still not done the fundraising I had set out to do. Many collegiate students can attest to the fact that school life gets chaotic and time seems to slip away from us. I realized at that moment that I was not as knowledgeable as I should have been going into such a big event. Nonetheless, I trudged forward and fundraised the goal that I had set for myself. The day of the Dance Marathon had arrived and I was very excited at the prospect of standing for 20 hours with all of my friends. I was having a wonderful time at my first Dance Marathon, but I was still blissfully unaware of how much of an impact the hospitals we fundraise for make. All I knew was that we were fundraising and standing For The Kids. We were fairly far into the event, when everything clicked. My energy was diminishing when a we were asked to kneel down as a family walked up to the stage to tell their story. This was a miracle family treated by one of the hospitals we benefit. The children who were on stage were both born prematurely and were kept inside incubators in the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit for the first portion of their life. Their dad even described them as being so small that he could fit his wedding band up their legs. It was in that moment that I realized that these kids and so many others are alive and happy because of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. It was an absolutely incredible feeling to know that the UCF Community had come together for such an amazing cause. As tears streamed down my face, something awoke in me. I came to the realization that I want to do anything and everything I can to benefit this amazing organization. Since then, not a day has gone by that I haven't done something For The Kids. Many people go through life never finding their passion. I am so thankful for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals for helping me find mine at such a young age. http://events.dancemarathon.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=59359http://give.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/

South Central Missouri Community Action Agency	286718		/users/profile/376788	Susan_K	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My name is Susan Keyton and I am a board member of the Central Missouri Community Action Agency. I thought I would share my story of how important this agency is to me and my community.There are many levels of poor  I lived in a few of them. I came from a family of college educated, middle class school teachers and everything was good in my life. Then, in 1970 my father suddenly died and left my mother with 4 children, grades 6th through 11th, to support on her own. My eldest sibling graduated the following May and moved on to a college campus. My brother moved in with friends to finish high school while my mother, sister and I moved to another state to be closer my grandma. We were introduced to low-income and were learning how to survive together. I went to work at 13 to help Mom with expenses, and we just made it work. Then it was my turn to go to college - which I did. I soon fell in love - and thought he had too, until I became pregnant.  You know how that story goes  I became a very young, single parent.  I quit school to go work so I could support myself and my child. Since I worked in the restaurant business through high school, waiting tables and cooking was the employment skill I fell back on. Since the wages I received did not support me and my baby, I applied and received food stamps, and child welfare. These programs were not the total answer, but they sure did help me buy TV dinners, diapers and formula that were affordable - and I felt it was better than nothing, and we were surviving!I really, really wanted a different job  one with better hours so I could spend more time with my son. I worked crazy hours and had to pick up shifts whenever they were available. I had no training to do other work, and I had no confidence that the restaurant skills I had could get me a better job.  One day someone asked me if I knew about the job programs the local Community Action Agency administered to our small community.  I applied. I will never forget the job program worker who took my application - she tutored me in confidence. She told me that just because I was a single mother did not mean I was not worthy of a good job. Period. She lifted my spirits immediately and gave me HOPE. That program was life-changing for me.I have certainly worked my way up since then - and it all started because of the training program I went to. I got a job at the Family Resource Center taking applications for the many programs that were offered. Next I went to work as the Office Deputy for the Howard County Sheriffs Department. My skills had grown so much that I then applied - and was appointed - by Gov. Mel Carnahan to run our local License Bureau for the Mo Department of Revenue. But my ambition did not stop there. In 2006 I ran for the Howard County Treasurers office and WON! I won two elections after that, and I am still the Howard County Treasurer today.  I will always be thankful to that job program worker who told me I was worth it, and that I could do whatever I wanted in life - it was up to me. She told me that day this program will get your foot in the door BUT, you will have to get the other foot in there and do the work to change your future. She was right  those programs empowered me  and empowered many, many more. Thank you, CMCA

Kansas City Chapter Of Young Audiences Inc	222938		/users/profile/286686	Erin87	Client Served	5	10/15/2014	We have enrolled our children in camps and classes at KCYA Community School of the Arts for over 2 years. It is so awesomely obvious that this organization is on a mission to educate and enrich children and serve families in KC. It is so much more than a business. After attending other "studios or schools" for dance in KC, I could tell KCYA was going to be different from the first day. The teaching artists in dance are as passionate abd gifted in the area of education as they are in dance. The dance director has goals beyond just getting the kids through a class or to the next "level." She incorporates life and social skills into the classes seamlessly---things like physical poise, how to sit or rise, how to present oneself- to smile, to speak clearly, to be healthy, to be dedicated. I guess I would say I am most impressed by the intentionality of all the teachers---they have goals, part of their mission. The mission is to support the growth of the while child, mind body and heart. I think that is extraordinary. The kids also love the chances to perform and the dance department teaches them the benefits of hard work and commitment in every step leading to performance.  Additionally, KCYA regularly put on free events for families that highlight local artists. They are not fancy, but they all kids are their parents the experience of community, comradery and participation in the arts. For all of the quality and intention that KCYA puts into their classes and camps, I also find it extraordinary that they are able to keep it affordable and accessible to kids with a desire to learn and grow through creative arts. We feel very lucky to be a part of the CSA

Here in Southwest Missouri, the organization I choose to support is The Arc of the Ozarks.

I support The Arc for the future generation. thearcoftheozarks.org
Kansas City Metropolitan Crime Commission Inc	213281		/users/profile/276451	The_Real_Kortnee	Volunteer	5	09/04/2014	I am a 29 year old mother of five, who has recently relocated to Kansas City Missouri. Since I have been here I have experience alot of Why? Who? and Where? questions. I seen my son forced to use the name Amir, when his name is Zeysean (12). I am a concerned parent who always and still have energy to communicate and plan my children's life. I worked in the health field as a Direct Support Professional since 2009-2012 and counting. I was disrespected by being sent to Truman Behavioral Health as if I am person with a mental illness, medication has been forced upon me as if I am joking about this matter. I love my children dearly. Whatever lies they are being told to cooperate and comply with lies of others using them for financial stability/ability. My questions to whom ever is behind this is.... Why put children in worse situations? Why confused abuse and mislead them? Are you a real child liason? Are you an active member who serve in your community? Do you have children of your own that you neglected and feel the need to take advantage of mother who really cares? Are you a person who can't except the fact that you failed as a parent or adoptive parent? Are there any adoptive applications I need to know about that I never filled out? What lawyer is believing these lies? Why hide behind the truth as you all hold/held occupations as doctors, lawyers, nurses, child liasons, and more. What extremity will you go to to protect your family who is behing it all? Why are you here? When did you arrive? What lie did you tell? Who are you paying to keep quiet? What chain of command do I comply with with my identity being stolen matter when the attorney general is related to the one who stole my identity? Miss I steal identities and children college funds and internal organs, Do you feel good about yourself? Are you feeling  shame? Are you embarrassed? Do you or will you protect what's yours? How do you think I feel? Just know you will never drive me to kill myself or harm my children we have been through it all and there is nothing to this point you can do to me secretly and think I do not know to make me feel bad as a mother or a person. Being me is rough but pretending to be me with everything I applied myself to I will conquer I am not in compitetion with you I am doing my best to succeed with all negative aspects and positive aspects. So keep communicating lies and whatever make you feel comfortable with yourself obviously you are insecure. Who are you and why do you feel the need to act in negative ways?  Is it because it make you happy? I am me and that KORTNEE MONEE LESUEUR! with children to take care of with out switching records and claiming what is not mine. Greed will not conquer all when my children are involved!

Kansas CityCARE Clinic	206640		/users/profile/269091	twoflymehome	Volunteer	3	07/19/2014	I was a very dedicated, passionate volunteer in 3 departments for several days a week for over a year.   I was treated very well by the Volunteer Manager, Suzanne L.  and by the departments I worked in.   I was treated so well that I thought I wanted to work there, and that muddied the waters.  A paying position opened up in the dispensary for which I was totally qualified for, but the HR manager, Miriam M., apparently does not think much of the clinics volunteer work force (over 1,000 people) and I was not even asked to interview.  Very political place, only about 100 employees, the management claims not to know what goes on in the trenches. In this job market, who turns their back on their volunteers?

Pcrmc Health Services Inc	146704		/users/profile/193674	docdvine	General Member of the Public	2	12/14/2012	Had some good experiences in the beginning with doctors there, but lately they have been few and far between since my doctor has left, Doctor C. Lee Parks. In fact, the new staff would not see me and accussed me of trying to get prescription pain medication from them, which I never did, nor did my pharmacy. I have a pain management doctor for that, which has been less than hands on also, so I did not need to get that medicine from them and besides I was getting ready to stop the pain mediation anyway. There are some very good doctors at this facility, but you may just have to have your own experience and then change if you are not happy which I had to do in the one case and may have to do in the other. Some other advise...I have also had the experience that when admitted to the hospital, they charge you for everything, and I mean everything. I had no idea that I was charged for the use of a fan during my stay until a nurse came in during discharge and told me I might as well take it with me as I had been charged for it {bought it}. So make sure you check your bill when you get out and ask questions when  you are an inpatient in the hospital.

Restore Ministries Inc	213845	1	/users/profile/277052	Deceived and Betrayed	General Member of the Public	1	09/07/2014	Erin Thiele is a false teacher, who lies about the Word of God, and uses His name for REVENUE for her own personal greed. Her non-profit claims are another LIE. I was partnered with her for 7 months taking her courses, and when I stopped "tithing" to her, she excommunicated me and actually threatened me with charges through law enforcement if I sent in another praise report about God to her ministry thanking Him that the Malachi verse she uses to get her members to donate/tithe money to her is false (which it IS)! This woman is dangerous and also claims total submission to your husband EVEN IF there is domestic physical abuse. She also continues to lie about her own marriages to two different men claiming she has only married once to one man Dan Thiele and that they are STILL married WHEN THEY have been divorced since 2005! ALL LIES and FAKE. She profits & POCKETS ALL the money she receives for herself taking trips around the world and never gives back yet claims it as a NON-profit organization with her 501 code. Such a deceiver. Such an atrocity! 1 Timothy 6:3-10 (NIV) 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain. 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. 
Independence Center	149255		/users/profile/198870	Tamara10	Client Served	5	02/12/2013	I have been a client of Independence Center since Jan 2010 and recently I have been able to go back to work full time.  This place really works and I recommend it to any seriously mentally ill person who really wants to get better, get off disability, and go back to work.  It took me awhile but Independence Center helped me work through the work issues that were holding me back through supported employment where they were on the job helping me figure out how to relate to my co-workers and do my job. Now I have an important full time job with U.S. Bank and can support myself.  What better testimony can you get?

Humanitri	199522		/users/profile/260474	ForeverBlessed	Client Served	5	05/02/2014	 I found myself and my children homeless after escaping an abusive relationship. I left everything behind but a bag full of clothes for each of us. We went to a shelter for women and children fleeing from domestic violence. Shelter stays are short term and I needed to start all over in a safe place. I was referred to Humanitri's Transitional Housing Program, where my children and I were provided a safe  furnished four bedroom, 2 full baths and 1 half bath townhouse. I received guidance, referrals and resources to get my life back and make a brighter future for my children. After 24 months I saved enough money to pay off all past debt and even put a down payment on my own home. I went from feeling like a  homeless, worthless, failure to a independent, successful, home owner!Humanitri is a wonderful agency, which cares about the families they serve. I was not just a "client" I was treated like a human being who just needed some direction. I felt they truly cared about my family and our success.

Connections to Success	286722		/users/profile/376792	Karen_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	We donated our CAR to charity Wheels of Success! When the time came for us to upgrade one of our older cars we decided we would rather help another family instead of taking its trade in value towards a newer car.The car we donated went to a lady named Chelsea. Chelsea is a mother of a three-year old who is balancing a full-time job as an administrative assistant while enrolled in the pharmacy program at St. Petersburg College. After escaping an abusive relationship, Chelseas car was repossessed. She lost everything including her and her sons clothing, when the repossession company disposed of her belongings before she could get to the companys lot. Thereafter, Chelsea used the early bus to take her son to day care then took a second bus and walked to work. Chelsea can now spend more time with her son and studies since receiving a new to her 1997 Toyota Camry.Director of Operations at Wheels of Success Barbara Uberoi said, Wheels would not have been able to help Chelsea had it not been for Karens [and Marks] donation of their car and funding provided by Build-A-Car funding from The Saunders Foundation whose mission is to support education. The Saunders Foundation provided funding to replace the Camrys struts, brake pads and rotors, engine cooling fans, water pump, window regulators, door handle and belts. The funding also covered a complete tune-up and oil change. AAA provided Chelsea with a basic membership to ensure she would not be stranded. Without vehicle donors and funders, Wheels of Success would not be able to keep placing families on the road to success.If you would like to learn more about Wheels of Success, Inc., including how you can donate your car, please visit the companys website. Mark and Karen say, Give what you can  when you can. Everything in life is either a blessing or a blessing in disguise.

LITTLE PATRIOTS EMBRACED INC	196123	1	/users/profile/256410	RoguesWife	Client Served	5	03/21/2014	Little Patriots Embraced has made such a tremendous impact on our lives! Words could not possibly describe how grateful we are for their unending support. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the President & Founder Carol and the hardworking team at LPE they helped us through the hardest and darkest times of our lives (and are still there offering support whenever we need it!). It's so much more than an organization, it's a family. And their focus on how war and constant deployments affect and impact military children not only sets them apart but is honestly awe inspiring by their complete & total dedication.  It's been over a year, 3 moves and the most challenging times we've ever faced since our family (active duty military with 2 amazing little girls) "met" Carol and the LPE  team and yet still to this day, thousands of miles away they continue to offer their support in every way possible. I could probably write page after page of glowing reviews of our experience as well as the experiences of many of our fellow military friends and families, but words couldn't do justice to the impact they've made on our lives. In a time when we thought all hope was lost they made it their mission to ensure we never felt that way again. Little Patriots Embraced takes the time to really get to know so many of the huge amount of families they assist and keep everything so personal that you'd think you were the only family they were helping instead of thousands! Their dedication, compassion and respect for our military families and understanding and empathy for military children is extraordinary.  We know first hand the impact their dedication makes and I don't know where we would be without their support. War is an ugly thing and it leaves scars on everyone it touches, it affects the whole family but each of them in different ways. Having an organization like this out there that provides resources and support tailored to the individual need of each person of a family is an extraordinary feat. It's not just about holidays and Christmas presents (though their support here literally saved Christmas for us!) it's a long term commitment year long to keep supporting, educating and offering resources and assistance that extends far beyond the holiday season. It's currently March as I write this review and we've already been contacted twice this month alone just to "check in on us". Where else can you find that? Thank you to everyone at LPE for your tireless dedication and support! We will never forget you!

Those not adopted will live with us forever. Our animals are clean, healthy  and we adopt to only the best homes. Our efforts have been acknowledged in newspaper articles, TV interviews, locally and across Missouri. We have fundraisers like our 5K run in Oct and all our information can be found on www.caretakersnetwork.org , our web site.  Donations are critical to helping us continue our work. WE welcome volunteers and adopters. COme play at our Trivia Games, our 5K run and adopt one animals which saves two, the animal you adopt is saved and adopting opens a spot at our rescue so we can pull another animal form a KILL SHELTER. CARE   
EQUINE-ASSISTED THERAPY INC	249651		/users/profile/337481	kayakmom	Client Served	5	07/23/2015	Can't say enough about this great organization.  Our little girl has been doing equine therapy since she was 3 with EATS.  At that point, she was unable to sit up, walk or talk.  After a year with them, she was able to sit up.  She was very unhappy about going and hated it at first, but the volunteers found ways (singing) to make her love it.  Fast forward 7 years, and she is sitting up, walking and talking (which they said she never probably would)!  We strongly believe it is due to the GREAT volunteers and therapy she receives weekly at this organization.  The volunteers go above and beyond for her.  Her therapists are incredible at inspiring her to do the extra.  They make it fun instead of work.  She is so confident on the horse and is able to participate in ways nobody thought possible.  She looks forward to Tuesday nights instead of dreading another therapy session.  We LOVE the staff and the other children who attend.  It is also wonderful to be able to sit with other parents of special needs children for an hour and be able to "relax" because you know your child is in good hands.
Shannon Foundation	102434		/users/profile/133522	backdoc	Volunteer	5	12/18/2011	I have been a volunteer for The Shannon Foundation for several years and have spent much time on the farm.  Rhonda Stephens who runs this organization cares deeply for the animals and every dollar donated goes to the animals as she doesn't draw a salary.  She cares for horses, pigs, goats, emus, llamas, mules minature donkeys, dogs, cats, birds, chickens and a fennec fox.  All the animals are happy despite their disability or issue (blind,deaf, seizures, incontinent, etc.)  Rhonda proves that those animals generally deemed unadoptable can live happy and fulfilled lives.  Located in rural Missouri, poverty is king so donations and volunteers are virtually unattainable.  
Paul Prince Ministries Incorporated	153001		/users/profile/179851	judi blomquist	Donor	5	04/06/2013	I would like to nominate The Fold Orphanage in the Limpopo region of south Africa for this award.  Founded and run by Paul & Micky Prince, they are meeting the needs of a growing number of children in the bush of South Africa.  They presently have two homes occupied by eight children and a house mother each, and another home to open in the near future.  Their goal is to eventually have eight homes on the property, which they purchased themselves.  The Princes are from the U.S. and have devoted the remainder of their lives to the mission of helping the helpless children of S. Africa.  My husband and I have personally visited this orphanage on a recent trip to South Africa.  It was very evident that their heart was in the right place--they do a great job of making their needs known to those in the States and also in-country and have a constant stream of volunteers coming to help on a short-term basis.  In fact, I was so moved after our visit that I am now preparing and mentoring a former student of mine to possibly go to South Africa this summer on a short-term missions trip to The Fold.  I heartily recommend The Fold of South Africa for any awards/financial assistance you may be able to render.  Please don't hesitate to contact me for future references or if you have questions.
Best Foot Forward	296903		/users/profile/387680	cbottini	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/18/2016	As a school counselor, and administrator, I have the opportunity to see first hand how BFF can have an immediate positive impact on a foster care student's life.  Ensuring academic success requires support that goes beyond the classroom.  The commitment and time provided is outstanding. BFF encourages success for students at risk and they work hand in hand with school counselors, administrators , and teachers to accomplish this. They deliver continuous assistance week in and week out furnishing the necessary tools  children need to persevere, achieve a diploma, and attend post secondary school. Whether elementary, middle, or high, the goal is the same; support, being there to help these children make it. Memorable for me is their continued correspondence with students after they have moved on.  The staff and students share  mutual respect  and encouragement for a fulfilling future. This wonderful organization is growing each day and making a huge difference in the future of many.

CULTURAL LEADERSHIP INC	155326		/users/profile/206219	elizabeth.darrell13	Client Served	5	04/18/2013	I was first introduced to Cultural Leadership through my high school's college counseling office. I had high expectations entering the program because of the things that I heard from my teachers and peers. The program not only met those expectations but surpassed them. It is completely hands on. As a student, I was able to have first hand experiences with the Jewish culture. For our African American unit, they brought in expert professors from top-notch universities. During the summer trip, we visited top social justice organizations like the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.  We were also able to meet with political leaders like Senator McCaskill and Senator Blunt. We visited numerous museums and historical landmarks all throughout the country in a span of just 21 days. Not only does this organization provide students with a great educational opportunity, it also provides students with a second family. The staff is very warm and friendly. They provide inspiration and motivation for the students who are a part of it. It has prepped me with tools that will prepare me for a college environment.  I would recommend it for any student with an interest in social justice and/or diversity.

A customer base that is largely broke, often homeless, primarily ex-convicts and 99% are recovering addicts and alcoholics.   However, if their business plan was to find the lost sheep and lead them back to the safety of the pen; if the goal was to give a hand (physically, spiritually and emotionally) to recovering addicts, they have one of the best business cases I have seen, as demonstrated by their high recovery rate.   I have lived here and witnessed acts of heroic kindness and true miracles.  Please support them in any way that you can.

It has been sobering at times to read the amount of scholarship applications we get in the mail almost everyday. The need for financial help for military veterans, their spouses and children while in pursuit of college degrees is GREAT! As prior military myself and also a college student, I am fortunate to attend a college I can afford on my own without high loans. Examples of applications we recieve are many military veterans who go to school full time with 3.5 GPA's or higher that put 200% of themselves into college but their military benefits do not cover tuition, books, fees, their family's housing, food and daycare! We must invest in military veterans, who in many cases have sacrificed so much to serve as volunteers to defend our country. 100% of all funds we receive go straight to military veterans in the form of payments directly to their colleges and universities. We are an all volunteer Board of Directors and work very hard to support these veterans in any way we can in pursuing their higher education. Please help us support the next "Greatest Generation."

Care Counseling Inc	269530	2	/users/profile/358255	RebeWilliams	General Member of the Public	1	10/29/2015	REVIEW POSTED ON SALVATION ARMY JOPLIN MISSOURI FACEBOOK PAGEUPDATE:  The Salvation Army's long term approach (hoarding donations) has taken almost four years before any appreciable amount of the 5.5 million donated was released for Joplin recovery.  Many people who suffered could have been helped.  They have recently posted pictures on their website of houses being built by Habitat for Humanity an organization that the Salvation Army announced a recovery grant of $800,000 from the 5.5 million donated to the Salvation Army in 2011.  They should be ashamed it is 2015.  Thats what needed to be done in 2011.  Below are reports dated 2014.  It was also reported that $455,000 went for expenses, including salaries, medical insurance for employees, uniforms, etc., etc..Reported Sept 2014 KSDK News:  At a news conference in Joplin, the Salvation Army announced recovery grants of more than $2.5 million. $800,000 of which goes to Habitat for Humanity to rebuild homes.  It was a day that some anticipated, even expected sooner.Reported April 2014 by KSDK News with regard to the Salvation Army:  "Local food banks. Local community foundations. Local human services organizations that have been there for a long time are best equipped to help their neighbors,  much better than organizations that have boards of directors thousands of miles away."The Salvation Army does very little for the City of Joplin.  The Salvation Army collected approximately 5.5 million dollars after the tornado.  They kept 4.2 million for almost four years.  Only approximately 1 million was spent on recovery immediately after the tornado.  With some of that money they recently built a new deluxe Thrift Store.  The proceeds from that store do not go to help people in Joplin, it goes to enrich the Salvation Army.  There are over 57,000 people living in Joplin.  At Christmas the Salvation Army gives out only 700 baskets.  The money for those baskets comes from the people of the City of Joplin.  Those people who drop money in the bell ringers buckets and the person who donates several thousand dollars each Christmas to the Salvation Army.  The Salvation Army also keeps part of those donations.  Virtually all of the  food for the soup kitchen is donated.  The woman's shelter is so small they turn away more women and children then they help.  It's unfortunate that people do not look beyond the obvious and truly know what kind of organization the Salvation Army is.  According to Forbes the Salvation Army's top executive, William Roberts, received an annual salary of $249,833. THAT'S $125 AN HOUR!!! (based upon a 40-hour work week) for the fiscal year 2012.  It is probably closer to $300,000 for 2015.  I wonder how many Santa Claus buckets need to be filled to pay Mr. Robert's extravagant salary?  There are all kinds of excuses to justify such outrageous salaries; but no one needs that kind of salary, and it is certainly inappropriate of a so-called charitable organization.  I realize that top executives are often paid high salaries for their fund-raising abilities and expertise; yet, it's just inconsistent with all the plethora of ads we see begging for our donations, which might mean life or death to some child. If that's the case, just think how many more children's lives could be saved if the CEO of the charity were to give back 90% of their salary. God forbid that a charity CEO might actually have to live on $75,000 a year! My, oh my, how would they survive? Even at $75,000 a year, that's DOUBLE what the average hard-working American worker earns in one year. Get out there bell ringers, you have a lot of donations to collect to keep this so-called charitable(?) organization solvent.  There are a lot of exorbitant salaries that need to be paid.

I tried to make changes within the organization, but was treated shabbily.  I filed a complaint against the counselor's license.  Through further investigation, I learned that the agency was deficit in eight key structural areas.  The agency doesn't meet the miniumum standards established by national charity watchdog groups.  It is unaccredited; there are unlicensed counselors; regular supervision doesn't appear to be taking place; low-and middle-income clients cannot afford the high hourly fees.  
Newborns In Need Inc	188546		/users/profile/246050	llf321	Volunteer	5	11/14/2013	Newborns in Need provides support to those organizations who care for sick and needy babies. NIN volunteers provide care necessities to local agencies and hospitals serving premature, ill or impoverished newborns. Volunteers use their talents to provide knitted, crocheted and sewn premature and full-term baby items. In addition, volunteers collect new and gently used baby items to distribute among local agencies serving families in need. Chapters collect clothes, blankets, diapers and baby hygiene items to be distributed in their local communities. Newborns in Need offers support to the grieving family by providing bereavement and memory items to honor and swaddle the precious life that was lost much too soon. Why you are needed: In the United States approximately 2000 babies are born into poverty each day. Over 540,000 babies are born prematurely each year and for every 1000 babies born, 6 babies lose their fight for life.
Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc	203686		/users/profile/199386	sherutim	General Member of the Public	1	06/25/2014	The CEF seeks to infiltrate the public schools in order to indoctrinate small children with the viewpoint that their fundamentalist Christian principles and dogma are the only truth. They operate so-called Good News Clubs whose mission is to convert the children to their religious dogma and use them as a cadre to induct other children (and even their parents) into their circle. Their message to the children is that any other religious beliefs (or none) will bring down the wrath of God on them, their families, and their friends. They bring adult leaders (armed with cookies, candy, and balloons) into elementary and middle school classrooms immediately following the school day and engage the children in Christian-based activities. To the children, the adult leaders are indistinguishable from their teachers, giving them the same mantle of authority for everything they say. The schools are virtually powerless to resist this invasion because of a bizarre 2001 Supreme Court ruling (Good News Club v. Milford Central School) which, stated simply, their practice of religion was merely free speech of a "viewpoint" and thereby protected by the 1st Amendment "free speech" clause. Their activity has divided and destroyed communities, schools, even families. The complete story is extensively documented in a book entitled "The Good News Clubs", by Katherine Stewart.
People to People International	294320		/users/profile/385063	AngryParent2016	Client Served	1	06/30/2016	This is an extremely condensed version of our nightmare with People to People International. They are rude, shady, and extremely unprofessional. They show no concern for the safety of the children or the legitimate concerns of parents. You will need a crack interrogation team to get any answers out of them. So here is our story. We were contacted by PTPI in December 2015. We were surprised by this, as we knew PTP had gone out of business. (Note: We used the old PTP in 2011 and were very happy with our older sons experience.) This was a brand new company with a new travel partner, although, they were still using some of the old websites info, specifically the history of PTP, even though they were now PTPI. The old PTP had local meetings, paperwork that had to be filled out, and a contract between the parents and PTP. The new PTPI stated up front that this being their first year up and running and the tight time table, no local meetings would be held. However, they assured us all our questions, concerns, and paperwork would be taken care of as quickly as possible.We paid our payments while repeatedly requesting this paperwork. Their response was to tell us to go to their website and read it. We stated anyone can set up a website. We wanted paperwork, signatures, and company verification. The run around continued, with each person we were put into contact with saying they were "looking into it" or someone else was "looking into it".  This included not responding to emails, and PTPI not acknowledging questions for weeks. Finally, in May 2016 we receive paperwork. They printed their terms and conditions off their website, put it on their letterhead with the vice presidents signature at the bottom. There was no place for our signature, acknowledgment, or any of the financial particulars related to our specific trip. Totally professional? We didnt think so. Some of the responses we received simply stated that any additional info would be on the group Facebook page. We dont use or ever want to use Facebook. We informed them of this and asked for an alternative. We were told to create a Facebook account. When we asked what information would be posted about our son on this Facebook page, we were told to look at the Facebook page. Once again, around and around in circles we went for months with no answers. When we asked about their social media policy in regards to security while in Europe, (i.e. instant posting of the groups locations via Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, geotag info, etc.), we were told there was no policy and we were being overly protective. They even claimed our info on geotag security was incorrect. We sent proof it was indeed correct and was met with silence. We were insulted many times, when we raised concerns of attacks against tourists, the heightened terrorist alerts, and the warnings against posting your current locations while traveling. One of their excuses was,  it was too late to change their policies and that they may add a social media security policy in 2017. The reason being they had no meeting scheduled and would not schedule another meeting before the 2016 travel. They would not even consider a meeting of our small travel group to discuss these or any other issues.  In the end, they told us they knew what they were doing when it came to electronic / social media information security and there was nothing more they would discuss on the matter. They really showed us they knew what they were doing when they sent flight info to our travel group. Contained within this group email, was the childrens flight info from JFK to Europe and back. This information was expected and important for the group to have as they would be traveling together. What we didnt expect is for our sons private flights from home to JFK and back would be included along with others private flight info. This was disturbing especially since number one, we specifically requested that his private information not be included anywhere except in direct communication with us. Number two, we already had this information from the travel partner. Number three, the group email included a link at the beginning to retrieve this information from the travel partners if you so desired.When we raised issue with this, they said if that happened it shouldnt have. It wasnt a question of if because it did and the evidence was in everyones email inbox. They continued to say if as if there was some doubt in the matter. This gives you an idea of the professionals youll be dealing with if you ever make the mistake of sending your child with PTPI. So, if you dont mind complete strangers having your childs complete and private travel information in case they want to beat you to the airport to meet your child or bump into them during their layover, then PTPI is for you.  They finally say they dont think they can make us happy and wanted to know if we wanted our son to stay in the program. At that time, having no alternative, we answered yes. They then sent the detailed travel itinerary for once they were in Europe. A few days later, on a Friday before Memorial Day, we receive an email telling us they were dropping our son and we would get a full refund. When we tried to find out why, no one would answer us via email or phone. They planned it this way. Due to the holiday weekend (including Monday) by the time we would be able to find someone to protest to, the refund would already have gone through. Looking back, over the past six months; we had sent over 100 emails requesting information and we received about one quarter of that back in response, with promises of information that never came. They did give us a full refund, however, the unwarranted, late decision by PTPI to drop us, cost us more than $550.00. Not being able to have a travel experience this summer would have been a great disappointment for our son. My wife, determined to see our son have this great experience, was able to find a site called Travel For Teens. Working with my wife, they set our son up with a better trip to Europe, provided instant paperwork, contracts, and answered any of our questions immediately, and they have a social media security policy. The $550.00 extra cost was for ticket prices and fees, which we fully expected, because we were joining their group late and missed out on the discounts.OMG, what a difference. One week after being dropped from PTPI, our son is all set for a great trip, and we are happy parents.Dont ever use PTPI. They need to go out of business and never be trusted with our children. Note: PTPI just emailed us to try to solicit funds for Travel 2017. Really!!??? They just dropped us with absolutely no thought to the child they were letting down. Its just another example of their greedy incompetence. 
Rock Hollow Youth Ranch	2934	33	/users/profile/4588	eboersma	Board Member	5	03/03/2009	Peace and tranquility abound at the Rock Hollow Youth Ranch.  I am a board member, but actually spent a lot of time earlier this year helping out with the ranch.  As an owner of my own consulting company, and the condition the economy is in these days, the time spent there working with the horses was priceless.  The cares of the day seem to fade away, and you can get back to just enjoying life's simple pleasures.I truly am blessed to be a part of something that can have such a huge impact on one's life.  Whether you are the parent of an at risk or special needs child, the CEO of a fortune 500 company that's looking for ways to improve performance, or someone that just needs to get back to the simple things in life, this ranch provides a little bit of something for everyone.Take the time to talk with the owners and those that work there, and I can't speak highly enough about what this facility can do for you.  I hope that everyone that visits has the same reaction that I did, and more importantly the same benefits.God Bless!
St. Stephen ECD & Preschool, Inc.	159368		/users/profile/211521	SZobrist	Client Served	5	06/03/2013	My sweet, music-loving son has a variety of "different-abilities".  He suffered a stroke shortly prior to birth - and communication and mobility are challenges for him.  My husband and I decided he wasn't quite ready for Kindergarten, so we toured a variety of local preschools.  Upon sitting in and observing Ms. Linda's and Ms. Amy's class at St. Stephen's just once, we knew that was where we wanted our son to go.  Then we brought our son to St. Stephen's to see how he would respond to the teachers and other children, and we knew he was where he belonged.  His teachers, Ms. Linda and Ms. Amy, included him in all that he would tolerate - and with their patience and guidance, he began to participate more and more.  The children accepted and interacted with our son - and, in time, he learned to accept and interact with them.  St. Stephen's is a school full of love and learning and acceptance, and we count our lucky stars that our son was taught there.  My husband says our son has the heart of a champion - and that coupled with the lessons he has learned from Ms. Linda and Ms. Amy, shall take him far.

FABRY SUPPORT & INFORMATION GROUP	131499		/users/profile/177061	tritter	Client Served	5	10/31/2012	My husband of 35 years of age had his 3rd stroke in May of 2012.  He was sent to Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO.  It was there where he was finally diagnosed with Fabry.   The doctor being a stroke specialist did not know much about this disease except for what he found on the internet.  Worst case he would have 5 years to live.  That evening I came home and read up on the disease as much as possible.  My 2 sister en-laws and I all found the FSIG website and telephone number.  Tired of reading about it I called the number.  I spoke with Jack Johnson.  While telling him about my husband and what he was diagnosed,  I was not aware that Jack too has Fabry and 49.  When he told me, it was a relief to speak to someone that KNEW what my husband has and understood.  Jack sent us all kinds of resources, drove to our house to speak with my husband.  My husband has had 2 more strokes since and 2 possible TIAs.  Jack calls to check on my husband.  My sister is having a benefit auction for my husband.  FSIG has donated bracelets to sell to help raise money to help my husband.  Jack has also been a great support for our family by e-mailing with family members.  Without Jack we would not of had the correct up to date research on the disease, know of doctors to get in contact with, know of informational seminars that are available and know of other people that suffer with this same rare disease.  Thank You So very much FSIG you have been of great help in our journey with this disease.  You gave us hope when we thought there might not be.  Thank you and God Bless.

Wayside Waifs Inc	210916		/users/profile/273725	CaitlinLOL	Volunteer	5	08/16/2014	I can't thank these people enough for their generosity and professionalism. If you want to see one of the most successful shelters in the USA, with the best outcomes for animals, and an amazing rehabilitation program, take a tour here. They're amazing, they raise the bar, they show you how it's done right. They keep dogs separate from cats. Cats have a nice set up for play and activity to meet people, they're not all jammed in little kennels and really scared by the time someone opens the cage. They take turns in the kitty rooms as long as they're healthy. The dogs all get walks several times a day. They have big areas to run outside or in different play rooms. You can meet animals in an intimate setting. I adopted a senior dog here and he will always have a special place in my heart, always. He had a lot of issues and wouldn't stand a chance at other rescues. But wayside paid for $1,000 worth of medical expenses while he was in their care. You won't smell poop or pee when you visit this place. Volunteers undergo training classes, with many options available and lots to learn before you get started. Employees are paid and able to do their job and take it very seriously. Thank you wayside waifs for maintaining my level of faith in humanity and providing excellent care for the animals.

Disabled Citizens Alliance For Independence Foundation Inc	192899		/users/profile/251918	CynthiaWilliams	Volunteer	1	01/21/2014	After having worked for Disabled Citizens Alliance for 2 years, I am shocked to find out that they are not under the jurisdiction of  Fair Labor Laws. When I asked about recieving my check they replied that because they are a non profit organization they are not required to adhere to minimum wage, and they are allowed to withhold your paycheck as long as they wish. If that is the law, I should have been made aware of it. I would definitely not reccomend employment with this company. I was supposed to be paid a week ago. Now I don't have the means to provide the disabled person I am supposed to take care of with the things he needs. He is the real one they are hurting, the ones they are supposed to be dedicated to protecting.

There are sometimes they are struggling with money issues but any ways the people who always come tho this place help a lot.  Once a month they have community or neighborhood breakfasts and the same people make some cultural breakfasts and bring them for the people coming to the breakfasts. They also have different organizations like Turkish Youth Club which organizes soccer, basketball, PS3, or Xbox tournaments for their kids to come together and carry on their cultures. They have cooking classes every once in a month and they only charge $5 per person but it only covers the shopping expenses. They have weekend schools and it works voluntarily bases, volunteer people  comes every Saturday and teaches their language and they do some cultural activities. They organize picnics that twice a year. In Ramadan they strive to give "iftar"  dinner for the families and they invite neighborhood and people from different religions. In the sacrificing day ( Kurban Bayrami) they help the poor families without looking at their religion or ethnicity. In thanksgiving they organize Thanksgiving dinner in which they invite different people from different religions,as well. They have good relationship with some of the universities so that their kids can learn more about the collages and the universities and help them graduate from the collages and help them find jobs. I can tell more about it but you should come and feel the warmth of their community and also feel the friendship as well. Here is their website www.tasom.org and facebook TASOM Stl.

Eagle Wings Ministries	200222	3	/users/profile/261372	kenj0418	General Member of the Public	1	05/13/2014	I became aware of this organization after my child's (public) elementary school solicited donations for old shoes with the explanation that they are being given to this charity and then that "These shoes are shipped overseas and sold for pennies to people in need.  The money is then used to build wells and help people in Africa and Hati have clean water."  The logic of this (shipping shoes worth pennies overseas - where the cost of the shipping would exceed the cost of the shoes) sounded bizarre, so I looked up the Form 990's they filed with the IRS.  From there I saw that the biggest piece of their revenue goes to pay their own salaries and to fly themselves around - only about a third goes to actually help people (that don't work for their 'charity').

Mega Foundation Inc	166027		/users/profile/217425	avataress	General Member of the Public	1	08/24/2013	I read about Mr. Langan, the President of this not-for-profit in Malcolm Gladwell's book entitled, Outliers.  I also saw three short videos of Mr. Langan on the Erroll Morris show on YouTube.  In both Mr. Gladwell's book and on at least one of the short video segments from the Erroll Morris show, Mr. Langan said he knew no one "smarter" (quotes mine) than him and that he would communicate with any "man" (quotes mine again) who claimed to be.  This seems to leave out black women who make this claim to him, as I did both in writing by e-mail to his topica.com listserv and by phone to the phone number on its voice mail listed on this website for his foundation earlier this week, for I have gotten no response to date (perhaps they were "out to lunch!") and my photo appears on my e-mails identifying me as a black woman.  At least I told him that I don't know anyone smarter than me. Also, in one of the video segments with Mr. Langan on the Erroll Morris show on YouTube, Mr. Langan actually said, with passion, that he is for Eugenics for breeding superior humans, intellectually and morally, and that this has worked with animals.  Unfortunately, the facts seem to refute Mr. Langan's logic because to my knowledge Eugenics has been tried many times throughout recorded human history and has never worked as planned, especially among humans.  This is clearly portrayed in movies like, "Gattaca," and "A Family Thing," in our own day, the latter starring Robert Duvall, a white man, and James Earl Jones, a black man as brothers, both of which films are the story of most Americans unbeknownst to them.  In Gattaca, two of the Eugenetically (is that a word?) bred characters in a future time, one played by Jude Law, turned out to be inferior in many ways, while the naturally bred character played by Ethan Hawke with all his faults turned out to be superior in almost every way, including physically.  Even among certain dogs, like English boxers, too much pure breeding has led to many problems for the resultant progeny.  Further, it seems a little "mongrel" in the gene pool adds a bit of hardiness as Mr. Langan's own questionable heritage and upbringing seem to show.  If his plan of Eugenics was in place when it was time for him to be bred, it is quite probable that he would never have come into existence to plan any Eugenics program like most people who want or wanted a Eugenics program.  His "plan"in this vein, is therefore highly laughable, and "boneheaded" but inconsequential, I think, because I don't think he's ever going to pull such a thing off because he's not practical enough to do even that.  I don't know about his wife, but really, I don't think the world has anything to worry about from those two or from their colleagues. Finally, in light of all of the above, I don't think it is necessary for anyone to fret over this person or his organization or to laud their intelligence.  He may, and I say, may, have an IQ of over 200 and have won $250,000 on a TV trivia game show, but a genius with the practicality and good old horse sense needed to implement sensible, practical improvements in the world, I would say that he definitely is not regardless, again, of the formation of his erstwhile foundation.  I think we should all thank whatever powers there are that in the final analysis it's pretty sure that Mr. Langan and his ilk will not be responsible for how the world is run in the future!

Branson High School Project Graduation Inc	88835	2	/users/profile/100352	heartstomp	Donor	1	05/17/2011	Thanks to Bob Nichols for producing the 2nd Annual "Dancing with the Stars Branson" to raise money for Branson High School's Project Graduation. Unfortunately, many of our graduating seniors did not receive much of the money, or any of the prizes because the woman that co-oped the Project Grad event, Lori Ashlock - Ruda, rigged the prize drawing so her daugher, and the entire table of her daughters friends won most of the prizes. In addition, the cash for attending Project Grad, was unequally distributed between the students. Some receiving as little as $40, while other students received upwards of $150. I, as a parents and helper in the fundraising, am OUTRAGED that this Lori Ashlock - Ruda woman was allowed to take over the Project Grad prize reception and still have not answered for it.

Kindness In A Box	293110		/users/profile/383681	kindnessinabox	Board Member	5	06/15/2016	10 YEARS OF HELPING THE IMPOVERISHED, INDIGENOUS FAMILIES OF MARAS, PERUOUR MISSION AND HISTORY by Lynda Burgman, Founder/Executive DirectorKINDNESS IN A BOX (KIAB) was founded in October 2006 by Lynda Burgman, a retired non-profit executive, after a trip to Peru to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.  While there, she hiked in the District of Maras where ancient salt pools are located. The children of this region spend most days before and after school working in the salt pools or farming along with their parents. The lack of resources and the conditions in the village schools prompted Lynda to begin her humanitarian work. Kindness In A Box was recognized by the Oprah Winfrey Pay It Forward Show after shipments of clothing, toys and school supplies were sent to over 500 children in Maras. In 2015, Lynda Burgman was awarded the United Nations Human Rights Award by the St. Louis Christian Women United for her work.The mission of KIAB is to provide humanitarian resources that support the education, health and well-being of impoverished, indigenous Quechua children in the District of Maras, Peru. 2.1 million Peruvian children live in extreme poverty.  About 73 percent of the indigenous Quechua communities  more than five million people  live on less than $1.25 a day.  Unfortunately, the children of Maras fall into this category.We believe that sustainable development occurs when support is strategic and relevant to both the needs of children and the capacity of the local community.  When families, communities and institutions invest in the education, health and well-being of children, everyone benefits.www.kindnessinabox.org5955 Grayling ViewVilla Ridge, MO 63089  FACEBOOK US!

They are professional, knowledgeable and want to match the right pup with the right person.  The staff and volunteers seem to go out of their way to meet clients' needs and respond to unique disability issues of their clients.  They certainly did with me - and they are always so pleasant and nice to deal with, open to questions or helping with any needs after service dog is placed.  So many service dog agencies do not work in this professional, helpful manner.  This agency is always giving back to its community, its clients and ensuring their service dogs are well cared for and truly the best trained.  My pup changed my life and it is a pleasure to deal with this agency - people I now call my friends.  I have dealings with this agency now for 4 years.  They never disappoint.

The camp has grown over the last 10 years, but the focus remains on the needs of each child.  Some of these kids have never had a birthday party.  They get one at Camp David.  Some have never rode a horse.  They get to ride at Camp David.  Some have never heard of Jesus.  They get to hear the Gospel at Camp David.  It is my privilege to support this growing organization that serves prisoner's children in Missouri.  The administrators are excellent stewards of funds entrusted to them.

Mercy system has worked hard to emphasize the healing ministry of Jesus in its educational programming, its philosophy, its treatment of family, patients and co-worker,  and even the criteria by which staff are evaluated.  We as co-workers are educated that our fiscal responsibility is to make sure we have a business practice which can continue to support our mission to serve the poor.  I hope that giving back my Christmas gift from Mercy and /or payroll deducation can be replicated by my co-workers and others who care to help the poor elderly and disabled:  those whom Jesus asked us to care for...
Ozarks Regional Ymca	286728		/users/profile/376798	Tammi_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why I Givehttp://www.orymca.org/I give to the United Way of the Ozarks and the Ozarks Regional YMCA because their partnership has impacted my teen daughter on a level I never could. She attended a residential summer camp in the summer of 2015 and came away transformed. Having been bullied in school for being too little and short, too outgoing/weird/loud, she struggled with self-confidence, drawing boundaries, and making friends. After a week at camp, she came away with strength, courage, and acceptance. She said for the first time she wasnt picked on or bullied and people truly cared about, and liked her, for who she was. As a mom, I try to help her face adversity with courage and strength, but there are some places a mom cannot reach. Camp Wakonda, the staff and counselors, and other campers reached her and she came home a completely changed individual. To this day she uses words like transformational. She drew healthy relationship boundaries, cleaned up her friends, and embraced the quality, not quantity, of the friends she has.  She has continued to share her story and impact others as well. I am thankful for the assistance we received to be able to send her to camp.
Inroads Inc	286852		/users/profile/376923	Anthony_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I wasn't supposed to be a Googler.Where I come from, guys like me are not expected to become software engineers. The facts and figures suggest that I should've been either dead, in prison, or homeless. I grew up in the murder capital of the United States and the birthplace of gangster rap. I lived in an extremely poor neighborhood of an extremely poor city. I can still remember laying my head on an air mattress hungry on at least a couple of occasions. I also remember being physically and sexually abused by a family member and a neighbor who lived upstairs. By the time I found myself in the lobby of the Department of Children of Family Services at the age of four on my way to my fourth foster family, I was actually relieved that my two younger brothers and I would have the chance to start a new life in separate foster homes away from the evil of our early years.I was not supposed to grow up to become a software engineer at the best company in the world.I eventually came to know the love of an incredibly benevolent pair of loving foster parents who reunited my brothers and me under one roof. They gave all that they had to raise me and pushed me to work hard to get good grades, even though I attended schools in one of the worst school districts in the nation. With scrappy determination, I promised to become a first-generation graduate of a four-year university despite being continually bullied through middle school for being the smart kid. I eventually developed a love for computers and computer programming, taking every opportunity that I could to visit the small computer lab that we had at school to learn how to send email, search the internet using Gopher, and browse the web with Netscape.INROADS discovered me during my last year of high school. The recruiter told me that I could secure a job at a top company and that INROADS would train me to build a successful career. Having nothing to lose, I signed up and got my first programming job as an intern at City National Bank, fresh out of high school. INROADS trained me over the next three summers and paired me with successful corporate professionals to learn valuable leadership and career development skills as I gained on-the-job experience. I was already a full-time, salaried employee by the time I graduated from college when many of my friends still didn't have plans for life after graduation.I, and others like me, are passionate and motivated about doing our part to give back to INROADS because we owe so much of our success to them. The mission of INROADS is to develop and place talented underserved youth in business and industry and prepare them for corporate and community leadership. I bear witness to you that this is exactly what INROADS did for me.An international organization with over 35 offices, 2,000 interns, and over 200 companies, INROADS is making a difference in the world by preparing a highly talented and diverse pool of workers for corporate success. If you believe in supporting Google's commitment to increasing diversity in technology, please join me in supporting INROADS.

Randolph County Sheltered Industries Inc	170536		/users/profile/225697	Jim_72	Professional with expertise in this field	2	09/19/2013	I worked at this establishment for a year to the day.  I really love the idea of what sheltered workshops stand for.  These people deserve the best possible staff available.  That being said, I made it my mission to be just that.  I did everything possible to ensure a positive and productive workplace.  Unfortunately, this kind of commitment is rare.  I found myself at odds with an insecure and easily manipulated manager and two ambitious and dishonest subordinates.  While I was running ragged, trying to promote the mission, they were breeding ill will and a hostile environment.  The saddest part is that the people we serve will suffer.  Upper management is well aware of the situation.  Nonetheless,  these insidious people were allowed to divert the blame to me and achieved my dismissal.  Now, the clients are at the mercy of at least two staff members who could care less about them and a manager who has not the conscience or will to protect them.  There are clear signs of dementia, bipolar disorder, and hostility issues at work, and that's the staff.  I love the work and the people.  If you're there and something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.  Do the right thing.  Please?

The various dentists I have seen seemed to be very good,  They were gentle and effecient.
Wild Bird Rehabilitation	275791		/users/profile/365456	SaintLouisBWorks	Volunteer	5	01/06/2016	I volunteered with Wild Bird Rehabilitation between 2008 and 2011.The care and compassion demonstrated by fellow volunteers and staff members was unbelievable.  In addition to caring for hundreds of birds in the peak season alone, Wild Bird attended numerous events to help promote education surrounding wildlife.  Coming into Wild Bird Rehab as a novice, with only the passion to make positive changes as a guide, I can say that the hands on training I received left me feeling capable and confident. When I eventually decided I'd like to increase my skills by attending a Nationally recognized wildlife rehab clinic, I was encouraged by staff and fellow volunteers who helped me study and practice. By the time I left Wild Bird (due to career related changes) I had gone from simply cleaning cages and filling dishes (both important!) to administering medicines and working with hatchlings in their ER.  The opportunity to work closely with common and migratory songbirds afforded me an up close look at these incredible creatures and helped to further my awareness of issues plaguing songbirds. To this day, I receive worried calls from friends and family anytime they find an injured bird. I feel grateful to be able to provide information to help them and the birds. Each time I bring a bird in, I make a donation, and leave knowing that the bird is in the best care we could hope for. Wild Bird is a fantastic group. Like so many non profits, they rely heavily on in-kind and monetary donations. Volunteer help is of course, always a welcome resource too.

Disabled Athlete Sports Association	172090		/users/profile/227792	Dang Skippy	Client Served	5	09/26/2013	DASA has helped my child achieve success when society's expectations would have given up on her.  My daughter has cerebral palsy and suffers from partial paralysis. Kelly Behlmann, the Director of DASA was my child's Physical Therapist at school.  Kelly  got my daughter interested in competitive swimming, against other kids with disabilities.  Eventually my daughter competed in track and field, archery, and a few other sports.  Last year she was invited to the U.S. Paralympic trials.  Although she did not make the US team, she scored well in her events.  As a result, a very forward thinking college offered her an athletic scholarship for track.   Because of the confidence, training, and conditioning provided by DASA and the absolutely incredible coaches and volunteers, my daughter competed on her able bodied high school swim team and track team all 4 years of high school.  She has completed 5 triathlons (short course).  If it were not for DASA, I am absolutely convinced that my daughter would have done poorly in high school, and would be living at home, overweight, depressed, and with a very bleak future.   DASA is a charity, that I never hesitated to donate money and time to, because I saw firsthand what an impact the people and programs have on kids with physical challenges.  Over the years with DASA, I met so many kids, who have now gone off to college and become productive young  adults (hopefully my daughter will join those ranks).  
Grace Hill Settlement House	3560	15	/users/profile/5338	kim-lenz@sbcglobal.net	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2009	Grace Hill Settlement House provides comprehensive and significant outreach to a large sector of St Louis... Recently Grace Hill steerheaded a program to create "idle-free" zones and encourage school bus drivers to turn off their idling engines while waiting for children.  Grace Hill also obtained grants to assist in the retrofitting of school bus engines to further reduce dangerous emissions.  Members of Grace Hill help local industries in identifying environmental dangers, especially around our waterways (the Mississippi River) to improve our land around the waterways and the waterways themselves.  Grace Hill works with the Americorp Trail Ranger Project... cleaning up the St Louis River front and planting native species of grasses to reclaim those areas badly damaged by governmental and private industry.  Last year Grace Hill started a grass-roots effort to engage the public and especially our older residents in making their own "green" household cleaners...  Their work in public education and environmental clean-up implementation is outstanding.
Shiloh Christian Childrens Ranch Inc	235135		/users/profile/313563	Lisa415	Volunteer	5	12/08/2014	My sister has been a houseparent at Shiloh for almost 20 years now.  She has been a loving mother to over 40 kids, many of whom have gone on now to have kids of their own that she considers her grandkids.  I've watched kids come into her house who were suicidal, ones who were abused, and ones who were refugees from other countries.  Each one is shown the love of Christ, love most of them haven't had in their lives.  They are given the limits and discipline that all kids need, and taught respect themselves and respect others.   Financially, the group are very good stewards of the investment you make in the kids.  The needs of the kids are well taken care of, but the houseparents also budget for some treats as well to make sure that the kids build special memories of family life while they are there.  It takes some skilled budgeting sometimes, but the smiles are well worth it.

I had suffered from anger, guilt, very low self esteem and shame for over 36years. I attended the Her Choice To Heal classes then attended their Reconciliation Weekend Retreat which gave my unborn baby a memorial service which was truly amazing!!!!! I've learned that this ministry has a biblical mandate Isaiah 61:1-3. Their vision is to enable abortion wounded women, men and families to live authentic, abundant lives. Mobilizing them for kingdom expanding work. I would urge anyone who knows or has experienced an abortion to check out INFG.org. I truly am a changed woman, I am giving back to those who facilitated my healing and wanting with my whole heart to tell as many people as God will allow that there is hope and a brighter future ahead!!

They personally took the gifts to each Veteran and thanked each one for his or her service to our country.  The smiles on their faces were the only thank you they wanted.  This July 11th TFO will have a  poker run to benefit the veterans at the Warrensburg, MO Veteran's home.  I support our Veterans through TFO.  Please join us.   Margaret Sammons

SPRINGFIELD ANIMAL ADVOCACY FOUNDATION	105886		/users/profile/142338	eclecsions	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/03/2012	As the administrator of the Environmental Health section, which oversees animal control services for the city of Springfield, I  have first hand knowledge of the work performed by our partner agency SAAF.  We have worked together since the first day of their opening to promote responsible pet ownership by encouraging people to spay or neuter their pets.  Animal control sees first hand what happens when pets are free to roam and breed.  It is a constant struggle to find rescues to take our animals to be placed in new homes.  This past year we were lucky enough to receive $35,000 from city council to pay for S/N surgeries for animals pulled from our shelter.  The majority of the animals pulled have had their surgery performed at SAAF.  With the reduced price for surgery, we are able to S/N more animals.

American Rehabilitation Ministry Inc	49225	5	/users/profile/50481	rob10	Board Member	5	08/05/2010	As a Board member of ARM, I have been extremely impressed with all of their staff and the wonderful ministry they provide.  The US has more prisoners than any other country in the world, and ARM provides free Bibles, through their partnership with the American Bible Society, to about 125,000 of those prisoners.  ARM has also provided hundreds of thousands of free Bible study courses, and millions of free Dayspring greeting cards to the prisoners. I know that ARM is a very efficient and effective organization, with low overhead.  ARM also does great ministry in other countries like Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Korea, Cambodia, and other sensitive countries.  You should join me in giving to the American Rehabilitation Ministries!

Della Lamb Community Services	233778	1	/users/profile/297717	Jenny75	Volunteer	5	11/16/2014	I was a Della Lamb volunteer at thanksgiving and Christmas of 2008.  I learned so much about generosity, and working side by side by people from Somalia, Sudan, Taiwan....  I learned that people from these cultures can come together for the common good of the community and work together, in spite of religious beliefs or backgrounds.  I saw them extend so much generosity to the community in Kansas City, and pour out so much kindness, that each year around the holidays, I replay the experience in my mind, and find myself missing them so much.  Just .08$ of every dollar goes to administrative costs.  The rest goes to the community.  If you want to donate to a worthy cause, to a group that goes above and beyond what we think community centers do, then please donate to Della Lamb.  They help people receive their citizenship, they help men and women get their GED's, they feed countless families in the community, they have an amazing Charter school, along with incredible day care facilities.  The staff is amazing and they are good people.  It was a blessing to get to be part of such a wonderful place.  Please consider giving.....

Interfaith Community Services Inc	173018		/users/profile/229060	EBeth	Client Served	5	10/03/2013	I first came to InterServ as a recently unemployed single parent who didn't quite know what to do. My company closed without much warning and no one even got their last paycheck. I had never in my adult life been unemployed and boy did it scare me! I was worried about paying my mortgage and my light bill and still being able to buy groceries and school supplies. InterServ helped me sort out what I owed and helped me figure out what I needed to pay next and what I could put off until I got an unemployment check or a paycheck. I got a huge box of food from the food pantry and some reassurance that I would be okay and my son and daughter would be fine. That was what I needed the most.  Today, I am happily employed in a new field and my kids are fine. I now deliver meals for InterServ a couple times a month with a group I belong to. I joined the group because they do this and I wanted to be able to help someone they way that InterServ helped me. I really don't think I would have been able to get through four months of unemployment without the girls ar InterServ!

Baptist Home Inc	206044		/users/profile/268364	kwiqkarl	Donor	5	07/15/2014	This nonprofit provides care for the elderly that society often forgets about.  You hear about how minimum wage increases help the poor gain a better living.  Most elderly do not receive an increase in their retirement income that relates to the minimum wage increase, so they actually receive a decrease in their purchasing power.  The Baptist Home, without accepting any government funding, provides the care that these elderly individuals need.  The cost of this care far exceeds the donations received an most years.  When many "charities" struggle to spend $.05 of every $1.00 raised, The Baptist Home usually provides well over $1.00 in unreimbursed care for every $1.00 donated.  The cost of raising funds is also much lower than most organizations.  I make a donation every two weeks to help support this ministry.

My husband and I liked it so much that we returned almost every weekend to play golf and enjoy the Clubhouse and the many ammenities.After the first couple of visits, we started looking at houses in the area for sale.  We found the perfect home on one of the 16 lakes in this area and moved here.  We joined the TDL Country Club when we bought our home and quickly made many friends and neighbors.       If you are looking for a pristine area that offers 2 fabulous golf courses, swimming, tennis and tons of social activities, TDL is the place for you.       My husband said this is the only place he ever moved into that he felt he was "HOME" from the first moment on.

Oakdell Homes Association	163184		/users/profile/216626	Charles33	Board Member	4	07/21/2013	52 homes and one of the best little neighborhoods in Kansas City. One end borders the Indian Creek Greenspace and Bike trail. Homes Assoc is voluntary and about 50% pay 25 $ dues, more participate. BBQ in June, Ice Cream Social in Sept. , Firepit and smores party in Nov., Chili Supper in Feb. at the Fire station at 99th and Holmes. Very peaceful and everyone is friendly and easy-going. About half retired and half young families. This is between Wornall and Holmes, near Watts mill Shopping, Ward Parkway mall. Best access to 435 and the plaza from the south. Organization was formed in 1988 to keep an apartment complex from using our quiet little cul-de-sac as a back entrance.  We are OK on the list of streets to be cleared of snow and we have curbs and sidewalks.  Street is smooth and .37 miles around the circle. It is used by several as a walking track.  The long Indian creek bike trail is close with a pedestrian easement that we keep mowed better than the city does. Our houses sell faster than average.  We have had two foreclosures and two houses that had very elderly residents who had to move and the sale was handled by an estate, these houses needed serious updating from 1970's decor. That brings down the comparable prices in the neighborhood but is a little misleading. All of these houses were built around 1962.

She has medical problems and can barely walk as it is so now she is not able to go anywhere.  If you are elderly or physically disabled this is not the place for you.

As we sat down to discuss things, I was immediately impressed both by the character and conviction of Alice, the founder. Perhaps their most impressive feat is that for 10 years they have worked entirely with a volunteer staff, filling almost 250 positions each year! Each volunteer has been through their seminar program, called Grace Adventure, and was so positively affected they've returned to help. That speaks volumes about their impact on their clientele. I expect to see them become big news in the next few years.

Gates-To-Heaven Inc	172170	1	/users/profile/227901	LanetteWilliams	Client Served	5	09/27/2013	Gates to Heaven Cemetery offers natural burial and what an awe-inspiring experience. This non-profit cemetery was developed as a permanent memorial of the life shared by Fred and Evelyn Napier raising their children on a simple farm in Southwest Missouri.  Fred and Evelyn were my grandparents and both of their burials were beautiful events.  My grandfather was cremated and his ashes were spread in the wind across the hillside which is now part of the cemetery.  At my grandmother's passing, we had a natural burial.  With natural burial the body is not embalmed and the body must be buried within 24 hours of death.  Freddy, their youngest son, cares for the cemetery and he dug the burial site.  My father, a son to Fred and Evelyn, my mother and myself were honored with preparing grandma's body for the burial.    Wrapping her frail body in a shroud and making the moment respectful of her life and death was in some ways a joy and was definitely a closure to our earthly time together.  I will never forget the love that this bond in life and in death awarded.

Missouri River Relief	84637	1	/users/profile/93914	Stefer1215	Volunteer	5	04/01/2011	We had the best time working with the Missouri River Relief efforts last year. We found this agency to be well organized and had fantastic communication skills. They made sure we were updated on the progress and the outcome of our efforts. We used it as a community service project for our agency (Juvenile Office) and everyone enjoyed it. It is no easy task to appease juveniles who are being forced to attend. We appreciated Missouri River Relief staff being so courteous. I would highly recommend everyone take a day to help them with their efforts. We found it to be a perfect way to spend time helping the community while still having a little fun by seeing what unusual items other groups found in their areas.  
Christian Childrens Ministry Of Tri County	272565		/users/profile/361634	lahbrooks1	Board Member	5	11/20/2015	I have been involved with Strong Tower Ranch for 13 years and have seen the lives of children, family and staff changed because of the outpouring of love that comes from the staff of this ministry.  They are welcoming, friendly and loving.  They greet visitors, no matter what their background, with acceptance and immediately make them feel at home.  The equine programs draw in people from all over who love horses.  Many of the horses have been rescued and given a new start from a background of neglect, abuse and abandonment.  These horses, who were once deemed unworthy in a very competitive field, are now used to help children, teens and adults also find purpose, healing and renewal in a sometimes very harsh world.  The minute you walk on to the property of Strong Tower Ranch there is a sense of peace that comes from a God who desires a relationship, desires healing and desires to give all a regenerated spirit through His son Jesus.  The evidence is in the smiles, the tears and the testimony of each set of footprints left on this property.

American Red Cross	286720		/users/profile/376790	Cheryl_J	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Pluggy is a robot that is programmed to teach fire safety to young children.  Red Cross takes him to pre-schools, fairs, K-3rd grade classrooms, etc. because young children need to be coached about what to do if a fire breaks out.  They are likely victims because they are usually separated from their grown-ups overnight and they hide when they are scared.  Mr. Les was the voice of Pluggy for many years, but he always lamented about the fact that in disaster preparedness you never really knew if you were helping.  Every year children still died in fires.  Every presentation you still had children not seeming to pay attention and doing their own thing, but Pluggy did save one life and it is an inspiration to me and I hope it is to you.  I draw my inspiration for giving of my time and money from this story:Mr. Les was cleaning up after a parking lot fair one day.  As he put Pluggy in the truck of his car, a woman came screaming across the parking lot, 'Wait Mr. Less, Mr. Les!!'He turned around and said, 'Do I know you?'She replied, 'I want to tell you how Pluggy saved my life.'As Les got visions of Pluggy pulling her out of a burning building and shrugged them out with a smile he said, 'You are going to have to explain what you mean.'She began, 'My son saw your presentation at his preschool last year.  He brought home the color book you gave him.  He was so excited and I read every page to him.  Well, it helped us make an escape plan in the process of working through the color book and we practiced the plan with his older brother so all would know what to do.  Two weeks later, we had a bad fire in the house.  The plan worked brilliantly.  The 3 of us gathered in the front yard under the oak tree - safe.'I looked down at my son and said, 'You stay here with your older brother.  I am going to go fetch some of our stuff.'He latched on to my leg and said, 'Mommy, Pluggy says don't go!'I said, 'Yes it is bad for you to go back in, but he does not mean this for grown-ups.  I have to go.  We are going to lose everything!'He said with big crocodile tears in his eyes, 'But Pluggy says don't go!'I finally got him to release his grip and stay with his brother.  I got half way up the sidewalk to our house when the roof caved in.  If he had not stopped me I would have been inside and both of my young children would have watched me die.I know our disaster preparedness programs are important and it takes volunteers who give their time to do these lifesaving presentations and it takes donors to help fund these programs with the supplies necessary to make the training stick.

Jamestown New Horizons	254513		/users/profile/342861	DocJ	Board Member	5	08/31/2015	Jamestown New Horizons (JNH) offers outstanding horse riding service to children and adults with disabilities. Located in Florissant, Mo. (St. Louis area), the beautiful setting and dedicated staff provide an overall professional and relaxing atmosphere for the students in the program. JNH has been in existence for 31 years, and through extensive training of the volunteers in the program and the special care given to each rider in each lesson they can boast a flawless safety record. I highly recommend JNH to anyone looking to get their child into a top-notch therapeutic horse riding program, my child was in the program and the benefits she received at a young age have helped her develop into the responsible, confident adult she is today. Their lesson fees are reasonable compared to the national average, and well worth every penny. Visit their website to learn more about this wonderful program www.jnh-goneriding.org. 
Dent County Animal Welfare Society	48624	1	/users/profile/49756	michele15	Volunteer	5	07/23/2010	DCAWS may be a small, rural shelter but it has made great accomplishments.  They are essentially a no-kill shelter having a lower euthanasia rate than most larger organizations with larger budgets. The dedicated group of staff and volunteers are committed to the animals in their care as well as educating others about proper pet care and the importance of spay and neuter.  Adoptions are done out of the shelter in Salem but the majority of adoptions are accomplished in the St. Louis area at various adoption events.  The Director makes the long trip with a van full of dogs almost every weekend and there are several dogs and cats in foster care in the St. Louis area.  DCAWS has a small operating budget that relies soley on donations.  If you donate money for food or vet care then that is what it is used for.  This is an honest organization with a true passion for helping animals.

The Lincoln School is the only African American  landmark in Audrain County on the Natl Historical Registry.  The community is not the most diversified and other than the African American support doesn't recieve many local donations. Though the board continues to strive forward with the monthly chicken dinners, dues, and applying for grants the desire is still strong to see this restoration become a reality.  Recently the local DAR donated to the purchase of a flag pole , which will be erected in the spring. Please be aware that Lincoln School is  not only Black History, but Vandalia History.
Midwest Biomedical Research Foundation	237158	1	/users/profile/321536	Vet6970	Donor	5	01/22/2015	This foundation was created to fund the research section at the Kansas City VA Hospital.  With out it there would be no research.  The government doesn't just give them money because they are the VA research.  They research many health problems that the Veterans have.  I am a Vietnam Vet that is fighting for my life.  I have Stage 4 Prostate Cancer, and so I give to the Prostate Cancer Research.  There are so many things that they research and when they discover something new it also benefits the public also.  The research on using an aspirin a day for you heart was done at the Kansas City VA and now people benefit from it all over the world.  My mother is alive today because of a pacemaker that she has.  The VA invented it.  Many more things have come from the VA Research.  Giving to this Foundation is a good investment for the country's health.

Multiple Options Inc	121810		/users/profile/165749	mommaboy	Advisor	5	09/01/2012	Multiple Options is an organization designed to aid inmates who are re-entering society due to parole or probation.  We offer shelter, meals, aid in finding employment, vocational training and support all in a structured, well monitored environment.  The organization was founded by a man who worked for many years in corrections.  Armed with a vision to reduce recidivism, a working knowledge of the field and considerable resources in the area of employment the stage was set. Multiple Options will aid former inmates with a place to stay, beyond what is currently available to parolees including meals and job and life skills training as they begin the process to get on their feet.  Multiple Options will aid clients to find gainful employment, provide necessary training and education in order to facilitate job searches. Multiple Options will provide a transition toward self-reliance and good decision making, aid with alcohol and drug addiction and also provide shelter for homeless and/or abused women so that, out of desperation to survive and provide for their children they will not have to resort to crime. Multiple Options relies on an understanding that helping ex-offenders is not preferential treatment but rather a move to a safer and more productive society.  Recidivism is a fact; given he proper attention, ex-offenders can re-enter society and become productive instead of the alternative: returning to (possible violent) crime.  A Florida study conducted in 2001 shows that inmates were most likely to re-offend within the first six months after release.

Their mission to help mend and strengthen broken families through relationship building with missing father's cannot be overstated or underestimated.  The social, emotional, and economic health of a community is in direct correlation to the state of its families.  If we want stronger communities we must not ignore its fundamental component - the family.  The children that benefit from this effort help to make us better socially and economically, both now and far into the future.  The impact their making is fast receiving recognition both locally and as a model for others nationally.  Please visit their website to learn more.

Clowder House Foundation Inc	158854	1	/users/profile/210848	Sonali_m	Volunteer	5	05/27/2013	Clowder House is a unique cat shelter in St Louis.  This is a retirement home for cats.  When people can no longer take care of their cats because of life events, or any other reason, Clowder House welcomes them.  This is a true no-kill shelter.  Every cat that is accepted here is given full care for the rest of his/her life.  They also accept rescued cats when fund allow for it.  Cats will be up or adoption if the owners request it. The first time I entered Clowder House, I immediately fell in love with the place.  There are >275 cats in the building.  The place is run entirely by volunteers.  This means they have many dedicated volunteers coming in every day to clean every room, clean every litter box, wash every water bowl and replace with fresh water, and fill every food bowl.  A lot of the cats are on medications, or need special diet.  The volunteers make sure their individual needs are taken care of. I used to spend my best day of the week here. After an entire week of busy work schedule, I would go there every weekend to relax and forget every stress as I spent a few hours with the cats.  The few hours I spent cleaning at Clowder House was truly rewarding.  The cats really appreciate what the volunteers do for them.  Many of them are constant companions while volunteers do their work.  After I  cleaned the room and put out fresh food and water, it was really rewarding to see how every cat would come by and have a drink of clean water, eat, and then go and take a nap on the clean beds.   Each cat has free love and hugs to offer.  Since all of them come from a loving home, they crave human affection.  Every time I was there, I made sure I spent at least some time playing with them and hugging them.   The volunteers who work here are an extremely fun group of people.  All of us worked hard, but we were constantly having fun.  Unfortunately my work situation required me to move out of St Louis and if there is one thing I miss about STL, it is Clowder House and the enormous unconditional love of the cats.  If you live in St Louis and are looking for a rewarding and fun volunteering experience, stop by Clowder House.  You will LOVE IT!!

Friends Of Abilities First Inc	286671	1	/users/profile/376741	Tamara_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Friends of Abilities First raises money for--and educates the community aboutpeople with developmental disabilities in Greene County, Missouri.  They are the friends of Abilities First, (working name for the Greene County Board for Developmental Disabilities). The hundreds of people whom they serve every month each have their own unique story; I would like to share with you just one of those stories that has been shared with me,  and I believe you will become one of their champions just as I have!  This is a true story; the names have been changed to protect the privacy of the family. Donnie is the legal guardian of his younger brother, Roger. Let me start by telling you about Donnie, who was propelled into the role of head of the household at a very early age, probably fourteen, maybe younger.  Donnies father, Bennie, already in his eighties when Donnie was born, was a strict disciplinarian.  In fact, people who remember him will tell you he was meaner than a junk yard dog. Donnie remembers one occasion when, as punishment for some transgression, his dad made him take off his clothes, after which Bennie soaked his sons body with bug spray. Burned like hell, Donnie remarked.  But, incredible as it may seem, Donnie holds no animosity toward his father.  In fact, some ten years after his death at age ninety-three, the room in which the old man died has been locked and never again opened.  Why?  Because Bennie left instructions that it was to be that way. And Donnie never considered anything other than to comply. So it is that Donnie, his wife, his son, his mother and Roger, all live together in the little family home with the room that is never again to be entered. To help you understand why I feel so moved to be a part of the work that Friends of Abilities First does, I must fill in a few more details.  Donnies mother has always been, or became so as a result of being married to the infamous Bennie, shall we say--a hard woman.  Once she threw a glass of water in Sheryls (Donnies wife) face just because she wanted to. But she is quite elderly, and nothing is done to alter her behaviornot by Donnie or by Sheryl.  Then there is Donnies fourteen-year-old son, Lil Donnie.  Lil Donnie is slow, (as the family puts it), and does not understand why he is forced go to school. He has been put back a year--or maybe two-- and is suspended  (much to his delight)  on a regular basis. He reasons that his dad didnt finish school, and he does all right working as an aide in a nursing home. His father explains that he quit school to care for his ailing father, to keep him from being put in a nursing home.  And because he didnt get to complete his education, Donnie exerts every kind of effort to keep his son in schoolmoving him to a different district when he must, imploring teachers to give him another chance, and literally delivering him to the school door to make sure he actually goes in. Donnies wife, his third wifewhy would anyone stay for long?is a fragile woman with a heart condition.  She has suffered a lot of abuse in her life.  Living in a home with a roof over her head, even if it occasionally leaks, knowing where her next meal is coming from, is enough to keep her reasonably content.  But, now, you should know a little more about the house. Its really a tiny little shack; in place of ceiling tile, Donnie has stapled black plastic. The floors are bare wood, splintered and rotted in some places, but Donnie always finds a way to shore up the defects and keep the family relatively safe from falling through.  There is not actually enough room in the house for the whole family, so Donnie and Sheryl sleep in a shed in the back yard, furnished to look, for all practical purposes, like a bedroom.  Remember, one room in the tiny house is perpetually locked, never again to be opened. 
Paws 4 Autism	274877	3	/users/profile/364402	floebe2822	Client Served	5	12/23/2015	My son with high-functioning ASD, anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder has gotten a service dog from Paws4Autism.  It has changed his life, he went from missing large portions of the school day (in office or sensory room) and almost being dismissed from school, not because he was bad or fighting but because they couldn't provide him the resources he needed.  Once Jason (his service dog) started school he dropped from 1-1 para to a half-time para and days without leaving the class once.  We got to stop his medicine to help him sleep at night, Jason sleeps with him and he can go to sleep without the meds.  When he does get overwhelmed, he and Jason can regroup and go back to participating, before Jason that would be us leaving or giving up for the rest of the day to recover.Paws4Autism was an amazing organization to work with.  Prior to working with them to get Jason, neither my husband or I had ever had a dog, so we didn't know basic information about dog training/caring for a dog, let alone  what you need to do to work with a trained service dog.  They worked with us on every step (making sure dog sits before meal, never thought of that) to how to work with Jason and my son when there is a melt-down.  They provided us all the resources we need to maintain the training.  When it was time to start school, they met with the school, gave the teachers training and resources, answered any and all questions and spent 3-full days on-site to help teachers/staff/administration adjust to their first service dog.  The process was seamless due to the extra effort of this organization.Paws4Autism was one of the lowest cost service dogs we found, but they also had several activities throughout the year, they set up and hosted where you could help or bring family/friends to help fundraise for your child directly.  When we did have our own fundraiser they attend and gave their presence and support.

It is an amazing group of people who give their time and share their love of "fur babies" with so many families and their beloved pets. Our animals are not just pets, they are family. They are the epitome of unconditional love and exercise it daily. I have had the pleasure to get to know and deliver much needed food/supplies to many of our applicants. I have come to call them all family. I am always touched and overwhelmed by the appreciation of our help in their time of need. Whether it be expressed by tears of joy, hugs or prayers from the people, the ultimate payment is the typical shower of love and kisses from their pets, this  is what keeps me working so hard and dedicated to continue out our mission. We do amazing things here at Republic Paw Pantry and we have amazing donors, sponsors and supporters, who help us carry our mission out daily. We could not do it with out the tremendous support of such an amazing community. 
Pages And Chapters	286753		/users/profile/376823	Tiffany_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The Rewards of Giving Back to Pages & Chapters  pagesandchapters.orgI began working with Pages & Chapters in 2013, two years after the official start up.  Pages & Chapters is a literacy nonprofit based in Kansas City, Missouri, with a vision of providing support, resources, and encouragement to Title 1 families in order to foster critical literacy skills in existing family units.  They do this by hosting a program called Open Books, which is family literacy workshops offered to K-5 students and their parents.  The main idea is for parents and kids to work together to practice literacy strategies in a workshop-type setting.  The Open Books curriculum is available for free download on their website for community members or teachers to implement.  The last three years with this nonprofit are the most rewarding years of my life.  I have learned so much about what it takes to foster a love of reading and about how important literacy skills are to everyday life.  Because of my time with Pages & Chapters, I give to them as much as I possibly can.  The time and effort put in by all the individuals who help to write the curriculum, run the Open Books workshops, and who keep spreading the love of reading, inspires me to give back.  It costs each school that runs Open Books $400 and it is vital to keep Open Books in current schools, plus spread awareness to even more schools.  It means so much to give back to this nonprofit because I can see the happiness on a childs face after completing a session of Open Books with improvements to their literacy skills.  It is the most rewarding feeling having a child read a book that they were unable to read just a few weeks before.  I give back to Pages & Chapters because children are the future and I know that Pages & Chapters is the best opportunity they have for a successful one.

A 'Foster Fail' means that I just couldn't let the little pup I fostered be adopted by anyone other than me!    So I officially have adopted a cute little pup and also foster a little 10 yr old Chihuahua with congestive heart failure.  I've been volunteering with Needy Paws Rescue for about 7 months and this organization is the best!  They rescue any breed dog and find them at the St Louis City/County Animal Control, rescue strays throughout the area and accept surrendered dogs when a family can no longer care for their dog.  If you are looking for any specific dog breed or want a specific temperament that gets along with kids,  dogs or cats, checkout their website:  www.needypaws.org.  Send in a inquiry and someone will contact you.  They have so many different types and ages that you will find that perfect fit!
Playing For The Cause	286799		/users/profile/376869	Lynn_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Connecting Musicians and Fans with Causes that Matter. www.playingforthecause.orgIn May 2013  I went to see a band whose bass players daughter, who is the same age as my own, has a brain tumor and receives treatment at St. Jude.  A few weeks later, the band put out a video chronicling a day in the life of this little girl and asking fans to text to give $10 to St. Jude.  As a music fan and professional fundraiser, I thought there could be a more effective way to harness the relationship between musicians and fans to raise money for worthy organizations. This thought led me to use my own money to form Playing for the Cause. Playing for the Cause is a 501(c)3 grant-making organization specializing in philanthropic branding, crowd-funding, and charitable management for musicians. The concept is simple: Touring musicians pick a cause to support throughout a tour, then ask fans to donate via a mobile platform and local organizations supporting the chosen cause apply to receive funds raised at the concerts. By leveraging the relationship between musicians and fans we  provide a new source of funding for local nonprofits that so many of you support, we will reinforce the philanthropic culture, make a positive impact in the lives of thousands of people, bring musicians closer to their fans, and revolutionize the way the music industry approaches philanthropy.

Warriors Heart Foundation	193157		/users/profile/252300	ktorretta	Board Member	5	01/27/2014	     We built this program on the belief that Horses want to bond with and please their human contacts. Horses want to help us. Building a connection of trust with a horse is a very self-satisfying experience as you have this 1000# wild animal responding to your thoughts and actions. Being a flight animal, the horse is very perceptive to the energy and emotion which a human brings to the relationship. Mirroring often takes place and adjustments need to be made on the human side. This is where the benefit comes in. If we, as humans, can learn how to control and develop out emotional being in a more positive, productive, and beneficial way, then, we have gained a powerful tool to success in today's society.     I have seen this happen. I have felt this happen. I have seen and felt the change occur. We hope to share this powerful experience with our warriors, both men and women, as a tool to help them re-integrate into society as productive and well-adjusted human beings.
