Chewonki Foundation Inc	186783	4	/users/profile/243788	Renny Little	Advisor	5	10/31/2013	If you are looking for an organization dedicated to environmental education for students of all ages, look no further than the 501(c)(3) Chewonki Foundation in Wiscasset, Maine.  It will meet your highest expectations (as it has mine), whether your interest is in a summer camp for boys or girls on a 400n acre Roger Tory Peterson Sanctuary on the Maine coast, or to study  up-to-date methods to conserve energy. Programs, led by well trained knowledgeable leaders, stress community building and foundation owned properties throughout Maine offer many ecological habitats for study. They are reached by hikes, boats and kayaks. It has been a pleasure to be associated with Chewonki for over over 70 years as a camper, counselor, board member and advisor. My time there led to advanced degrees and  professional positions in environmental education.

My sons have had the challenging and rewarding experience of participating in Wilderness Trips.  And we have a soon-to-be-Semester student in the house!I had the privilege of volunteering in the Development Office for about 3 weeks.  I remain impressed w/ Chewonki's crystal clear mission statement,  generous scholarship awards and the exceptional quality of people that Chewonki attracts and retains. 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	185657	1	/users/profile/242627	outdoors01	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Chewonki fosters an appreciation for the simple things, for the environment, for meeting a challenge head on, and for living and working in community with others. This appreciation often shifts a person's (especially a young person's) entire worldview. This is the magic of Chewonki.  You hear over and over and over again: former Chewonki participants say that Chewonki has changed their lives. It changed my life. 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	185649	3	/users/profile/242617	Caitlin C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	Never before have I been a part of such a caring and thoughtful community. Both camps (in Wiscasset and at Fourth Debsconeag) attract the most interesting and inspiring people from all around the globe, and I am honored to say that I worked there for two summers. Every trip leader and staff person I have met at Chewonki puts all of their energy and passion into each day. The Chewonki Foundation is an exceptional community filled with beautiful people. I hope to return to Chewonki as a trip leader again. I would hope too that those unfamiliar to this place would come and join us for the days to come!

After graduating from their semester program, I went on to join their Girls Camp leadership program and later became staff. The lessons that I learned at Chewonki will stay with me forever; more than technical wilderness skills, I learned how to listen, to create and foster community, and to lead others to their own self-discovery. All this because of the outstanding staff and programming at Chewonki.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	184938	1	/users/profile/241873	pchatfield2	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	Chewonki is a fantastic organization that I hope to stay involved with. One of their programs is a Semester  School for high school juniors, of which I was a student this past spring. It was one of the best things I've ever done! 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	184740	3	/users/profile/241681	grapes101	Client Served	5	10/29/2013	The Chewonki Foundation changed the way I will live my life forever. I went for a semester last year and learned about the importance of finding my true self, exploring the world, how to truly enjoy learning, and it taught me so much about agriculture. The people that are a part of this Foundation have hearts bigger than anyone I have ever met. They are experts in what they teach and their goal is to truly better this world and create leaders that will make a change. I will always go back to Chewonki knowing it is my home and where I found people that cared whole heartedly about me and the things I love. A feeling like that does not come easily and requires a lot of thought and skill. This is such a wonderful foundation in every way shape and form. 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	184565	1	/users/profile/241502	rmarvil	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	The Chewonki Foundation has educated and inspired young people for almost 100 years!  I was a student in a year-round program in 1975, a wilderness trip participant, a wilderness trip leader and now a board member.  Much of what I did in my professional and academic life hails back to what I learned about myself and the interests I developed at Chewonki.  The foundation has a wonderful, vast campus and fantastic staff.  Its teachers lead by example to impart their reverence and knowledge of the natural world, high school academics, wilderness adventures and leadership - the list goes on.  I, like most folks who've had the good fortune of being in a program at Chewonki, was transformed by my experiences there.

Granted, I am one to believe that every experience you have changes your life in some way, but Chewonki changed mine in a significant and positive way.  I have experienced the organization in a few different capacities: I was a semester student during my junior year of high school--a program that provides value for almost anyone, from anywhere.  We worked and learned and explored in atypical ways, and I will certainly never forget those four months.  I keep in touch with my classmates and teachers equally.  Secondly, I participated in Chewonki's Wilderness Leadership Expedition during the summer after the Semester School.  I got a taste of what is a virtually unmatched wilderness trip program for teens, and was able to learn a great deal about white water canoeing technique, as well as leadership skills and wilderness medical training.  It sounds clich but I think I'm going to say it anyway: Chewonki builds an extremely strong bond among its community, such that wherever I go, if I meet a Chewonki person, I know we will have more than enough to talk about

The experience taught me to believe in the inherent value of my individuality, and to recognize my capacity to work for socially responsible changes in the world. It drove me to alter my list of colleges to apply to, switch majors, and pursue a career path I wouldn't have considered before.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	184113	1	/users/profile/241054	relmore27	Donor	5	10/29/2013	Chewonki has had a profound influence on my life and three of my children as well.  When I think of my years as a camper and counselor two words come to mind joy and core values. From its very beginnings in 1915, the people who serve this incredible organization as teachers, volunteers, cooks, managers, etc. have found ways to expose participants to the joy of being with and learning from the lessons nature provides. We have all benefited from the experiences of jointing together in community  to become better responsible citizens. I recommend a Chewonki experience to anyone seeking a safe place where people genuinely care for each other while providing ample room for joyful experience and personal growth. Not many organizations stay in business for a hundred years. I takes a successful track record to stay in business this long. And with the continuing support of all those who are touched by its good work I pray for another successful 100 years.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	184035	1	/users/profile/240972	Terry45	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I have been volunteering since November 2011. I come to Chewonki for one day(sometimes two) a week to help create The Chewonki Archives. Chewonki was founded almost one hundred years ago. It is a really fun project as we have amazing albums, photographs, the papers of the founder Clarence Allen, plus movies, audio and memorabilia. All the staff at Chewonki are so positive and enthusiastic, it is a joy to be part of the organization. As I am there so much, I have gotton to know many people and work together. Chewonki lives the values that it is teaching, and being part of that is what makes volunteering at Chewonki great. We listen to each other and respect each other. The people that work at Chewonki are cheerful, caring and always ready to help each other and pitch in. We have dish crew where everyone takes turns cleaning up after lunch. Usually 5 people have signed up and its actually really fun, because everyone is working together in harmony. 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	184028	1	/users/profile/240965	Zannie	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	We discovered Chewonki for our sons through Boys Camp and Wilderness Trips. Not only did the boys have a great time through repeat programs but they also learned about themselves, the natural world, and the community of people - especially counselors and program directors - who loved their company and their universe, who formed honest, personal relations with the boys. We now have personal experience with nearly all of Chewonki's programs through the friends and family we have introduced to its programs. I became involved to give back but it's Chewonki that gives back so generously to me.  My hope as a board member is that we can keep Chewonki strong  - and help make it even stronger - while making its programs available to even more children, teens and adults. Chewonki is a superb advocate for a joyful but also a thoughtful, intentional relationship to social communities and the natural world. The world needs Chewonki and I am so very honored to be a small part of such a powerful and transformative organization. There are many best parts of Chewonki but one of the very best of all that superiority is the people. 
Chewonki Foundation Inc	183864	1	/users/profile/6032	Isabelle	Advisor	5	10/28/2013	What makes Chewonki a great organization is the people who lead it, and the space where you are when you help at Chewonki. My most memorable afternoon in recent years was when I turned myself over to the staff at the farm and did what I was told. I had a chance to help prepare a field (and learn the difference between rock walls in New England), collect eggs from the hens (and have one for breakfast the next day) and milk a cow! The sky above us that beautiful afternoon is not one I will soon forget. And the lessons I learned from Megan are not soon forgotten!

Chewonki Foundation Inc	183746	1	/users/profile/240658	bmccallum	Advisor	5	10/28/2013	Chewonki simply does good work.  My experience with Chewonki includes attending the Chewonki Semester School, leading wilderness trips, and serving as an Advisor.  More than any other organization I have encountered Chewonki does one critical thing very well.  It is conscientious and intentional about pursuing programs that achieve its mission.  While this may be a high-level success, it is extremely rare among non-profits and for-profits alike.  Luckily for its students, the adherence to Chewonki's mission comes without pretension or dogma, and it translates into extremely impactful, educational, and fun experiences in the outdoors.  I don't know anyone who has left their Chewonki experience without feeling enriched and challenged to live a more intentional and conscientious life of their own.   
Chewonki Foundation Inc	183743	1	/users/profile/240656	Sue Stafford	Advisor	5	10/28/2013	I'm the parent of a Chewonki Semester School student - that was over 20 years ago.  Chewonki changed my son's life.  He learned what it means to be a trusted member of a community, learned to be a steward of the natural world, and found an outlet for his quirky sense of humor.  I'm happy to say that he never recovered from the experience.  He returned to work as a camp counselor for many years,  a math intern, and the IT person.  My husband and I have been Chewonki enthusiasts for years, and two years ago I became an Advisor to the organization.  I've heard wonderful things about the girl's camp, and look forward to seeing granddaughter become a camper.  Chewonki manages to stay true to its mission while at the same time keeping pace with changes in technology, educational pedagogy, and environmental pressures.  It is just a magnificent organization!

Chopping the wood for their cabin wood stove, gathering eggs and milking the cow for breakfast, working on global warming issues - forming a community of caring, well educated stewards to lead their generation in finding solutions to problems my generation and prior have wrestled with is a great outcome of the Chewonki experience.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	183577		/users/profile/240489	davidliebmann	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Chewonki changes lives.  I first became involved with Chewonki as a young teacher more than twenty years ago, and I  think of the lessons I learned there as my second graduate degree, or far better, the place that best taught me about how to treat other people, how to pursue intellectual passions, and how to better live in balance with the natural world.  I was always an outdoorsy person, but Chewonki taught me to look at and listen to the natural world with more precise senses just as it taught me how to be a caring teacher and a hardworking colleague.  Chewonki is always my gold standard for what it means to work in a healthy job, but more than that, it defines what a strong, vibrant community can be.

My outlook on life and personal rules of community were learned and developed from my experiences at this organization. I have had children who have experienced and been changed by Chewonki. Currently, I have a grandson who took up white water kayaking at Chewonki only now to find himself accepted by professional kayakers on the west coast. His ability to interact, learn from and be fully accepted by these professional is due to the lessons from Chewonki. I have also helped several Maine islanders to take various programs at Chewonki and have been amazed by their professional development and love of learning due to this organization. Through the years I am continually amazed to watch how the Chewonki experience seeps into the psyche of all who experience this amazing organization.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	118943		/users/profile/161720	Misha V.	Client Served	5	07/20/2012	Where do I start raving about Chewonki? I was a 4 year tripper and before that went to Chewonki's old sister camp, ALC for 5 years. My experience at Chewonki started even before that. My mom worked in the offices there, and as a kid, there was nothing I would rather than run around campus with the other staff kids, playing games in the woods and sneaking popsicles from the kitchen. The 2 years that she worked there were some of the best of my childhood. I also did the vacation day camps every year, at least twice year, for probably 3 years. I remember falling into the farm's duck pond, building igloos, playing Camouflage in the woods, and assembling the skeleton of a whale. Not only was I getting incredible hands on learning experience from a young age, I also was having the time of my life. The same was true when I was on wilderness trips. I started on a trip that has since been stopped due to the founding of the Chewonki Girls Camp (which I can't say I have any experience with). It was an all girls 3 week canoeing trip. We lived in a yurt on base camp of 2 weeks, while doing day paddles, and then canoed down river for the last week. It was the perfect transition for me. After that trip, I wanted to challenge myself more, so for the next three years, I did a different type of trip every year. Sea kayaking, white water kayaking, and a hiking/canoeing combo trip were my choices. Those trips led me to some of the most amazing people I have ever met in my life. My leaders were inspiring, approachable, funny and super caring on every trip. My trip mates, despite differences in social status, age, and race, all bonded together as a family. On trips, you are a part of something bigger than you realize. After a few days, you fall so easily into your new trip life that you don't realize that is making a stronger, more thoughtful, and happier version of yourself. Even when a day seems like the worst you've ever had, you'll wake up in morning knowing that you made it through and that gives a feeling that is indescribably empowering. I had my fair share of tough days on every trip. My first year, while portaging a canoe for a couple miles, me and my partner lost our grips and the canoe came tumbling down.. on my face. Though my nose has never looked quite as straight, I look back on that day and laugh about how miserable I was, because I know that it really wasn't that bad of a day after the pain stopped. My experience at Chewonki really shaped me into a better person, with a love for everything around me. Despite the fact that I haven't been able to do trips for the past two years, I still carry everything I've learned with me. Chewonki gave me a sense of motivation and personal strength that has benefited my life in every way. I hope to work there next summer as support staff at the boys camp, so that I can give back at least a fraction of the amazing guidance I received as a camper, and to be able to be surround the strongest, happiest community I have ever been a part of once again. To all parents and prospective campers that have managed to read all the way through this, I want you to know that Chewonki has a place for everyone. The best choice I ever made was going, and finding out just how life changing a summer camp can really be.

He has grown from an awkward, impulsive, quirky little boy, into a helpful, compassionate,  and responsible 13 year old who has the confidence to try new things, make new friends,  and express his ideas.  Each year his councilors and activity leaders have serve as amazing positive role models for him as he explores his developing self.  He will tell anyone who is listing that he love's Chewonki.  Over the past few years, he has learned to eat salad, how to manage his emotions when hiking and discovering you are NOT there yet, found his power in a paddle, and a love of Archery.  We're excited to see what stories he returns with this summer!
Chewonki Foundation Inc	59632		/users/profile/64527	Mary Morrison	General Member of the Public	1	01/07/2011	Review of Chewonki Camp for Girls.  Our daughter attended this camp in the summer of 2009. We would NOT recommend this camp.  Unlike the Boys Camp, the Girls Camp is far more rigid with emphasis on areas one would not expect. Focusing on a girls willingness to try what the camp defines as delicious food rather than a girl developing independence to make ones own choices is one example.  We will focus on the rigid rules around food because it is unexpected when one is choosing a camp and this rigidity extends to other aspects of how the girls camp is run.  Food was a particular concern of ours due to a diagnosed medical condition diagnosed at a leading Childrens Hospital that limits the variety of foods our daughter can eat.  She needs simply cooked foods with no spices or strong textures. The camp director, Genell Vashro, said that alternatives would be provided to her.  While the camp did provide alternative to vegans, it did not to our daughter. Instead, we assume the director made a judgment that our daughters condition was actually pickiness and arrogantly thought that by forcing our daughter to eat the camps food, her condition would disappear. Even when a food made her physically ill, she was forced to eat that same food again several days later in front of the entire camp. Our daughter adopted a dangerous strategy to eat little until a food appeared that she could tolerate and then she binged. Our daughter was not alone she said. Many girls who did not like the food also did a mild form of fasting and binging. The director assumes that girls who do not like the camps unusual food need  weaning off their addiction to sugar and their expectation of a processed-food diet. We suspect that most, if not all, parents who choose to send their girls to a remote wilderness camp are not feeding their children a processed food diet. Be sure to read Food meets Philosophy in the fall 2009 newsletter (http://www.chewonki.org/alumni/thechronicle.asp) to understand the policies. We were surprised that the girls receive letters at the end of the summer assessing whether they ate the food heartily. Our daughters letter read: Sometimes you were a bit reluctant to try new things such as food. We hope that you realize and appreciate where our food comes from, and will be willing to try new adventures.   We were stunned that trying new foods was important enough to make it into a letter to our daughter about her camp experiencethat was certainly not one of our goals in sending her to camp!  The camp had many spoken and unspoken rules that lead to a tightly controlled environment. It was not what we hoped for in a camp: It was not a place to spread your wings. After the summer was over, we talked to Genell Vashro, who basically dismissed our concerns.  We then wrote to the president and the Chairman of the Board about our concern about their rigid approach to food as well as other aspects of the camp.  For months and months, we didnt get a reply, despite several phone calls to follow up. Finally, we did have a lengthy phone conversation with the president, who listened and said he would follow up with us, which he never did.  (This was more than 3 months ago.) So we dont know if the camp has implemented any changes.  We hope it has, particularly since it is dealing with girls at a vulnerable age when eating disorders emerge for so many.   
Chewonki Foundation Inc	37658	11	/users/profile/38366	myrnaloy	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2010	It is my strong belief that the summer camp at Chewonki is a bedrock of environmental education. Providing solid information and hands-on learning about the environment and the impact you have on it begins at camp.  My grandson spent his first sleepaway at Chewonki this past summer and is returning along with his younger brother because he thrived on this experience.  Spending so much time outdoors and learning how important it is to be kind to the environment and the benefits for everyone as a result. When you live in the city you lose a sense of nature at work and the Chewonki experience was a springboard to understanding how vital it is to know your environment.  Sharing thisinformation with children at an early age is key to a successful experience for them. In my case, it was extraordinary.  Most summer camps concentrate heavily on competitive sports and the refreshing program at Chewonki provides children of all ages an opportunity to learn and respect the earth.  I might add, the staff at Chewonki is superb.  After a Chewonki summer session the camper is undoubtedly a better educated and happier individual.  With a Chewonki attitude the world will be a sweeter place.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	36536	12	/users/profile/37327	Emily	Client Served	5	04/22/2010	The months I spent living at Chewonki still rank as among the best of my life. I had no idea what to expect from the semester when I arrived. What I found was an entirely new way of thinking about the world and about my life. I was able to step outside the frantic, competitive world I was raised in, and I gained an immense new understanding of what really matters to me: community, meaningful work, natural beauty. Thanks to MCS, I've spent countless hours over the past two years working for the environment, and I plan to spend the rest of my life doing the same. But, more importantly, thanks to MCS, I've discovered how to live a better life. I'm happier, more confident, more open to new experiences. I couldn't have ever found that without MCS: without the walks in the woods, the community meals, the intense class discussions of philosophy and history alongside with lessons in gardening and woodstoves and sailing.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	36522	7	/users/profile/37311	Ben	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	Chewonki changed my life starting at age 9.  My first experience was as a camper and it left me with a profound appreciation for nature and a significant boost in self-confidence.  It was the first place that I ever strapped on a backpack and hiked several sections of the Appalachian trail.  They also took me to remote island off the coast of Maine with a naturalists who could identify just about everything we saw, from plants to birds, to species in tidal pools.  I later returned with a school group and then worked there as a counselor. With each step I've taken deeper into the organization, I have been more and more impressed.

Together, we developed a sense of unity and comfort between all members of Chewonki, such that anyone could take a seat at any table at a mealtime and feel included.  The relationships developed between students and teachers, advisers, and other faculty have proved to be long-lasting and meaningful, months after the semester ended.  The knowledge I gained at Chewonki, from identifying bird calls to graphing sinusoidal curves, from learning how to milk a cow to the details of American economy during the Civil War, and from lighting a woodstoves to whitewater kayaking, all came from a great experience.  Chewonki has taught me countless lessons that extend beyond sustainability, transforming me into a more valuable member of any new community.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	35392	7	/users/profile/36228	ebb3	General Member of the Public	5	04/10/2010	My oldest son attended Maine Coast Semester at Chewonki in 2005, and this was one of the most important and positive experiences of his life.  High School for some teenagers is a place where the limits and channels of thought can become too restrictive - and this was the case for Charlie.  Chewonki gave him a structure in which to explore beyond the typical boundaries of the classroom and of educational curriculums, but also to explore and occupy spaces outside of conventional culture.  He went there with a fairly typical attachment to computers and "FaceBook" and the like, and came back with a far deeper love and attachment to the physical and natural world.  I'll never forget the look of appreciation in his eyes as he bounded through the woods to show me his favorite tree that he spent the night next to on his overnight - and made several pencil drawings of.  It's hard to overestimate how precious this connection to our world is - and this gift of connection is one of the most valuable things that Chewonki gives it's students and people that interact with it.  Our stewardship of this earth is ultimately what will make the difference as our environment faces huge and growing challenges, and Chewonki stands as a place where students learn good stewarship and the importance of that.  Thanks to all at Chewonki who contribute to this beautiful gift to us all.

It finds and retains some of the most energetic and compassionate staff of any organization, whether nonprofit or for profit.Sometimes, the experience of being on site seems almost magical.  With self-deprecating humor, the Chewonki staff and campers refer to the comforting "Chewonki bubble" to remind themselves that the experience is to be shared and enlarged beyond the confines of Chewonki Neck, not only to be enjoyed while there.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	4381	29	/users/profile/6099	Aya	Donor	5	04/30/2009	I attended the Maine Coast Semester and it was the first time I had ever been away from home.  I honestly did not think I would make it because I was so homesick and scared to do the solo that is part of every Chewonki experience as a Maine Coaster.  But through the unfailing support of my teachers and new friends I made it through and absolutely loved it.  I learned so much about what it means to be independent and yet rely on others and be able to contribute to the community as well.  I would never trade my Chewonki experience for anything because I learned that I had the capability to adapt to so much. Even today, several years after graduating from Chewonki, I am always happy to help when the opportunity presents itself.

Being a somewhat timid child who was overdue in developing confidence and independence, it took about a month or so for her to fully experience all Chewonki had to offer.  The incredible and positive experience at Chewonki enhanced not only her academic abilities, but also her appreciation for herself, others and nature.  This nature reserve provides the ultimate positive experience for all who attend and should be the role model for sister camps with locations all over the USA and beyond.

I subsequently worked there for 2 summers both in Wiscasset and in the field.Those experiences formed the foundation for my appreciation of the natural world and the communities which depend on it.  Chewonki also demontrates on a continuous basis how a nuturing and focused community can drive innovation - especially in the area of sustainability.  Chewonki has remained steadfast in its commitment to the original and core values established by its founder and the Board while at the same time it has continued to develop new ways of teaching old lessons through expanded program offerings and outreach far beyond its origins as a summer camp.  I believe that it is this history of commitment and innovation that attracts a very talented and motivated staff year after year.It is exciting to me that society is beginning to catch up to and respond to issues of sustainability and the interdependancy of human and natural ecosystems that I was exposed to 30 years ago at Chewonki.

A few years later I became a Board Member and finally had some other advisory responsibility.  But there really is no "finally" with Chewonki.  It is a place that imprints values on young people and adults alike.  I have an Ed.D. in Sociology of Education but none of the lessons learned in all that schooling is as important as one of the basics learned at Chewonki:  the human body is water-proof!  And we humans are respon-sible for the mountains, the forests, the lakes, and the rivers~~as well as our fellows.

Chewonki is that place for many of us: students, campers, employees, and visitors who have walked the paths, slept in the cabins, worked in the pastures, sang around the campfire, or studied in the salt marshes. It's a place where every moment seems full of learning and discovery about the connectedness of all people, all living things, all ecosystems. Such a marvelous antidote to the disconnection and isolation of the world!

My experience at MCS was a keystone in my education.  The challenge, the curriculum, the  people, and the place have all positively influenced me and my career.  Working for Chewonki Camp introduced me to another side of the organization.  It was clear to me very early on in the summer how much the boys loved the camp and how much the experience impacted them.  I am so glad there is now a camp for girls!I am committed to the organization and I like to introduce people to Chewonki every chance I get. I haven't been back in a few years, but I still read all the publications and follow news from the Neck.

I was a Maine Coast Semester student there last year and I was blown away by the warm and personal environment. The staff there are so welcoming and community-oriented that it's practically impossible to not learn and grow while you're there. Not only was I a student there, but I also volunteered in other areas of the foundation. Chewonki gave me the opportunity to try many new things, all in a safe and caring environment. Sustainability-wise, I've never seen anything parallel Chewonki. With the funds that they have, the board has done a fantastic job of making the foundation green in every aspect of daily life.

The Chewonki Foundation faculty, staff, and entire community succeeding making those four months some of the best of my life.  I learned more in that semester than any semester of schooling thus far.  I learned about the importance of community, of responsibility, flexibility, and generosity.

I returned to Chewonki after college, and worked as a summer camp counselor, a teacher in the Maine Coast Semester, and an apprentice on the organic farm.  In all my experiences, I have been impressed with the quality of people at the Chewonki Foundation, as well as the determination on the part of the community to do things right.  Chewonki helped me build a vision of how I wanted to live my own life, and helped me connect to many who shared my vision.  There is a saying popular among activists that "another world is possible."  To me, Chewonki is that other, better world that I spend my life working towards.

At that time, camp Chewonki was only for boys.  One brother is now an avid birder and nature photographer, no doubt because of Chewonki.  The other is also a great outdoorsman, although he lets his schedule get in the way.  My son now goes to Chewonki, and it has provided one of the best experiences of his life.

I attended the Maine Coast Semester in my junior year of high school, and the course of my life has completely changed as a result of the four months I spent there. Prior to the experience, I was not terribly interested in the environment and only applied because I was desperate to get out of my high school, if only for a semester. I left with the conviction that I want to devote the rest of my life to protecting the environment any way I can. I'm currently majoring in Environmental Studies in college and plan to become an environmental lawyer and hopefully work for the government. Truly, attending MCS was the best thing that has ever happened to me. Everyone who works there is wonderful, the work they do is greatly varied and all-encompassing-from developing sustainable energy alternatives to teaching about the incredible value of nature to creating strong bonds between people that last a lifetimeand I just truly believe that spending time at Chewonki makes you a better person. Most of the greatest people I've ever known I met there.

I think it says a lot that Chewonki is a place where people want to come back to year after year.  Campers become counselors and counselors become full-time staff.  Chewonki fosters the development of environmental stewards, from teaching kids how to harness solar energy to leaving no trace in the wilderness.  As the organization continues to grow, they do so in an environmentally responsible way.  Chewonki will buy land for more camps and conservation and new buildings are built following strict green guidelines.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	4153	20	/users/profile/5896	jawatson	Client Served	5	04/27/2009	Would it be clich if I said that Chewonki changed my life? I decided I wanted to become involved in the Wonk when I was in kindergarten, and my sister participated in MCS XIII. When I was eight years old, my parents enrolled me in the summer camp, where I was either a 3.5 or 7 week camper for six straight years. I took some time away from the organization to experience some new opportunities, but returned in the fall of '05 as a member of MCS XXXV. After that, I was a camp counselor at the boys camp for two years. My experience at Chewonki taught me a lot about my self, as well as about my peers and the environment around me. As a camper, I began to appreciate and respect the natural world - its power and the respect it deserves. I learned how to share, listen, and problem solve, all in a comfortable, understanding, and fun environment. As an MCSer, I began to understand myself as a unique individual in the world. I became aware of what I have to offer, but also that every person, no matter who they are, also have their own intrinsic value and ideas to contribute. I learned to laugh and breath and be myself. At MCS, I didn't have to fit into a mold. As a counselor, I developed a love for teaching and helping others. Chewonki gave me the opportunity to relive my days as a camper and enjoy the carefree bliss of a perfect summer. There is nothing I would change about Chewonki, ever. The people could not be kinder or more compassionate. The facilities and land could not be more beautiful. The experiences could not be more meaningful. I can only hope that Chewonki remains strong well into the future so participation in its remarkable programs can become a tradition in my family for generations to come.

Testing pH, sampling sphagnum moss from bogs, graphing mathematical temperature trends of the compost pile and identifying Black-capped Chickadees and Balsam Firs were all part of the daily academic coursework. It was these early educational experiences that first elicited my enthusiasm for science as a way of exploring and understanding the natural world. I have continued to pursue this field and I am about to begin a Masters program in Marine and Estuarine Science. I know that Chewonki has continued to educate and influence thousands of other students and campers in sustainability and science, and this is absolutely vital for humanity's continued presence on our planet.

For most people who have participated in a Chewonki program (either through camp, their semester program, school outreach programs, on-campus school programs, etc), Chewonki is really a family. I know of kids who depended on Chewonki not just as a way to spend the summer, semester or week, but as an integral part of their development process. It's truly an amazing organization that deserves every amount of support it can get. Furthermore, it's lead the way in Maine and beyond not just as an advocate for a greener world, but as a doer. Teaching students how to make biodiesel, running all of its maintenance trucks and equipment on it way before anyone else was doing it; Chewonki is really a trailblazer, and one who has the capacity to bring green living beyond the lab or insular organization and into classrooms and people's individual lives.

I was lucky to be able to attend the Main Coast Semester in fall of 2000. It was an amazing experienece that opened my eyes to the idea of living sustainably. Growing up in Washington DC did not provide me with a connection to the land and knowledge about organic/sustainalbe agricultural practices. Chewonki shaped me greatly as a 16 year old to become a more environmentally conscious and active citizen.I went back to Chewonki for four summers to work at the summer camp. I taught the farm activity for two of those summers and was so happy to be able to teach kids about farming and gardening, which had been so influential for me. I now am a public school teacher in the bay area and just started a vegetable garden at my school. I know that without the influence of Chewonki, I never would have taken this project on. I now have over 30 students involved in the garden project and for many of these students this is their first exposure to growing their own food. Chewonki's legacy and dream extends beyond its Maine campus as the people who have been touched by the organization go on to do wonderful work in the environmental field.

This was his (and our) first experience with overnight camp and, it turned out to be a terrific experience.  We had heard about Chewonki from a friend and nervously attended the director's "meet and greet" here in Ohio. We were taken with the slide show presenting their unique set up and loved their obvious environmental awareness.  It was clear that they had been doing this for some time, and we liked the fact that consideration for the environment was built so seamlessly into everything they do there.  It turned out to be a great fit for our son. He had a blast, learned a lot, was excited to get his own pair of binoculars and has even identified birds here in Ohio -- which had never happened before his Chewonki experience, despite Mom's best efforts!The staff we've dealt with through phone calls and emails has been terrific -- competent and caring, courteous and thorough.  Their attention and efforts are genuinely motivated by their passion for Chewonki.  We would not hesitate to recommend Chewonki to others, and have talked it up to friends here.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	4116	23	/users/profile/5861	sadams	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2009	I have worked for the foundation for only the past 5 years. I work on a remote property in the Northwoods of Maine that Chewonki recently acquired. It was once privately owned campground on leased paper company land. Chewonki purchased the campground and eventually the land for the purposes of conservation and protection as well as recreation usage . It is still a campground that welcomes the public, including many avid flyfishermen and family campers. It also provides a great base for Chewonki programs such as whitewater kayaking and hiking to nearby Baxter State Park. Watching the transformation over the past 5 years from tacky, over used and abused river frontage to green, welcoming , responsible ownership of such a beautiful wilderness area, has been a great pleasure. Working with the managers, board members and staff of the foundation has been an even greater pleasure. They are all so focused on what really needs to happen in lifestyle changes to improve the world we all live in and our children will live in.  They "walk the talk". This foundation is as responsible as they get, in every sense of the word. To the environment, the community, their participants and students and to their staff. Thank you to those founders who had the foresight to take this "Summer Camp" to where it is today. I hope more will have the opportunity to experience the "Chewonki Experience " in the near future.

As a sustainability-focused teaching fellow for the Maine Coast Semester (MCS), Chewonki's high school semester program, I worked with MCS science classes and served as a liason between the students and the Chewonki Sustainability Office.I am now a graduate student in the environmental management field, at a school far from Maine. I think of Chewonki often, and of the great work they are doing to educate our next generation. With top-notch faculty and staff, a beautiful campus, and incredible programs, the organization is able to reach out to so many kids, the majority of whom leave Chewonki with a different outlook and an inspiring experience to carry along with them into the world. I highly, highly recommend this organization. It is an amazing place.

This experience sparked a life long love affair with birds, nature and the outdoors. My father went on to have 7 children who (4 of whom went on to attend Chewonki) and now my son looks forward to his time at camp which he describes as "my idea of heaven". I have so much gratitude for the gift of environmental enlightenment they have given generations of my family and many more.

Maine Coast Semester's curriculum does just that.With her classmates at Berkeley's Masters in Journalism school a couple of years ago, Kate won a national award for her radio reporting on global warming--her story was on Mt.

I was a woodshop and photography counselor, but also was taught to expand my own skills by leading my cabins on Hiking and Canoeing trips in the White Mountains and on the St.Croix.  They combine programs and a philosophy that at once teaches people how to be in contact with our environment, how to treat it with reverence and help it heal from the ravages of the industrial age, and they model community standards that insist that all members learn to develop their skills as leaders, and how to work with others leading, when it is not their turn to lead.  Chewonki's continued presence as Environmental Educators, Wilderness Tripleaders, Energy and Eco-Science Experimenters and Policy Advocates, and from their first role as a Summer camp providing Boys, and now Girls with a really enriching summer experience in full contact with the Maine Coast and Woods.

The Camp had a history of strong nature programs dating back to its founding by Mr. Allen in 1917. At the time I was impressed with the emphasis on the environment to which the campers were exposed, and by the dedication of the staff to the values and appreciation of Maine and its many natural attributes. Many of the campers came from families who cared deeply about nature. They sent their children to Chewonki because of the camp's reputation as a place where environment received significant emphasis. Among the areas where the camp enjoyed an outstanding reputation was its emphasis on Maine birds. The Osprey was the Camp's logo. The son of Roger Tory Peterson was one of the young campers who attended the camp. In the many years that have passed I have seen Chewonki mature and grow into a major presence in the National enviromental community. As the world grows closer together, the skills of those fortunate enough to attend Chewonki will be an important resource for finding ways to retain and preserve our environment.Thank you,Stephen Bullock

I had a good deal of experience in teaching and outdoor activities, but not much environmental knowledge.  I became very aware of man aspects of the environment such as global warming- this was in 1987-solid waste management, wood lot management, farm management and such.  Especially, I saw the impact that this kind of program had on the students, making them aware of the environment and willing to do something to instigate changes in behavior after they returned home.  I have kept in touch with many of those students over the years and find that the feel that MCS was a defining point in their education.  Although I am no longer working at Chewonki- I am over 80- I return regularly to visit and keep in touch with what is going on there.  All of the programs seem to have a similar impact on the students.  I have a granddaughter returning for the second year as a girl's camper.

My experience with the Chewonki foundation could not have been better. From the farm to the classrooms, the wilderness programs to the outdoor classroom program, Chewonki educates and involves young people and adults alike in caring for and learning about the natural world. The faculty and staff at chewonki are clearly driven by love and are thoughtful, concious, effective and deep educators. Chewonki has profoundly affected the way that i view and interact with the world around me for the better. When groups of chewonki students and faculty get together and someone, out of habit, picks up a random peice of litter on the street or joyfully calls out the name of a bird who is singing in central park we always joke about the "Chewonki way". Yet, though we say it in jest, we all know and sense the profound affect that chewonki has on all it touches and the way that that effect ripples through communities as students, campers, staff and teachers return to their home communities. I firmly believe that chewonki is creating a generation and community of environmentalists, activists, educators and influencers.
Chewonki Foundation Inc	4046	24	/users/profile/5809	stkoda	Donor	5	04/27/2009	What I found most exciting about Chewonki is that they are constantly working to be an environmentally responsible organization and are most importantly passing this goal on to students and campers. They are influencing and changing lives of so many young people. My daughter attended the Maine Coast Semester at Chewonki and because of her experience there, she has decided to major in Environmental Science at college this coming fall. I know many parents whose children have attended Chewonki in one form or another and it is always a life changing experience for them. They become much more aware of the world around them and their impact on the earth.

Chewonki Foundation Inc	4041	29	/users/profile/5800	Feathermaid	Donor	5	04/27/2009	I was a parent of a camper years ago and have watched Chewonki develop from a boy's summer camp into a year-round environmental educational organization that impacts people of all backgrounds and ages, including girls and families. It has been been having a serious impact for generations, ever since Roger Tory Peterson was the nature counselor. My son devloped such a respect for nature and for ecological processes while there that he shaped his life around the precepts he learned at Chewonki. Ne now lives in Maine.

They share their knowledge freely, and encourage others to use solar, wind, bio-diesel, and become more energy efficient.  Plus, Chewonki Foundation does great school programs with their traveling environmental education programs.  They have come to my small town in Maine for summer library programs as well as school year programs.  Chewonki Foundation walks the talk!
Chewonki Foundation Inc	4038	27	/users/profile/5798	rodmanlyd	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2009	I am so in awe of all that Chewonki does.  My brothers, neices and nephews have all been involved with Chewonki in various ways over the years.  One brother was councilor and then staff member, another was both camper and councilor.  My nephews have gone to summer camp.  One neice has participated in wildnerness trips and the other was part of the innaugural season of the summer camp for girls.  All had fabulous experiences that have helped to shape them.  I am so impressed with how Chewonki continues to find new ways to be self sustaining and leave as little impact on the environment as possible.  Chewonki is also so committed to teaching the next generation to respect the environment and perhaps be either future leaders in the field, or to apply what they have learned to whatever their field will be.  Every time I have the chance to be on the Chewonki grounds I am so thankful that such a place exists that is always teaching respect for the environment.Lydia Rodman

As a beginning teacher many years ago, I first experienced Chewonki for a week long environmental education teacher workshop.  The experienced and passionate instructors from Chewonki instilled in me a deeper appreciation of the natural world, which I transferred repeatedly to my students over the years.  The Chewonki mission of sustainability and earth stewardship is more than lip service.  Through environmental outreach, bringing students to Chewonki, wilderness experiences for girls and boys, and promotion of environmental education in general, Chewonki is recognized as a leader internationally in the field of earth stewardship.I am a life long teacher of geography, human and physical, and my long standing relationship with Chewonki has enhanced all I do with students.

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	306888	1	/users/profile/398205	Tammy137	Client Served	5	09/28/2016	Last year was our first experience at Camp Sunshine! Before arriving we had no idea what to expect but just knew that this was our first getaway since treatment which totaled 3.5 years. Our only son was diagnosed at age 9 with a rare form of leukemia called Philadelphia + ALL. Like many, treatment was brutal, long, exhausting (mentally and physically) and we knew we desperately needed a break and to getaway! Once learning about Camp Sunshine we immediately applied and were accepted right away. We had no idea what we were in for. Once arriving to camp we were totally taken away...away from the sickness, away from stress, away from fear, away from the hospital and away from confinement. We were instead now at a place of serenity, fun, joy, peace, understanding and had our every need taken care of. We needed this more than words can express!! Camp Sunshine is a Camp filled with light and if you've never experienced this incredible place please trust me you will not regret it. This isn't camping in tents, eating outside over fire pits and worrying if big creatures will attack at night....this is a resort of sorts where you have a spacious family suite, 3 meals in the meal hall, parent time while your kids are enjoying a full camp experience with every outdoor and indoor activity you can think of, family time, entertainment every evening, parent discussion groups, sibling group and volunteers that are beyond exceptional that care for yours and you children's every need!!! I can't say enough. I thank you Camp Sunshine for not only bringing my family joy and peace but to all the families you service every year....we are forever grateful.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	303237		/users/profile/394397	Alyssa26	Client Served	5	09/11/2016	At the age of two our son Banning began complaining that his stomach was hurting. As new parents we immediately thought his stomach might have been upset and his discomfort would pass by the next day. As the next morning arrived,   Banning woke up in severe pain and was curled up into a ball and crying in pain. This concerned us greatly and we raced Banning to his pediatrician to find answers. Leaving the office we were convinced the discomfort would pass and was an isolated incident.  The days and months that passed saw Bannings pain intensify and his discomfort was so great he was refusing to eat and drink. Without proper nutrition he began to lose weight. Working with our pediatrician we made appointment with specialists in the areas of gastroenterology and infectious disease to find answers. While the stomach pain continued Banning began to have fevers which would spike in a matter of minutes to an alarming 104.5. The fevers were unfazed by Tylenol and Ibuprofen and we were unable to reduce his temperature without a visit to the Emergency Room. Banning was also prone to becoming sick with frequent colds, ear infections and even a rare case of giardia (normally found in third world countries). While illness in children is common, Banning was unable to fight off the illnesses quickly and took weeks to recover from a simply cold.The months that followed were some of the most difficult and stressful my husband and I have ever experienced. Banning was now averaging 4 doctors visits and two trips the Emergency Room each month. Still no answers to why he was experiencing these severe episodes of stomach pain and cyclical fevers every twenty one days. His Gastroenterologist performed an exploratory scope of Banning abdomen to determine if there were any abnormalities. The scope raised concerns in Bannings pancreas and the specialists spoke with us about the possibility that our son may have Cystic Fibrosis or Schwachman Diamond Syndrome, both debilitating diseases which attack the bodys vital organs.  Banning was immediately placed on Creon, a drug used in cystic fibrosis patients, to help absorb the nutrients of the food he was eating. As there are no generics available for this drug, the prescription costs exceeded $800.00 for a month supply. This was a financial strain on our family, but the cost was minimal in contrast to our sons continued health.  The episodes of stomach pain continued, although less frequent in the months that followed. It became apparent that this illness would not be diagnosed without seeking the help of a pediatric specialist outside of Orlando. After many long hours of research we were directed to the University of Florida Shands Childrens Hospital Hematology and Oncology Department.  After a six week period in which Bannings blood was drawn twice a week, we had collected data which lead to a diagnosis on neutropenia, an abnormal reading of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell whose function is to fight off infections by destroying bacteria). While this was encouraging and seemed to explain the frequent illnesses, it did not explain the frequent stomach pains Banning was continuing to experience. The Hematologist recommended we seek the guidance of the Pediatric Gastroenterologist at Shands.  We were placed under the care of Dr. Christopher Jolley, Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. Banning was given an MRI of the abdomen (pancreas) to determine if it was functioning properly with manipulation. Following these results it was determined that, in fact, Bannings pancreas was not absorbing the nutrients of the food he was consuming and a diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency was recorded.   We have been given a clinical diagnosis of Shwachman Diamond Syndrome.  Immediately I contacted Camp Sunshine because we had heard of the SDS week.  There we met families with similar stories to ours. Also, it was great to be able to connect with those families who "understood" our situation.  Our family has made forever friends through Camp Sunshine. We cant say enough about Camp Sunshine's positive impact on our lives.  We are forever grateful.

We had been wary of heart transplants, deciding that God would guide us and our decisions. We had gone for their kidney week and was surprised when we got there that due to a maintenance issue solid organ transplant week was joining us. The first 2 families we met were post transplant hypoplastic left heart families. We could not tell the "sick" kids from the siblings..in that moment we felt God giving us direction we had been seeking and are forever grateful for the experience.

We went to Camp Sunshine on the recommendation of our hospital social worker. Are we glad we took advantage of his recommendation.  There is no place else in the world like Camp Sunshine.  Every member of our family has been blessed by our association with Camp Sunshine.  My sons who do not have the brain tumor go there and for that week are free from worries. They connect with other kids  with similar circumstances. The staff and volunteers love them and treat them like royalty. Our son with the brain tumor, has a one on  one (who loves him like a brother), which allows my wife and I to connect with other parents.  There are times of laughter and lightheartedness, time of tears and sorrow which all minister to our souls. We are better for meeting these courageous parents. I have never met such a caring staff and group of volunteers. They are friends for life. Donations to Camp Sunshine are an investment that pay rich dividends.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196441		/users/profile/256767	SherBear714	Client Served	5	03/25/2014	Our family has been fortunate enough to attend Camp Sunshine since 2009 when our daughter Abby, who then was 3 years old, was diagnosed with leukemia.  She also has Down syndrome and sometimes finding people that would accept her with not one but both diagnosis and just allow her to be a normal kid was hard to find.  We were extremely blessed to find Camp Sunshine.  The staff and all the wonderful volunteers there have made amazing memories with us.  Abby (as well as her siblings and parents) LOVE going to camp.  She gets so excited and refers to it as Hands Up (it's a song that is traditionally sung at camp).  Our family is able to relax and just be.  Our children are able to be focused on individually, which is common place for Abby but not so for her siblings which is unfortunate but a reality in our life.  Her sister Elisabeth finally found a place that worries about her and her needs and she isn't "Abby's sister" she's Elisabeth, her own individual.   The bonds and friendships we have made with other families as well as the volunteers has been indescribable.  Several of our families have such a bond that we try to reunite there every year if possible.  We cannot thank Camp Sunshine's staff, volunteers and the donors who all make it possible for families like ours to have a place that each member of our family feels comfortable at.

As a bereaved parent, I found Camp 3 years after losing my daughter to mitochondrial disease.  I live in Maine and never knew there was a camp for families who had lost children to disease.  Although we were very lucky to have support as my daughter got sicker, my 2 younger children found others like them who had experienced the loss of a sibling -- something quite unique.   In the past couple of years, I've been able to give back to Camp, by volunteering in numerous ways during the bereavement sessions.  This is also important to me, as it gives me an opportunity to help others who may be newer in their grief journey.   Currently, my family and I are taking a break, as my children become older and can also volunteer!  Thanks so much, Camp Sunshine!!Theresa Gaetjens
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196420		/users/profile/256742	patsimons	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	Last summer I had the privilege of volunteering for one week at a Camp Sunshine brain tumor session.  The camp is a delightful, happy, modern, clean and well-run facility.    Staff and volunteers do everything they can to make the families attending feel relaxed, special and like they are on vacation.   The families have time to bond as a family and they have separate child and adult time--it's a great balance.  There are plenty of smiles and laughter and also a few tears.  I'm looking forward to returning again this summer!  Happy 30th Anniversary Camp Sunshine!!

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196399		/users/profile/256718	Jillian6	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	Camp Sunshine is truly the happiest and brightest place to be. I volunteered for the first time four years ago and it completely changed my life for the better. The highlight of my year is being able to volunteer, meet new families, reconnect with old and help allow these families experience a vacation they will never forget. At camp it isn't about the diseases that define the child but getting to know the child for who they truly are. The staff is amazing, the campus is breath taking and it truly is a home away from home. Volunteering at camp has brought me to my future career goals to become a child life specialist. I will continue to volunteer year after year! It is rewarding to be able to see the families and volunteers come together in remembering what life is all about. We come together to multiply our joy and happiness and divide our troubles. Camp Sunshine will always be my favorite place!

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196396		/users/profile/256715	sj163	Client Served	5	03/25/2014	We are the parents of three children; tweleve, ten and seven years old .  On May 6th 2005 our lives were forever changed when our 18 month old (now ten years old), was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).  On this journey we have certainly learned some valuable life lessons, and got a serious education in blood related cancers and the associated treatments.  Through all our ups and downs, we can truly say that weve been blessed to meet quite a few wonderful people.  One of our highlights has been our visits to Camp Sunshine, which continues to exceed our expectations.The Staff of Camp Sunshine always prepares unforgettable experiences, from the games to the Group Sessions.  Their meticulous planning, efforts and hard work is evident and truly appreciated.  The entire Camp Sunshine facility is absolutely amazing! The Volunteers, who gave of themselves, their selflessness, support, love and open hearts could never be re-paid.  They gave so much to us and to our children.  The kitchen staff prepared absolutely delicious meals for us.  Visiting Camp Sunshine afforded us the opportunity to meet people that we may have never met.  It provided us with much needed parental group therapy, and the opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest, without worry, for a few days.  It is our belief that we have made some bonds with Our Fellow Sunshine Parents and their families; whose warmth and kindness allowed us to share our story, as well as listen to theirs.  There is amazing comfort and extra strength that comes from knowing that we are not alone on this journey.  And as it continues, we trust that these bonds will last a lifetime.  These experiences could not have been possible without Camp Sunshine.  The words Thank You almost do not seem to be enough to truly express our heartfelt gratitude for Camp Sunshine.  Camp Sunshine is truly like nothing else!   Go Camp Sunshine!!!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196395		/users/profile/183220	Marianne B.	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	Wow what to say about Camp Sunshine.  Smiles, laughter, fun, friendship and oh so much more.  I have been involved in non-profits before as a volunteer but never one quite as loving, caring, compassionate and dedicated as this camp is.  From the relentless dedicated staff who make sure that families have everything they need from arrival to departure, to the thousands of volunteers that are attracted to the camp and what it stands for.  And what it stands for to the many who come through the doors  HOPE.   The bonding that takes place between the campers themselves, as well as the volunteers is simply amazing.  No one is left behind, what I mean is that every family member is treated as royalty.  They have so many activities (from sports, to arts and crafts, games, singing and dancing, just to name a few) for the different age groups, from the littlest camper to the biggest, each individual  is special .  Winter, spring, summer or fall the camps activity is on-going.   Certainly anyone who has a child with a life-threatening illness whether near or far should come to camp, it will change your life, you will leave rejuvenated.  If you are interested in volunteering this camp will also change your life, as it has mine, you will leave exhausted but the joy inside your heart is like nothing else, knowing that you have spent the week in such a hopeful, respectful and loving environment and you WILL want to do it again.  It is and always will be an honor to volunteer for such an outstanding non-profit as Camp Sunshine is.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137253		/users/profile/183220	Marianne B.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Wow to be able to tell the world about Camp Sunshine is such an honor.  My daughter was the first in our family to volunteer she was 16 at the time.  When she came home she was so excited and so uplifted about her experience I couldnt wait to go.  A couple of years went by and because of life I was unable to go but it nagged at me.  So in 2010 I decided no more excuses I was going and I invited my sister who was recovering from breast cancer.  That decision changed my life, working with families and children who everyday struggle with so much more than the rest of us made me realize just how lucky my family, friends and I were.  Camp Sunshine became my purpose in life, I dont have a lot of money, but I do have time and I am so grateful that I found that time in 2010 because I came home and shared my feelings and now my children, their friends, and my neighbors are all volunteering.   Camp Sunshine is like a fine tuned machine, the staff and volunteers (who are all so absolutely wonderful) are there for the families and the families who are lucky enough to come have the experience of a life time.  For the first time many families are relaxed, they can breathe easy for a few days, experience friendship with people who understand their plight, and most importantly they have fun.  I along with many other volunteers walk away with a feeling of such pride to have been able to walk beside volunteers, staff and families for those few days.   And many of us make lifetime friends, I am happy to say that I now volunteer a few times a year and I consider that one of the greatest blessings in my life.

Camp Sunshine allows him to meet with other kids who deal with the same issues he does. It allows me to meet other parents to bond with and connect with so we can talk/chat/email/facebook in between our two year sessions with our hopes/fears/questions/experiences.  Camp Sunshine is life changing. There is no way to truly put it in words. It makes more than a difference. It changes your world...though emotional as you talk through some of your emotions and find those emotions that have been buried for a long time. All this while your child is living a fun, safe and normal camp life. Siblings are well provided for as well.  Please take a moment to look at their web site where you will see photos filled with love. The volunteers pour their love into each session. The employees are top notch and I could not say enough good about the on site counselor Nancy.  If you paid her a million dollars a year, it wouldn't be enough. The sacrifice her family has made by working there is truly a Blessing for all of us.

Camp Sunshine is the only way to meet others with the disease. Our foundation partners and brings in the top doctors and researchers to make it a vacation, appointment with your specialist for your orphan disease, bonding with other families and hearing first hand in the scientific world what is happening. It is a take-your-breath-away experience. It is full of hugs and tears--both happy to see others, sad to learn the real facts and happy again to learn about hope. I can't recommend it enough.

The Camp itself has great facilities and treats all their volunteers with utmost respect and kindness, even going out of the way to learn everyone's name when thousands of us pass through there every year.  The families I've met have all echoed the same sentiment - that camp sunshine is amazing. I can only speak from a volunteer point of view but I know that I have witnessed communities of support come together and help each other get through this difficult time in their lives.   Volunteering at camp has literally changed my life and I don't see a time in my life when I wouldn't make the trip there at least once a year. 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196383		/users/profile/241245	Tammy58	Client Served	5	03/25/2014	I have told all of you before what an amazing impact Camp Sunshine has had on our family!  Tacey has worldwide 'best' friends due to meeting them at Camp Sunshine.  However, I wanted to share this with you so you have another testimonial of how Camp impacts others! This is from Caitlyn Harkness who lives in New Jersey.  She is the young lady we flew to Texas for Tacey's birthday. "I am writing an essay for my language arts monthly writing and I really wanted to share it because it is dear to my heart......"The one person who has influenced me most in my life is My best friend Tacey Raulerson. Tacey was born with a rare cancer called Retinoblastoma which left her blind in both eyes. I met her through a camp for kids with cancer. My brother was also born with this rare form of eye cancer about 7 years ago. Just because she is blind doesn't mean that will stop her from doing anything she wants. Her ambitions are high and this has shown me that know matter what tries to stop you in life you can always find a way around it, and succeed. Even though she is blind she still can text, and she even uses her ipod without any help. She goes to regular school like you and me.Tacey has really influenced me in my life because even though she is blind nothing will stop her from doing what she wants. You can say she is sorta hard headed, which I admire most because know one can tell her she can't, because she knows she always can. When we are at camp she does everything that any normal kid would, she goes out on the lake in a boat, she plays the game where we throw mini bean bags into a hole, and she plays volleyball which is our personal favorite. Some times I forget she is blind, which I guess to me means that she is so willing and strong enough to want to do everything we do,even though it might be challenging, its almost like she is like a super human. Her strength and views on the world makes me determine to be a better person and to view the world in a better way. Most people would be to scared to treat her as if though she isn't blind, but I have learned that if you treat a blind person as if though they are blind they will be upset verses if you don't treat them blind and you push them to do something out of there comfort zone they will be happy with the result. Her letting me guid her and letting me help her has inspired me because she trusts me enough to guid her and to help her do everything that I do and its a blessing from god to expose me to something like this. It taught me that everyone is the same know matter your disabilities, they are all people who desire to do everything we do and is willing to do what it takes to live a normal life.I've never imagined my life having such an impact from one person who has accomplished so much in such little time. Tacey has influenced me in two ways; she taught me know matter how hard life gets, it always gets better in the end. Tacey was sick for the first 7 years of her life, always in the hospital going through chemo and more chemo. she somehow though, always kept a smile on her face and always saw the positive in life. Words really can't described how she impacted my life simply because it was is a life changing experience that not many can say they have experienced. Secondly she showed me that you can truly look over someones disabilities. Again its hard to explain in words of how you can truly look past someone who has a disability all I can say is that a person is a person and thats all I see them as. In the future I really hope our world is able to completely change in a way that I have, being able to treat everyone as just a person, viewing them on there personality, and not singling them out because they are different. The one person who has influenced me most in my life is my best friend Tacey Raulerson." Tacey I love you! best friends for life!!!!" Thank you AGAIN for everything all of you do to make Camp Sunshine such a magical place!!!

Our familys attendance depends on generous donors, grants and other sponsorships.  To understand why it means so much to us, you have to know our story.After 13 years of marriage, my husband and I elatedly welcomed our precious daughter, Tacey, into our lives.  Seven short months later, our world was again forever changed when she was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma, a very rare cancer that forms tumors in the eyes of infants.  Despite a hard fight with chemo, radiation and other treatments, Tacey eventually lost both eyes to this horrible disease.  Tacey is now 13 years old and the joy of our lives!Being blind has not slowed Tacey down in life!  She is a very successful seventh grader with extremely high aspirations in our local public school.  She swims as often as possible and plays the piano and guitar as she sings songs she composes.  In her free time, she also rides horses.  She and her horse lead parades, carry the USA flag for rodeos and participate in many special events.  As much as we dislike (or despise) this disease, it has made Tacey who she is today!  That, I wouldnt change for any amount of money!So many times in life, Tacey is told she cannot do things because she is blind.  Many in society often feel she must be protected even when she is very capable of doing certain things.At Camp Sunshine, Tacey isnt told she cant do something!  She is able to do everything all the other children do.  She is allowed to shine in a way that builds her confidence and allows her to go back to face the daily struggles.Dealing not only with cancer, but also with a disability can be challenging to say the least!  Having an amazing group like Camp Sunshine where our family can not only have fun together while leaving the cares of the world behind, but also to meet other families and share our experiences is very therapeutic and healing for all of us!  Our friends at Camp Sunshine, from the staff, volunteer and other families, have become an extension of our amazing family!  Spending time at camp and with our Camp Sunshine family is a truly priceless experience! Michael, Tammy and Tacey Raulerson
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	196382		/users/profile/256705	AngelicaRI	Client Served	5	03/25/2014	Prior to May 2006 we were a family that traveled often and wasn't afraid of adventure.  Once my daughter was diagnosed with Leukemia our traveling came to a full stop.  We were so afraid to leave the house because at any sign of a fever we had to rush her to the Emergency Room.  Camp Sunshine brought to our family that sense of  fun & adventure in a safe, clean, and fun environment.  We have the best memories from Camp Sunshine.  They provide families with a great program, support, an ER doctor 24 hours a day, excellent food, and daycare.  Parents get to relax and participate as much or as little as they want.  The kids have the best time without any reservations because of the carefully selected group of volunteers and staff.   We have been to Camp Sunshine many times, and plan on attending in the near future.  It is a family! Come and visit...

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	190335		/users/profile/248496	Tony30	Client Served	5	12/10/2013	I Found HOPE at CAMP SUNSHINE I spent last weekend at CAMP SUNSHINE with my family. CAMP SUNSHINE is a place where my son Cole was able to enjoy his life before cancer and the harsh treatments he received stole his ability to run, swim, play, and laugh like all children should. CAMP SUNSHINE is run by volunteers; mostly young people in high school and college. I have such great memories of Cole and his brother and sister delighting in this wonderful place together, but it also hurts me to remember that this was one of the last places Cole was strong and healthy enough to enjoy pain-free. After Cole died I attended a bereavement weekend there with my family. It was only a few months after my son passed away and it was agonizing for me to be there without him, at that time I was nothing more than a ball of tightly wound anger. I forced my way through that weekend hiding behind a false smile for Coles twin brother Troy and big sister Tara. They love it at CAMP SUNSHINE so I did it for them, but inside I swore I would never go back. I thought it would always be too sorrowful for me to return.   Awhile back my family was selected to attend another bereavement gathering scheduled for last weekend and I had no intentions of appearing but after weeks of pleading from Tara and Troy I reluctantly agreed. I am so happy that I did because on the very first morning there I was presented with a great display of HOPE provided by two young volunteer counselors named MaryEllen and Kim. For those that dont know me well I am not a morning person. It usually takes me an hour or so and at least two cups of strong coffee before my mind and body get going. However this morning as soon as we sat down for breakfast in the cafeteria MaryEllen and Kim joined us and I was immediately showered with their energy and passion to help increase funding, research, and awareness for childhood cancer. My heart was suddenly filled with HOPE; here were two young women who were intent on achieving everything we strive for to help put an end to the monster that is childhood cancer. Throughout the weekend I witnessed an equal display of enthusiasm from so many other young volunteers.   There is a theory thrown around that childhood cancer does not get the attention it needs to achieve greater funding because the subject is just too dark and uncomfortable to think about. MaryEllen, Kim, Andy, Jarryd, Adrienne and many more incredible young volunteers at CAMP SUNSHINE proved that is a weak excuse. They face the horror of childhood cancer head on with unbridled love, compassion, and enthusiasm that is truly inspirational. They were not forced into this battle like many of us; instead they have chosen to take part simply because it is the right thing to do. This gives me HOPE that the generation that will follow us will not hide behind excuses or give up when faced with obstacles in the battle against childhood cancer. To all the volunteers at CAMP SUNSHINE I just want to say thank you for all you do and for giving me HOPE that the future will be brighter because of you!   Tony Stoddard

As a former client served I cannot even begin to describe how much of an impact this organization has had on my family and my life. When we attended as a family my brother and I, the "normal" siblings, were finally able to find others that we could relate with and really, really talk to. My brothers and I have established lifelong friendships from our time as campers. I began volunteering last year by myself and was able to share the volunteer experience with my mother and my husband this year; I honestly inform everyone about Camp Sunshine and encourage volunteering or supporting Camp in any way. It is impossible to put into words how much Camp means to me, but I can tell you that I am constantly using my earned vacation and personal days to VOLUNTEER, if that shows you how amazing volunteering for this organization is.

Camp is such an amazing place for families experiencing these hardships to sit back, relax, and connect. I finally was able to give back and volunteer this summer and can say that volunteering is even more of an amazing experience. You can see the joy, hope and gratitude in the families eyes as they are able to have a normal summer experience. By the time the week was over I did not want to leave and jumped at the opportunity to come back, which I will be doing in about two weeks. I have also spread the word about Camp to ALL of my family and friends and can't wait to spread the joy and hope for the years to come.

Just love it.    My short, but wonderful story:  When I arrived at camp for a session this year, a small boy ran over to me  with a huge smile and a big hug, laughing and saying "Jeanie, Jeanie, you're here again, and so am I."  "Will you be with the 6-8 (year old) kids?"  I answered "yes" and he pointed to himself, and said "that's still me."  "Hurry up and come say hi to my Mom and Dad. They want to see you."  "This is so really great," he said.     How can anyone beat that for a beginning of a Camp Sunshine session.... And this is what Camp Sunshine is all about.  New families, returning families, and great volunteers and staff.  All sharing a love for children and wanting to make it the very  best experience for everyone.

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	185170		/users/profile/182707	Kelly62	Client Served	5	10/30/2013	My family and I have been to Camp Sunshine twice.  The camp and their volunteers and staff are wonderful, caring, sharing people.  We go for Fanconi Anemia Family Meeting, held by Fanconi Anemia Research Foundation (FARF).  FARF hosts this annually, where the kids (and few adults) with this serious disorder, and their siblings, get to frolic and interface with others in the same boat -- a rare chance to gain a sense of support and camaraderie.  The parents also get this great opportunity, and FARF is a close, expert, and vital organization that presents a dozen seminars, bringing in experts in FA and BMT from around the world. Camp Sunshine staff and volunteers take care of everything, so families can REALLY take a break!  The first time at Camp was full of emotions for me.  The kids said it was the best experience they'd ever had -- they had lived two years knowing only two families in the "same boat" as them (FA), and were blown away by the gathering of 70 FA families, with a chance to share common challenges and triumphs with folks who had no knowledge of the genetic disorder and associated conditions.  I was still grappling with acceptance of the hand my daughter had been dealt, with the enormous learning I had before me to become my child's best advocate, and the information I gained through the expert seminars and personal meetings with them throughout the week was a bit overwhelming.  I gained a lot of strength and hope, too, from being close with so many families and experiencing what they do to cope and persevere. The second time at Camp was amazing, so much better.  Friendships were forged, learning of the advances and best practices was easier and much enhanced, and seeing the dedication of the scientific and medical experts giving of themselves brought a lot of serenity and hope to me.  Thank you, FARF, for the wonderful thing you do for our kids, and THANK YOU SO MUCH Camp Sunshine, for creating a place where we can come together, a place where hundreds of volunteers can give of themselves so freely -- can impart upon families happiness, a sense of caring, fun, and HOPE.

The staff appreciate the hard work that we do on behalf of the children and their families. The camp is a happy place where kids can be kids, no matter what illness they are struggling with. Their families find others who know what they are going through.

My time at Camp Sunshine has been among the best of my life.i've seen some amazing things there and met some wonderful people. The staff and the volunteers there are genuine ,caring people, and some have become some of my closest friends. I believe so much in the mission of Camp Sunshine that I can hardly wait to go each year. Volunteering there has enriched my life ,and I'm grateful to have found Camp Sunshine
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	184759		/users/profile/241699	balbert1205	Client Served	5	10/29/2013	In June 2012, our daughter was diagnosed with a low grade brain tumor.  6 weeks later, our family spent a week at Camp Sunshine.  We met about 30 other families going through the same thing and many of them have become close friends.  The support and love offered to the families by the staff and volunteers is unparalleled.  We were blessed to be able to attend another week at Camp Sunshine this past summer and it felt like a family reunion.  Having a week spent with people that truly understand the trials and tribulations of being a cancer family is such a reenergizing experience.  Plus, to have a week of fun for the whole family is just amazing.  :)

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	184390		/users/profile/241330	Brenda49	Client Served	5	10/29/2013	In May 2006 our daughter Olivia was diagnosed at the age of 7 with Osteosarcoma, a bone tumor in her knee.  After a year of debilitating treatment and a leg salvage surgery which left her wearing a prosthetic in order to walk, our famliy was burnt out.  I had spent the greater part of a year in the hospital with Olivia and my husband had spent his time working and taking care of our 3 year old Camille.  We were ready for some family time and some fun.  In June 2007 we went to Camp Sunshine where we were pampered, loved and rejuvinated.  We have been back many many times since then, and always it is just what our family needs.  Now that the kids are older, we are volunteering at Camp and are happy to share what camp has done for us with families that are still in need of the love and nuturing that Camp Sunshine offers.  They are the best at what they do and they never stop trying to improve the facility, the programs and themselves.  b.

I cannot express how wonderful it has been to have a place to meet with other families going through the same difficulties. The volunteers are terrific, and it is a pleasure to not have to worry about whether or not my child is getting adequate care when I am in adult sessions. He thinks Camp Sunshine is fantastic, and neither of us can wait to return each year.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	184292		/users/profile/193547	ajohnston100	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	After volunteering at Camp for 5 years I took up an internship position over the summer working behind the scenes, and all it did was make Camp sunshine even more magical for me. Every single person, and I emphasize that I mean EVERY person, involved with Camp Sunshine is nothing short of amazing. Camp Sunshine to me represents a different world, one that I wouldn't mind living in forever. From the families to the volunteers to the staff, there is a great sense of family and togetherness that for me, only exists in one small piece of land in Casco, ME. If every other organization is rated from 1-5 stars, Camp Sunshine gets a sixth.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146598		/users/profile/193547	ajohnston100	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	Camp Sunshine is truly one of a kind. It is tough to readjust to the real world after being at camp, because it seems like an entirely different world. After five years of volunteering I have seen the long term impact of Camp Sunshine on families; how it represents a community to them, a place where they finally have the time to be happy again. Families and volunteers come from not only all around the country, but from around the world for this one of a kind experience that they will never forget. There is not a cause in this world I am more passionate about than what Camp Sunshine does for children with life-threatening illnesses and their families. I would have given them 100 stars if I could have!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	148101		/users/profile/196053	mulli31	Volunteer	5	01/15/2013	My husband and I have volunteered at Camp Sunshine for the last 7 years and we look forward to our colunteer week each year.  We love being able to provide a wonderful vacation for these families that otherwise might not take a vacation due to their child's illness.  In all honesty, I think we get more out of the experience than the families do, we get to meet great friends, keep in touch with some wonderful families, watch children grow, and make people smile all while having fun ourselves.  The Camp offers lots of activities for kids and adults alike, the staff is very hands on and involved, you can always find someone to assist you when needed, and the volunteers are attentive and top-notch.  We have also given financially to Camp and have encouraged others to volunteer or donate as they could.

It is more that a week respite for the children and their families, it is like going back home.  The camp staff, volunteers, and families stay connected and feel like a family.  I heard parents remark that their children would rather come to camp than go to Disney World!   It is a stellar organization that maximizes every dollar donated.

We're grateful that he is in remission but his treatment course was challenging and he is still dealing with side effects of his disease and treatment. Camp Sunshine is a sanctuary for our family and a place of healing and renewal. It has been instrumental for our older son, who was marginalized when everybody pays attention to his "miracle" little brother. We can't say enough about how amazing this place is and how well run it is. Colin, our patient, has had the biggest physical improvements after visiting camp. He's outgoing and social, but he truly blossoms when we are at camp and his disabilities are not unusual and all of the kids are embraced. His older brother, Aidan, is more quiet and cerebral and does not easily feel comfortable in places. However, he has found a place at camp and a constructive path to ward healing and belonging. As parents, we love feeling like we are part of a community where we can actively participate and share with other families.

What I experienced was a wonderful staff and resort!  I was very moved by the loving staff and volunteers, the excellent organization of events, and the feeling of welcome and inclusion I felt.  It was a week of widely varying emotions for my family and me, meeting so many FA families.  Parents attended a very comprehensive array of seminars and presentations, while the children were engaged by over 100 volunteers doing everything from golf to archery to a sleepout in the yurts.  My son said it was the most awesome experience he ever had.  I was so thankful for the professional staff -- their experience in facilitating meetings on tough topics, and their approachability and caring made all the difference in the world!  Thank you so much, Camp Sunshine, for the difference you make in our families lives!  Kelly Adams, Colorado Springs, Colorado

It was overwhelmingly difficult time for the family. We were recent immigrants and couldnt count on anyone for help us. Camp Sunshine gave us warmth, hope, and joy. It became our extended family.

At the time, Camp Sunshine was a very small camp but it was a healing place for my family. My son is doing well and he became a physician himself.  I and my husband never forgot Camp Sunshine and we volunteered several times. I watched how the old staff and the newer staff are dedicating their time and energy to make the camp an inviting, warm, informative  place for so many people. May Camp Sunshine continue to be there for so many.

My daughter is a leukemia survivor she had a compromised immune system for a long time.  We were not able to do things that most normal families could do.  Camp Sunshine is a place for us to relax and enjoy ourselves and also connect with families who have gone through or are going through the same ordeal we are.  The staff is amazing and the volunteers truly make Camp Sunshine a magical place.  We love Camp Sunshine!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146793		/users/profile/193787	Gwen3	Client Served	5	12/15/2012	Camp Sunshine was an amazing place. The camp  has allowed my daughter, who had a heart transplant, to feel at home where she was free to be herself with out explanation or feel like an outcast. Children don't get looked at oddly when on steroids or other drugs that change their appearance. Surgical scars aren't pointed out. Families don't get harassed when they can't attend an activity. No one has to explain anything. It's a break from being different, as a child and as a family. We are all in a club of families who have a child with chronic health issues. No one signed up for this, it's what we were dealt in life. Camp member parents do have the opportunity to share in parent group time. We can let our guard down, share our fears and realize we are not the only family feeling the same things. While we are sharing, our kids are boating, swimming, painting or doing skits with staff and great volunteers. Family time is balanced during talent shows, meals and special camp activities. Parents even get to date, as a dinner dance is put on for them, while the kids either camp out, share treats at a bon-fire or relax for movie night. The games they have the adults and kids play are ridiculously funny. Life is uplifting and so much fun at Camp Sunshine. New friends are made and the bonding is unlike any other experienced. I experienced heaven on earth while I was there as a parent. It brought my family closer. Both my daughter and son enjoyed their experience meeting others from all over the globe. Camp Sunshine is a home away from home with out all the additional life stressors.

Camp Sunshine has far exceeded all of these organizations for professionalism and overall organization. That, coupled with the concept of serving not only the ill children but also catering to the entire family of the children makes Camp Sunshine a truly unique organization. The experiences and relationships my wife and I have enjoyed at camp will stay with us the rest of our lives. Every session at camp guarantees us another lifetime memory and we look forward to serving Camp Sunshine as long as we are able to.

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146687		/users/profile/193651	Beth70	Volunteer	5	12/14/2012	I first started volunteering at Camp Sunshine seven years ago.  To say that Camp Sunshine is the best place for families would be an understatement.  Camp Sunshine IS the place to be for families going through difficult times due to illness.  Camp gives families the opportunity to get away from the pain and worries for one week, and reunite as simply just a family.  As a volunteer, I have met many familes and have kept in touch with so many of them as well.  For me, I return every year because sometimes I need to be reminded of how good I have it and that children are going through things that I could never even imagine going through as an adult.  The smiles, the laughter, the fun, the families, and the staff are what makes this the best place to be.  This was truly a life-changing, humbling experience.  I have learned so much from the kids.  Unfortunately, due to illness in my family, I have not been able to go since last year, but it is where I will be this summer.  Beth Gervais

Our family traveled from CA to Maine to participate in the family camping program. My youngest son was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma, a rare eye cancer, when he was an infant. We joined other families with Retinoblastoma at Camp Sunshine. The program was an amazing social opportunity for my son who was previously very cautious and fearful. He did activities at camp that I never thought he would venture out and try. It was an amazing family experience.

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146663		/users/profile/193621	Holly24	Client Served	5	12/13/2012	Camp Sunshine is a very special place for our family. We adopted our daughter at age 2. She had had a liver transplant at age 6 months. When we first arrived at Camp Sunshine when she was 4 years old, we had never even met another family with a child with a transplant. The very first person that we met was a Volunteer with a kidney transplant who helped us with our bags and getting settled into our room. We learned more in the first half-hour at Camp Sunshine than we had in the previous 1.5 years! The encouragement that we received from Camp Sunshine Volunteers, Families and Staff has made all the difference in our family's well-being.  Now that we are an "experienced" transplant family, we are able to be an encouragement to family newer to the transplant process. None of this would be possible without the generous support of Camp Sunshine Donors. We love Camp Sunshine! -Holly

Our family is lucky enough to attend the Bereavement Sessions at Camp Sunshine. From the moment our family walks through those 3 doors we are "home." It is a place that we have found such friendship and support. It is a place where each of our family members feel that they belong and that they are loved. One would think a place filled with people who have lost children would be the most depressing place on Earth, when in fact it is the complete opposite. It is a place where yes sometimes there is crying, but mostly laughing! Our children have so much FUN at Camp! They have so many activities that anyones interests are please. Our children would like to share a few of there personal favorites- Art and Crafts Room, the pool. rock climbing wall, the "Teen Room", and sleeping in a "Yurt".  We also enjoy the opportunity to talk about our experience of going through the journey of cancer with our daughter and now they journey of our grief. It is the only place my children agree to sit and talk with a professional about what they are going through. This is because it is a place of fun first, and healing at the same time. We have a count down to each session that we are lucky enough to be able to attend, and we hope the Camp Sunshine remains a part of our lives forever.

This place is amazing. Volunteering there has provided me with so many opportunities, and because of Camp Sunshine, I have been able to figure out a career path. Camp Sunshine has made me want to be an advocate for childhood cancer research and to hopefully be a PA for pediatric oncology some day. I would recommend volunteering here to anyone because it is an unbelievably rewarding experience. I have met some of the most amazing people here and have developed many lifelong friendships.  The strength of the families is beyond inspiring and everyone should have the opportunity to experience the magic that Camp Sunshine brings to life.

Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146656		/users/profile/193615	Laura107	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	I was a camper at Camp Sunshine in 1990 and have been volunteering since 2004. It is truly a life changing place. They have given me a chance to take my own experiences and use what I have learned to help others. Families of children with chronic illnesses face so many challenges, and camp gives them time to spend time together without stress. Siblings are placed with children their own age and parents can have fun while also joining in support groups. I think that many families facing pediatric illnesses feel that they are alone but camp helps them to build relationships with people who are experiencing what they are. I love Camp Sunshine dearly, and really think that they deserve this recognition.

It is a safe haven for the entire family struggling with a child's life-threatening illness. The camp is a FUN place for all, but also a very supportive and "normal" place for the family. All the families that attend during the week share a similar yet very different story. They have this place to share their story, be heard, and most importantly, be understood. As a volunteer, it is so powerful to see how this camp leaves a such a feeling of hope and love in all who attend. It's a true transformation that takes place right before your eyes. This place is a tremendous blessing to all. It is a place you WANT to keep coming back to year after year.. so amazing.

Groups of students from my school have gone and volunteered, and even as many of us graduate this year, I am sure that we will continue to come. Camp Sunshine very clearly makes a huge difference in the lives of everyone who comes there, whether as a volunteer or as a family member. It has a positive environment where everyone feels comfortable, welcome, included. People enjoy themselves, the kids feel special, and the adults connect with other people going through similar situations and have the pleasure of seeing their children having such an amazing time. Everyone benefits. This place is difficult to describe because it is absolutely so amazing. Coming to camp helps people just as much as any medicine would; it is an incredible experience. I donate to Camp Sunshine, and I really recommend supporting this program. It changes lives.

Whether you are a family member being catered to by Camp Sunshine, or a volunteer, Camp Sunshie truly is a magical place. Where else can the entire family feel cared for in every way possible? Camp provides a full array of camp activities, three full meals a day, evening entertainment, time to talk with other parents of sick children  with a supportive psychosocial director, and if all this was not enough, there is a doctor on-site to care for any medical needs that may arise!  My children have fun every time they attend camp! The volunteers are amazing and the smiles on  the campers' faces reflects the spirit of Camp! 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146620		/users/profile/193571	508pickle	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	It's very difficult to convey what Camp Sunshine means to me, because it's simply incomparable to anything else I've done in my short years. I began my Camp Sunshine journey at 17 years old. I am now 24 and can't imagine life without multiple yearly 3-hr drives to Camp. From the staff, who have remembered my name since 2006 even though I only go up a couple of times a year, to the families who accept and embrace my help and sentiments and hope, even though I can't truly know what it is they go through, there isn't one thing about Camp Sunshine that's left me unsatisfied. Volunteering at Camp grounds me - I leave grateful for my health, my family, my LIFE. I leave humbled and admittedly, often heartbroken that these wonderful, strong, selfless families suffer. But it is things like Camp Sunshine that ease their suffering, or at least that's what they tell us, and in that I can find solace knowing that I've helped in the slightest. But - it isn't about my satisfaction or solace, it's about the families, and Camp Sunshine is quite simply such a stellar place full of so many worthwhile humans you can't help but become overwhelmed with emotion. Explaining what makes this a "stellar" organization would take all day, but let me share this short anecdote: This November at a bereavement session, there was a balloon launch, which is an event for families and volunteers to remember siblings, children, friends and loved ones who have passed away. I didn't have to furiously struggle to hold back my tears, as I feared I would have to, because even though there were many tears falling, it was still a moment of celebration, albeit bittersweet celebration. As the graffiti-ed white balloons rose into the air above the lake, a toddler yelled to her sister to "Make sure you take a good look at it - I don't want you to miss any of my message." That's Camp Sunshine - it might be heart-wrenching, but you'll never be alone here and if you want to yell (or scream or cry) up to the sky, there will be a beach full of family supporting you always.

This was our first excursion as a family after my daughters diagnosis with Leukemia and from the moment we arrived we know we were in the right place. We were so well cared for and made several return trips, each time leaving rested and better prepared to deal with the rigors of our cancer battle. The programs were so helpful to us all.

For my son and I it has been a brick in our foundation as we deal with illness that most can simply not understand.   When my son tears up as we drive away everytime, and a new countdown starts for the next time we will attend, you know how special Camp Sunshine is.  Camp Sunshine is not #4, $5, or whatever it is ranked right now.  It should be #1, and nothing less.

It starts with the counselors who are amazing with genuine heart and soul. The kids feel it and the parents cherish it. For my pre-teen to reluctantly come to Camp complaining all the way, just convinced he won't have a good time - to now - at almost 13 wondering why it's only once a year! Truly makes an impact on the children with life threatening diseases - making them feel 'normal' and having fun all at the same time!! Fantastic. GO CAMP SUNSHINE! :)
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146610		/users/profile/193560	David Wheeler	Client Served	5	12/13/2012	Last week we were blessed again with a trip to Camp Sunshine. The final night of camp is a special night where they have a Celebration Show, which includes a trip down to the lake to launch the kids Wish Boats. Wish Boats are made by the kids during the week. They all have a candle (at least one) on them. The candles are lit and the kids all push them out into the water. Everyone then has a chance to make a wish. Its a powerful moment  probably mostly for the parents. Each boat is a unique reflection of the owner and his or her experience. The boats are personal creations. The ceremony is a great moment of quiet reflection and positive group thinking. I like to think that all those wishes will definitely come true!Camp Sunshine is a magical place. There always seems to be one or more Camp Sunshine Moments during the week. This trip was not an exception. One of the first time campers, Aaron, is a 6 year old boy with Leukemia. He is still in treatment but has just recently lost his hair. Apparently it all fell out over the course of one or two days. He was very self-conscious about it and started wearing a baseball hat almost 24x7. His parents could not seem to get him over it no matter what they tried. So, thats how he showed up to Camp Sunshine and thats how he went to his group session on the first morning. Thats how he was at the end of the first day too and he went to group the next morning with his hat on. But when his parents picked him up for lunch on the second day, there he was, running around with no hat on!! His parents were shocked and did not know what to say. I dont think I saw him wear a hat again for the entire rest of the week. Amazing change in attitude and feeling. Aaron was able to feel normal again and was in a place where he didnt feel different from everyone else. He was back to himself. For me, Aaron was healed just a little bit during his trip to Camp Sunshine. And to see healing taking place right before your eyes man, that hits you square in the forehead. Then it drills right into your mind and travels all the way down into your heart. It becomes part of you. It changes you. It changes you forever.You would think that a group of cancer kids and cancer families all in one place for a week would be a bit of a downer. Sometimes it is. You look around and see how many people are there (so many!). You look at all the names of families that have been there before you (too many!). Little bald heads running around. Wheelchairs, artificial legs, medical tubes. But I gotta tell you, being surrounded by these kids is more uplifting than you can imagine. Look further and you see other things. Kids running around laughing and playing. Those little bald heads have smiles on them! Kids with no hats on anymore! Counselors giving piggy back rides. Support, love, and caring is all around. People hugging. Everyone helping everyone. Small moments of calm for a Mom and Dad  sitting in the Adirondack chairs on the front porch. Look around and you realize that healing is taking place all around you.Maybe the camp is named not for the sun up in the sky, but for all the sunshine bursting out of the hearts and smiles of the campers, the families, the volunteers, and the staff!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146605		/users/profile/193554	latins2	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	We started  going to camp  Sunshine to volunteer as a family in 2004 and have continued ever since, we wouldn't think of missing a year.  our church group started the ball rolling with 5 volunteers and it's since grown to over 15 church members going...........every year someone else decides to go and keeps going.  i really think this gave my daughter a direction in life   She now knows the feeling of giving back and helping others.  we have made some wonderful friends  over the years and know we'll always want to continue.   
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146595		/users/profile/193542	Jennykniss	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	Camp Sunshine is by far the most amazing place on earth. When I first volunteered at camp I left there with a whole new look on life. Camp Sunshine truly changed my life. It made me so appreciate for everything I have and I met the most amazing, strong, funny and appreciative people I have ever met. Camp Sunshine has become my favorite place in the world and each and every time I go I leave feeling rewarded and like I truly helped impact these families lives for the better. I honestly believe that everyone should volunteer at Camp Sunshine because I guarantee it would change their lives forever.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146593		/users/profile/193540	KitchenAl	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	Started at Camp Sunshine when my 12 yr old daughter got Leukemia (2005).  I wouldn't wish this disease on anyone but without it I would never have experience the enormous love & compasion we received from the staff & volunteers at Camp.  The best cross-section of humanity that I've ever encountered.  We loved it as a family.  It had emotional healing for everyone not just my daughter.  Kids bonded immediately with the others.  Never, ever found a better environment for siblings of sick kids.  They get left behind so much during the treatments, but not at Camp.   Parent share advice.  What has worked, what hasn't.  You can't get that kind of feedback from doctors.  Then when we returned, it was if no time had elapsed, we picked up right where we left off.  They are family.  Now returning as a volunteer.  I love giving back to the place that helped us out so much.  One my top ten places on earth.  Truly life-changing.  Go Camp Sunshine!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146589		/users/profile/193533	Laura106	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	The first time I heard about Camp Sunshine, I knew it was a place where I wanted  my family to volunteer.  We started with my husband and I as volunteers, and my children as campers.  After that first year, there was no doubt that we would be back every year we could.  Now my whole family volunteers.  It is a given that Camp Sunshine is part of our summer.  My famiily is able to share a magical experience while building our seperate friendships among the volunteers and families attending camp.  All of our lives have been changed for the better  because of camp. I have heard each of my kids comment. seerately, that there is no other place like Camp Sunshine and they can't imagine their lives without th e time we spend there.  The work that is done at this camp  is extraordinary.  Children who feel they have no one who understands their illness call camp "HOME."  Parents who carry the sadness and fear for their children can find commonalities and support from each and every person there.  You see many unlikely friendships at camp.  Why - because the people who run Camp Sunshine do an amazing job at giving support, respite and fun to each and every person.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146587		/users/profile/193530	Lexi G.	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	I went to camp for the first time in September. Not knowing what to expect I arrived nervous and anxious, but after 10 minutes of being there I was embraced by other happy volunteers all wanting to get to know me. I had the most amazing tme at camp and I tell everyone I run into about my time there. I was fortunate to be with the 6 to 8 year olds who were more full of life and happy than any children I have ever met. I was able to connect with the kids and families ans share stories and memories with them. I cried when I had to say goodbye to my campers and other volunteers!!! They were also tears of joy because of the amazing time I had and it was the first time I had ever felt like I truly made a difference in the lives of others. What's even better is that I still keep in touch with the families and the volunteers and we are all going to try to go to the same session next year! Camp sunshine is truly an amazing and inspiring place. 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146586		/users/profile/193529	Bonnie35	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	The opportunity to be a repeat volunteer at Camp Sunshine is one of the best experiences I've ever had.  Bonding with entire families is amazing.  Bringing the whole family to camp provides the opportunity for each member to interact with others that are going through the same ordeal.  It offers an atmosphere of fun and support.  I am honored to have met some of the bravest people ever.  The kids can be 'just kids' and the parents can laugh and enjoy a special family memory.  I love Camp Sunshine and encourage anyone who has a week or a long-weekend opportunity to make their way up North, and arrange to volunteer.   
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146427		/users/profile/193252	Rachel71	Client Served	5	12/11/2012	We just attended Camp Sunshine for the first time this fall and it was an experience we will never forget. We were able to meet for the first time, other families who have the same rare condition as our son, which was priceless. The volunteers at Camp Sunshine are phenomenal. It was the first time since my son's illness that we were able to let him play like a normal child, knowing he would be taken care of while we spent time with doctors and in support groups. I recommend every family with a child that suffers from a life-threatening condition attend Camp Sunshine at least once. Though we can't wait to go back! 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146365		/users/profile/193154	Don_13	Volunteer	5	12/10/2012	My family discovered Camp Sunshine in 2001 as a supportive, informative, nurturing community of families, in our case, with a child with kidney disease. We went as a family...free of charge thanks to a pool of generous donors...for six years and have now been volunteering for five years. Each week, throughout most of the year, a the camp hosts children and their families, with different life threatening diseases. I our case, we learned all about kidney disease and transplants, the various drugs and their side effects. This was not information from doctors, but families that were going through the daily grind of providing the best care that they were capable of providing. We heard to miracles, the failures, the trials that the children and families went through. The kids were in a supportive place where their scars and tubes and bodies puffed up by steriods were just another one of the kids at camp, free to enjoythe activities and make many new friends. No ne stared or laughed or asked stupid questions. This gave my daughter Lizzie and us, her family all kinds of information needed for Lizzie to choose a pilot drug study that did not use steroids or an imuno-surpresent drug that is toxic to kidneys post transplant. The camp staff is amazing and the 70 or so volunteers at each session provide care, support and friendship to each and every family. In our family we say that "there is no place like Camp Sunshine". 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	146361		/users/profile/193143	Brandi H.	Volunteer	5	12/10/2012	Camp Sunshine is hands down (or hands up) one of the most amazing places on earth. I've been volunteering as a camp counselor for Camp Sunshine for over 7 years. Typically, volunteer work is thought of as an act of giving, but it's hard to leave Camp without feeling you're always taking more than you've given. It has an amazing, small staff who somehow remember the names of hundreds of repeat volunteers and always walk the halls with a smile. From an on-site doctor to well-kept volunteer housing units and 3 meals a day --- there's little sacrifice to giving of your time here. For every ounce you give, you're given a pound in return. The magic of Camp comes from the children you interact with. The families who come to Camp are incredible. They are strong. They have perspective. They know how to live every minute. And they share all of that with you. Camp Sunshine makes every session special from small Winter sessions with camp fires, marshmallows, and ice skating to bustling Summer weeks of water activities, volleyball, and challenge course activities. Camp Sunshine changes lives - not just those of the families it serves, but of those who volunteer to help that mission. Get involved. You won't regret it.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	142400		/users/profile/188868	xcreuz	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	The first time we went to Camp sunshine it was in 2005 when my younger son was being treated for Hodgkins Lymphoma. At that time we were devastated and the whole family needed a brake. We experienced  such a warm, happy  and supporting atmosphere. The next year we were fortunately invited again. It was at the end of that session that my oldest son who was 15 years old wanted to become a volunteer. So, the next year, my son, a friend and I became volunteers. The following year my husband also came with us and 3 years ago my younger son proudly  became a volunteer.  We love to help children and their families to enjoy their  session, have a great time and  forget their illnesses, the same way we were treated a while ago. We are so happy  and proud to be part of the Camp Sunshine family. Camp Sunshine exceeds all our expectations of a great organization.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	141926		/users/profile/188340	bohemiangrl316	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	I have been blessed to volunteer at Camp Sunshine the past few years. Camp Sunshine is an amazing organization to work with. I love the fact that Camp Sunshine caters to the entire family, enabling them to be together while also enjoying activities based off of the children's age group. The program that Camp Sunshine runs is amazing and I plan to go back year after year, despite it being an 8 to 9 hour drive for me.  The people at Camp Sunshine are compassionate and upbeat and the bond that one forms with the campers and families is astounding and cannot be found anywhere else that I have been. I have made lifelong friends at Camp Sunshine and my week spent at camp always manages to be the highlight of my summer.

It is such a special place like no other. It is truly a blessing to be able to volunteer at such a wonderful place. I have met some many wonderful Staff, Volunteers and Families over the years. If you have a chance to volunteer, it is a great experience and it will keep a special place in your heart forever! 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	141439		/users/profile/187745	ragenork	Donor	5	11/19/2012	My youngest cousin went to Camp Sunshine years ago when she was receiving treatment for neuroblastoma. She and her family had a fabulous time. They always said how nice it was to get away and just experience the normalcy of camp activities and camp life. Camp Sunshine is a fantastic organization and the world is a little brighter because of them.

Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	LHQ DanceForce Volunteers At Camp Sunshine  Students and staff of LHQ Danceforce rounded out their summer vacations by volunteering at Camp Sunshine in Casco, Maine, August 26-30. Camp Sunshine supports children with life threatening illnesses and their families. LHQ student Jenn Root is grateful for the opportunity to participate in such an amazing program. "To have had the privilege to work with these wonderful children was life changing. Thank you LHQ for making it possible." LHQ staff Brenda Hadden and Connie Fink were equally touched by their experience. Taking the LHQ Danceforce Students to Camp Sunshine this year was a new and exciting opportunity for us and them. It was so rewarding to see how much the students gave so much love and support to children and families they had just met. Each and every one gave their whole heart to each person they met and we know they will hold a special place in their hearts to the families at Camp Sunshine." Returning home with life-lasting memories, student Hayley Burbank said, "Volunteering at Camp Sunshine was the most unique and life changing opportunity I've experienced. Amanda Lafayette insists shell return to camp, commenting "being able to have that experience and create all those memories is the best feeling in the world. I look forward to volunteering every year." Camp Sunshine has the distinction of being the only program in the nation whose mission is to address the impact of a life threatening illness on every member of the immediate familythe ill child, the parents, and the siblings. Since its inception, Camp Sunshine has provided a haven for over 30,000 individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	141181		/users/profile/187436	508worm	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I began my Camp Sunshine journey at 17 years old. I am now 24 and can't imagine life without multiple yearly 3-hr drives to Camp. From the staffers who have remembered my name since 2006 even though I only go up a couple of times a year to the families who accept and embrace my help and sentiments and hope, even though I can't truly know what it is they go through, there isn't one thing about Camp Sunshine that's left me unsatisfied. Volunteering at Camp Sunshine grounds me - I leave grateful for my health, my family, my entire life. I leave humbled and admittedly, often heartbroken that these wonderful, strong, selfless families suffer. But it is things like Camp Sunshine that ease their suffering, or at least that's what they tell us, and in that I can find solace knowing that I've helped in the slightest. But - it isn't about my satisfaction or solace, it's about the families, and Camp Sunshine is quite simply such a stellar place full of so many worthwhile humans you can't help but become overwhelmed with emotion. Naming specifics of what makes this a "stellar" organization would take all day, but let me leave this short, inspiring anecdote: Last weekend at a bereavement session, there was a balloon launch, which is an event for families and volunteers to remember siblings, children, friends and loved ones who have passed away. I didn't have to furiously struggle to hold back my tears, as I feared I would have to, because even though there were many tears being shed, it was still a moment of celebration, albeit bittersweet celebration. As the graffiti-ed white balloons rose into the air above the lake, a toddler yelled to her sister to "Make sure you take a good look at it, I don't want you to miss any of my message." That's Camp Sunshine - it might be heart-wrenching, but you'll never be alone here and if you want to yell (or scream or cry) up to the sky, there will be a beach full of family supporting you always. 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	140997		/users/profile/187221	sjames	Client Served	5	11/18/2012	In 2005 our son was diagnosed with ALL and our Social Worker gave us a list of non-profit camps that could help us through this difficult time.  At the time our son was only 18-months old and we loved the fact that Camp Sunshine was a family camp.  In June 2006 we first visited Camp Sunshine.  It truly is like no place else; the beauty of the campus, the organization of their programs and staff, and the overwhelming warm and caring volunteers.  It felt like our home away from home.  We have been blessed to return to Camp Sunshine every year thereafter and our children are often in tears when leaving.  We have been blessed to meet many families like ours, and have made lifelong frendships with volunteers, staffers and other families.  We call Camp Sunshine our home away from home; A place where we can be ourself, a place where we understand each other without any need to "explain" ourselves, a place where we can relax and enjoy and watch our children be children and not children-with-cancer.  As a parent, my favorite part of being at Camp Sunshine is participating in the Parent Group discussions, where we truly understand each other, we can laugh, cry and know that we have each other to always count on, because we are all a family, all a part of the Camp Sunshine Family.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	138943		/users/profile/185035	Lynn.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have done a lot of volunteer work over the years and the experience at Camp Sunshine was absolutely wonderful.  The parents who attended were SOOOO comfortable at Camp - comfortable that they are held, comfortable expressing themselves about their loss, comfortable that their children are well taken care of by the volunteer staff.  Each one of these things is significant - and to have a place where all of these elments are present is truly a blessing.  The children seem to really bond as a group and the bond with the volunteers seemed so natural.  I feel honored to have been part of the volunteer staff at Camp Sunshine and look forward to my next experience there.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	138424		/users/profile/184490	LATONG11	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	The first time I went to Camp Sunshine, I was scared.  Scared that I couldn't handle it.  Scared that I wouldn't like it and the kids wouldn't like me.  Then I went to camp and the instant bond between counselor and teenager was beyond anything I could have imagined.  You make life long friends among the other volunteers but mostly importantly with the families.  Hearing their stories is amazing.  By the end of a week, the whole camp is one big family and nothing can tear you apart.  At the end of the week, teens, kids, and counselors alike cry because they've had such a special week and they don't want to go home and leave their friends and loved ones.  Camp Sunshine is honestly one of the most amazing places I've ever been.  The more times I go to camp, the more time I want to spend at camp and the more time I spend time figuring out how to fit more camp sessions into my schedule.  I can't wait to go back in February!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137738		/users/profile/183736	Bibi J.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Each night is themed so the kids have something to look forward to and  there is a song that we all sing (and perform) to start the festivities.  The camp provides activities for children of all ages, ensuring that no one will get bored.  One thing I really liked about the camp was the support that was also provided for the adults.  I was assigned as an adult counselor.  The parents participated in silly games that made them all laugh and help them to momentarily forget about the illnesses that their children were fighting.  Daily group counseling was also a part of the schedule and I think it really helped the parents to know that they were not alone.  Daily meals were provided and volunteers sat along with the families allowing us all to create a bond, to get to know one another and just make new friends.  I could really tell that the staff at Camp Sunshine were extremely passionate about their cause.   They did not let you believe for a second that they did not want to be a part of this.  The support that they provided to the parents, to the children,  the attention to detail to the facility in ensuring that the children were safe and did not lack in anything that they might have needed was absolutely admirable.  The environment bred support and love - I really can't wait to go back soon!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137670		/users/profile/183666	loveCS	Client Served	5	11/12/2012	Our daughter was diagnosed with Lupus in May, 2011.  It was a scary and stressful time.  With Summer quickly approaching our daughter wanted to go to a camp where she could connect with other kids with Lupus.  She was struggling with the disease and its effects on her body.  We vacation in Maine every year.  We were amazed to find a Lupus Family Camp in Maine that was being held the at the same time we were planning to be there.  It was awesome!  It was so supportive of the entire family!  It was extremely informative and the relationships that we built with the other families were amazing.  It is such a gift to out family!  We are very grateful for Camp Sunshine! 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137370		/users/profile/183342	1jdjd	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	In 2010, when considering a vacation from work in California, I knew that I did not want to go somewhere and lie around.  I wanted to do something meaningful.  Then I came across an article on volunteer vacations in a recent Budget Travel magazine, which profiled Camp Sunshine as one option.  After reviewing the camp's website, I was inspired by how and what the Goulds had unselfishly provided for all those families, and I knew that I wanted to help.  At Camp Sunshine, the synergy is about giving of our attention and love to those who are ill, the parents, the brothers and sisters, and those who have sadly passed.  In whatever our interactions may be in our individual volunteer duties, the giving can be with focused listening, loving silence, a warm gaze, a caring touch, joyful and silly laughter, a knowing  smile, and an understanding hug.  At the end of each session the song, "That's What Friends Are For," is sung.  You have to be present then to truly understand, as when you see the families' faces and feel their energy, their happiness, and the love emanating from everyone present, you know the specialness and magic of Camp Sunshine.  I only wish there was one in the West Coast, as you would find me volunteering monthly, if time allowed, and/or if permanent employment with them was possible.   I have volunteered three times and was not there for this November only because of a work issue.  As I believe in the SPECIALNESS OF CAMP SUNSHINE AND THEIR MISSION AND SERVICES to all those families, I will be a lifer volunteer, returning annually.  The families need and receive so much from Camp Sunshine.  There is no other like it.  As a volunteer, what I have received is invaluable, indescribable, and my heart has been touched.  Coincidentally, that year two other California gals, having read of Camp Sunshine through the same magazine, were inspired and volunteered that same November!

What they are doing with children and their families cannot be measured in any other way but wonderful.  This is an organization that deserves whatever you can do to support them.

I have worked with many families that sought refuge at Camp Sunshine and they had only wonderful words to describe their experiences.   It was not until I went to Camp Sunshine that I was able to fully appreciate what uniquely special place it is.   
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137294		/users/profile/183262	camp sunshine	Donor	5	11/12/2012	     I learned about Camp Sunshine from my son Alex.  He is a student and University of New England in Maine (near Camp Sunshine).  He was doing the Polar Plunge to raise funds for the camp and asked me to help his cause.  Of course I obliged and soon came a thank you from the camp for my small donation.  I was impressed as I have given some monies to different charities in the past and cannot remember getting such a nice note.  In researching the camp I was amazed at the wonderful things that they are doing for families in need.  As a leukemia survivor, I know what family means when it comes to overcoming adversity (both physically and mentally) and to be able to help support such a wonderful cause just makes you feel good!  I think it is of utmost importance to let the rest of the world learn about Camp Sunshine and help support it in any way possible.  No matter the monetary amount given they make you feel like you are part of their "family" and I cannot ask for more than that.   
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137250		/users/profile/183217	FAB6	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Camp Sunshine has been a tranformational experience every time I volunteer there. Being around children who are fighting for their lives and having the time of their lives at camp, reminds me that I have strength inside of me that can get me through anything. I have taken the memories of volunteering back with me into my daily life. Voluneering at camp has made me a better person and I look forward to going back again this year.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137201		/users/profile/183158	MichaelsBigBro	Client Served	5	11/11/2012	Not only am I a "client served" but I also volunteered at Camp Sunshine, and every year, I look forward to their "AJ's Polar Plunge." My brother had cancer from 1999 until his death in 2005. I remember the old trailers that provide memories for my first camp memories; they smelled bad and had some gnats outside, but it was a great place for my family to be a real family, not just the splintered group of people fighting to keep my brother alive that we were most of the time. I met the love of my life there on a teen bereavement retreat. The smiles I have seen from hundreds of families in my 4 visits there plus the the polar plunges make it much easier to remember my brother's situation fondly, as painful as it was. Camp Sunshine is a place where people go to ease their pains and heal their souls; those who run the camp do an amazing job at allowing this place to grow, and I couldn't be prouder to give them a high rating. 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	137170		/users/profile/183128	nicmcd	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	I am both a volunteer and a donor. Camp Sunshine is an amazing retreat for children with critical illnesses and their entire families. Families attend at no cost to them thanks to generous donations. The facilities are very well maintained and safe for all. The challenges these families face are tremendous and Camp Sunshine provides a welcome respite for them where they can be together, relax, and not think about day-to-day life. It is hard to put into words how amazing the Camp Sunshine experience is. JOY RISING is one of the best phrases I could use. Everywhere you look, everyone is smiling, everyone is happy, and everyone is enjoying time together in a beautiful spot. This is an incredibly special place and they manage their program, their facility, and their resources with great care.

I have been a volunteer for 5 years and have LOVED every minute I was there!!!!  It is definitely a "two way street"....volunteers get more than they give.  I have met wonderful people...families and volunteers...who have touched my life in a million ways.  My only regret...Camp Sunshine is a far drive for me!!!!  I wish it was closer and I'd be there a lot more!!!   Mary

Camp Sunshine has provided my family with support, love, and a refuge for my children.  We have been so lucky to have such an amazing organization reach out to us multiple times.  Camp Sunshine has given my children a home away from home.  My children would give up any opportunity to go to Camp Sunshine.  We have all made amazing friends and bonds with other families that have gone through what we have gone through.

Let me back track a little. My daughter was also diaganosed with Sickle Cell disease at age two, but I didn't know about Camp Sunshine until four years ago. She was always a shy person, but now because of Camp Sunshine she is now smiling and is now making new friends. She now anxiously awaits for summer so she can see her new family at Camp Sunshine. The staff and volunteers at Camp makes the six days  unforgetable, exiciting, and enjoyable.As a parent I wish we could we could attend Camp Sunshine three time per year. 
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136958		/users/profile/182910	Karen122	Client Served	5	11/11/2012	Our daughter was 3.5 years old when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Prior to having cancer, she was loving, outgoing, social, and love to travel and explore. Once she became sick her world and ours shrank down to hospital stays, doctor's visits, and staying at home. Our little bird was grounded. She was on active chemotherapy for 2.5 years and would need emergency transfusions often. We were too scared to go away for a vacation. We didn't have family close by. I also had a newborn at the time of diagnosis. We felt very alone and lost during this cancer journey.  One day, we saw a brochure stapled to a wall in the hospital waiting room. It had a cheery yellow sun on it which attracted my eye and described a camp for the entire family! Not just for the ill child.  Could this be the respite we desperately needed? It took me 6 months to finally apply and for us to be mentally ready to go. I couldn't believe what an amazing place Camp Sunshine is. We were welcomed with warmth and open hearts. We met so many other families who were going through the same journey.  We were not alone anymore. Our daughter literally flew around the camp with counselors at her side exploring and playing like she hadn't had the chance to do for so long.  Parents receive counseling and fun just like the kids and we met and made some amazing friends. Truly one beam of sunshine can banish the darkness. That beam is Camp Sunshine. Please help them help other children and their families.

These families  have struggled so much throughout the year that they can't wait till it is time to return to camp. They bond so closely with one another that their friends at camp become extensions of their family. I know that this is something these families could not live without. Camp Sunshine does more then give them a week's vacation. It provides them with a lifetime of support, and I love being a small role in that. I look at all these people who have been volunteering for over ten years, and I know that one day that will be me too.

It is an innovative and paramount program. I was a volunteer during their Lupus week in 2009 living near by attending college as a nursing student. The incentive to participate in volunteering at Camp Sunshine was motivating; however,  the experience was moving. I gained so much from the experience that are difficult to put into words. I will continue to volunteer for such an amazing organization for my years to come.

My youngest son is off-therapy after being treated for Leukemia.  Although he had been eligible to attend other camps for kids with life-threatening illnesses, he has never gone, he didn't want to go by himself.  Camp Sunshine is so special because it allows the entire family to attend.  It was great to be around other families who have shared similar experiences.  The volunteers were amazing, and there was so much to do the kids were never bored.  They didn't even miss TV.  Casco, Maine is beautiful and the camp facilities are great.   I would highly recommend any family that has a child with a life-threatening illness make the trip to Casco.  It will be an experience you will never forget.

We had an incredible time with other families all going through similar challenges, and were blessed by the experience.  We realized we were not alone in our emotions and fears.  The kids have a wonderful time with the counselors while the parents have fun and time to relax also, something they normally don't get a chance to do with a very sick child.  We were all taken care of by an amazing group of volunteers and staff.  We have returned every year since then to volunteer as a family and to give back to others going through what we did.  We feel so strongly about the value of this unique and very special place that we now run an annual fundraising event so many more families can experience the magic that happens at Camp Sunshine.  We can not imagine our lives now without Camp Sunshine.  Our volunteer time at Camp Sunshine is a highlight of our year.   We have made life-long friends at Camp Sunshine.  We have seen the program and facility grow over the last 17 years, and are very excited to see it continue to grow and serve many more families.  We are honored to be associated with such an incredible organization.

During that time I had the wonderful opportunity to learn exactly how the Camp operated (caring, supportive, loving, efficient) and how the campers regarded their experience.  To summarize it all - virtually every camper I interacted with during Lupus week regarded the experience as one of the best in their lives and started looking forward to their return to Camp the next year almost before they had left.  They formed friendships, kept in close contact with each other, and gained invaluable knowledge about dealing with their illness in their family lives and in their social worlds.  FABULOUS JOB CAMP SUNSHINE!!!!               
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136813		/users/profile/182756	Kristina L.	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I've volunteered at Camp Sunshine for four years now, and it is without a doubt one of the most loving, wonderful places I've ever been. As a camp that serves children fighting illness as well as their families, it is uniquely effective at supporting entire families. In my time, I saw parents finding support and understanding in each other, sick children being treated as normal, and healthy siblings receiving lots of attention that they may not get at home. I became particularly close with one family, especially their youngest, healthy son. Though we only spent a week together, we have remained in touch and I attended their sick son's funeral when he tragically passed last year. Camp Sunshine families were there to support this family in happy times and the worst time of all. I love the camp as a resource for those in need and as a fun, happy summer camp for those who are lucky enough to attend. I cannot recommend the camp more.

Way before their spectacular current facility was built Camp Sunshine facilitated the same special respite for us that could not be found anywhere else in the midst of chemotherapy. Our experience going back as volunteers was as moving and inspiring as ever. CAMP SUNSHINE MAKES A PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF FAMILIES FIGHTING CANCER.

For months my wife and I faced obstacles and fears, one after another, in isolation.  Camp Sunshine gave us the oppostunity to meet other families who are going through the same experience that we are.  It allowed us to meet with and hear from the top researchers and clinicians in this field.  It facilitated our getting the information we need to look after our son.  It provided us with a support network without which this journey may have been too hard to travel.  It alleviated our fears, helped us face and meet our obstacles, and made us feel that we were not isolated, we were part of a caring community.Thank you.

It's best described as "family away from family," "home away from home," and "Christmas away from December."  We'd be lost without Camp Sunshine.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136787		/users/profile/182729	Taylor11	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I first heard about Camp Sunshine through a friend from college. Myself and 3 friends took a long weekend to go to one of the first winter sessions that Camp had held. The only way I can think to describe my experience is absolutely life changing. Just walking onto campus you immediately feel welcome and like you've been going there for years. Then you get to meet the families. How these kids, siblings, and parents make it through day after day astounds me. I left Camp after that first weekend feeling so grateful, humbled, amazed, and inspired....and I have returned every chance I get since then. The people I have met, the bonds I have formed, the relationships I have made, and the memories I have, have made an incredible impact on my life and will stay with me forever. I feel so lucky to have been given the chance to experience the magic that is Camp Sunshine.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136780		/users/profile/182725	rubenstg	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I have been a volunteer for 6 summers. There was a group of high school students from a school in Worcester, MA that showed remarkable maturity. It gave me great hope for the next generation.  The Camp is an oasis of magic. From the three front doors of different sizes to the cooking crew to the different families that have been a part of Camp over the years, each year is breathtaking and incredibly life-changing.    The campers and volunteers Ihave spent time with have been very resilient people.  you would like to have them as part of your group of friends.   There is a true sense of family at Camp, and that is another reason that Sunshine is so tremendous.  Parents can relax and have fun without worrying about their ill child.  The siblings can get attention they need. All can share and learn from each other.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136769		/users/profile/182709	Jennifer163	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	We attended Camp Sunshine in July 2012.  This was a life altering week for our family.  Our children are 2 and 5 months at the time and spent most of the day in the nursery being cared for by volunteers that were caring, gentle and kind.  We spent more of the day in seminars and classes learning about our daughter's rare condition.  We never worried about the children.  One night we had to meet with one of the doctor's that was lecturing at 9pm to discuss our daughter.  As the children go to bed at 7pm we were faced with the dilemma of who was going to go to the meeting and who would stay behind.  This  was  a very important meeting so we asked the staff if a volunteer wouldn't mind watching them for us.  Five volunteers came as a group to watch the children.  The kitchen staff was also very helpful.  They cooked my picky 2 year old her pasta from home everyday for lunch and dinner and my 5 month old was still able to eat his homemade baby food as they kept it in their refrigerator.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136766		/users/profile/182705	Carol Lee	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	How many ways can we, that are privileged enough to volunteer at Camp Sunshine, explain what the camp means?  It is a chance to help others, yes.  It is a chance to get out of our comfort zone and grow, yes.  It is chance to meet many people we would never meet from all over the country, yes.  But the most important part for me as a volunteer is being allowed to step into the world reluctantly occupied by cancer families.  They let me help by accepting that I care, even if I can't really empathize for lack of walking in their shoes. Each time I apply to bring a group of teens from Harvard, MA or attend on my own I hold my breath hoping that there will be a spot for me.  i don't care if I am weeding, shooting photos or handing out athletic equipment, I just want to be there.  I am there to help and its my favorite place to be.  
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136753		/users/profile/182691	melissa dugan	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	We first learned of Camp Sunshine when we were on vacation in Wisconsin. Our daughter was diagnosed with Stage IV Ewingsarcoma and we decided to take a vacation. We camped at a Jellystone park and saw a sign get posted about Camp Sunshine. We signed up right away. We learned later that this was the first time Camp Sunshine was branching out and Jellystone was going to host. We were signed up for a session right after my daughters Make-A-Wish trip. After spending the week at camp she told us that she enjoyed Camp Sunshine more than her Make-A-Wish trip. Wow what a statement! This place was amazing and did not only good for her but helped our whole family through this torturous road we were on. We were very lucky to be able to come back several times. Allowing her to reunite with these friends that she made that understood what she was going through and no one judged her or looked funny at the girl with no hair because for once she wasn't the only one in the room like that. We always wanted to get up to Maine to see the original Camp but unfortunately, we never made that trip with her. She passed away in 2009 and our family was devastated. We didn't know what to do or how to do it. We were so lost without her. Everyone told us that we should talk to someone but we felt that no one really would understand. Plus, we couldn't find any groups that really related to our children. No support groups for a child that lost a sibling. Then we thought of Camp sunshine and what a huge help they were to us before and knew if anyone would get us it would be the people there. So we signed up for a bereavement session in Maine. What a sense of healing we were given while at camp for the week. Granted we are not completely healed and probably never will be but every time we are able to get into a session at Camp Sunshine we know we will enjoy a little bit more healing. Not to mention the closeness that we feel to my daughter while we are there. Infact, we all become closer as a family while we are there and are able to bring some of that home. I honestly don't know where our family would be without Camp Sunshine. We pray that people will not need to go to Camp Sunshine because that puts them into a category or club that no one wants to belong to but we thank God for the fact that there is a place called Camp Sunshine that is there for those unfortunate families that need that. Hospitals can provide some of the physical healing that is needed but Camp Sunshine provides the emotional and psychological healing that is so desperately needed! We are so grateful for Camp Sunshine that I am sure all who attend feel the same!

I was very apprehensive the first time we went; it could have been an uncomfortable and disheartening experience to be around sick children and their families, but it was just the opposite. Camp sunshine is a place filled with so much happiness and love an acceptance, it is impossible not to revel in the joy that it brings people. My family and I fell in love with this place and it is the one week we look foward to every year, no matter what. The people at camp sunshine have become my second family, and camp my second home.

My son was diagnosed with this syndrome when he was 13 months old.  It is a rare genetic disorder which not much is known about it.  Camp Sunshine brought us together with other families that have a child or children with this syndrome.  It was a wonderful week away from the hustle and bustle of doctor's appointments.  The families we met are now part of our extended family.  Camp Sunshine brings comfort and confidence to families fighting critical illnesses.  There is so much to do too.  My son enjoyed the paddle boats on the lake, mini-golf, the indoor pool  and of course the volunteers.  The volunteers are such an asset to Camp.  They are so engaged with the kids and make it unforgettable.  All the support provided by the staff was excellent.  Camp Sunshine is a place our whole family is looking forward to attending again.

As a family it is the BEST place to go.  Our non-BT child who is 14 now loves it just as our now 10-year old BT child does.  It just makes you feel so connected and NORMAL when you are at Camp.  Everyone is in different places but facing the same situations.  My husband and I were afraid to go the first time but after entering the doors there was no doubt we were in the right place and where we needed to be as a family.  We have received so much support from Camp and the other families we have become friends with at Camp.  At least once a month the kids ask WHEN ARE WE GOING TO CAMP SUNSHINE.  We were there this February but have to get back soon so we can have some more NORMAL for a while.

I volunteered this past summer with a group of kids from my high school, and it was the most fun I had in a long time.  I made dozens of new friends in my fellow volunteers, and of course, with the campers!  Camp Sunshine is honestly one of the best places on earth, everyone is so caring and accepting of everyone else.  I feel like i was able to make a connection with most, if not all of the 20+ kids in the age group I worked with, and I think I even managed to learn from them!

That was back in the day when the camp was only a vistion of what it has become.  A place of hope, respite and unconditional love.  We have returned many times since that first visit and each visit has brought a rekindling of our spirt.  On one of our visits our daugher, then 17 years old said she loved going to camp but was changing her role from camper to volunteer.   We have   transioned to become volunteers.  Our son has many medical issues that prevent us from going to camp often, but we still manage to visit with a day trip.  Our son loves to wear his exspansive clothing collection from Camp Sunshine, it brings a little sunshine into his day which in turn brings sunshine into our lives.

As a parent I cannot express to you how much happiness it brings to our child and as a parent mere words would never explain the support, unity and friendship that we receive to tide us over to the next year.  Our daughter has always said she would rather go to Camp Sunshine every year than have Christmas!  She is no longer an outcast when she enters those doors - she is normal for one week and accepted just as she is.  Throughout the year she is hospitalized many times but our Camp Sunshine Family is always there for her (and us) to listen and lend support.  I say family because that's what they are...we are all held together by a common thread and connected at the heart.  There are things my child endures that nobody else would ever understand but someone who has had the same experience.

Camp Sunshine allows families to get back a little bit of normalcy in their lives.  It was so wonderful to see everyone smiling and having fun.  The staff is exceptional and the week always runs smoothly.  They have meetings for the adults everyday so that they can learn from each others experiences.  The kids are split into age groups and have different activities every day.  I really liked that they cater to the entire family as every family member is impacted when one is diagnosed with cancer.

It is the onlyh program of it's kind.  The camp was designed for these special children.  Children can swim, enjoy the lake, and even camp out in a special cabin.  Families have 2 room motel like rooms.  There is even a candlelight dinner for parents.  The camp is primarily volunteers.  Many of the volunteers are health professionals.  I was the "Camp Nurse" for Transplant week.  I took my family.  I have participated in some of the Camp Fund Raisers.  I highly encourage everyone to support the Camp through donations of your money and your time.  Take a week to volunteer. You will have the best experience of your life.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136658	1	/users/profile/182595	camsmom3	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	We found Camp Sunshine in February of 2011, nearly 7 years after our daughter was diagnosed with massive diffuse brain tumors.  We did not know really what to expect when our family went to Camp the first time: what we found was love, age appropriate activities and fun for each of our 3 children, psycho-social support and community for the parents, and really, a lifeline for our family.  Camp has been there for our family during our daughter's relapse in late 2011 and through her new treatments this year, we have been able to return to camp as a FAMILY and recharge for our ongoing battle.  At Camp we meet other families who are walking the same path we are, and we are able not only to find strength for ourselves as parents (and information from leading experts in our daughter's disorder), but my daughter is able to laugh, and play, and actually be with other kids like her.  We are so grateful for Camp Sunshine and what it has meant to our family.

We left children & Grandchildren in California.  We were lucky enough to find Camp Sunhine and helping other children and their families now fulfills our retirement days.  We volunteer at least 5 sessions a year and drive all summer to the airport, train station, bus station to transport families in and out of camp.  We are so thankful that we have a healthy family what better way is there to give back to those who need you. HANDS UP TO CAMP SUNSHINE!!!

The folks who volunteer are all there for the same reason- the children with life-threatening illnesses, and their families. Everyone at camp is so caring and everyone's focus is on providing a great experience for the kids and their guardians. All the volunteers and staff walk around with smiles on their faces all day, and the same can be said for the families that come to camp. Camp Sunshine truly is a special place!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136650		/users/profile/182586	Laura92	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	I learned of Camp Sunshine through our franchise business, Tropical Smoothie Cafe. We started collecting donations for this charity, however; the first year my family and I went to camp as volunteers we were completely engulfed in the magic that this camp brings to families AND volunteers! We have been volunteering at CS ever since our first week in 2009! It has become one of the highlights of our family time together. We absolutely are proud sponsors and volunteers of this amazing camp! We share our experiences with everyone we know and love spreading the word about the difference this camp makes in ALL who attend! It is so very well organized with lots of activities for both the children and their parents. In addition, the setting couldn't be better! The rooms are wonderful, the food is fantastic, and the views are amazing! God bless the founders and all who are touched by Camp Sunshine.

Fortunately, she's now nine years old and in complete remission. We attended Camp Sunshine a couple of years ago along with other pediatric oncology families and it was amazing! It was just like a wonderful huge family gathering with so much support from fellow guests and the volunteers. This completely free program to those families attending provided great accommodation and food, group support and fun activities, but most of all it provided a chance for our daughter to feel normal - to do the fun stuff kids get to do in a safe environment. We can't thank Camp Sunshine enough for an amazing experience!
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	136646		/users/profile/182582	Gillian R.	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	My grandson had a liver transplant at age 5 months and we learned about Camp Sunshine from the transplant team at NY Presbyterian Hospital at one of his checkups.  We had never expected summer camp could be part of his life.  Because their father has to work, I accompany my daughter and her two children to Maine.  We fell in love with Camp Sunshine and Sebago Lake right away.  The staff and volunteers are amazing, the facilities are sparkling clean (necessary for immune-suppressed kids) and the activities varied and age appropriate.  My daughter was able to connect and make close friends with other transplant parents, the kids just had fun  all day.  I laughed and cried in nearly equal measure that first week and we all look forward to Camp Sunshine each year since then.  I have done what fundraising I can and I tell everyone about Camp Sunshine on my blog and Facebook page.  It is a real gift to families who live with the stress of sick or immune-compromised children.  Thank you!

Absolutely everything is meticulously maintained, and the compassion and passion staff and volunteers show in hosting their guests is readily apparent.  Seeing the kids participate in a wide range of recreational activities...big smiles...lots of laughter...it's a special place.  This organization does an extraordinary job in providing a supportive environment for kids with life threatening illnesses and their entire families.  I am not easily impressed...but Camp Sunshine is simply the best.

Its magic envelopes you upon entering its unique doorways.  Camp Sunshine is our home away from home complete with family, fun, love and endless kindness.  The support we receive there, whether it be during group sessions or in general, is like no other, and desperately needed by families like ours.  When our daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor just days before her fourth birthday, everything changed in an instant.  Our new "brain tumor" life felt isolating and full of fear, anxiety, and sadness.  Coming to Camp Sunshine rewarded us with so much, but especially with knowing that we were not alone.  We validated all our worries with other parents who truly understood.  We gave each other hope. From its staff to the volunteers, Camp Sunshine began the healing process for our family living with this incurable diagnosis and continues to provide limitless happiness each time we attend a brain tumor session.
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	111339		/users/profile/151598	mjoff	Client Served	5	05/03/2012	Camp Sunshine is a little slice of Heaven for those of us who have kids who are fighting life threatening illnesses. The first time my family went to camp, and every time afterwards, we have been greeted with smiling helpful faces. When you walk through the yellow doors there is a wave of instant understaning. You know everyone there has in some way experienced what you have been through. The facilities are clean, comfortable and welcoming. Not only have I found support and love there but so have my children. The cancer child sees other kids just like him and the siblings get to see what it is like to have cancer from a friend's point of view. They also meet other siblings and learn that they are not alone. Siblings get the attention they deserve, just as much as their sibling with cancer. We have made life long friends at Camp that we keep in constant contact with. Though we need help from different friends in different ways, it is so wonderful to have made friends who really understand what we are going through. At camp I lose all my fears. While the kids are doing their activities, my husband and I can take a walk or just sit and talk knowing that our kids are happy and perfectly safe. I will forever be grateful for what camp has done for my family. I know that I will have a lifetime connection wth camp, returning when my kids are ALL grown up to volunteer, to welcome the new family that has just walked through those yellow doors and comfort them any way I can
Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc	111332	1	/users/profile/151584	Lisa86	Client Served	5	05/03/2012	My daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 16 months old.  She has endured many treatments to stop her tumor from growing including surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy.  The treatment to save her has left her very different from her peers, but I am happy to say that she is now 14 years old.  The road has been rough for all of us.  Having a child with any form of cancer is scary and can leave you feeling isolated and alone. My son has been growing up with a "sick" sister which has prevented him from doing many things.  My daughter feels that she has few friends because she is different from her peer group.  We spend a lot of time at doctors' appointments and there is little time left for either child to be "normal" kids.  Camp Sunshine has changed all of that for us.  It is the only camp that I found that allows the whole family to go together, but once there allows every member to relax and enjoy themselves.  As a parent I don't worry about either of my children while we are there.  The volunteers and staff are excellent at taking care of all the children regardless of age.  A doctor is always on staff should there be any worries.  Both children can have fun but also talk about their lives without being ostracized.  The other kids "get it".  As an adult I found a support group unlike any other.  It's not just a support group - it's family!  We have all made lasting friendships.  Camp Sunshine has allowed us time to relax and enjoy life.  It has renewed our hope!

Wreaths Across America	319547	1	/users/profile/397048	Chuck30	Volunteer	5	11/28/2016	Wreaths Across America is an experience and to truly appreciate what it does, one should spend an hour at a National Cemetery laying a wreath or a couple wreaths on the gravesides of our veterans.   Read the headstone aloud, especially to a child or grandchild.  Tell the story of World War II or Korea or Viet Nam or even the Cold War or more currently, the Global War on Terror.   Discuss the service and the sacrifice our veterans have made, their branch of service.

Wreaths Across America	297058	2	/users/profile/387830	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/18/2016	Once I became aware of Wreaths Across America, I was awe struck discovering who, and how, it began. The Worcester's of Maine had been making Christmas wreaths for years and in 1999 (I believe) had a surplus and made the decision to donate these surplus wreaths to Arlington Cemetery. No fanfare, no screaming for the media to show their deed...just good heartfelt respect for the deceased military. My first volunteer trip to help lay the Christmas Wreaths was 2004, a year after my second beloved, LTC Ret. George J Young, was laid to rest in Arlington. I moved to the west shortly afterwards then returned to Virginia in 2006...I try to make the annual volunteer trip to help lay the Christmas Wreaths, health problems do interfere at times! The Wreaths Across America manner of laying these wreaths at each headstone encourages all volunteers to respectfully say the name of that veteran. The growth of volunteers visiting the military cemeteries around the country speaks volumes for the Wreaths Across America organization. They show Americans what Remembrance, Respect and Honor stands for.

Their mission of Honor, Respect and Teach cover every walk of life. As an educator, WAA helps us teach our youth to learn about the sacrifices our military personnel make for our freedom. Many of our youth currently in elementary schools, do not have family members that served in our armed forces. They need to learn about the sacrifices that were made for them and WAA is the driving force behind that education. I can not say enough about the mission of this wonderful organization and it is my hope that it continues  being the driving force for the education of our youth.

Wreaths Across America	249561		/users/profile/286409	Drem	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	I attended my first Wreaths Across America program here locally in 2007 to place remembrance wreaths upon the headstones of veterans. The local Civil Air Patrol Squadron organized the program with about 30 people showing up for the wreath laying. It was a very moving experience to find headstones dating back to the Civil War, WWI and WWII.  In 2008 the Civil Air Patrol handed the reigns to the Patriot Guard Riders for us to continue the program at our about to be opened Jacksonville National Cemetery. In the last 6 years our program has grown from 1100 wreaths to 6800 wreaths. One for every headstone! Every year we receive emails, snail mail and phone calls from the families that have someone laid to rest upon these hallowed grounds. Most are from families that had never heard of Wreaths Across America and are touched by the site of a remembrance wreath on their Hero or loved ones headstone. If Worcester Wreath Company had not started placing left over wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery so many years ago, December would just be another month a military/veteran's family is without their loved ones. However each year these families know that there are thousands of strangers nationwide that value our military's service and sacrifices. It shows them that we will never forget them. As a Location Coordinator I cannot imagine doing anything else but to Remember~Honor~Teach
Wreaths Across America	222675		/users/profile/286409	Drem	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	I started supporting our local Civil Air Patrol with their Wreaths Across America program in 2006. In 2009 I became a location leader for the Jacksonville National Cemetery. Our first year we had about 300 attend placing 1100 wreaths. Last year we had about 2500 attend placing over 5400 wreaths. Besides the basic tenant of Remember, Honor, Teach the most heartwarming driving force is the feedback from families that have never heard about Wreaths Across America. Each year I hear from families who laid a loved one to rest in the preceding year and visited their loved one after the wreath laying ceremony. The comments they share about seeing every headstone with a wreath laid upon it puts a lump in my throat. The appreciation they convey that people volunteered their support, time and money to remember those who have served our country or were the spouse of someone who served proves this is the right thing to do. It also proves that the effort put forward is well worth it.

If you have ever witnessed or rode in the parade to washington you have no doubt been very emotional. what a better way to remember our service men who have died for our country.It teaches all along the way to children what this is all about.Join the parade this year and you will be so glad you did.  
Wreaths Across America	249528		/users/profile/337353	Da Woz	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	My involvement with WAA is through Operation Care Package and the American Legion Auxiliary Post that I am a member of.  It is our privilege to not only help sponsor wreaths to be placed at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, but also to place the wreaths on the veterans' graves.  To have this go nation-wide is a hearty task, but with the help of volunteers and donors, WWA and OCP are ready to take up the challenge.  God Bless the American Soldiers and their families!
Wreaths Across America	249488		/users/profile/337308	ModernMilitaryFamily	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/23/2015	I am currently the owner of Modern Military Family Magazine. While researching content and resources to help our readers, I stumbled upon a story on this organization and photos of all the beautifully decorated resting places of our fallen. I was brought to tears. I am so thankful that an organization like this exist. The simplest gesture can have the most profound impact. 
Wreaths Across America	249487		/users/profile/337307	kellyeverett1	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	Wreaths Across America makes sure that every deceased veteran in a state or national cemetery is honored at the holidays across all 50 states.  For family members that can't get to those graves or deceased veterans without living family - this is a tremendous gift. A gift of a grateful nation in honor of our guardians.  I love Wreaths Across America.
Wreaths Across America	249465		/users/profile/337287	ProudAmerican46	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	Wreaths Across America is an organization that offers every American an opportunity to honor our veterans. We have personally participated in placing wreaths in several states and have donated consistently to this great cause. Unlike many organizations claiming to serve our military these folks are NOT self-serving! 
Wreaths Across America	243129		/users/profile/329778	cringanm	Volunteer	5	05/16/2015	Wreaths Across America is an organization that helps us teach our youth about the sacrifices our soldiers and veterans have made for our freedom.  Many of the current children in school today do not have a family member involved in the military.  It is our responsibility to TEACH,  our youth about the men and women who fight/fought for our freedom and Wreaths Across America makes that happen.
Wreaths Across America	223462	1	/users/profile/287211	Wayne H.	Board Member	5	10/16/2014	I have been involved with WAA for over 21 years, starting with being just one of the few volunteers in the early years of the wreath project at Arlington National Cemetery.  Over those 20 plus years I have seen this organization grow to its present position of one, if not the best, organization showing our veterans and their families that we will never forget what they have provided to us all through their service and sacrifices.  I am honored to be a board member of this organization helping to guide it to even bigger and better ways to Remember, Honor and Teach so that our children will know what Freedom really is and what it has cost us.  We can never forget our veterans! 
Wreaths Across America	223264	1	/users/profile/287006	Cheryl118	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	I've never been to one of the cemeteries.  But I believe that even our veterans, especially our veterans, deserve to be recognized at Christmas.  Just like Jesus, they gave the supreme sacrifice.
Wreaths Across America	223262		/users/profile/287004	Dianne C.	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I learned about WAA through Civil Air Patrol when my daughter was a cadet in CAP.  The Remember, Honor, Teach presentation of a wreath to each military branch is one of the most moving I have witnessed.  Over the years, I watched the participation in WAA grow in Nevada from a few hundred wreaths donated to thousands. Give a wreath donation for a Christmas gift to that person in your family who has everything.
Wreaths Across America	223260	2	/users/profile/287002	FamilyCouncil	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	After my Dad (a retired Navy CAPT) passed in 2011, I was so touched by the kindness of strangers that placed a wreath on his Arlington grave at Christmas.  So, I tracked them down and found out that it was Wreaths Across America (WAA).Myself and other families from the military retirement community where my parents lived began volunteering with WAA in 2012 with wreath sponsorships and placements.  We were able to get a bus of residents to come and help with wreath placements.  It really made the Christmas season so meaningful for us all.  We also assisted with wreath cleanup in January.Many thanks to everyone (WAA folks in Maine, truckers and volunteers) that make this effort so wonderful!!
Wreaths Across America	223167		/users/profile/286910	Joanne41	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I have been buying my Christmas wreaths from WAA for quite a few years now. I purchase one for my home and one for a solider buried at Arlington. As a Blue Star Mother my chapter sponsors 10 wreaths every year. in 2013 I went and placed wreaths in Arlington. what incredible thing they accomplish. I was moved beyond words at the genoristy and the spirit of which we all come together. I will always be a Wreaths Across America sponsy and volunteer 
Wreaths Across America	223068		/users/profile/286809	Kimmer2014	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I first heard about Wreaths Across America on the news.  I was so impressed by what the organization was doing that my husband and I flew from Colorado to DC to participate the next year at Arlington National Cemetery.   AMAZING experience!!!  Since then, we have sponsored wreaths every year and volunteer locally at Fort Logan National Cemetery to honor our relatives and friends, and all those who have served.

Wreaths Across America	222918	1	/users/profile/286665	Kristee14	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I participate in Wreaths Across America as a volunteer and a donor in order to honor and pay tribute to those that served our great country and made it what it is today.  I like the fact that veterans are remembered across the entire nation.  My father is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, so that's where I volunteer.  I miss my father so much.  Last December it was very moving to see the trucks arrive with the wreaths and all the volunteers who turned up on a very cold day to help distribute the wreaths. I hope this year to have a wreath for every grave site (250,000) to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Arlington National Cemetery.

When he was killed, I promised him that I would help veterans as I know he would if he had made it home alive. Wreaths Across America is so special to me, what a wonderful way to show the love and care we have for our Veterans. This is my second year with Wreaths Across America, and I am so honored to be a part of this wonderful organization.. Karen Hickman
Wreaths Across America	222877		/users/profile/286623	Brian110	Volunteer	4	10/15/2014	This December will be our sixth consecutive year that we travel from Boston to ANC to assist with placing wreaths.  As a member from a Gold Star family (Vietnam) I consider it an appropriate tribute.  I know the GS families of today take comfort.  See ya there!
Wreaths Across America	222872		/users/profile/286617	Brandi13	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	I discovered Wreaths Across America though the trucking industry.  My boyfriend is a driver for Prime I saw their Support the troops trailers advertising WAA and checked it out last year I attended my first WAA ceremony and wreath laying I was humbled and honored to place 10 wreaths. This year I am supporting WAA with the purchase or a wreath and giving one as a gift to my Uncle a Veteran of Vietnam. This is a wonderful nonprofit that is deserving on more national attention!  Thank you for what you do.
Wreaths Across America	222851		/users/profile/286595	Susan343	Donor	5	10/14/2014	Been contributing for 2 years ever since I found them on Facebook.  Teaching others, especially children to remember and honor the sacrifices of our veterans is our responsibility as recipients of the fruits of their sacrifices.
Wreaths Across America	222846		/users/profile/286590	yls46	Donor	5	10/14/2014	My husband and I first heard about WAA in 2012 and decided to participate at Arlington Cemetery.  It was truly an amazing experience.  Neither words nor pictures can truly capture the scene of the trucks coming across Memorial  Bridge being escorted by both law enforcement and the Patriot  Guard riders.  Laying wreaths to honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom was humbling. Last year, we not only participated, but also sponsored wreaths.  This year, we plan to do it again and have invited our friends to join us.  
Wreaths Across America	222839	1	/users/profile/286583	Al__4	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	While sitting at home one December I asked my wife if she knew who was putting the wreaths out at Arlington National Cemetery, after some research we discover that it was Wreaths Across America. We decided that year to go to Arlington and take part in the wreath ceremony, that was 10 years ago.After losing a brother who was in the Army during the Vietnam war, it was like no one cared. That day at Arlington changed my view, I found out that someone did care. Thanks to Morrill & Karen Worchester, and all those that participate and continue to participate for keeping the memory of our fallen heroes alive.
Wreaths Across America	222794		/users/profile/286535	Laura218	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	Wreaths Across America has and continues to do so much to increase awareness of veterans who have died for this country.  People unite during the holiday season and volunteer time from their very busy schedules to make sure they are not forgotten.
Wreaths Across America	222772		/users/profile/286514	junia45	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	America is all about doing for others and who more than those who gave it all. To travel to Arlington and have the privilege of recognizing men and women who did their job to preserve and protect freedom is a heart-warming experience.  Men women children -people from all walks of life come together to walk up and down the hillsides -wreaths in their hands,  smiles on their faces.  We came once and it changed us forever. Our family gathers at the truck every year to once again give thanks.

He and my Grandmother died within months of each other and my Dad and his sisters were separated and grew up apart. granddad was buried at Arlington, but since my Dad was also a Marine, we really never had a chance to visit his grave. Inagine our joy to see a wreath on his grave last Christmas, given by a stranger to a man who died in 1933. I will donate this year and if possible, I will volunteer as well.

Wreaths Across America	222758		/users/profile/286501	andidee79	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I was always moved by the pictures at Arlington National Cemetery at Christmas time and all the beautiful wreaths.  When I learned it was only possible because of donations, I did so immediately.  It was only after that I realized what a huge difference they make on a daily basis.  As a wife and mother of AF personnel, it is an honor to donate to such an awesome organization.
Wreaths Across America	222754		/users/profile/286497	jclyde454	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I am happy to donate to Wreaths Across America each year! The ceremony's they put on are heartfelt and very welcomed as a Gold Star Family.

Over and over again they give the message of "Welcome home" to those who did not get a warm welcome when they came home.

Wreaths Across America	222736	1	/users/profile/286477	NavyMomma	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I found out about Wreaths Across America through a friend's post on Facebook.  I immediately wanted to donate to this organization by having wreaths placed on veterans' graves.  In one case, I had a wreath placed to honor my son who is in the US Navy.  In another case, I arranged for a wreath to be placed at Calverton National Cemetery on the grave of a friend who had passed away.  Donated again for another wreath to be placed on the grave of a veteran I did not know.  By supporting this organization's Mission: To Remember, Honor & Teach, we are able, in our own small way, to show our respect  for our fallen heroes who served in the United States military.  It is my honor to do so through Wreaths Across America.  
Wreaths Across America	222722		/users/profile/286460	Patti_K	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	We have been participating in the annual laying of the wreaths since 2005 after the death of our mother. A military wife during our father's 32 years of Naval service, she rests in the Columbarium at Arlington.  Our father will be joining her there in a few month's time.  Over the course of these years, we have seen this effort grow from a grass roots volunteer contingent to an army of dedicated folks - who count this day, as we do, as one of the most important and special days of the Holiday season. The monumental effort on behalf of the Wreaths Across America organization - collecting donations, constructing the wreaths, coordinating their destinations, and handling the incredible logistics - is mind boggling, but never fails to come off with precision.  Their efforts to teach and honor and remember are so very important. Indeed, my husband's Boy Scout troop makes the journey from NJ every December to participate, just one of many Scout troops, Civil Air Patrol contingents, Future Farmers of America, groups of all sorts - all there to make a difference. There is a group of friends and family that also accompanies us, and once they've participated, they earmark the next WAA Day to come again.  The poignant yet heartwarming moments abound. People of all ages - young, old, widowed, married with small children, groups of all sorts, Veterans, families of the fallen . . .  the list goes on and on of those who take part in this day. To lay a wreath at the headstone of a hero - and to remember their sacrifice and honor them in this way - and sometimes to see the face of a grateful grieving friend or relative - just cannot be described. It is our honor to participate each year, to support Wreaths Across America, to spread their story and share their mission.

I love how it has grown and how Veterans all across our land can have a beautiful wreath to decorate their grave. Such a simple gesture for those who gave so much. I want our younger generation to know about WAA and to honor the Veterans of our country! i am humbled to do a small partto help!! 
Wreaths Across America	222688		/users/profile/286423	John285	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	I live in England and I think the WWA is a great organisation. To lay wreaths on every single grave is a giant task and people queue  up to be a Volunteer. Since 2012  I have paid for a wreath for a friend's son. He is buried in Arlington , one year I asked the organiser  to place it on his grave .He even sent me a photograph. This year I will pay for two wreath's as another friend's son is buried in the same section. Wreaths across America are even trying to  teach the young , to Remember, Honor   and Respect  the heroes buried in each cemetery . I feel  it is a honor to help them each year.

It's how my son and I honor and remember our fallen service men and women, friends, family, and others who served our great nation.  I'm proud to say that by doing so we're helping others understand the importance of remembering the fallen, because after all, being forgotten is the worst possible thing that can happen to someone!

Having our cadets participate each year so they will know and understand the sacrifices that were made on their behalf as Americans is a priceless gift. My dad was a WW2 vet, served in the Army, was a POW  in Germany and we honor him each year with a wreath in remembrance of his service. We have 2 sons active duty Army and one Army Reserves and as a Blue Star Mom, WAA is a way to raise funds for care boxes we send to our deployed sons and daughters as well as an opportunity to reach out to the Gold Star families, sharing in their memories and honoring the service and sacrifice of their loved ones, -- an opportunity to stand shoulder to shoulder with others, giving support and feeling supported. For our family it's become and American tradition.

The significance of what these folks do cannot be stated enough.  I have seen first hand the looks on the faces of family members who place the wreaths on the graves of their loved ones.  I have seen first hand families with youngsters, teaching them the value of honoring our fallen heroes.  I have experienced first hand the emotion that gets right under your skin, when we conduct these ceremonies, and the community comes together.  This is important stuff.  And Wreaths Across America does it well, with respect and honor.
Wreaths Across America	222667		/users/profile/286401	Teresa50	Donor	5	10/14/2014	Wreaths Across America is such a wonderful organization to go through the cemeteries and place wreaths at Christmas time on the graves remembering our brave soldiers.  Last year when I donated I requested if a volunteer could snap a picture of my grandparents grave with the wreath.  My grandfather and grandmother I grew up with are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  They were my parents since I was 18 months old.  I would be grateful since I do not live nearby anymore.  Not too long before Christmas I received the best gift ever - a picture.  What a wonderful surprise as I had forgotten about my request.  To this day when I think of my grandparents I choke up.  Now I have such a pleasant, peaceful remembrance.   Wreaths Across American is such a great organization - they touch the lives and hearts of may - as well as the souls of Angels.

It is an awe inspiring program, and the idea that at the same time (noon Arlington time - 10 am Arizona time) thousands of folks, young and older, across the country are honoring those who have served.

Wreaths Across America	222654		/users/profile/286388	Linda305	Donor	3	10/14/2014	What better way to 'honor' the warriors of our lives, putting a wreath in their honor is the least we can do.  It is such a painfree gift and it keeps on giving, take a look at how beautiful the cemeteries look wreathed in their glory.  There is also a program where you get a t-shirt for your donation! How could you resist doing that? This is one of the best donations a family could support.  We have six men in our immediate family now serving in two different branches.  It was the least we can do, don't you agree?
Wreaths Across America	222653		/users/profile/286387	Kris22	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	Being from a military family, being involved with WAA is one of the things that brings so much pride. It is one of those events that makes you proud to be an American, the veterans instilling pride of country, the little ones thanking a veteran for their service. The reverence with which the wreaths are placed at each stone. I get almost as much from being a part of the event as the veterans we are honoring. As an example, in Houston, I have a cousin whose grandfather is buried there. I located his stone on the day of the event and took a picture of it with the wreath and sent it to her. She enjoyed and shared the pic of her grandpa dressed up for Christmas.
Wreaths Across America	222652		/users/profile/286386	Darlene N.	Donor	5	10/14/2014	Every living American should find a way to honor those who gave there lives for our freedom. This is my way of doing this. I donate as many wreaths as I can afford each year. I also make sure a wreath hangs on my front door so all those that enter my home during the holidays are reminded of the sacrifices made by the fallen heroes of our great nation.
Wreaths Across America	222651		/users/profile/286385	Linda304	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	I have only done one event with WAA, that was this past Dec, at the National Cemetery in Canton, GA.  It was raining, cold and bitter...But the people there were awesome..I came by myself, wanting to help and honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.  I did that and so much more, watching the Scouts, senior citizens, and others out in that weather was inspiring and touching.  I will be back again this year, hopefully with family members to honor those who rest in this beautiful place.
Wreaths Across America	222649		/users/profile/286383	Barbara189	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I have been contributing to this organization and cause for several years.  I have an uncle and father-in-law buried in Bushnell National Cemetery in Florida.  Annually, I "gift" sponsorships to my father and others as a recognition of their service to our country.  I am seriously considering getting one of the Wreathes Across America license plates - soon to be issued by the State of Maine!  This is a great organization and a great cause - watching those trucks travel down Route US 1A through Dedham & Holden, Maine on their way to local and national cemeteries is breath taking.  Thank you so much for the means to honor those who have served this country!
Wreaths Across America	222648		/users/profile/286381	Mary300	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I found this organization from a flyer and Jersey Mike's sub place. I looked online to see what they were all about and was amazed! We had just buried my grandparents at Arlington and wanted to make sure they had a wreath on their headstone, along with someone who may not have someone to buy one in their honor. I asked for them to specifically place one on my grandparents headstone, not only did they do that, I got a personal email with a picture of a wreath on my grandparents headstone! My family was so happy and amazed at the love and honor Wreaths Accross America puts into each wreath! We are even thinking about participating this year at Arlington! I have told all I could about them and plan to donate again this year!  
Wreaths Across America	222647		/users/profile/286380	Marilyn48	Donor	5	10/14/2014	My husband died six years ago.  I have taken part in Wreaths Across America every year since his death.  It is so breathtaking to drive into the cemetery and see all the wreaths placed on the graves.  I have started purchasing two wreaths.  Last year, I bought a wreath for my front door.  Just seeing the U.S.and the U.S.A.F. flags makes my heart skip a beat.  I wish I was able to help place the wreaths.  This is a very worthwhile project.
Wreaths Across America	222644		/users/profile/286378	usmcwife93	Donor	5	10/14/2014	We can not forget our service members! This is a fantastic way to remember those that are no longer with us during Christmas. I have donated and will continue to do so and will make it out this year to help place wreaths, my family will do it together as it is important to us all. Without these service members we would not have our freedom. I always try to incorporate my military into my family's daily lives and show my daughter the importance of our Military to keep us free.  
Wreaths Across America	222642		/users/profile/286376	Jim_122	Donor	5	10/14/2014	This organization means so much for so many!  The first time I ever visited Arlington National Cemetery was on a cold, wintry day and noticed the wreaths that had been placed.  My brother served in Vietnam and died serving our country. This tribute to the men and women who bravely served so that we can enjoy the freedoms that we take so much for granted is truly an inspiration.Their compassion is wonderful and I will continue to support them!
Wreaths Across America	222641		/users/profile/286375	ShannonVM	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	I've only participated in/with Wreaths Across America the past 2 years at Arlington National Cemetery and I think they are an amazing organization, I wish I had known about them earlier! None of our heroes should be forgotten, least of all during the holidays. It is such a moving and heartwarming feeling being out there with other volunteers, laying the wreaths and remembering that these fine men and women gave their all for our country.  I look forward to volunteering for many years to come.
Wreaths Across America	222638		/users/profile/286372	Andrea107	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I participated in 2013 for the first time. I found out about our local event, accidently - thru facebook. What an honor it has been to connect with new friends, to help raise awareness and funds for our deceased Veterans. And what a TRUE HONOR it was to be able to place a wreath on that day, on my best friends fathers grave. The ceremony, the volunteers, the families, the Veterans attending - it was amazing. I am proud to help them as much as I can this year as well.
Wreaths Across America	201421		/users/profile/262903	WesleySalmans	Volunteer	5	05/30/2014	We have been involved with this program since 2006. After seeing the U-tube clip on the Arlington Project.  Our first thoughts was disbelief as no one does this for living veterans, let alone those who are buried in National Cemeteries. After checking on the internet we found this to be true and have been involved ever since.We would work 24/7 to help them to Remember, Honor, Teach.  It is the most heart-felt thing we have ever done, to be able to give back to those that can no longer give, during the holiday season,  here at Ft Sam Houston National Cemetery.It is an honor to hand out the "Thank You for your Service Cards" to those still serving, and to Veterans thru-out the community.  We especially give them to the Vietnam Vets, shake their hand and welcome them home.  We still get those vets who tell us that is the first time in over 40 years that they have been welcomed home.It is so gratifing to go out in the military retirement  community and take grave specfic requests when they are unable to walk the cemetery terrain or have loved ones in El Paso or West Point or at the cemeteries that do grave specific.Please attend a ceremony near you this year.  We promise that it will change your life.Shorty & Midge Salmans
Wreaths Across America	201376		/users/profile/262851	Cheryl88	Donor	5	05/30/2014	My father passed away almost four years ago, and the compasion this foundation has shown me is wonderful.  Mrs. Carlile has devoted her time and efforts to raise money to be able to have every veteran's grave covered with a beautiful wreath during the holidays.  This time of year is the most difficult for me, and seeing the uniformity of the wreaths on  the laying ground of so many soldiers, causes me to stop in awe.  While I still sorely miss my father, I appreciate the beauty, respect, and recognition this organization has created.
Wreaths Across America	201331		/users/profile/262796	Debster	Client Served	5	05/29/2014	My husband passed away last October. After the funeral my daughter told me she had heard about Wreaths Across America and I tried to contact them. Messages were left on both sides of the phone and I knew I had missed the deadline to add my husband to their list. The holidays were upon us and I went to Ft. Sam to put flowers on his grave and as I approached his grave I discovered to my delight that they had placed a wreath on his grave. That act of kindness truly meant so much to me and made my holiday so very special. From now on they will always have my support.  My children and  I will be at Ft. Sam to join them in placing wreaths on others graves this and every holiday.
Wreaths Across America	201329		/users/profile/262793	BeaHoeffner	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	Wreaths Across America, San Antonio, has changed my life in a way I never expected.  I wanted to find a way to honor the men & women in our Armed Forces...that's where WAA, SA comes in.12/2013 was the first time I purchased Wreaths & laid them & others at Ft Sam Houston. The ceremony was emotional and beautiful and seeing so many veterans there made me more proud than anything I've been involved with in my life.  I have asked friends & family to be involved in 2014 & they have all agreed.  I've picked up order forms to hand out later this year. I also returned in January, 2014 to remove the wreaths & was overwhelmed by an invitation to a high school graduation from a daughter to her father who was killed in Iraq.  I knew then that the best way to honor and show respect for our military was by being involved with WAA. I thank Judy Carlile for all her hard work & devotion to this amazing organization. 
Wreaths Across America	201213		/users/profile/204732	Judy Carlile	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	Wreaths Across America has brought more love and joy into my life that.....there are no words to describe it. It truly is a blessing that is indescribable. The joy from working on this program all year long, and to see the wreaths roll in on the trucks from Maine.....makes my heart throb. To know that the drivers have carried my heart in the back of their trailers is a joy unmatchable. After the rush of the unload, and to be able to lay wreaths on Saturday to honor our fallen heroes that are laid to rest at the Ft Sam National Cemetery, is a blessing no one can put into words.  At the end of the day, my children and family and I lay my husbands wreath, (and to be able to continue to honor that precious man).....and the joy of the year comes in full circle.......my precious Jim took my heart with him when God took him home, but to honor him at Christmas time is a joy that I can not put into words. WAA thrills my heart and  to hear the stories of family members that have been helping us is a huge joy!!!!! You have to lay your first wreath to know the love and joy of this program. WAA is ABSOLUTELY  my heart!!!!!!
Wreaths Across America	153915		/users/profile/204732	Judy Carlile	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I did not know about WAA until I lost my precious husband in 2008. Jim was and is my heart!!!! I wanted to know all about this program and in 2009, God laid the program right in my lap, and it has been a blessing I can not describe since that day. To work all year long on a program to honor our fallen heroes and veterans that are laid to rest  in a National cemetery is a blessing by itself. But to be able to part of a program that brings almost 4000 people together that have broken and heavy hearts from the loss of a loved one that was so dear, and see the love in a crowd that big...thrills your heart and everyone knows that we are all there as a "huge family" to remember our loved ones, honor their memory and teach our children that everything that we love to do everyday has a price. When the children come out in force it is a joy that thrills my heart. There are so many wonderful memories from the past 4 years, that only comes from love and support of our fallen. WAA is a program that can not be described in few words......but  WOW.....blessing.....thanks......love.......sharing.....tribute.... diginity..... honor.......memories.......all come to mind. Thank you to the Worcester family for starting this program. It is definitely a program of LOVE!!!!!!!
Wreaths Across America	153986		/users/profile/204812	Tina33	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	As a parent, leader and volunteer in two Cub Scout Packs and one Boy Scout Troop , I had the opportunity to go with our Scouts with the support of our community to Arlington National Cemetery for Wreaths Across America.  A moving, educational, and awe inspiring  experience. The ceremonies inspired the boys to research the service person(s) whose graves they placed a wreath on, they really listened to the instructions and paused to pay respect and say prayers for those that served and protected our freedom. They also got to thank some of the active service members who were there for their service.  After laying wreaths my family visited the grave of one of my co-worker's daughter, who bravely served and sacrificed her life for us. The boys and all the chaperones who went on the trip were immediately saying this has to become an annual event after the trip. A great organization that provides an opportunity to give back to our American Heroes. After returning from Arlington, we were told of another location closer to our home, that needs more volunteers, so we are planning to go there next year!  It was such a moving experience we dedicated all the pictures on our Christmas card this year to it and listed the Wreaths Across America website on them to try to inspire others.  Never got so many strong positive responses from Christmas cards before.

Our chapter also bought 4 of the larger Memorial Wreaths that were placed on Christmas Eve on Veterans Memorials throughout our county, remebering Veterans of WWI, WWII and Sailors of all wars and conflicts. It was a proud event for our chapter and one that we plan on doing again this year. What an awesome program to remeber those that have gone on before us.

I make it an annual trip and look forward to it every year and will do so each december. My neighbor a US Army Major and my uncle US Army Master Sergeant and both been to Afghanistan and Iraq and number of times, it is the absolute best feeling, and I thank the wreaths across america family for giving there time for this amazing opportunity.   Michael A.

Wreaths Across America	153871		/users/profile/204691	Michael164	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I first volunteered to help lay the wreaths at ANC in 2007 and was so humbled and moved by the experience that I have participated in some way every year since then.  In 07 I believe we laid 10 k at Arlington,  I came back in 08 and helped lay 15 K. I met Morrill Worcester in 2007 at Arlington and in casual conversation I told him how great it would be if Wreaths Across America could expand to the point that every veterans grave whether in a Nat. Cemetery or not could get a visit from someone who volunteered to remember them by laying a wreath at their grave. He said that was his vision. I also met a young lady and her two boys who had came to Arlington as a planned family event, they had planned to come along with their father but he was killed in Iraq before he made it home. This is when the significance of what Remember, Honor Teach really hit home with me. I moved back to Ohio in 2009 and due to the nature of being an over the road truck driver I was unable to attend the formal events. Instead I had my own private ceremony at the cemetery where my Father, Brother and Uncle are buried. I would order 4 Patriot pairs so that 4 wreaths would be shipped to my house and 4 would go to Arlington, I placed one on my family members graves and one at the small veterans memorial by the flag pole. This continued until 2012 when Craig Transportation (my employer ) volunteered one of their trucks and me as the driver to help transport the wreaths to Arlington. Delivering 3200 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery along with 33 other trucks and their drivers was one of the greatest honors I have ever had. It was truly exhilarating to see 20,000 volunteers come to help lay the 110,662 wreaths that were lain. The significance of all the volunteers that came to participate drove home the fact that our nation as a whole is truly grateful.  At the same moment when the wreaths were being lain at the Tomb of the Unknown a large ceremonial wreath from WAA was being place at the Veterans Memorial at the cemetery where my family members are lain to rest. The wreath bearer was my nephew who served in both Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom, there was a color guard provided by the local American Legion post and the first annual wreath laying was started at Floral Grove Cemetery in West Unity, Oh.  In hopes to expand WAA  Floral Grove Cemetery is now a listed location on the WAA's website open for sponsorships of wreaths to honor ALL 347 veterans graves located there this December. The goal is to also spark interest through out the whole county so that one day as Morrill and I discussed the mission of Remember Honor Teach will spread to all of our veterans.Wreaths Across America is a great charity to not only remember the ones who have served but also to honor the ones serving now in our military and show them that their nation is grateful and they will never be forgotten. Our youth can learn the true values of their freedoms by attending an event.Calvin Coolidge once said ~ A Nation that forgets it's defenders will itself be forgotten.

Wreaths Across America	153846		/users/profile/204668	Meghan11	Donor	5	04/09/2013	I used to live near Arlington National Cemetery and always thought the wreathes at Christmas were a wonderful symbol of how we will never forget the soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  When I found out that Wreaths Across America was the organization behind this gesture, I knew I wanted to support them.  I sponsored a wreath this year and also ordered one for my home and it was beyond what I expected.  The quality and care was amazing and I was happy to know that my donation was going to a great cause.  My husband is a Marine so he loved that we got to display the same wreath that is used to honor the brothers he had loss and those that had fought before him.  We will be donating again next year.
Wreaths Across America	153844		/users/profile/204665	Karla N.	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I have put wreaths on graves at Ft Snelling Cemetery in MN for many years now with the wonderful people from Wreaths Across America and also participated in the ceremony. It is something I am honored to do as I am a Military Mom who is lucky enough to have had her son return home safely after 2 deployments. It reminds me of those that have gone before him, those that fought with him and all those that sacrifice so much for all of us back home. I look forward to sharing time with others there and listen to their stories as to why they are there. I put it on my calendar every year very early so I know nothing else will be scheduled for that day. It's just a small way to show my respect for our nations fallen and their families. 
Wreaths Across America	153843		/users/profile/204664	Anne65	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I started going to WWA @ Arlington National Cemetery in 2009 and I have gone every year since. The ability to play a small role in honoring our Veterans is a moving and proud moment. My father is buried there and in 2010, a friend lost his son in Afghanistan and makes my mission twofold. I go to honor the memory of my father, a Korean War vet, and to remember that freedom is not free. The dedication, respect and honor that I can bring to the final resting place of our brave men and women of the military, is a very small sacrifice. I recruit my children, co-workers and friends to participate too. I plan to bring my biggest group yet in 2013.
Wreaths Across America	153841		/users/profile/204661	jeanneO	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	A whole bunch of us, ~ adults, little kids, big kids, and teenagers went to lay wreaths this year.  We will all be doing it again and again.  It was underfunded,  so we need to help get some donations, because, honestly, it went by too quickly.  We read the gravestones, and thought about the veteran, and his or her family.  I think we all felt a deep connection to those men and women who served, just by touching their headstones, and speaking their names.   I don't think we realized how moving it would be.  
Wreaths Across America	153836		/users/profile/204657	Lysa M.	General Member of the Public	5	04/09/2013	My first experience was when the caravan came through Putnam CT 3 years ago. I was overwhelmed and in awe to see the Patriot Guard escort and so manyTractor Trailers, painted with the logos, full of wreaths ontheir way to Arlington. The lump in my throat comes back whenever I recall that memory. I haven't missed a year since I first found out about the amazing patriotism that Wreath's Across America inspires. It is my goal to actually go to Arlington on National Wreath Laying day and participate in that ceremony.  I carry the thank you cards in my wallet and in my car so I may distribute them when I come upon a Veteran - of anty age - to say thank you.What surprises me the most is the ones who say to me  "I carry these too". I think much more advertising needs to be done at a local level to encourage  awareness and participation in the community for the December ceremonies.

Wreaths Across America	153832		/users/profile/204654	Robby47	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I'm unable to attend Arlington or another local Veteran's cemetery, but do get wreaths and put them on graves of vets I have know that are buried in local cemeteries.  The families of those veterans are really appreciative of this "giving", and others who see me doing it ask and are then told about WAA, and often comment that they will do the same in future years.  So the message is expanded.
Wreaths Across America	153829		/users/profile/204650	Keith16	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	I have had the honor of participating in the Wreath laying at Middle Tennessee Veterans Cemetery for the past 4 years. I heaard about it from a Patriot Guard Coordinator friend while my son was serving in Iraq. The 2st time that I participated, it touched me in ways I cannot explain. My grandfather served as did my great-grandfather, so I consider it the least that I can do to honor their and my son's service. The next 3 years my son and grandson have been there at the service. If you have the chance to particapate, I can guarantee that you will be honored to do so. I will be there in December for this year's service to do my part. Thank you to the sponsors and to Wreaths Across America along with Worchester Wreath Company. Without them, none of it would be possible.

We place a wreath on the grave of a beloved friend.  This year, our 86-year old father, our brother, his wife, another sister, and 4 nephews joined us for the wreath laying.  it's a beautiful and moving event.  Children are thanking the veterans, young soldiers salute the graves after placing the wreaths.  We cannot forget those who gave up their todays for our tomorrows.

We volunteer every year at Arlington National Cemetary and lay wreaths on the graves.  It is a wonderful experience and educational for the kids. I take my son every year and it has become a tradition in which he looks forward to. Laying the wreaths is very special to us, it brings us closer together and also lets us pay tribute to all the military and their families.

Wreaths Across America	153815		/users/profile/204634	Charlene P.	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	My father, a US Navy veteran, passed away unexpectedly over Thanksgiving 2011.  Fast forward a month later, and it was Christmas.  As much as I wanted to visit my fathers grave over the holidays, it was still too soon for me to return to the Washingtons Crossing National Cemetery.  I felt terrible about leaving him alone, but mentally, I wasnt ready.   As Fathers Day approached, I jumped online to find my fathers exact grave location so that I could go and pay my respects.  I came across a picture of my fathers grave and sure enough, there was a wreath on it.  This is how I found out about the Wreaths Across America program.  It was truly comforting to know that a stranger had taken the time to honor my father over the holidays, especially since I was unable to do so.  I knew that I had to pay it forward, and have since volunteered for the program in 2012 and will continue to do so in the future.

It is my passion to remember ALL those who gave so much.  Wreaths Across America is one of my favorite and I feel honored to remember these great Americans by placing a wreath on their final resting place.  This organization is one of the greatest groups I have worked with and I am proud to have participated at Arlington National Cemetery and here in Columbus, Ohio. It brings the community together to remember the sacrifices made, to thank those who gave all and the opportunity to educate younger generations about our great heritage.  If you are not involved, you should be.
Wreaths Across America	135588	2	/users/profile/181466	dtilton	Advisor	5	11/08/2012	Wreaths Across America's most visible effort is the huge national remembrance day in December, when over 700 locations in 50 states and beyond have SIMULTANEOUS wreath laying ceremonies.  Think about that. During the busy holiday season, thousands of people are collectively pausing to reflect and be grateful for those willing the make the ultimate sacrifice.  But this organization also works all year to encourage people to be audacious in their appreciation of our service men and women, their families and veterans.  They reach into schools to encourage them to start conversations across generations as local veterans can make history come alive, and help youg people appreciate how precious freedom is.  I have come to know this organization by assisting the family with its start-up.  The organization was created in response to the flood of people who wanted to help the family in their personal mission to donate wreaths to Arlington every year. I am continually impressed with this family, and the people they have brought into the organzaition, for thier fierce devotion to this effort, for their visible respect for family members who continue on after they lose thier loved ones, and for the way they cherish each and every story they hear about heroism, loss and honoring memories.
Wreaths Across America	125345	1	/users/profile/170509	AmberCaron	Advisor	5	10/14/2012	Im writing in response to the earlier post that provided information to readers that is not accurate. Quite to the contrary, Wreaths Across America (WAA) is governed by an independent Board of Directors that assesses a competitive price requirement at the end of each contract term and the feasibility of soliciting bids from other companies is currently being conducted by committee. WAA relies on a partnership with our founding company to provide fresh, Maine- made wreaths to our locations  that are affordable and delivered on time. All wreaths are made in Maine, using Maine Balsam, farmed specifically for this purpose.  WAA, although not required, has an outside audit conducted annually. In addition, an outside firm is engaged to help provide oversight in complying with IRS nonprofit regulations. The relationship with our founding company providing wreaths was presented in the initial 501 c3 application and a subsequent audit conducted by the Internal Revenue Service found no irregularities in this relationship.Our mission, Remember, Honor, Teach, is carried out in part by coordinating wreath laying ceremonies nationwide in December. We also coordinate veteran services and recognition through a variety of programs, and provide schools with teaching aides for projects throughout the year. We believe in our mission and the meaning it has to our soldiers and their families.Thank you, Amber
Wreaths Across America	125134	1	/users/profile/170274	tobinslaven	Advisor	5	10/11/2012	I work with this organization since before it became a non-profit in 2007. I am responding largely because of the earlier(negative and anonymous) review that called into question the validity of the 501-c-3 status. The official records and IRS filings will address most of this. What I wanted to share was how WreathsAcrossAmerica.org came to be. You can read the full story here: http://www.wreathsacrossamerica.org/about-us/the-arlington-story/    But after donating 5000+ wreaths each year as a company project for over 15 years, the response in 2005 was so overwhelming, that others wanted to know how they could get involved. In 2006 we (Worcester Wreath and the Wreaths Across America working group) informally added all the state and national veterans cemeteries. In 2007 WAA received status as an official 501(c)3. It is an honor to participate in this project. It would help if reviewers would get the facts correct, and not leave reviews anonymously if they really feel there is merit in their reviews.

Wreaths Across America	123039	6	/users/profile/167606	traveldoc	General Member of the Public	1	09/25/2012	This "non-profit" is run by the owners of a for-profit wreath company which sells the "non-profit" millions of dollars worth of wreaths each year. The "non-profit", which gets donations from all over the country and free services donated by trucking companies, does not buy from any other Maine wreath-makers as far as I know. In fact, one other Maine wreath-maker told me that "he buys Canadian wreaths for $5 and sells them to his own non-profit for $15".  It is a nice cause, but seems like a scam. Probably too noble a cause for anyone to actually question, though, but perhaps it is time they did. Even though it was his idea, I think he needs to very publicly put the wreath-buying process out for bids or divide it up among the wreath-makers in his area. He is potentially violating IRS regulations by selling to his own non-profit.

From colored pens, dry erase markers, mechanical pencils, items for a classroom prize box to books (new and used), Ruth's is the first place I look for the things I need for my classroom. Not only does Ruth's provide a financial savings to school districts but to individual teachers, who often spend out-of-pocket money on items for the classroom.

Most people know that teachers do spend their own money on their classrooms, but most don't realize the hundreds and hundreds of dollars that we spend each year on our kids. It comes down to this: if we need it, and the district doesn't provide it, we have to buy it--or go without. If you come from a two-teacher family, like me, that can really add up every year. That's where Ruth comes in. She provides, at no cost to teachers, the resources we need for class. Whether it's a new stapler, reams of paper, binders, in-baskets, books, paper clips, pens, pencils, and everything else you can possibly imagine, she provides it. The businesses who support her give her their excess or their outdated items, all of which would otherwise end up in a landfill. I estimate that so far this year, Ruth's has saved my family personally approximately $250 for items such as those I mentioned above, and many others--including some brand-new new safety goggles for my science class. RUTH, we love you and thank you for your support of education. We are so blessed to have you in the state of Maine! :)

Many of my students have organizational issues; many more live below the poverty level, so being able to provide pens, pencils, folders, binders, etc to them enable me to continue with the work of teaching and to ensure that students have the tools they need. Having access to workbooks and textbook materials gives me opportunities to include different activities and bring variety to my lessons.I'm also the Drama Club director, and we rely heavily on Ruth's for all the materials we need for costumes, props, and sets.

Ruths Reusable Resources	84841		/users/profile/94266	MollyBrothers	Board Member	5	04/05/2011	I began volunteering at Ruth's in 2005 when they were still working out of Bessey School in Scarborough, Maine. At first, I wanted to be involved to get the experience of volunteering. One day, a first grade teacher came in and said that she didn't know how she would get books for her kids if it weren't for Ruth's. I love children, so hearing this made me want to continue to help out. Seeing the community support Ruth's as they were faced with the challenge of having to move out of the Bessey school was also very touching. People and corporations came along side Ruth's to make sure that this amazing resource would not have to close it's doors. Today, Ruth's not only puts supplies into the hands of teachers (which then go to children); now, non-profits and the general public are able to benefit from the donated supplies. The non-profit members of Ruth's have a huge impact on my community - the new public store allows Maine's small business owners a place to go to get discounted supplies, and saves them TONS of money. I could go on and on about Ruth's, but the best way to learn about what they do is to go there and check it out for yourself. There should be a resource center in every major city in the U.S. - Why do businesses throw away brand new supplies? Why should we allow those things to clutter up landfills? If you are "Green", you'll LOVE Ruth's. If you are an educator - you'll NEED Ruth's, and if you are an artist, you won't believe the number of items available to you. Check it out!

I have used other resource centers closer to my place of work, but nothing compares to Ruth's.  The materials and supplies are well-organized and in abundance.  The facility is very clean and well-lit.  I expected to leave with a few items for a specific learning project.  Instead, I filled a grocery cart to overflowing with new books for my students, markers, backpacks, binders, assorted craft supplies, contact paper, fabrics, yarn, pens, paper, white board supplies, and the list goes on and on.  Budgets are extremely tight and I usually spend $1,000+ each year of my own money to supply my classroom.  Now that I know the types of things I can find at Ruth's I will be able to use my small classroom budget for those hard to get items.  My students are loving the "fishing games" I found at Ruth's.  What a great way to improve fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination.   We need more places like this, especially with the current economic situation.

With budget cuts and things getting tighter and tighter in regards to money and resources, having Ruth's helps.  I have been able to get books for my library, paper supplies, envelopes, office supplies, fun games, math and science materials...the list goes on.  I try to go at least once a month and each time it's an adventure.

She saves me a bundle---from binders to tape dispensers to paper and books.  There are prizes for the kids and pencils and markers.....it's an amazing place.   Each time I go I come away with something unique and special----something I can't wait to put to use in my classroom.  Ruth, her husband, and her cadre of volunteers are tireless, and believe me, we ALL appreciate it.

With so many needs for our classroom, administration, etc., Ruths has filled the gaps and kept costs down for us.  The whole philosophy of Ruths-Reusable-Resources is one we all need to adopt today.  We need to think about reusing or giving to a non-profit that offers our "junk" to be a need filled somewhere else.  Ruths-Reusable-Resources allows us to help our community and get help when we have a need.  Ruths connects us together, fills needs, and helps us reuse supplies, computers, furniture, etc!

In these hard economic times, we are fortunate to have Ruths to supply us with the materials we need to teach! Last year, I was overwhelmed with my math materials everywhere. At Ruth's I found these wonderful drawers to organize my math! Other teachers were so impressed, they went in the next weekend to get some for their classroom.Students enjoy using the envelopes to write letters to each other. Every year, I make a special trip to load up on recycled materials so students in my Kindergarten class can design and make a vehicle. I am amazed at what they make with junk art! I love Ruths!!!

Take last Saturday, I went to get just a few items my class is short on, like pencils and 3 hole punch paper.  But by the time I left I found so many other things, from a combination lock to a set of easy to read books for my students.  It serves such a valuable purpose to teachers and our students.  From glue to paper, from odd art stuff to pencil lead, from a box of tissues to calculators, some weeks you just don't know what you will find but it is always practical and useful.  Join me in supporting Ruth's!!!
Ruths Reusable Resources	83241		/users/profile/92150	Carol	Volunteer	5	03/25/2011	Ruth's is not only a great place for teachers to get needed supplies.  It also gives companies a place to donate items that they no longer need.  In the past, many of these organizations put these items into a dumpster.  Now, they can help teachers, students, and the environment by recycling them at Ruth's.  
Ruths Reusable Resources	82888		/users/profile/91661	rlee	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	Ruth's is a needed resource for  schools and teachers.   As budgets decline,  obtaining materials at Ruth's becomes even more valuable to supplement classroom needs .    The customer service and organized layout make "shopping" at Ruth's a pleasure---even more so because there is always an unexpected  surprise item.   Additionally, RUth's allows for the throw-outs at one workplace become treasures at another.

Ruth's finds furniture as well.  I am currently using bookcases, a teacher desk, a teacher chair and file cabinet which I obtained at Ruth's.  I find birthday banners (little plastic flags) for students, paper, pens, pencils, erasers, markers, books, art supplies and much more at Ruth's to use in the classroom.  Since our schools are purchasing very little, Ruth's supports the classroom in many areas.  
Ruths Reusable Resources	82701		/users/profile/91378	Nancy Grose	Client Served	5	03/21/2011	Ruth's is an amazing resource.

Ruths Reusable Resources	82688		/users/profile/91351	Greyhounds	Client Served	5	03/21/2011	Ruth's has been instrumental in providing our school district with furniture, resources, educational materials and books.  During these tough economic times, Ruth's has really pulled through.  I am also amazed and impressed by the wonderful customer service I receive every time I go to Ruth's.  I also appreciate how organized and supportive they are of education and children.  One direct example of their customer service was when Ruth went to the warehouse to find me extra Everyday Math Materials.  Our district is starting this program in the fall and Ruth allowed me to gather materials to help our staff learn about the program.   
Ruths Reusable Resources	82686		/users/profile/91349	lindaj	Client Served	5	03/21/2011	Since my first trip to Ruth's last Spring to my nearly weekly trips since the beginning of this school year I wonder how i ever got along without Ruth's as a resource. The staff is friendly and incredibly helpful. The facility is clean and well organized. I teach over 600 students each school year and do not have a textbook. Consequently, I develop a number of handouts each year. In the past this has  amounted to thousands of copies each year. The free resources I have collected this year have allowed me to create notebooks of resources, everything from matching 3 ring binders (for a class of 35), the copy paper, to plastic sleeves to put each handout  in to prevent wear and tear. These notebooks can be used every year and make it simple to add or revise materials. This alone has saved our school a significant amount of money and is great for the environment! Additionally, the countless other supplies mean I can pass out a pencil to an unprepared student and provide other materials to be used during class time. I can't ever imagine going back to a time without R.R.R.

This resource has allowed me to add experiences into my teaching that would otherwise not be possible. It is a wonderful resource for paper, pens, envelopes, books, prizes, and craft materials that I would not have free access to at school. In these times of reduced school budgets, Ruth's is a bright spot. Ruth's allows us to continue to provide the best possible experiences for our students.  Ruth works tirelessly to continue to gather materials for teachers to have and use to improve their students' experiences. I can't thank Ruth's enough for all the materials I have gotten for free over the many years.

I have been visiting Ruth's for close to 10 years.  Without materials that she offers I would not be able to supply my classroom with the necessary materials needed due to budget shortfalls and the recession.

I have come to rely on the service/materials that they offer.  I have never seen an organization so dedicated to utilizing the resources they have and collaborating with other groups so to help educators  provide for our kids.  I love Ruth's!  I look forward to my Saturdays "shopping" there and finding inspiration with what they have to offer.  I know many other educators who also have come to rely on Ruth's and appreciate all of their hard work and dedication to help benefit our kids.  THANK YOU RUTH!

Ruths Reusable Resources	82510		/users/profile/91013	Nichols	Client Served	5	03/17/2011	Ruth's is a resource for teachers.  Items are donated by local companies such as LL Bean, US Felt MFG, Fibercraft, and Big Al's.  The items donated consist of used binders, overstock office supplies, felt scraps or stickers.   Teachers, whose school is registered, can pick out items of their choice to bring back to their classroom.  Today I got everything from felt scraps which will be used as filters in science class, pencils, used binders, and mesh bags which will be used for leaf litter macro-invertebrate lessons. Empty unused plastic chowder containers and paint brushes will be used to hold materials for building anatomical models. The facility is very well organized, clean and carefully monitored.

The tons and tons of resources they have kept out of the waste stream and given away to schools is unbelievable.  What is even more unbelievable is how much business and industry throw away.  Then along comes Ruths and takes it all and passes it along.  If you ever saw their warehouse and then saw the wonderful service and amazing people behind this effort you would give them any award you could dream up.  Our school feels their work and generosity every day.  We are committed to being environmental stewards at our school and Ruth's help us do this is a big way.  For example, we have not bought a three ring binder, pencils, pens, art paper, envelopes, tables, pencil sharpeners, folders, or notebooks in three years because of them.
Ruths Reusable Resources	82480		/users/profile/90959	dbaker	Client Served	5	03/17/2011	It's hard to imagine how much brand new stuff businesses have to give away.  It's very different in schools.  Ruth's gives businesses a way to turn a terrible waste into a beautiful gift.  Decent office furniture in a school is almost non-existent.  What teacher would order himself a new chair?  He would feel as if he were cheating his students out of some scarce supplies.  The principal has a desk held together with strips of wood and dry wall screws.  A drawer front is held on with duct tape.  She wouldn't order a new desk.  She would be embarrassed and the voters might be angry.  Ruth's gives the folks a chance for new or nearly new stuff they would otherwise never get.  The Ruth's crew is mostly volunteers and yet they know their way around the warehouse.  They're brisk and efficient and friendly.  Someone there does a terrific job training volunteers.   Ruth, Mary and all the rest of the crew provide a much needed service to us.  Without them, we would do without.  When I drive my truck to Ruth's, I feel like I'm on the Polar Express.  When I get back to my school, I'm a believer again.

Several times a year I go to get pencils, rulers, scissors, crayons, paper and other supplies for my kindergarten students. It is a great resource to have. They outreach to businesses in the area to donate supplies they do not need and teachers are able to build creative lesson plans around these materials. By finding a second use for these supplies we are keeping them from the trash, which helps the environment as well as providing needed resources to schools. It is a double benefit for all of us in the community!

Ruths Reusable Resources	82041		/users/profile/90020	bellafuel	Client Served	5	03/12/2011	During these most challenging budget times, Ruth Libby, her staff, and volunteers should be credited with helping to keep many school district supply budges from completely going under.  Her vision, to bring gently used or surplus items  from local businesses to school departments is not only fiscally responsible, but environmentally friendly as well.  The simple fact is that these items are completely usable, but otherwise would be discarded.  "Ruth's" allows this not to occur, but also gives a second lease on life for the items that would otherwise end up in the trash.  Personally, I am going on my third year at "zero" budget- NOT zero increase, but "0-" for my classroom, and the students I have get exactly what they need for their educational process.  Ruth is the best!

When I lived in Gorham, Maine Cancer Foundation provided my follow up treatment and checkups for my first cancer.  I now live in Texas, but for the last 3 years I have sponsored some of the women  from Village School in Gorham who have run in the Tri For A Cure.  I think it is a great cause and (even though I live in Texas), I love that the Maine Cancer Foundation keeps the money in Maine.  Their website makes it easy to donate and I'm able to keep in touch with old friends and co-workers from Maine.  I even entered the poster contest and although it wasn't chosen, one of the teams picked up my poster drawing and have incorporated it into their Tee-shirt that they wear at the Tri. So from a gal who lives in Texas, but still has part of her heart in Maine: "Bravo Maine Cancer Foundation -- Keep Up The Good Work".

I've lost immediate family members to breast, prostate, colon and appendiceal cancers!!   I also have family members that are survivors of some those same cancers! :)  We must keep on trying or "tri-ing"!!!:) :).   Oh, and I have on my list of things to do:  order some PINK TULIPS!! :)
Maine Cancer Foundation	216634	1	/users/profile/280130	Joseygirl61	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2014	As a survivor of bilateral breast cancer I find your TriForACure a terrific event! My daughter Sue has participated as a single and as a team member for years. The information you give at your events is very helpful but meeting other survivors is the BEST. Thank you.
Maine Cancer Foundation	216571	1	/users/profile/280070	has921	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2014	My sister has done the Tri for a cure for several years, the event is wonderful and very inspiring for everyone involved and for everyone who supports the athletes.  All the best in continuing the life saving work you do. 
Maine Cancer Foundation	216520	1	/users/profile/280015	SHL_109	Donor	5	09/23/2014	I have been an enthusiastic supporter ever since I did the Tri-for-a-Cure triathlon in 2010.  The event offered courage and support to survivors, like me.  It was a wonderful community event to raise awareness about all the Maine Cancer Foundation does.  It was an event that helps to empower women in a competition-free athletic endeavor.  It raises lots of money for research.  Maine Cancer has functioned with professionalism and empathy.  Great organization!
Maine Cancer Foundation	216481	2	/users/profile/279976	cnygren	Client Served	5	09/23/2014	I participated in the Tri-For -A-Cure this year for the first time. It was something I had always thought would be fun but never imagined I could get through such an athletic event as an average middle aged woman. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer 1 year ago I decided that I would go  through all the ups and downs of treatment and surgeries for one year in hopes of pulling together enough good health to participate in the TRI. It had been a dream and there was no sense in putting it off. My doctors agreed and it became a goal for me, my family, and my doctors. When I couldn't lift my tooth brush or my teenagers had to brush my hair for me we would laugh and joke that I had a lot of training to do before the TRI. Finally came the day where I was standing on the edge of the water with my new wetsuit at the TRI swim clinic a few weeks before the race. The director was thrilled to see so many first time participants and let us know that during our first swim things may happen. She was ready for them with kayakers, paddle boarders, coast guard boats, and swim angels to help along the way. Whatever came up we could deal with. MCF is a positive force in that same direction. Things like cancer will happen but we are ready for them. We have researchers, new treatments, new imaging, support groups, and out reach programs to deal with whatever happens on the way. MCF makes great strides in bringing hope and positive energy to Maine cancer patients now and for future generations who will benefit from their research gains.
Maine Cancer Foundation	216367	2	/users/profile/279855	Tri4acure,	Donor	5	09/22/2014	Maine Cancer Foundation does a great job raising money for cancer research that helps the Maine economy by staying here in Maine.  I participated in Tri for a Cure and it was very well run and they were always there to help.  I have had a mother and two sisters with breast cancer  and many friends and it stinks.  I hope a cure is found soon.  MCF has some wonderful people working there and I hope someday we will know we were part of the cure!

As a donor, I am interested in knowing that the money I donate goes to those whom I am supporting rather than sending out endless monthly mailing soliciting more money. I appreciate the integrity of this organization in that the majority of the monies are circulated to research and patient care. Thank you! As a Tri participant- this event has been the most well planned and positive experience for the past 2 years. We have had 3 and 4 teams participating and everyone has had a wonderful time and have appreciated the professional athletes and the communities engagement and encouragement. I appreciate this organization so much that I come from North Carolina to participate- knowing that the dollars I raise, stay in Maine. Thank you!

Their diligence, hard work, positive spirit helps make the events they put on to be amazing. It is obvious that they stay true to their mission, which supports cancer research through funding as well as supporting  the health of Maine cancer victims. They strive to keep the money raised in Maine, where surprisingly there is a lot of research happening. They also support organizations that help support patients. Through their website, the public can view where the money goes. I continue to be quite impressed with their organization, and will support it for many more years to come.

The office staff and other volunteers are so positive and generous with their time. My husband also enjoys volunteering at the Tri for a Cure and cheering participants on. Last but not least this organization takes great care in making sure that all volunteers and donors are properly thanked and kept informed on a consistent schedule as to where their monies are being spent and the back stories that go along with the funding. As a survivor I greatly appreciate the work they do and the manner in which they do it.
Maine Cancer Foundation	216390	2	/users/profile/236169	Mrs Dumas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/22/2014	In my travels to oncology offices throughout the state of Maine I am constantly reminded of how much the Maine Cancer Foundation does to help fight cancer right here in Maine.  Whether it is funding research taking place at Jackson Labs or  Maine Med Cancer Research Institute, or helping fund transportation in Eastern Maine, or providing  scholarships for oncology nurses to further their education-- I hear sincere comments of gratitude everywhere I go.   Keep up the good work MCF!!!
Maine Cancer Foundation	179524	1	/users/profile/236169	Mrs Dumas	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	It is really important to me that 100% of the funds that MCF raises stay here in the state of Maine helping Maine Physicians, Researchers and Patients.

I have been touched personally by the work they do.  In the last three years we have lost 3 immediate family members to cancer and have been uplifted with the hope inspired through advanced treatment options, new choices every year. In this event alone thousands are inspired by the stories and lives impacted by cancer and the positive energy and support felt by all who participate.  It is hard to find an organization that touches people so personally and measurably impacts treatment and scientific advancement.

Maine Cancer Foundation	216351	1	/users/profile/279839	HHMaine	Donor	5	09/22/2014	The Maine Cancer Foundation has provided valuable seed funding to Maine Medical Center Research Institute for cancer research.

Despite this devastating diagnosis, my family and I are so incredibly grateful to the Maine Cancer Center and to the Maine Cancer Foundation for all of the support we have received in the last few months. The community that is fostered in southern Maine through the Maine Cancer Foundation is amazing- from the care received at the Center to the events (my sister and a few family friends participated in the Twilight 5k fundraiser)- we are blessed to be a part of this community.The Maine Cancer Center is an invaluable part of the community because it provides much needed resources and support. 
Maine Cancer Foundation	216332	1	/users/profile/279818	Jenny67	General Member of the Public	4	09/22/2014	As a volunteer & past participant in the Tri for a Cure, I must say it was very well organized and communicated. I have lost my sister, mother, friends and father in law to this disease. Often I ask myself how I will get through some of the 'tough' days when they are heavy on my mind and then I realize everyone has their own heartbreaking story, I am not alone.  What was the most memorable & enjoyable part of the Tri, a life changing experience, was that I had the opportunity through activities or clinics to meet others that have been impacted by cancer too.  This seemed to bring a real personal aspect of our efforts and empowered me to feel like I was making a difference! Great organization!

Maine Cancer Foundation	206804	1	/users/profile/269277	Stephanie155	General Member of the Public	4	07/21/2014	I was part of a 3 person relay team. I have to say that everything was wonderful. The race was seamless and felt like it was one of the top races I have participated in.  As a relay team member, I felt as though the relays were somewhat of an "afterthought" - the signs for where the relay members needed to transition were lacking and many volunteers didn't know much about where things were in relation to the relay team. The transition at the swim was a bit difficult since there were so many people, and the relays were at the far end making the transition harder. The place where we met our runner and joined in at the finish was poorly marked.  These things are minor and did not impact our overall performance, just would help to make things a little easier next time.

We both experienced first hand wonderful care from our oncology nurses and nurse navigators.  This warm experience was attributable in part to the training our nurses received thanks to funding from Maine Cancer Foundation.  However, what is magical about Maine Cancer Foundation is the Tri for a Cure:  an  all women triathlon and major fundraiser for MCF.  The Tri gave me a goal.

The camaraderie and positiveness of this event made it memorable, as did the amazing amount of money raised for patient support, research and education here in Maine.  I attended a "Looking Good" workshop in Brunswick and appreciate the make up donated by the Foundation,  and I enjoy the visits by local volunteers while I am doing chemo. We are checking out support groups and the Dempsey Center for future ways to continue an active life in the most healthy, positive manner.

Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	My experience as an athlete/fundraiser for the Twilight 5K and especially the Tri-for-a-Cure have been life changing events. As a cancer survivor I have been given an opportunity to give back to the community that helped me when I was ill. I can also say "I'm a Triathlete", which feels pretty awesome!I have no doubt that the funds raised are used for cancer R&D In Maine.
Maine Cancer Foundation	178566	1	/users/profile/235196	David178	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	I have been a board member for only a few years and discovered this incredible organization due to some work my company was working on with the foundation.  I am so glad we connected.  MCF is so involved in the communities in working on solving issues from cancer.  MCF does things so well.  Planning for the fundraising events is executed perfectly and the passion of the employees and the volunteers at the events is outstanding.  The foundation is very forward thinking and wants to be an important part of bringing together the current solutions in the medical fields to help impact the cancer survivor rates in Maine.  They have such a respect in our communities. I am proud to be a part of this organization.

Maine Cancer Foundation	178520	1	/users/profile/235151	dmitchell	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	The Maine Cancer Foundation is a well organized organization that has gained great visability and respect within the community over the last decade.  The level of passion exhibited by staff, Board members, and volunteers to support research and support for cancer in Maine is unrivaled, in my opinion.  This organization is heading to new heights, and it's an honor to be a part of it.
Maine Cancer Foundation	216367	2	/users/profile/279855	Tri4acure,	Donor	5	09/22/2014	Maine Cancer Foundation does a great job raising money for cancer research that helps the Maine economy by staying here in Maine.  I participated in Tri for a Cure and it was very well run and they were always there to help.  I have had a mother and two sisters with breast cancer  and many friends and it stinks.  I hope a cure is found soon.  MCF has some wonderful people working there and I hope someday we will know we were part of the cure!
Maine Cancer Foundation	178493	1	/users/profile/235124	jgulliver	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	I joined this Board because of the strong  reputation Maine Cancer Foundation has within the community. I have served on many Boards and have learned to only join those organization that have a clearly articulated mission to which they adhere. In addition I look for a professional and lean staffing structure committed to maximizing the delivery of resources to fulfill the mission. Maine Cancer Foundation is all of these largely because the staff and the Board are so passionate about about research and support for those are who are dealing with cancer here in Maine.

The Maine Cancer Foundation is simply the best organized - - and most compelling - - among all of them.   We have great staff, a committed board and a very powerful mission to beat cancer! 
Maine Cancer Foundation	175893	1	/users/profile/232272	jerry4ins	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	My mother died of cancer in 1960 when I was 17.  Years later in my working life, I was introduced to the Maine Cancer Foundation through clients and was impressed by their mission.  Later I was asked to join the board and did.  Over the years, the MCF has grown to be a vital funding source for cancer research, patient care and medical work.  Probably the most important piece for me is that 100% of all money raised stays in Maine.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	282795	3	/users/profile/372960	Writer,	Client Served	5	03/18/2016	I adopted our dog from GaDaH in December 2015.  The response from the rescue was prompt and all my references on my application were called and checked.  Jenny facilitated a transport for my dog to Connecticut (which cut my trip in half) with another adoptive family. While arranging the transport, I received prompt communication from both Jenny and the transporting family. The family had only kind words regarding the rescue (they adopted and were transporting there dog as well directly from the rescue) and refused to take money for transporting our pup.  The pup was checked out by our vet and found to be in great health and right on track.  His personality and behavior (and any issues regarding both) were exactly as stated in his description for adoption.  Other than the adoption fee I paid no additional money and have never been directly asked to donate to the rescue.  I donated the transport money of my own accord for food for the dogs since the kind family refused to take it.  Our dog is thriving and based on my personal experience was taken care of at the rescue.

She was taken from a kill shelter in Texas, and placed with a foster family for several months as she regained her health (she was nearly starved and bald from mange when rescued). When I found her on Jenny's website, I completed the adoption process and arranged to have her shipped up to Maine on a transport. She is a happy, healthy 85 lb. beauty who I adore each day. Thank God there are people who are willing to put their passion into action and save dogs.  My Sinead hit the "Puppy Powerball." She will never know a day in her life again when she has to cower at the hands of a human or long for a drink of water and have abundant tasty food.  Jane Leifester 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	307757		/users/profile/399103	AnimalAd	General Member of the Public	4	10/03/2016	As someone who has followed this rescue for several years I am surprised at the negative comments, although seeing the attacks on Facebook last year it was clear that someone was intent on getting the rescue closed down. I tend to go with the official stance on things and since the rescue has had now two shelter licenses, (posted on their website, which I believe entails visits from animal welfare, I am sure that should anything have been wrong the rescue would not have been allowed to carry on.Reading over the posts it all looks too convenient all the posting around a certain time frame, all in line with what was going on over Facebook when previously people were happy. Maybe the rescue got overwhelmed and needed to refocus, they are certainly doing well with their adoptions so far this year so something is working right. Maybe someone from the rescue upset someone and they wanted revenge, something we will most likely never know.I will continue to support the work this rescue does and keep watching .Until I see something from an official authority saying otherwise then I believe what they are doing is excellent and very much needed and I hold them  in high regard for carrying on after the onslaught over social media.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	301193		/users/profile/362523	Canttell	Client Served	1	08/21/2016	I adopted a dog from this rescue almost a yr ago. He came to ME from Tx with Heartworm.  Jenny put him outside with all the other dogs where mosquitoes were able to bite him then go from dog to dog. No, HW isn't contagious like a cold. It's spread by the bite of a mosquito, just one bite can spread it to many dogs. While Tx is full of it,  Maine is not.  He spent a month outside this way before he was treated with a fast kill treatment, basically arsenic 2 shots 24 hrs apart from each other in his back muscle. It's extremely painful but per the vet, more so to an under weight dog such as him. Then 18 days later he had bilateral FHO (Femoral Head Osteoectomy). She then put up a fundraiser the day of the surgery and told me I couldn't bring him home until all the money was raised for him, she didn't have the money. He stayed at the vets 9 days until all money was raised. I got him home with a draining left him and fluid under them both. Less then 48 hrs he was at the Emergency Vet with both hips infected.  The left hip was re-opened and drained. He ended up on entended antibiotics. Apparently it wasn't what he needed. He finished an 12 wk course of antibiotics about 4 wks about when we thought all was well with his hips. His bone actually was infected from that originally infection,  from a dog that had no immune system to have a major surgery.  Vets have said after HW treatment no surgery should be done for 6 months of any kind, but it was more profitable for this rescue. I have been adviced to sue...

Rescue saved her while she was on kill list and had given couple hours to live. She had received then much needed medical treatment that cost the rescue thousands of dollars. She was and is a very healthy dog.  This rescue deserves excellent reviews for what has done to save so many dogs over the past 5 years. Please do not pay attention to those negative comment, that is written by one person under different names.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	285643		/users/profile/375647	Writer	Client Served	1	04/12/2016	The dog that we adopted was physically healthy. Unfortunately, she had been severely traumatized, presumably before she went to the rescue. More unfortunately, the extent of the dog's needs were not shared. At all. The dog is absolutely phobic about the leash. This is a very significant problem in a house without a fenced in yard.  It is unclear whether the dog is actually house trained (possibly, but since she runs if she goes outside and she can't be leashed, it's hard to tell). The dog is not socialized to and is fearful of people. The fear and lack of interest in people is not changing. I can't imagine how anyone would think that this dog could be a pet as she simply does not respond to human attention. The person adopting the dog is experienced with dogs, competent and willing to invest the time to train the dog in typical new pet behaviour: don't get on the furniture, this is how to walk on the leash, sit, come when called etc. This dog needs significant at home professional intervention which could not have been unknown to the rescue. The local shelter would NEVER adopt out a dog like this.

I could go into sordid details I want people to know-these dogs are not what your being told they are. We had attack-bite issues. Aggression so bad we needed a behaviorist help. It all came down to her pack treatment. My dog was there over a year and ruined by one mentally deranged female.

I hear dogs cry out in pain. Dog's fighting amongst one another daily without anyone to stop them. Dogs barking all hours day or night, no matter how cold it is they're out. We walk on the warm days, the smell is extraordinarily breath taking. You can hear her screaming, swearing at the dogs. Calling them names I wouldn't call an enemy much less an animal that's supposed to be fearful or has been beat or abused. Often times the dogs are loose running through yards. They have killed livestock. She has been seen chasing them down the main road with them just ahead of her SUV driving like a mad woman. What if the dog stumbles? It would be dead!

There are a few, a very few, people who have decided to target this rescue and cause problems. Their opinions are unfounded. The success stories of this rescue saving dogs,  placing them with forever families and bringing joy and happiness are abundant.  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	282647	5	/users/profile/372809	Kort	Volunteer	5	03/17/2016	Anyone giving a bad review about this rescue has never been there or has a personal Grudge against Jenny. I volunteer often and all I see is a lot of healthy dogs living together while waiting for their forever home. The dogs that come to Jenny sick, skinny, Or any health issue are taken to the local vet clinic where they get excellent care. There is definitely no abuse and yes some shelter dogs come to her scared and fearful, we work with those dogs on their terms to bring them around to become loving dogs. Jenny is saving dogs from kill shelters, these dogs are from abusive homes , the streets or who knows what conditions, anyone with any intelligence would know it was going to take time and effort to make them into family pets. Jenny is in this to save dogs, if you lived it you would know there is no money in it and the success comes from the generosity of those of us that love the dogs.

You never deal with Jenny until you actually puck up your dog that's what I recently found out. I backed out of our process when we did start dealing with Jenny herself, the way she pushed us for donations, wanting family to donate. Things weren't as smooth as people say they are. We had been dealing with someone else much nicer in the beginning. Jenny is a mean nasty person once she realized she wasn't getting our cash. This place is a SCAM!

It's refreshing  to see Jennys unconditionall love for animals. She is willing to give them her all every day. In the past 5 years she has saved hundreds of pups from kill shelters and found them new homes  with family's that love animals like she does.Jenny has a network of volunteers ,helpers and supporters  all over the U.S. and Canada who love animals too. I feel bad that a few have made it there misson to criticize and try to ruin Jenny reputation. What Gadah needs is other kind hearted people to help Jenny do what she does best,save lives! Thanks go out to Jenny and her supporters for the wonderful difference they make in these pups lives.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	282343	3	/users/profile/372498	Auto.inman	Client Served	2	03/15/2016	I adopted a dog from this place several months ago. A thin frail unhealthy GSD with many more on going issues then our family anticipated. It has cost us several hundreds of dollars with many more to go before we have any hopes or a shimmer of light before us. We have just begun with socializing due to the fear. This dog is a shell of what a dog should be. We thought we were getting a rehabilitated, healthy young GSD. Instead we got a dog that needs what a rescue should have done before sending it to a home family. It had food aggression with our other dog, didn't know how to live in a home for months. I don't recommend this place to any person at all much less an animal.

When I met the pup six-months later, he was friendly, affectionate, and all if his medical issues were resolved.  He was happy, fluffy, energetic and I fell in love with him immediately.  I'm grateful to Jen for her commitment to these awesome dogs.  She is a very warm person and despite taking care of the rescue pack and running a business, Jen does a really good job at communicating.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	273864	3	/users/profile/363154	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/06/2015	Jenny is a loving, compassionate person.  The dogs in the rescue adore her...so do her adopters and boarders. Incidently,  all of the pups are happy and healthy.   I got involved with the rescue as a potential adopter.  I was looking  for a GSD and had inquiries out with several different rescues.  I ended up adopting  from a private home because the pup I adopted was in a far worse place than Give A Dog A Home.  The dogs at GADAH were already rescued,  and in a loving caring environment.  Jenny was nothing but  helpful, and understanding.  I am now a volunteer, because I respect and like Jenny,  respect her efforts, and I  adore the breed.  In short Jenny runs an excellent organization and I am proud to be a part of it and to call her a friend.

I inquired about Sadie (aka Wendy) and within a week was united with her. This was not an easy task since the shelter is located in Maine and we are located in Pennsylvania.  They brought her down to Pennsylvania to make it happen. I highly recommend considering adopting from this rescue before anywhere else. Thank you Give a Dog a Home!!

Further, Rocky is gentle and socially adjusted thanks to the pack of awesome pups at GaDaH.  I have nothing but praise for Jen and her rescue.

She doesn't just save the prettiest dogs or the healthiest dogs but the ones in greatest need - take for instance our rescue. When Jenny pulled him from the city shelter, he was hours from being put down. Despite being a gorgeous boy with a wonderful temperament, he also happened to be heart worm positive. She had him treated and fattened up and kept him safe until we were able to come across him - we could not be any more grateful!  You can't go wrong when looking for a rescue dog (or a groomer!) - all of her dogs are so well socialized with her pack, they will have a much easier time adjusting to their forever homes.

The care, love, and determination to save as many precious lives possible is second to none. I can't thank them enough for bringing our perfect Ziva into our lives; our family would not be complete without her:) This rescue is focused on finding forever homes for their dogs which is exactly how every rescue should operate! They also do not confine their dogs to individual kennels but allow the dogs to live as a pack! Again, I can't say enough about how amazing this rescue is!! If you're looking for a best friend that's well taken care of, socialized, and you're informed of personality traits this is the rescue to adopt from!! Thank you GADAH for everything you do!

We had lost our pup late last Spring and we were all looking for the perfect family addition. We had searched, and searched thoroughly and decided to rescue rather than just find a puppy. I was scrolling through the GaDaH website, and fell in LOVE with our Sergeant and Lieutenant. They are the most well mannered, patient, loving dogs. Jenny runs a top notch rescue. We could not thank her enough for the addition to our family 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	273353	2	/users/profile/362567	Meredith20	Client Served	5	12/01/2015	We got Milo last summer from Give a Dog a Home. Let me count the ways this org is awesome:1. There are videos posted regularly of the dogs in action. This allows you to get a really good sense of the dogs' behavior and how they interact with each other, with people, with new stimuli.2. Jenny does a terrific job evaluating and rehabbing her dogs. She was spot on with our 'Mr. Mayor' Milo Muggsy Liben.3. The dogs do not have food aggression because they have communal and open access to food. This is a BIG DEAL with rescue dogs, who generally have anxiety about where their next meal is coming from. 4. Jenny does not have nutty requirements like 'the dog must be fenced at all times' or 'you must swear to never let your dog off the leash'. She wants her dogs to go be good companions, well trained and adaptable. We, for example, live in the country and have taught Milo and our shepherd Will, to have excellent recall. So they get to hike and walk off leash, like mannerly dogs should be able to.5. Jenny wants to expand into veteran service dogs and everyone who reads this should help her do so!

We drove all the way down from Rothesay, New Brunswick, Canada, crossing the boarder, to pick up Shania and the trip couldn't have worked out any better.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	273247	4	/users/profile/362450	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/30/2015	Not sure I can put into words the tremendous, positive impact this rescue has on so many lives but I will try. I have seen many, many animals go from starving, sick, neglected animals to loving, healthy, happy members of  a family through the generosity, hard work and tender loving care of this rescue. Recently, I fostered a German Sheperd that was saved from Fort Worth Animal Shelter. He was extremely underweight and could not keep food down. The vet suggested that he be put to sleep because he was diagnosed with Mega-esophagus. Of course, Jenny the backbone of GaDaH, didn't even consider putting the dog to sleep and was more than willing to accommodate the dog despite his special needs. He is alive and well and will bring much joy to his forever family thanks to this rescue. This is just one story of so many! Rescue is hard, stressful, not always pretty and not always perfect. But I've never doubted the dedication and commitment of this rescue to do what is right despite how challenging that may be at times. As a foster, I have made wonderful friends and been brought together with others who love animals. Thank you GaDaH, all the fosters and most importantly Jenny for giving all you have to saves the lives of so many animals.

I am a vet tech for a high capacity animal shelter. Whenever I have a German  Shepherd in terrible condition and need of serious medical attention, I can always call Give a Dog a Home. Jenny always finds a way to help these magnificent dogs in need. Her supporters are there to help in these critical times. Without great rescues like Give a Dog a Home,  my job would be so much more difficult. I cannot thank Jenny and her volunteers enough for all the hard work they do and the lives they save.

I helped at several events and helped with several events. Jenny is a VERY hard work and does amazing things for these dogs BUT I have since stopped volunteering. While Jenny does amazing things she is probably one of the rudest people I've ever met when you do something she doesn't like or agree with. Half the time she wouldn't even say thank you to me except when I did transports and it was just me and her alone. My mom came to one event and then stopped by another event for a bit to help out and both times she completely ignored her and never said thank you for helping after my mom worked her butt off at work all day but still managed to stop by and help. She also called my mom out and called her a coward after she BEGGED for fosters and we agreed but then she turned us down so my mom posted on Facebook and Jenny called my mom a coward even though my mom NEVER mentioned Jenny or the rescues name. She also called me a bad pet owner and belittled me for considering a medical issue with my dog and she kept badgering me on Facebook not letting it go and that is when my time with the rescue ended, I felt so disrespected and disgusted. She complains about "witch hunts" on her and people saying nasty things about her but then she does the SAME THING, very two faced if you ask me. Like I said she does a lot and works very hard! I'm not gonna take that away from her and make it seem all bad because without her so many dogs who are alive would be dead but if you volunteer here just be careful. 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	229853	3	/users/profile/293502	Sabeam	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I volunteer for an awesome rescue....Jenny Cope.  Give a dog a home German Shepherd rescue. I have had the opportunity to help in the transportation of a few. Some from ACS, vets , and meeting some terrific people who have also help as we meet to continue the transportation to Jenny Cope.  Many of them would not be rescued by any others due to their conditions such broken bones (legs, pelvis, dislocation of one or even both hips )and severe skins conditions, malnutrition and abused. The conditions have been very sad. Many are minutes from being put down. Yet Jenny gives these babies a chance for life. I have personally seen the transformation of these babies. Their eyes tell it all. Their tails wagging, some who had no hair now with hair as well as those with the skin conditions all cleared up. Unfortunately by looking into some of  their eyes there had been abuse. Yet once with the work that Jenny does there is trust again. Jenny works so hard to find great homes not for just dogs but to be part of a family. I have never met such a dedicated women who has given so much of herself to ensure the well being for the beautiful babies. 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	229796	4	/users/profile/293443	Davida X.	Donor	5	10/29/2014	Sadly, one of the most noble breeds, the German Shepherd Dog, is no stranger to death row in kill "shelters". In fact, GSDs are the 3rd most oft killed purebred dog in one of these facilities. I network GSDs nationwide and believe me Texas certainly has a large number of GSDs on death row at any given time. Some are adopted, some are rescued, but far too many are murdered. Interestingly though, there's a subset of GSDs that we see in Texas that have a chance at rescue. These would be the hardship cases, the dogs that no other rescue will touch. Dogs with not just broken hearts and broken spirits, but broken bones to match. Some are dying from kennel cough or pneumonia. Some can't even move from paralysis. Some have skin conditions rendering them bald and leathery. Some have gaping wounds with festering infections. Time and time again I've seen these hopeless cases scooped up by Jenny of GaDaH. Without Jenny and GaDaH there'd be nope hope for these tortured souls. There is nothing more gratifying than seeing an 'after' picture of a dog who has been rescued by Jenny and in her loving care...the difference from the shelter picture is astounding. Jenny is often the only hope, the only bridge to life for these creatures. Thank heavens for GaDaH, a GSD in Texas' best friend. 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	282795	3	/users/profile/372960	Writer,	Client Served	5	03/18/2016	I adopted our dog from GaDaH in December 2015.  The response from the rescue was prompt and all my references on my application were called and checked.  Jenny facilitated a transport for my dog to Connecticut (which cut my trip in half) with another adoptive family. While arranging the transport, I received prompt communication from both Jenny and the transporting family. The family had only kind words regarding the rescue (they adopted and were transporting there dog as well directly from the rescue) and refused to take money for transporting our pup.  The pup was checked out by our vet and found to be in great health and right on track.  His personality and behavior (and any issues regarding both) were exactly as stated in his description for adoption.  Other than the adoption fee I paid no additional money and have never been directly asked to donate to the rescue.  I donated the transport money of my own accord for food for the dogs since the kind family refused to take it.  Our dog is thriving and based on my personal experience was taken care of at the rescue.

Her love of GSDs and especially those that are the very weak, hurt, injured, and then some....there is just no comparison.   When death is looking those poor souls in the eye....she's there...And one of my most rambunctious GSDs  - the one and only Cesar - comes from her.  We both spotted him in MS - but, she managed to get him (before I even knew of Rescues) --- and now, he is here-- with a bunch of others - and through her toughness and fighting spirit for these poor abandoned "guys" and "gals" -- I now too, have my own Rescue.   She is truly a heroine for all those that she has saved, is saving, and will save.......!  Here' s to Jenny! :)
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	228791	4	/users/profile/292475	topguntaekwondo	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I first saw the GaDaH facebook page it caught my eye as they were looking for someone to transort a dog from Houston to SA as I live in Sugarland I thought to myself your a animal lover believe in rescue hmm this sounds interesting, so started my journey because from that first FREEDOM RIDE had me hooked!! Jenny met me in SA and one look at her and you can just see the love and care for the fur babies she has, if you follow the progress of the pups many of them have surgerys in which fund raising must be done. Many hands go into the ship with the captain leading the way but one thing is clear these dogs are all safe and sound when they are at the rescue Jenny works very hard,long hours why? you might say well as someone who also adopted a GSD ZACH from GADAH one look in his eyes when he plonks his big head in my lap yep thats the answer............... thankyou too all the volunteers and of course Jenny!!
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	227895	5	/users/profile/291612	C'Lina S.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	One day I just stumbled across GaDaH's Facebook page and was immediately welcomed to the pack by Jenny and other volunteers.  It's been a great warm welcoming and it's been a blessing to be a part of a rescue that strives to be THE BEST!!!  I cannot imagine what it is like to see first-hand how injured  these dogs are when they're first rescued.  Whether it be physically or emotionally I have no doubt it can take a toll on a person to see them hurt.  However, Jenny continues to push forward and do what is best for these loving animals.  She does not stop because she has a headache or upset stomach, this lady crazily pushes further/harder.  Through her videos/photos we're able to a part of their journey even though some of us are miles away.   This is taken from the American Kennel Club website regarding the GSD: "...this dependable breed is more than its 9-to-5 job"........"The breed is approachable, direct and fearless, with a strong, muscular body."  I believe those words also represent Jenny :)
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	227743	3	/users/profile/291467	jeanae	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I met Jenny Cope while rescuing for another group. I have since come to know her and have helped in the past with adoption events.  She has a huge heart for GSDs.  She also expanded that heart to include several mixes.  She goes above and beyond to help the dogs no one else will help.  She will rescue dogs that have horrible medical conditions and give it her all and then some to try and save them. Some times the only thing she can provide them with is love and compassion as she holds them as they cross over the bridge. She will search out specialists for rare conditions. She works tirelessly in her efforts to save these dogs from kill shelters.  She has worked her magic on so many dogs and continues to do so.  Unlike many rescues it is mostly just Jenny.  She has more energy and compassion then several people combined. I am not sure how she manages but she continues to amaze.  In a perfect world she would have unlimited help and finances. But she fights on and on to do the best for these precious babies. 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	217978	3	/users/profile/281529	Stacy47	Volunteer	5	09/27/2014	Jenny goes above and beyond for the love of these dogs.  She takes the dogs that someone else would look at and say are hopeless.  Injured, sick, abused, neglected, it doesn't matter.  Jenny somehow makes them whole again.  I'm so very proud to be a small part of this rescue - for me it is a privilege to help in giving these dogs a second chance.  THANK YOU Jenny for all you do.  Those little beating hearts in GSD bodies are forever grateful!
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	217127	3	/users/profile/280645	Teal Y.	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	Two years ago I made a donation to honor the loss of my sister-in-law's GSD, Marie, to GaDaH-San Antonio. The donation was to help a young male who had been hit by a car, his pelvis shattered, and left for dead. This organization and it's tenacious founder, Jenny Cope saved this dog's life and made sure he and another of her rescues had the life they deserved in a fantastic home. I have witnessed Jenny nursing distemper ,every type of fracture, joint issue,skin disorder, and neurological disease one can name in veterinary science over and over again.  She literally takes the dogs no-one else will; over and over again. Even if a dog is healthy enough when it comes to GaDaH-SA, he is heartbroken when he come to Jenny, as no Shepherd can imagine its family giving him to a shelter. Jenny Cope provides the love, care and " find that forever home "commitment to their well-being; which every dog wants and no German Shepherd Dog can live without. Jenny has assembled a valuable team of equally passionate and capable volunteers and together they are of immeasurable value to the German Shepherd Dog and those who love them. This organization not only saves dogs: it lifts us all up as human beings we should all strive to be.

She helps/save Sheps, that others have given up on sometimes with only hours to spare before being killed!,She works to find kennel space, foster homes, frequently with experienced handlers to help the Sheps gain the skills they need to go on & live a fulfilling life with a new family, and she matches Sheps with forever homes through adoptions. Can't speak highly enough of Jenny(Give a Dog A home German Shepherd Rescue)Jenny clearly puts the welfare of the dogs in her care first at all times in a  thoroughly professional and efficient manner - would recommend without hesitation to anyone.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	215895	2	/users/profile/279347	Katherine33	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	I met Jenny Cope approximately a year ago at a tribute to fallen Police Officers and Firefighters event in San Antonio, Texas.  I have volunteered at her Rescue. I have transported dogs for her either to a vet or bringing a dog to her from a shelter.  Jenny gives her heart and soul for dogs and for the German Shepherd Breed. People have dumped dogs on her that were not shepherds and she still took them in.  She has taken dogs that were very broken and given them new life via surgery.  Anyone who does any work at a Rescue knows that this is not an easy life, but Jenny keeps sticking with it,  when some would have given up.  I applaud Jenny, some day when life allows, I will foster dogs for her and maybe adopt one from her.  If anyone adopts a dog from this rescue they will not regret it.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	215666	1	/users/profile/279071	sherrysk8	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	As someone who has worked with numerous rescue groups and volunteered at multiple shelters since 2001, I wanted to take a couple of minutes to write a review on Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue and commend it's founder, Jenny Cope, for her hard work and dedication.  I have followed this rescue on Facebook and their website for the past couple of years, and though I have nothing bad to say about any of the rescue groups I have worked with, this one goes the extra mile.    Jenny doesn't hesitate to rescue dogs that most other groups would not even consider trying to save.  She pulls from kill shelters throughout Texas and arranges transportation to either the rescue itself or to whichever of the several vet's she utilizes best fits the dog's individual needs (she has several specialists that she calls in when they are needed, as well as a local vet).   Whether it is a pregnant mama dog, a litter of pups with serious health issues or a dog that is suffering from severe injuries or skin conditions, GaDaH rescue is ready and willing to do whatever is needed to help them get ready to live a better life. Because we live several hours from the rescue, we are unable to assist Jenny as much as we would like.  We have helped with some transports and arranging transports on the internet, as well as making some phone calls and sharing available dogs via FB and emails.   We hope in the future to be able to help out more and would encourage everyone else to do the same. Please think of this rescue when you are looking for your next companion - there are always some great dogs at GaDaH GSD Rescue!  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	209905	6	/users/profile/272648	Furryand4Paws	Client Served	1	08/10/2014	I'm sure things started out right, reading the prior reviews. But I'm sorry there are major issues with this rescue now. How can one person properly care for 80 animals many of them that are sick by herself. Read her facebook page, she is majorly stressed.We adopted a GSD from this group almost two weeks ago. I was aware of the skin issues, but was not prepared for the severely malnourished animal brought to my house. How could I not take this poor sweet animal. I felt he would die if he went back to this rescue. I have pictures of when he was pulled from the pound and when I received him three months later. It was my impression and experience that dogs should get better in rescue, not get worse.We were in a one week foster to adopt situation. Three days in we PayPal'ed  the $300 adoption fee, big mistake on my part. No further contact with this rescue despite e-mails, facebook messages and phone calls. Montgomery County pound did shots, micro chip, possible neuter. The only thing this rescue organization did was almost let this animal starve to death.I see this rescue organization "Give a Dog a Home GSD Rescue" as like a bad puppy mill. If you keep supporting them they will continue. To GADAH, rethink what you are doing, you are way in over your head!!!! I've had lots of experience with GSD's and rescue.  This place is not what it seems.

We flew down from Boston, MA and adopted a beautiful German Shepard puppy.  I cant tell you how much I am grateful that they saved her from being killed. She is so smart, I am training her for service dog work and search and rescue!    Give a Dog A Home is an organization that really helps dogs and uses the donations 100% for the dogs.Not for self needs. They post so all can see were donations went. I donated $ and items and saw this for myself. It was awesome to see the dogs chew the bones I bought : ) I encourage you to support this wonderful organization! 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	191861	2	/users/profile/250430	kase2gsd	General Member of the Public	5	12/31/2013	GADAH is a truly remarkable rescue organization because of the direct impact that Jenny makes to save the pups who would not have half a fighting chance if not for her. Many rescue organizations have dozens, some have a couple hundred volunteers, from which they can ask for resources and get assistance. This rescue handles countless GSD pups with a limited, seemingly skeletal core group of people to help. For Jenny to have started this non-profit and continue to take in the GSD cases that she does is really inspiring. I live in Virginia and even though this rescue is in Devine, Texas, I watch it closely to see if I can help in some way. I follow several rescue organizations and can say that few have as much spirit as GADAH does. Everything that GADAH does is for the best of the pups. I hope GADAH can continue to do the amazing work that it has done already for many years to come.

Jenny, the founder, is doing a terrific job of rescuing, getting dogs healthy & socialized, & finding forever homes. My husband & I have helped with transports as well as donations.

Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	191220	1	/users/profile/249622	Donna137	Donor	5	12/19/2013	I stumbled across GADAH earlier this year. As a life long GSD owner, (I have loved many) I was completely awestruck by Jenny's devotion to the breed. She is completely selfless in her efforts to pull dogs literally at death's door at shelters, to rescue, vet and rehab dogs that others would deem too expensive to take on and to love, feed, home and care for these dogs until proper homes can be found. She is one in a million. People want to help, but rarely go to the extremes that Jenny does. I have limited funds at my household, but I donate whenever I can. I know that every little bit helps. If someone is looking for a GSD to rescue, please go to her website and fill out an application. She has many wonderful dogs looking for families to love and to be loved by.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	190632	1	/users/profile/248891	Joe-Laurie S.	Donor	5	12/14/2013	We were blessed with 2 beautiful boys that Jenny saved.  We suffered a devastating loss of our GSD of almost 12 years November of 2011.  That same month I read an article on Pet Examiner about a GSD puppy found in Garland Texas with a broken pelvis, RYKER.  Jenny stepped up to rescue him and I started following the rescue because he stole my heart.  I donated to his care and then just followed along with his progress on facebook.  Jenny is great about posting lots of photos, videos and commentary about what is going on so I got even more vested in him.  Then we decided to put in an application for 2 GSDs.  Since we were out of state and I know how much Jenny loved RYKER, I didn't think she'd let us get him but after checking into us she did!  I was so happy!  We drove to San Antonio for the meet and greet and we got them!  Of course we have remained in contact with Jenny, still follow the rescue, making donations and falling in love with more dogs.  Jenny always goes above and beyond for these precious souls and we will forever be grateful!  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	190574	1	/users/profile/248823	Cindy113	General Member of the Public	5	12/13/2013	I have personally picked up and temporarily fostered a pup from the Irving shelter, Jesse, for this rescue. And am an avid follower of this rescue on face book. Love the pictures, videos, stories, and following along with these pups journeys. Jenny is simply amazing! I am in awe of this lady's commitment, love, and drive for this majestic breed. She has saved so many wonderful GSD's  and mixes from shelters all over Texas that would have otherwise been euthanized. She is candid, blunt, and is a no nonsense type of lady. I like that about her. She takes on all kinds of urgent care pups, ensuring they are well taken care of, and have every chance at a normal, healthy, life. And not just the cute cuddly babies some rescues tend to only care about for a quick turn over, although she has some of those too. And she does most of it, all on her own! She gives everything she has, each and every day to keeping these pups healthy, safe, and loved. She is truly an inspiration, and any pup in her care is very lucky! You can't ask for a more socialized, and well rounded pup then the ones Jenny has. She always has about 40 pups, of all ages and various medical needs, that she cares for every day, from sun up to sun down. Yes, she is very picky about the homes and people her charges are adopted to, ensuring they understand the breed, and that every pup gets the best possible home. And that is exactly as it should be! 
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	190559	1	/users/profile/248798	amandafries	Client Served	5	12/13/2013	My husband and I adopted a 4 month old puppy from Jenny. He is absolutely one of the best dogs that I have ever had. Without Jenny and everything that she does our puppy Kaiser probably would have been put down. Especially since his previous owners gave him up because he bit them. Before we adopted Kaiser we had been following Jenny at Give a Dog a Home for about a year. We had previously adopted a GSD from another rescue the year before and we were looking to adopt another GSD. Every time we met Jenny she was nothing but kind and very helpful. She completely understood that we were looking to adopt another dog, but at that specific time we weren't ready due to still having a little over a year left in our apartment. She was never pushy and we never got any guilt trips from her. As soon as she got Kaiser we knew he was the dog for us and the timing was just perfect. I contacted her and got a response within a reasonable time frame especially with her being a student. She told me everything I needed to fill and get to her. We filled out and got all the paperwork into her. Within 2 weeks we were having our meet and greet. Jenny is absolutely wonderful!!! We are very pleased with our whole experience with Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue

She has saved dozens of dogs with her own heart, strength, home and some help from friends.

If you donate to GADAH, you will be able to see exactly where your money is going and follow these dogs on their journeys. I completely support GADAH and Jenny.

Ones that no one else steps up for.  She gets them the care they need, provides love, shelter and a stable pack.  When she adopts the pups out, she makes sure the pups and new family are well suited and does not hesitate to take a pup back "home" should the fit not be perfect.  If I could, I would volunteer.  She does so much with so little in the area of volunteers.  I donate when I can and urge others to support her and Give a Dog a Home.  You will be hard pressed to find anyone else with the compassion that Jenny has.  She puts her heart and soul into the pups and it shows.

I will continue to support this rescue and all of their efforts to rescue the underdog. Thank you to Jenny and GaDaH
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	181967	1	/users/profile/238722	akralich	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I had followed this rescue for about a year and half, and then one day I decided that I needed to do more to help them out. I contacted Jenny and have helped organize transport runs, answering facebook questions for rescue followers and potential adopters, and assisted with emails to get pledge sponsorships honored. I have also transported a few dogs and some dog food for Jenny and the pack. My first transport was a sweet boy, Jesse, who has since been accepted into the Shepherds for Lost Sheep service dog training program. He will become a service dog for a soldier with PTSD. Jesse is not the first of the rescue pack to be trained for this role, and he will not be the last either. The second transport I completed was for Harley. He is a dutch shepherd that was hit, run over, and dragged by a 4 wheeler. GaDaH stepped up and put a rescue tag on him at the shelter to save his life and get him the treatment that he needed. Harley had major injuries and ended up with surgery to repair his broken upper and lower jaws, another plate to repair a broken facial bone, and a plate to repair his broken pelvis. Many pet owners, nonetheless a rescue, would not pay the over $4500 to fix this sweet boy, but Jenny and Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue did. She takes in many "hopeless", sick and injured dogs and provides them with the medical care, love, and life that they so deserve no matter the cost to her financially or personally. This rescue does not give up on a difficult case and will exhaust every option for care and treatment to get a dog happy and healthy. I cannot say enough good things about this rescue and hope that you will find it in your heart to check them out and help out however you are able!
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	181294	1	/users/profile/237511	Militarynurse	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2013	I met Jenny years ago when I wanted to adopt a GSD.  She checks out families and gives advice whether a GSD would be a good match for the household.  At that time her assessment was right.  I am full time military and would not be able to exercise the dog enough for the breed.  I appreciated her frnakness Jenny is a fantastic and caring person.  She is willing to give all her time to her GSD's without regard to her well being.  The dogs always comes first and she is committed to giving time to saving more GSD's even if she has too many rescues.  There is always a place for a GSD in her pack .  Jenny has also saved other breeds so they could live.   Being stationed in Afghanistan, I have had email chats with Jenny about a GSD as a service dog for PTSD.  She has been so helpful in her answers.  I plan on getting touch with her when I am home again.  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	282795	3	/users/profile/372960	Writer,	Client Served	5	03/18/2016	I adopted our dog from GaDaH in December 2015.  The response from the rescue was prompt and all my references on my application were called and checked.  Jenny facilitated a transport for my dog to Connecticut (which cut my trip in half) with another adoptive family. While arranging the transport, I received prompt communication from both Jenny and the transporting family. The family had only kind words regarding the rescue (they adopted and were transporting there dog as well directly from the rescue) and refused to take money for transporting our pup.  The pup was checked out by our vet and found to be in great health and right on track.  His personality and behavior (and any issues regarding both) were exactly as stated in his description for adoption.  Other than the adoption fee I paid no additional money and have never been directly asked to donate to the rescue.  I donated the transport money of my own accord for food for the dogs since the kind family refused to take it.  Our dog is thriving and based on my personal experience was taken care of at the rescue.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	180933	1	/users/profile/237645	Heather117	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	We receive GSD from Jenny's Give a Dog a Home - GSD Rescue all the time for use in our program.  We train GSD for the Shepherds for Lost Sheep, Inc.  The dogs we have received from GaDaH have been phenomenal.  There are many veterans that have been given their life back because of Jenny and her dogs.  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	180898	1	/users/profile/237608	amazinggrace5	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2013	I am a GSD owner and live in the Dallas area.Im always helping friends find GSD or adoptable dogs in shelters. I just love the dogs that this rescue has saved and try and promote them to the public.Thank you all for what you do love watching the videos of the dogs , they all look so happy and healthy despite being in a rescue.
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	180821	2	/users/profile/237525	Jodi15	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	Jenny came to me while doing some behind the scenes research on German Shepherds in San Antonio. The rescue, Give A Dog A home came up when I typed in German shepherd in San Antonio. I was beyond thrilled. I had learned that she had been in rescue for about 6 months to a year I believe it was. I then showed my husband and it was following her that gave us the courage to check into adopting. After going to help where we could at events, we became thrilled to do whatever we could to help her save the dogs she needed us for. First was a transport from Austin. Then one from Houston. Wherever she needed us we would try to be there. Now, I feel like the rescue is our family. Every time Jenny asks We look at our schedule and if we have the slightest chance of opening it we do just for her. Jenny brought us to find our little girl Akasha. One adoption event after another this gorgeous tan pup kept stealing my husbands heart. Constantly pulling at him saying take me take me. Finally, at the dog show, he fell into her plea and as always he couldn't say no. Neither could I. The moment between them has never stopped and its the best thing seeing both of them together. All because Jenny didn't give up and saved Akasha were we able to add her into our home and hearts. The work Jenny does, the time she spends, and the life she bears is remarkable. This rescue is not only the best I have ever seen, but the best I have worked with. Now, fostering Frodo and bringing him into the family life with us and getting him out of his scared shell has added to the experience of how fantastic, amazing, and exceptional Jenny and Give a Dog a Home is. Without her, the world of uncertainty for almost all the hard case pups would be unbearable. Every pup has its story, and Jenny, no matter how bad the situation, seems to make that story come alive into a fairy tale of happiness. Every dog she has saved has gone through something. Some were told to die because they were just that sick. Others were just abandoned. All were pulled from DEATHROW. And all have been given a new life and a new hope! Thank you Jenny for getting the second and third opinions, for giving second chances, and most of all for keeping this magnificent breed alive. You are the most admirable person with the most admirable rescue. Thank you!
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	180789	1	/users/profile/237488	dswhitney	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I've had the privilege of working with the rescue by pulling dogs from area shelters and providing temporary foster care until transportation can be arranged from the DFW area.  Jenny works tirelessly in the efforts of providing a 2nd chance for these wonderful animals some of whom have been injured or were sick.  She has a heart as big as Texas and works extremely hard to find forever homes for the dogs that come through her rescue.  
Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue	180787	1	/users/profile/237486	madocw	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I first came into contact with Jenny when I was looking to adopt/rescue a senior GSD.  I had a female GSD for 13 yrs. and know and understand what the seniors are all about.  After my experience with my Dutchess, and knowing how so many do not want to deal with older dogs, I decided that I wanted to help the older pupdogs in their later years.  Come to find out, Jenny did not really have the opportunity to deal with the older dogs; but, ... she did take in all the GSDs that others seemed to turn their back on.  Mattered not how dire the pupdog's situation was/is, she would take that dog and do everything in her power to make that dog "whole"    again, or as whole as the pupdog could possibly be ... then the daunting task of trying to find homes for these pupdogs. At this same time, I had recently retired and was doing volunteer rescue pupdog transports.  My first transport I committed to was taking a pupdog all the way to Utah.  A transport from TX to Utah would require a whole lot of different people pitching in, ordinarily.  Me, being the person that I am, love driving, love being on the road, thought a trip to Utah would be most awesome.  So I took probably 90% of the legs myself, accompanied by my darlin' daughter.  So after this initial transport, I starting looking to see where else I could help out.  (Aside from the GSD, I also have a love for the pit bulls and Akitas).  I ended up doing a transport for Jenny Cope and GiveaDogaHome helping get a dog from the DFW area to San Antonio.  After I researched, I found that I had already contacted her about the possibility of adopting a senior.  The hubby and I did the transport, met her at her vet's office, as she was picking up a couple of her pack that had received treatment, one of them being an amputee.  We dropped off the momma GSD and her pups and visited with her a bit, and the tripawd ... the rest is history.  This woman sacrifices her own personal life to give life to unwanted GSDs.  She had a most beautiful home (with restrictions on dogs) and chose to move to the semi-boonies and live in a "wizard-of-oz" falling down around her, type of home so that she could save more GSDs.  We ended up adopting 2 of her pupdogs to add to our pack, we go and help her with building and repairs, and patching, whatever we can help with.Jenny is amazing!!!  Her love for the GSD is not to be rivaled.

Sustainable Harvest International	316076		/users/profile/407342	catadowning	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2016	This organization is my role model for everything I am trying to do in my own Central American community.  I love what they are doing; especially having it directed by the people and outward to their communities.  Great work.
Sustainable Harvest International	316048		/users/profile/68096	Betsy	Donor	5	10/28/2016	While on a trip to Belize I was able to spend a day with SHI helping build a water reservoir for a family.  I also learned about the various other projects SHI did to help local families to farm in a sustainable way and to preserve the rain forest.   I have been proud to be an SHI supporter since that day!
Sustainable Harvest International	315686		/users/profile/406992	Francesca L.	Donor	5	10/27/2016	I love what Sustainable Harvest does to help promote sustainability by helping farmers around the world take care of the land, farm more efficiently, and reduce poverty!
Sustainable Harvest International	302235		/users/profile/393353	Steve175	Donor	5	09/01/2016	Sustainable Harvest International's programs promote sustainability and conservation on multiple levels: preservation of rain forest, enhanced productivity of crop land, enhanced nutrition and healthier families, improved food supplies for communities, and even greater financial security for families and woman-run enterprises and economic opportunity for their communities.  SHI does all this with a notably cost-effective organization; contributors get an exceptionally high return on their investment in the work of Sustainable Harvest International.  We are SHI supporters for life.
Sustainable Harvest International	260651	1	/users/profile/349231	megmelville	Donor	5	10/01/2015	This is an exceptional organization that has grown in leaps and bounds in the past 18-20  years, aiding small farmers and growers (and their families) not only with terrific changes in quality of life but also with improved farming techniques that better protect soils and surrounding forests. It sounds dramatic to say but I have been moved to tears more than once when I've heard the stories of profound change that have helped propel these villages and communities into improved living circumstances while simultaneously improving the ecology of the land, forests and streams around them.  Sustainable Harvest is efficient in their work, they aim to educate and do so with humility and awareness of the existing community  while supporting its autonomy as well. They deserve the highest marks for their diligence and vision.
Sustainable Harvest International	260271	2	/users/profile/268542	mwcopi	Donor	5	09/30/2015	This is a terrific organization making a difference at the micro level with farming families in Central America and at the macro level with the enviroment and our planet.  Farming families  are improving their lives by growing more and more varied food.  Better health and more income are the direct results.  The sustainable methods they learn result in a significant decrease  in the slashing and burning of the rain forest.   Trees are planted to provide food such as fruit, nuts, coffee, and cacoa.     
Sustainable Harvest International	206174	4	/users/profile/268542	mwcopi	Board Member	5	07/15/2014	I love this organization, having been actively involved since 2004 when I made my first trip to Honduras.  It is heartwarming to see the pride that the farmers take in the skills and techniques they have learned that enable them to produce a greater variety and more food for their families.   Selling surplus produce helps with school fees for their children and needed medical attention.   And their work helps us all as they stop slashing and burning the rain forest because they have learned how to make their land more fertile using sustainable techniques.   Planting a variety of trees that provide fruit, nuts, coffee, chocolate and wood further benefits both the families and the environment.  
Sustainable Harvest International	260266	2	/users/profile/348835	SteveATX	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	Sustainable Harvest International is our favorite non-profit; the first choice for our non-profit contributions. The work of SHI preserves our environment, alleviates poverty, supports family enterprise and helps women become self-sufficient.  SHI is efficiently managed and delivers huge benefits for every dollar it receives.
Sustainable Harvest International	260192	2	/users/profile/348751	Lisa479	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	SHI is making a difference in the lives of farmers and their families in Central America. I have had the opportunity as a volunteer to work with SHI programs in Belize and Panama, and the experience was life changing. It quickly became apparent to me that The SHI model truly works. I was so impressed with this organization that I became a committee member for several years, and am now serving my second year as a board member.
Sustainable Harvest International	260139	2	/users/profile/224125	Steve Richards	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	I have been involved with non-profit organizations for over 40 years as a staff member, board member, board chair, and as a volunteer.  I have found SHI to be a truly unique organization in a variety of very positive ways.  SHI's small staff accomplishes amazing things.It is addressing some of the most important global issues such as climate change on a local level.  By teaching farmers how to grow healthy vegetables through organic farming, SHI is is able to provide healthy food for families and to market their excess crops thereby generating some income for their families.SHI's 5 phase program usually takes about 5 to 6 years to complete.  It is a comprehensive plan that produces outstanding results. An additional benefit of SHI's program is that, by teaching farmers how to grow their crops using organic methods, they no longer engage in the traditional slash and burn techniques which have been destroying the tropical rain forests which is a leading cause of climate change.I am very proud to be associated with such a worthwhile organizations which has a record achieving outstanding results. 
Sustainable Harvest International	169106		/users/profile/224125	Steve Richards	Board Member	5	09/11/2013	Sustainable Harvest International (SHI) is an amazing organization! I have been involved as a board member and staff member of a number of NGOs working overseas.  SHI stands out as an organization that works hand in hand with local farmers and helps build the local infrastructure so that local farmers are helping train and educate other local farmers. It has a well thought out 5 phase program that results in  outstanding crop production that does not deplete the soil. It creates a real win - win situation as the local farmers no longer need to use the slash and burn technique of their forefathers, which was devastating the forests.  With sustainable agriculture, not only do the farmers have a broad variety of crops with better yields, but the forests and the many species who call the forests home, are no longer being burned.  So SHI not only helps the farmers, it also has a significant impact upon the environment by saving tens of thousands of trees each year. I had the opportunity to visit SHI programs in Panama this year and was impressed by the results being achieved.  In one small village I saw many farmers graduating from the 5 phase program. One local farmer had significantly diversified his crops, created a fish pond, created a rice paddy, installed an irrigation system.  He also installed a composting toilet and a very energy efficient stove.  All this was accomplished with the advice and support of the local SHI field trainer.  SHI has a very small staff in the US so that most of the money donated to SHI can be used to support the local organizations with which it works in four Central American countries - Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. These local organizations, with the support of SHI, hire and train the local staff who then work with the local farmers. As a donor to non-profits, I want to see my donations having a real impact.  With SHI, I am assured of my donation having an impact in supporting sustainable agriculture in Central America and saving the forests. It also has positive impact upon the environment.
Sustainable Harvest International	260136	2	/users/profile/348700	cafrench	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	I have seen the impacts of Sustainable Harvest International's work in communities in Belize and Panama. Not only do participant families learn to plant healthy foods in a sustainable manner--while preserving tropical forests--but they also feel empowered in many aspects of their lives. Women have noted that learning to cultivate food and often earn income has helped them take on new leadership roles in their community. Individuals who formerly had little access to education now have the confidence and resources to send their children off to school. And communities feel empowered to come together around any issue, challenge, or opportunity as a result of their work with Sustainable Harvest International. SHI changes peoples' lives and those changes even ripple out to impact others in the community for the better.
Sustainable Harvest International	260121	3	/users/profile/348683	mlb707	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	Sustainable Harvest International (SHI) achieves remarkable results with a lean budget. Working on the ground in Central America, SHI helps poor farmers dramatically improve their lives using organic farming techniques, agroforestry and diversification of crops. Families also plant thousands of trees to protect watersheds and curtail erosion. SHI is truly a gem!
Sustainable Harvest International	260115	3	/users/profile/348676	meganjones	Volunteer	5	09/29/2015	Sustainable Harvest International is an amazing non-profit! SHI has tremendous positive impact on the people they work with. I volunteered with SHI and saw first hand how small farmers lives were dramatically improved when they were taught susatinable alternative practices to slashing and burning the rainforest. Flo Reed, SHI's founder is making the world a better place. I greatly admire her dedication and the incredible work SHI has done!
Sustainable Harvest International	260111	3	/users/profile/223243	Gyan Kanal	Board Member	5	09/29/2015	Sustainable Harvest International invests in Latin American farming communities where both the need and the potential impact are the greatest. By supporting small scale farmers to improve productivity, restore agricultural land and forests while reducing negative environmental impact, the organization positively addresses the needs of both people and the planet. Sustainable Harvest International has developed a unique mission and programs that have a broad impact on the communities served, and are important to addressing global issues of food security and climate change. 
Sustainable Harvest International	168361	2	/users/profile/223243	Gyan Kanal	Board Member	5	09/08/2013	SHI works to promote environmental conservation and protection by addressing the needs of people who depend on the land for their livelihood. This is an essential key to long term change that respects the rights of the people and empowers them as the best possible stewards of their environment.
Sustainable Harvest International	257161	3	/users/profile/345573	orleila	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I have volunteered for Sustainable Harvest International as a translator for the past year and it has been nothing but a pleasant experience. They go out of their way to help me feel valued and appreciated and are constantly thanking me for me time and my efforts to help them out. Additionally, whenever they send me more material to translate, they are very considerate of my time and other commitments and are flexible with the time-frame in which I return the translated documents to them. Whenever they do have a more urgent assignment for me, they let me know with as much heads-up as possible and are even more grateful when I can help them in a crunch! SHI has not only been great to work with, but it also makes me feel really honored to get to work with and help out an organization that is doing such great, crucial work in the Americas. The projects SHI has implemented are key to promoting food security and more sustainable development in that part of the world and I am proud to support them!
Sustainable Harvest International	255550	4	/users/profile/266687	j3D2003	Board Member	5	09/09/2015	For years I worked in Latin America with the Peace Corps on projects to help small farming communities improve production and plant trees. This non-profit was started by a former volunteer in my program who served in Panama. She has won numerous awards and they have kept true to their mission promoting organic agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable practices for the poorest farmers.  I know in supporting this organization, I am helping people AND the environment which is not easy to do these days. They have a terrific staff and have made great strides in the past three years.  Great organization worthy of support.  But what have they done, you ask?Here are a few of the stats: Helped families plant over 3.7 million treesprovided long term  support (average 5 years) to 1,127 families to convert from slash and burn agricultureIncreased average agricultural family income by 23%Built many wood conserving stoves, water systems and latrines. 
Sustainable Harvest International	204653	2	/users/profile/266687	j3D2003	Board Member	5	06/30/2014	I was the Associate Director of the Peace Corps when SHI Founder Flo Reed was a Volunteer in Panama.  She went on to do some amazing things.  She has assembled a terrific board and staff that is dedicated to working up to five years with individual families, bringing them knowledge of how to transition from the terribly destructive 'slash and burn' farming to sustainable practices.  This is essential for the conservation of forests, wildlife and water.  It is also critical to the wellbeing of rural communities.  SHI maintains low overhead, making sure that gifts and grants result in program field results in Belize, Panama, Honduras and Nicaragua. Thanks SHI for making the world a better place for all of us. 
Sustainable Harvest International	207364	2	/users/profile/270015	Lydia22399	Volunteer	5	07/27/2014	In the 6th grade, I had the opportunity to travel to Panama through SHI with a small group of family friends and school acquaintances. Sustainable harvest changed my whole perspective on how to go into a remote community and offer recourses and knowledge in a manner that is not invasive. Ever since that experience, I can't wait to get to my fund raising goal for another trip with a group of high school friends. I can't wait to perfect my Spanish, and be able to have conversations with people I come across.  That trip made me see the true value of collaboration, and communication with people from different backgrounds and fields of knowledge.I would highly recommend an SHI service trip to everyone!

Sustainable Harvest International	205547	2	/users/profile/267734	townsendthomas	Board Member	5	07/09/2014	Sustainable Harvest is a remarkable organization at a break-out stage in its evolution.  After spending its first 12-14 years refining its mission and developing a proven process, it has been transformed into an even more effective and capable organization by creating an efficient executive team and small staff to support its dynamic founder.  The work that SHI does in Central America is fantastic and the impact on program participants is profound.  With a strong core organization and focus on good governance, SHI is well positioned to grow the impact of its outstanding program.
Sustainable Harvest International	205503	1	/users/profile/267691	AlS54	Board Member	5	07/09/2014	I have been a board member of SHI for two years and am very impressed with the knowledge, dedication and spirit of cooperation of both the board and staff.  SHI works to lift families out of poverty in four Central American countries by providing field trainers who promote sustainable farming methods instead of traditional slash and burn. Results to date have shown improved nutrition and added income which pays for school fees and other needs.  Benefits to the planet include improving the farm soil, preventing erosion, planting trees and  improving biodiversity.  During my visit to Belize  I saw the results first hand  and got to meet the dedicated and enthusiastic field trainers.  It is important to me that SHI uses residents of the country as field trainers rather than US experts.
Sustainable Harvest International	205437	1	/users/profile/149810	Carole W.	Donor	5	07/08/2014	My husband and I went to Belize a few years back and volunteered alongside the Agricultural agents who work directly with the farmers and their familys.  We met some of the most wonderful and appreciative people who benefit from all the work that SHi does with them and for them. AS a long time donor, it was great to directly meet the people who our money is going to help.  SHI knows what it is doing, and spends my money well.  They can see and measure their work to prove it works. Their goal is to continue to help more farmers and hopefully grow to help farmers in other Central American countries.
Sustainable Harvest International	168788	1	/users/profile/149810	Carole W.	Donor	5	09/10/2013	SHI has been helping farmers in Central America for over 10 years.  They have had a tremendous success rate in changing the lives of farmers and their crops and land. I traveled to Belize with them on a trip where we met the families that were working with SHI and who had experienced improvement in their annual income and changed the way they farm.  I volunteered by helping to plant trees, built a solar latrine and a stove for a Maya family that previously had no stove. This stove used only 1/3 of the wood previously used and eliminated the smoke from their home which contributed to poor health.They continue to do wonderful things in an area that needs their help and instruction.
Sustainable Harvest International	128311	1	/users/profile/149810	Carole W.	Donor	5	10/24/2012	SHI is my favorite charity. I heard about them about 10 years ago at a presentation given by Florence Reed the founder.  SHe was a Peace Core worker in Panama originally, working with farmers to better their lives and crops. Now SHI  works with farmers in 4 countries in Central America, teaching them to grow their crops in a more sustainable way, ie no more slash and burn, use natural fertilizers.  The families they work with increase their annual income significantly and they are so appreciate of the help. Also the land is being used in a sustainable way.. I have gone to Belize with them on a Smaller World trip to see  the work they do, and volunteered while there and also met many of the families that are helped by SHI.  One person's dream and efforts  can make a difference in many lives and this happened when Florence Reed started SHI.

I have personally seen the good work they are doing in Belize as I went on a trip with them to volunteer and meet the families I had helped through donations. SHI  was working with poor local farmers to change the way they grow crops, without fertilizer and no longer practicing slash and burn  methods.The families had increased  their annual income and were able to send their children to school, in addition to growing additional fruits and vegetables for their own consumption.  The trip was most rewarding, and the families were appreciative of all we did to help them.
Sustainable Harvest International	205372	1	/users/profile/267524	David238	Volunteer	5	07/08/2014	My wife and I have been on 7 trips to Central America as an "agricultural missionary" with Sustainable Harvest.  We have visited farmers in all four of the SHI countries and have always been impressed with the high quality work done by SHI local staff in each country.  Although other  residents of these very poor communities try to migrate north for a better life, we have never met a family from the SHI program who needed to leave their country to survive.  They have learned how to grow nutritious cash crops.

SHI's staff and board are passionate about the work they do and it is making a life-changing positive impact to the families they serve in Central America and to the biodiversity and health of our planet by saving our tropical forests and raising people out of poverty. I'm continuing to volunteer for and donate to SHI because of the results they produce and I see the potential and possibilities for their work model to aid other countries and people.  I hope you'll join me in supporting them.
Sustainable Harvest International	168348	1	/users/profile/132814	jsurban2002	Board Member	5	09/08/2013	I visited some of SHI's Panamanian farms this past January and what I saw and heard was beyond what I'd imagined and very inspiring.  One farmer, Demitrio Martinez, decided to farm because of bad experiences working in commercial rice fields. The first year he rented the land and started immediately with SHI-Panama.  Eventually his father bought the land for him. Because of his experience with the chemicals in the commercial rice fields, he was quite willing to work with sustainable, organic methods.  This was hard work since it meant working steep slopes with very abused soil and lots of insects and hauling buckets of water up from a small stream during the dry season.  His number one income-producing crops are greens -- which he calls mustard greens and many other kinds of vegetables as well.   He and his farm have been such a success that it is now a demonstration farm, with many other improvements including a fish pond and rice paddy. SHI's board was there to tour the farm and to attend a graduation ceremony for Demetrio and 35 other families. It was wonderful to see so many women and men with their families graduating and we had a special ceremony, lunch and musical entertainment to top it off.  It was a remarkable day and a remarkable testament to the mission of SHI - providing farming families in Central America with the training and tools to preserve our planet's tropical forests while overcoming poverty.  SHI is making our world a better place for all of us.
Sustainable Harvest International	109959		/users/profile/132814	jsurban2002	Board Member	5	04/16/2012	My name is Joy Urban and I and my husband, Steve, have been supporting SHI for 12 years.  I have been a board member for less than a year.  We support SHI because their work benefits all of us by teaching poor farmers to raise crops in sustainable ways it restore our planet's forests and lifts people out of proverty.  We have seen SHI's work grow and evolve to meet the needs of more families in Central America.  When families finish working with SHI they continue to use what they have learned and to share it with their neighbors.  The SHI model is very empowering, impactful and innovative.  We're proud of the work they do and are glad to be a part of it. 
Sustainable Harvest International	102258	1	/users/profile/132814	jsurban2002	Board Member	5	12/13/2011	My husband and I have been supporting SHI for 12 years.   The work they do is making a difference in people's lives by improving their nutrition and income and it also reverses the trend of deforestation.  We share their passion for improving our planet and people and we know our contributions to them are well spent.  
Sustainable Harvest International	205331	1	/users/profile/267475	Kriste_Ericsson	Advisor	5	07/07/2014	I have been inspired by the vision, goals and work of Sustainable Harvest International ever since hearing its founder and executive director, Florence Reed, speak at the annual National Peace Corps Association conference in 2012 in Minneapolis. That afternoon Flo was awarded the Sargent Shriver award for creating a successful paradigm that has been used repeatedly for assisting subsistence  farmers and their neighbors to improve crop yields and diversify harvests, using earth-friendly, community-friendly, and sustainable methods. At this time Sustainable Harvest is looking into extending its efforts from the countries of Belize, Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras in Central America to other continents. I am excited to have the opportunity to play some part in realizing this vision.
Sustainable Harvest International	205319	1	/users/profile/267461	SHRMDI	Board Member	5	07/07/2014	I have been involved in not for profit organizations as a staff member and board member for over 40 years.  Much of my work over the past 25 years has been in the international field, primarily in Africa, Asia, and Europe. I became aware of SHI through a contact with Flo Reed, SHI's founder.  The more I researched the work that they are doing in four Central American countries, the more convinced I became that this was an organization worth supporting with my donations.  As I became more knowledgeable about what SHI was able to accomplish, my commitment to SHI became even stronger and I agreed to serve on its board. SHI has a great leadership group in the US that works together in support of the programs in Central America.  I have visited SHI programs in Panama and Belize and will be visiting SHI programs in Honduras in February 2015. I have seen firsthand how the SHI programs are transforming farming in these communities.  It has virtually eliminated the slash and burn method of farming. It has created a far more diverse and healthier diet for the families.  The crops are rotated and are grown using organic methods. It is a real win for preserving the rain forests, a win for the families in eating a far healthier diet, and finally a win producing food that can be sold at local markets, which also helps the financial position of the families.   
Sustainable Harvest International	186137	1	/users/profile/243096	Gunnar H.	Donor	5	10/30/2013	My favorite non-profit organization! I love the concept of providing sustainable agricultural education to the people in Latin America. Having read a bit about tropical sciences including agriculture issues, I truly appreciate the mission of Sustainable Harvest International. As a donor I like how well they keep me continuously  informed with the progress they make.
Sustainable Harvest International	169321	1	/users/profile/133675	Elizabeth Agle	Board Member	5	09/12/2013	Since 2008 I have made 10 trips to visit family farms and in some cases, live in the homes with the families:  5 as a Board member visiting farms in all 4 countries and 5 as a volunteer visiting and working in farming communities around Trinidad, Honduras.  Each time I have come away deeply impressed with the dedication and sensitivity of the field trainers and the pride and motivation of the farming families.  I see the sense of empowerment as they chose to learn new more environmentally-friendly and healthy alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture and to plant a variety of vegetables that they previously had to buy -- when they had the money to do so.  The progress in the communities which I visit each year with a group from Washington DC has been astounding.  There are productive gardens near the homes; there are fields with basic crops (corn and beans), a huge variety of vegetables and herbs, and "forest gardens" where mahogany and coffee plants shade smaller crops like ginger.   I wish I could take everyone interested in SHI to meet Don Noe of La Majada.  Noe farms less than two acres, but he is so proud of the crops he is harvesting.  His land even yields coffee seedlings which he can sell for a good price to nearby large-scale coffee growers. Photos of Noe show such happy eyes and broad smile!
Sustainable Harvest International	102470	1	/users/profile/133675	Elizabeth Agle	Board Member	5	12/19/2011	My husband and I have helped lead 3 adult trips and 3 youth trips to Honduras organized by SHI.  We have seen the benefits first hand to communities and families since 2006.  As result, I am active board member and fundraiser and my husband is pursuing institutional gifts for SHI.  We recommend that friends and family donate and come on trips as well.  We encourage your support as well.
Sustainable Harvest International	169295	1	/users/profile/224372	Charlotte Dougherty	Board Member	5	09/12/2013	I have spent most of my professional life working on social change from the top down, assisting government agencies in creating programs and policies that promote environmental protection, conservation, and sustainable development. I have often been frustrated by political roadblocks, problems with implementation, or limited results on the ground. I am coming to realize that real social change happens from the bottom up in individuals, families and communities. This is how lives are transformed and positive impacts are sustained. This is what Sustainable Harvest International (SHI) is doing in Central America. While in Piedras Negras, Honduras as an SHI volunteer, I witnessed the commitment that families make to alleviate their hunger  from the backbreaking tilling of small hillside plots of parched land, to hauling water, bottle-by-bottle from a distant stream to water tender seedlings. I experienced how community members supported and trained one another  sharing limited resources and tools, working together to build chicken coops and wood-conserving stoves for other families, and looking after each others children. I saw adults in the community care for the land - nourishing it for future generations and devoting themselves to teaching children sustainable farming methods.  I have returned to Piedras Negras with SHI several times since my first visit, and I am astounded at the palpable changes resulting from SHIs work. I no longer see malnourished children. Miquel and Candia, (my hosts) are now happy and healthy  laughing and playing with their children and proud of their accomplishments. The plantains that I helped Evan and his family plant two years ago are not only a staple of the families improved diet, but are also a commercial crop providing needed income for the childrens school fees. Sustainable Harvest International does an amazing job of motivating social change from the bottom up. The organization works in rural farming communities in Belise, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, providing seeds, training and support to families desparate to grow food and sustain themselves and their land. SHI is truly changing lives and the productivity of land that those lives depend on.
Sustainable Harvest International	168691		/users/profile/211947	Laurel7	Donor	5	09/09/2013	Great non-profit doing wonderful work to help people feed themselves and improve their lives with minimal impacts to their environment.
Sustainable Harvest International	168334	1	/users/profile/223221	Ivor	Donor	5	09/08/2013	SHI has continued to use local personnel to educate the poorest farmers to be more self sufficient and avoid harmful chemicals and activities.  It is a system to help the soil regenerate and for their family to eat better. It is a great organization with constant reviews of its processes and results.
Sustainable Harvest International	168197	1	/users/profile/223088	amatthews	Donor	5	09/07/2013	SHI was established by former Peace Corp Volunteer Florence Reed in 1997 to serve farmers in four countries of Central America in learning sustainable farming techniques and has become so much more than that.  Grown from Flo's deeply held values SHI allows poor farmers to take responsibility for reversing environmental degradation and achieving economic viability within their own countries. The most amazing thing is that after 16 years this organization is thriving with 60 percent of its support coming from individuals who believe in the mission and want to ensure its capacity to work with farmers and communities.  More amazing is that this tiny organization returns 83 percent of its $1.6 million budget to programs that serve 4 affiliate offices in 4 countries and thousands of men, women, and children.  I love this organization and it's no wonder that Ms. Reed has been named to the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellows Program and received the 2012 Sargent Shriver Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service from the National Peace Corps Association (NPCA).
Sustainable Harvest International	127662	1	/users/profile/172749	Tucker H.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2012	My church has worked with SHI for several years, supporting them financially, sending youth groups to work every other summer and adult groups as interest allows. My own experience on an adult trip of women working with women in two communities was so satisfying.  I saw the dollars I had given being used to change people's lives in positive ongoing ways. Participants' gardens were proof that they were improving the soil and producing good food for their families - no more need to slash and burn! The other thing that impressed me is how much SHI commits in-country developing and using local personnel to support their mission.  This is a lean and lovely organization - one that I am happy to support with my money and time.  Tucker H.
Sustainable Harvest International	110488	1	/users/profile/150416	Joan D.	Volunteer	5	04/22/2012	my grandson and i volunteered with SHI last summer in the jungles outside Punta Gorda, Belize.  It was an incredible experience for both of us.  SHI had the supplies needed tht couldn't be found at the family home; they educated and guided the families; their intent was to help the families maximize the use of their lands without contaminating the land or water available to them.  They presented everything in a simple easy to understand manner for both the families and the volunteers.  this was the best experience i could give to my grandson about giving back to the community, the global community.
Sustainable Harvest International	110014	1	/users/profile/149842	RUTH TUCKER AYERS HARRIS	Donor	5	04/17/2012	After working in a farming community for a week in Honduras, I came home committed to supporting the work of SHI.  they support in-country staff to help individuals become self-sustaining farmers and entrepreneurs using moderately priced, low-tech and locally available resources.  As a result, I saw first-hand how lives were improved by the work that SHI does, family by family.
Sustainable Harvest International	110001	1	/users/profile/149825	Kimberly13	Donor	5	04/17/2012	My family and I have been donating to SHI for the past 7 years, since our son was born. We wanted to do something to celebrate his birth so we decided to plant a tree in his honor. We planted one in our yard and donated to SHI so that many more trees could be planted in the rain forest. The more we read about the good work SHI was doing, the more we wanted to donate. Now we give gifts of hope to our family and friends to celebrate their special occassions. SHI's ability to combine short-term relief for people in poverty with long term, sustainable changes is very important to us.

I enjoy supporting an organization where I know the bulk of the money given will go directly to work for the folks 'in need.'  I am proud to have been part of helping to change for the better so many folks lives and also to be working to sustain our planet.  In addition. I greatly value the fact that SHI organizational structure is 'sustainable' with the local organizations are establish and run by local people.  This is truly a sustainable model. - for business and for human beings!

Sustainable Harvest International	109955	2	/users/profile/149765	tjgibson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/16/2012	My name is Terry Gibson. I have been translating quarterly reports from Spanish into English for SHI for about two years now.  I discovered SHI on-line while researching for my MBA of Sustainable Business at Marylhurst University in Portland Oregon. The reports that I have received to translate from communities in Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras have given me a valuable look at the wonderful work SHI is doing in remote locations that have very few options, if any, to earn money to send their children to school, start home-based businesses, and restore the environment using sustainable agricultural practices. The success stories and testimonials that I have translated not only inform me about how critical the SHI mission is to those most in need, but in a model that does not patronize or lock them into destructive globalization strategies.  SHI truly helps these communities, sometimes one family at a time, but more often raising the hopes and living standards of entire communities in sustainable ways.  SHI gives a hand up, not a hand out.  I know of no other organization working in Central America with their track record of success at practical sustainable agriculture. 
Sustainable Harvest International	109954	2	/users/profile/149763	mdlori	Volunteer	4	04/16/2012	My daughter and I traveled to the Toledo district of southern Belize last December. We learned of the efforts of SHI through the Cotton Tree Lodge where we stayed. They helped us set up a day of volunteering with Herminio Cho and another SHI worker at a Mayan home in Santa Teresa village. We helped the Max family  with a vegetable  garden on their  property, discussed the importance of keeping a compost pile to add nutrients back to the soil, and enjoyed a wonderful, simple meal together. Sustainable Harvest is making a lasting impact in the lives of native Mayans of Belize and eco-tourists who visit the area and want to help out.
Sustainable Harvest International	109952	2	/users/profile/149761	LaMT	Donor	5	04/16/2012	It's so hard today to know where to direct your charity dollars to. I used to give to a large charity that builds houses. I've was looking for a way to celebrate a friends 50th birthday and stumbled across this charity. I was so impressed with their work, I have now switched over my charity donations. Their name says it all: Substainable and Harvest. They work directly with people to change their lives in a way values the environment in an area crucial to our ecosystem. Letting them earn enough money to build their own houses and build a foundation for their children's education and future.  Keep up the great work!
Sustainable Harvest International	109947	2	/users/profile/149752	Dale3	Donor	5	04/16/2012	I have been aware of the work Sustainable Harvest has done for years.  The tremendous beneficial change they make in people's lives and livelihood is nothing short of phenomenal.  Especially when one considers the amazing things done with the resources they have.  Their heart and soul is based in the purest of intentions for helping others.  Kudos to SHI and all the tremendous workers on their staff.  
Sustainable Harvest International	109945	1	/users/profile/149751	Feather	Donor	5	04/16/2012	I love supporting Sustainable Harvest International because so much is accomplished with seemingly little funds. Participants learn that growing food sustainably is great for their family's health and also profitable! Many trees have been planted to reforest land that was cleared, leading to improved water quality and reduced erosion. The amazing improvement in the quality of life for participants causes others to want to work with SHI as well, leading to community-wide impacts. I do hope to travel with SHI someday.
Sustainable Harvest International	103869		/users/profile/139060	stukaye	Volunteer	5	01/19/2012	I had a chance to volunteer with SHI in Belize toward the end of 2011.  My esperience was an excellent one, and the projects I worked on were planting pineapples and various types of trees, and helping to build wood conserving stoves.  The people from SHI were very pleasant to work with.  
Sustainable Harvest International	102832	1	/users/profile/136011	Crystal6	Volunteer	5	01/03/2012	I had the opportunity to travel to Panama and volunteer with SHI in 2011. It was a wonderful experience and I was able to see firsthand how this organization has had an extremely positive impact on the participants in their programs. Many of those in the village in which I volunteered couldn't stop talking about how their lives had changed after participating in programs led by the local field staff. I have found that SHI combines two areas of importance to me: preservation of the environment and empowering people to overcome poverty. I will continue to donate to SHI and hope to participate in a Smaller World Tour again in the future.
Sustainable Harvest International	102601	1	/users/profile/134365	Sheldon Snodgrass	Donor	5	12/23/2011	I always balance my business instinct for due diligence, with my intuition.  Call it a decision making marriage between my brain and my gut. Metrics matter, but Karma is king.  And SHI plants Karmic seeds aplenty, while also ensuring they grow. When my daughter and I started our research to identify the best possible charity to support for the service component of her Bat Mitzvah project, Sustainable Harvest International wasnt even on our radar.  There are simply so many other well known causes competing for attention that we almost missed the gem that is SHI.  Thank goodness we didnt. We had set a high bar.  We wanted a cause that simultaneously attended to rain forest preservation and economic empowerment for the rural poor. My daughter was equally passionate about saving the planet and directly improving peoples lives.   Moreover, we wanted assurance that our efforts would strongly impact those in need, and we wanted to feel a connection to the organization and the people who run it.  We had questions, and requests, and tight deadlines.  The efficient, warm and responsive staff at SHI gave us concierge level attention, but with the twinkle you get from people who are motivated by mission instead of money. They were fast, thorough and endearing. Give to SHI and know that your money will go far to help people (and plants) a world away, and your generosity will touch their servants right here in the USA. J.

Sustainable Harvest International	102599	2	/users/profile/134361	juliasnodgrass	Donor	5	12/23/2011	I chose to support SHI because through their work, they captured the essence of what I believed was most important: A balance between preserving nature while creating better futures for the rural poor in Central America. They do incredible work and put such tremendous effort into the projects they start. I did a short presentation/house party a few months ago in which I showed the "Planting Hope" video, talked about SHI, and answered some questons. SHI made it easy for me to do this by sending me the video, and supplying me with brochures, envelopes, catalogs, etc. They even sent me a t-shirt and chocolate bar! Through this entire process, SHI has been incredibly helpful and supportive. I highly recommend this unique charity if you would like to help the earth and people at the same time. SHI is an outstanding organization that most definitely deserves our support.
Sustainable Harvest International	102560		/users/profile/134136	sk789	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/21/2011	In full disclosure, I am a member of Sustainable Harvest International's small staff in the US. I have had the great pleasure of being a part of SHI's work over the years and can tell you with confidence that as a staff we are dedicated, enthusiastic and passionate about the programs we carry out in the field.  We pride ourselves on organizational efficiency and work hard to ensure that funds are put to work contributing to valuable community projects ending poverty and deforestation in rural Central America.  SHI's local staff in Central America are experts in sustainable farming practices and give families the tools, training and support to improve their quality of living while restoring the environment.  The organization's grass-roots approach is reversing cycles of poverty and slash and burn farming while empowering families to grow healthy food and strengthen communities.  This is an organization I am proud to work for, work I am proud to do and I am especially grateful to all the generous volunteers and donors who make our programs possible.  
Sustainable Harvest International	102326		/users/profile/133159	zehner84	Volunteer	5	12/15/2011	While completing my thesis work in International Development I had the privilege to work with the Sustainable Harvest Honduras program for 6 months from 2010 to 2011.   I worked both in the field visiting SHI participant families as well as in the office with local and international staff where I focused on monitoring and evaluation of SHI program effectiveness and impact.  I was continually impressed by the personal and life changing stories I heard from farmers and their families throughout my time there.   After working in development in West Africa, where I witnessed a great deal of failed projects and misguided development programs, my time evaluating the impact of SHI programs renewed my faith in the overall impact that small scale development programs can have on the lives of many.  
Sustainable Harvest International	102252		/users/profile/132789	chillery1974	Donor	5	12/13/2011	I have been a supporter of SHI for around 6 years. I find that they fulfill my liking to donate to environmental causes, but they also fulfill the humanist charitable donation also. They have recieved a score of 4 in the Charity Navigator for years, so I know that my money goes where it is needed. I get just enough updates over email (never so much, never too little to be forgotten), which always put a smile on my face. By supporting SHI I feel I am doing a really GOOD THING!

SHI's deep commitment to restore forest while assisting farming families overcome poverty is most impressive and appreciated when interacting with the people in the field. The innovation of the field staff who work diligently working with makes a significance for every family either through family gardens, wood efficient stove, agro-forestry, composting or providing training to a local group of farmers and women. The three month experience helped me learn new skills, grow personally and professionally. SHI influenced my career and now I am studying for a M.Sc. in  Sustainable Agriculture. I encourage more people to take the time to visit SHI's website: http://www.sustainableharvest.org/, participate or support them in any way possible.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/09/2011	I had the privilege of working alongside the staff and board of the Panama program for more than a year and I observed and experienced an extremely high level of devotion to advancing sustainable organic farming practices and replenishing rainforests, while equipping poor rural farming families to change their own lives.  I was continually blown away by their ability to accomplish so much for so many with so little. Donors can expect their gifts to be used to change lives and improve the environment. If you dont believe me, just make a gift and SHI will invite you to go to Panama or to one of the other countries served where you will see your gift in action.

She said that after just a few years working hard with SHI, however, she now feels that she is an importan person for her family, her community and our planet as a whole.
Sustainable Harvest International	64437		/users/profile/70454	stede	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	This charity is based on the premise that agriculture and particularly subsistance agriculture can be sustainable unlike the traditional slash and burn agriculture of the rain forest. Florence and her crew train farmers in subsistance agriculture and then have agents in place to help as they learn and apply the subsistance principles. This group supplies farmers with the seeds and techniques they need for a completely sustainable farm for individual subsistance as well as cash crops like cacao. A great way to invest your money in third world economic development
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	145142		/users/profile/79388	NeedsMoreRitalin	Client Served	5	11/30/2012	I cannot say enough about this group of dedicated volunteers who are just so passionate about caring for the wildlife that surrounds us.  I've brought a few animals to them and I really like that they will care for and release these animals even if they are prey for other animals in their care.  For instance if you found an injured mouse they'd help it and release it and not just feed it to a Hawk or Owl in their care.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	72622		/users/profile/79388	NeedsMoreRitalin	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	I have brought a few animals to the center for rehabilitation and I have also called them and asked for advice when I have seen an animal that I believed needed help.  They are always quick to respond and very helpful. The thing I like best is that if I bring in a prey creature, like a mouse, they won't feed it to an owl at the center.  They will rehabilitate it and release it.  It might eventually be taken by a predator in the wild, but the animal is assisted and released despite being so common and so low on the food chain.

We look forward to working with the Center for years to come.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67388		/users/profile/73657	lamb.sh	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/12/2011	As a progressive educator, it can be difficult to find like minded and like practiced teachers out there.  In their educational programs, The Center for Wildlife does not try to tell students what to think nor give them answers.  Instead, they provide real, hands-on experiences for students with the animals that allows the students to think and construct their own understanding.  With the bat program, for example, this knowledge can also be followed by action on the teacher and students part.  It is exciting to know that the Center for Wildlife is doing such an educational service for the community.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	80529		/users/profile/87899	Jeep	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	The Center for Wildlife (CFW) provides a unique, priceless service to the inhabitants of Maine and coastal New Hampshire.  Care for the animals is not limited to direct interaction with injured wildlife.  Rather, CFW helps to prevent the injuries in the first place through programs and events aimed at increasing public awareness and stewardship.  I have volunteered at open house events for several years.  Each year, CFW and their partners have evolved, learning from the past failures and successes, embracing this knowledge to better hone their services.  Should the Center ever fail to exist, it would leave a void in these communities, a void that would impact young and old, as well as the wildlife.

The internship ended in September and I've been a volunteer since. It is absolutely amazing the work and care that goes into helping each and every animal that passes through the door which is well above the thousands by now. Most importantly, all wild animals are treated as such to give them the best possible chance of remaining wild. There have been many times in the 8 months I've been there that someone will bring us an injured animal and tell us it has been very good and still and sat in their lap and let them pet it the whole way there. Such a circumstance can be very frustrating for a rehabber to hear considering that WILD animals do not let people "pet" them and they are just too terrified or injured to attempt to defend themselves, after all they see humans as a predator. For example, a cottontail had arrived with a mom in a minivan with her children once. Cottontails are high stress animals as it is and you can imagine how terrified the animal must have been with all the noise and the young children touching him. Sadly the rabbit died within minutes of arrival, most likely from the stress. Rather than getting upset or assigning blame in situations like these, the staff members are exceptionally patient and courteous with the public and take the time to explain to them what to do differently should a similar situation arise again. They are professional and excellent at what they do. Providing examinations, food, clean cages and medicine and as stress-free an environment as possible to the animals while receiving no state/federal funding. I am proud to volunteer there and I love doing it. You never know what you'll be asked to do, feed baby birds, clean a cage, weigh an animal, make platters, etc... There is always so much to be done! It's all worth it when you see the animal get to go back to it's natural home. Last summer we released four broad winged hawks atop Mount A and it was truly an indescribable feeling to watch the birds we received as fledglings take majestic laps around the mountain, finally well and free. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	79338		/users/profile/86648	FrankD	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I've led vernal pool walks and helped with the CFW's open house events.  They perform a marvelous service for both the injured wildlife they rehabiliate and the community in terms of their environmental education programs.  The looks of wonder and excitement on the faces of small children and their parents when on a CFW "Owl Prowl" or amphibian "Big Night" give a sense of how crucial the CFW's mission is, and what an impact it has in raising awareness about nature and the mounting threats to the environment.  The CFW is the last resort for thousands of injured wildlife in this large region; they offer a "second lease on life" for many animals, including many endangered species in southern Maine.   They are a very committed & talented staff, working all hours, and with a small budget,  doing crucial work that balances animal and human needs.  In that sense I think they are a model organization, well worth your support. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	78726		/users/profile/86012	bdacko	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	I first learned of the CFW from Facebook. I follow their link all the time.  What an incredible organization.  I have learned so much from following their posts.  I have had to email and call them on a couple of occasions and both times they were just fantastic in being a resource and tool to help me do the right thing. Their immediate repsonse to my email the first time truly astounded me....I did not expect anyone to get back to me for quite some time....but I think it was within 30-60 minutes they emailed back.  I couldnt believe it.  I live in a very rural setting, and I can tell you that knowing who they are are, and what they do with a lot of wildlife around me.  Thye truly make me feel that I am not alone if I find an injured bird or animal if I am at odds as to what to do.  Expert advice is only a click or call away.   
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	78532		/users/profile/85812	hanna frank	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	The Center for Wildlife is a unique and wonderful place in the state of Maine. Fifteen years ago I found some baby squirrels in my yard. The mother was dead. What to do? I found out about the Center and quickly brought the squirrels there. They were nurtured until they were old enough to be released. The expert care and genuine compassion for all animals that come through there is remarkable. They treat a field mouse with as much care as they do an eagle. The center has provided educational programs. They bring bats and snakes, owls and turtles. This service helps educate young children the importance of bats.  I have been volunteering there since I discovered them so long ago. The quality of my life has improved because of my association with them.  I have an increased awareness of wildlife and feel secure knowing that there is a place to take our injured animals in the area. Please consider The Center for Wildlife. Thank you, Hanna Frank
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	78517	1	/users/profile/85797	erika	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	  The center is amazing, all the staff and volunteers are so dedicated and willing to help new volunteers learn.  The lengths they all go to treat and rescue every single little animal that comes to the center is incredible.  Its so nice to have a place to bring injured or abandoned animals that not many people would consider worth saving. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	78513		/users/profile/85793	kittywo9	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	I have needed to bring several animals to this rescue site.  Animals I had no knowledge how to help myself. I am so grateful for their exceptional help , caring and expertise. Thank you for being there
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	78158		/users/profile/85427	Michelle	Client Served	5	02/26/2011	As my husband and I were driving through our neighborhood one Sunday afternoon last May, we had to stop to allow a little baby groundhog struggling to cross the road safely. We knew this wasn't normal. Our families of groundhogs have lived in our yard ever since we moved in years ago. We knew that the mama would never allow her babies to wander away.  Never.  In fact, she nurtures them pretty much all through the summer until they are grown and can live on their own.We knew this little baby had lost its mom. We went home to get a box and drove back to where the little groundhog was sitting in a neighbors yard.  A man who lives in the house came out and said that the baby had been around for 2-3 days. So my husband and I placed him in the box and took him to our house. We placed clover and grass inside the box, as well as some cloths. We wondered if our mama groundhog would take care of the little orphan. However, information that we found on the internet said that a mother groundhog would not welcome an outsider.I had no idea what to do.  As my husband continued to research the web for information, he suggested that I call The Center for Wildlife in Cape Neddick - approximately 40 miles away. At least they might be able to give me some advice.  Well, they gave more than advice. They asked if we would be willing to drive him to the Center where one of their staff members would be delighted to take him in. (They told me that groundhogs were her favorite!) We of course agreed.When we arrived, the staff quickly took the baby groundhog and the box to a back room where they had prepared a pen for him. They gave us an "admission ticket" with a number to reference should we want to call and check in on him.I did call to follow up and spoke with the woman who was caring for him.  She said that another baby groundhog was brought to the Center, which was good for both of them.  She adores groundhogs and took extra special care of them.  I continued to email her throughout the next few weeks and she always replied with a detailed account of how the groundhogs were doing  which was amazingly well!  She cared for them until they were grown and ready to be released.  My husband and I are grateful to have such a wonderful place nearby.  I let others know about the Center for Wildlife whenever I have the opportunity. They forever have my support!
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	74374		/users/profile/81260	Kathryn	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	I read about the work of CFW in the news and am so happy that this organization exists to help animals throughout this area and the wider region.  I am happy to see that CFW is getting more serious about fund raising and getting attention outside of the local area.  The website has greatly improved too.  All the best!
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	74357		/users/profile/81242	Nancy	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	Two years ago I brought a wounded chickadee to the Wildlife Center in Cape Neddick Maine.  I was very impressed with their knowledge, kindness and expressions of gratitude for bringing the bird to them.  Since then I have been to several of the Center's Open Houses and have learned much.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	73808		/users/profile/80643	Miranda K.	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I volunteered at the Center for Wildlife for two years. I had a zoology degree and working there gave me invaluable experience which helped me later find a career in wildlife rehabilitation. During my time there, I began to see how critical it is to have this rehabilitation center up and running. It is the only major wildlife center in Southern Maine. They provide so much time and effort for mammals, birds, and reptiles. The staff goes above and beyond for every injured animal. They make do with what they have and they do a fantastic job with it. But it would be so nice for them to have the funds for new caging, a better facility, or better equipment to help the wildlife of Maine. They help so many animals, and I can remember countless times having to come up with caging ideas on the spot to accommodate every animal! I would love to see this facility expand with the proper funding, they provide amazing rehabilitation for wildlife and wonderful education for the public. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	73379		/users/profile/80196	Jambo	Donor	5	02/22/2011	The CFW is an irreplacable haven the rehabillitation and caring of animals on the S Seacoast.  there is no other place anywhere near Portsmouth, hampton, York Kittery or Kennebunk where one can take injured aninals.  They do a superb job and deserve all the funding they can get, as the animals need theis place desperatelt due to human encroachment and expansion. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	73027		/users/profile/79828	Deb G	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I have taken several birds over the years to the Center For WIldlife and it's such a good feeling knowing that these injured birds and other animals have at least a fighting chance at being rehabbed. If by chance they cannot be saved, they will at least die humanely. Most of the birds I have found have been injured by human contact, albeit unintended, such as the beautiful hawk I found that had been struck by a car. I was able to transport the hawk in an open box--it never struggled or attempted to escape. It was incredible to see such a bird up close.Thank you Center For Wildlife for being there for the many unfortunat wild creatures that need your help!
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	72772		/users/profile/79545	jesari	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	CFW saves wildlife with a caring and dedicated staff of mostly volunteers. With no federal or state funding, they are able to care for and rehabilitate wildlife brought to them from throughout the region. Those they are not able to release back to the wild are used for education programs in schools and for the general public. My non-profit environmental group has volunteered for 3-4 years at their facility helping in spring clean-up activities. After completing our work, the staff has given us a short tour of the facility, introducing us to the permanent bird residents and showing us their rehabilitation area. We have seen the staff in action caring for newborn baby birds, squirrels and other wildlife. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	72582		/users/profile/79349	Megan G.	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	The Center for Wildlife is an excellent facility, and the only one like it in the area.  I brought a wild animal  to them once, and another time someone came to my house on short notice to get an animal that needed their help.  The first time I used their service I searched online, and found that most other places like the CFW only accept certain animals.  Their ability to accommodate several different types of animals, and their goal to release the animals back into the wild where they belong make this an invaluable asset to York County.  Without CFW there would be many animals suffering and unqualified people attempting to care for them.  It is so important that CFW keep running, and that people in the area donate to support them.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	72578		/users/profile/79345	eggy	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	CFW is performing an invaluable service for the birds and animals of ME with no government funding.  For this I will do anything I can for them.  they accept volunteer time and donations of bags of acorns to paper towels plus the money recieved is so well used I only wish I could do more.  Hardly a soring goes by that I don't take them a baby bird and I am so grateful they are there.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	71053		/users/profile/77677	Kim B.	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	I became aware of CFW two or three years ago.  My sister-in-law began volunteering there, and then continued as an intern. Her love for the animals she cares for is apparent to anyone who knows her, and she keeps family and friends informed about the work CFW does from her Facebook profile. As she learns about Maine's wild creatures, she in turn teaches us about them when she posts photos of the animals, birds & reptiles in her care. She comments about them & updates us on their progress as they are rehabilitated. She spreads the word about the work CFW does to everyone she meets. She is a wonderful ambassador for a wonderful organization that is very much needed. CFW works to educate the public with their educational programs. Like most of my neighbors living in a rural area, I've had many instances when I've encountered an animal needing help, but the game warden refused to have anything to do with it. Other animal welfare groups restrict their care to domestic animals. There was never anywhere to turn. Now that I know about CFW I feel confident that I can get help for an injured animal.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	70155		/users/profile/76674	Fred G.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	CFW is a truly remarkable organization.  With no federal or state funding, they are able to provide excellent medical care to a wild animal population that would otherwise go by the wayside.  Thousands of birds, small mammals, and reptiles benefit from their care each year and the CFW asks for very little in return for their efforts. They are largely volunteer-powered and paid staff are by no means getting rich!  There is an overall atmosphere of a true passion for the mission there that is infectious and leads to people falling in love with the Center over and over. Furthermore, they leverage their animal care to provide educational opportunities to the community - whether it is a program in schools or libraries, or simply to educate a member of the public who comes in to drop off an animal - they are helping humans and wildlife coexist more peacefully in Southern Maine.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	70038		/users/profile/76550	Heather H.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	I have been involved with The Center for Wildlife for over 15 years.  In that time, the organization has gone from a small wildlife rehabilitation center operating out of a trailer with no running hot water, to a facility with. among other things, an indoor treatment center, an outdoor enclosure for eagles, and an impressive educational building.  But one thing has remained consistent: the dedication, hard work, love, and complete commitment of the staff, volunteers, and Board to caring for injured and orphaned wild animals, always with the goal of returning them to the wild and their native habitat. As someone who has volunteered at CFW for many years, served on the Board, and brought in my share of injured animals to receive care, I have enough stories to fill many pages.  All of them are about wild animals in desperate need of help, and the Center being there to provide it.  It is the only facility in the area to do this work, and without it, far too many animals would die.  They would never get that second chance the Center gives them. So thank you, everyone at CFW, for all that you do.  I hope you realize how very much you and your work are appreciated!
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	69959		/users/profile/76465	Jeff	Client Served	5	02/17/2011	The CFW provides a learning experience like no other.  Every trip to the Center produces a personal connection with the animals which nurtures curiosity, understanding, and compassion for the wild around us.  Every visit leaves me in awe of the natural world and inspired to help protect it better.  The CFW is an incredible place staffed by great people doing amazing things for all who share this planet.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	68583		/users/profile/74926	Susan  Anderson	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	I volunteered over 1 1/2 years at the York Center for Wild LIfe.  It was an amazing experience - to be so close to wild life, helping to feed, clean enclosures and be with an incredibly caring, dedicated staff.  It's pretty tough during those long winter months in Maine, and they never miss a day - the animals need them and that's that.  While always remembering that the animals are wild and being aided to go back to the wild, I made close acquaintanceships with porcupines, opossum, beautiful falcons, hawks and owls as well as innumerable birds, squirrels and ducks.  I also got to see an albatross who had gotten blown inland during a storm.  They never turn down a wounded animal and survive mainly on donations, which makes what they do even more admirable and amazing.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	68231		/users/profile/74553	TLives2love	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	I used to volunteer at the Center For Wildlife when I was 16 years old. I would do whatever it is that they needed done. Cleaning cages, laundry, changing water, making food platters or feeding the birds or squirrels. I no longer volunteer there, but my mother, Anita, is part of the staff. She takes care of a lot of their paper work involving animal admissions and donations.The Center for Wildlife is an amazing non-profit organization that deserves more recognition and funding. The amount of effort the hard working employees and volunteers put into keeping the organization going is mind boggling. The biggest thing that I think the general public doesn't understand is just how much more to it there is than just making sure the animals are taken care of. The to-do list goes on and on! They also do educational shows for kids. The children get to see at least one animal, be involved with activities and conversations and they get to learn about why it is so important to have these animals around. The educational shows is a wonderful program. It has been my pleasure to keep in contact with the CFW and occasionally help out at big events. They are a wonderful group of energetic people that are making a difference in the world of wild animals. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67925		/users/profile/61576	Tia S	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/14/2011	There is a very special place here in Southern Maine, the Center for Wildlife. With a humble existence, they take in and treat hundreds of animals that literally have no where else to go, as no other rehabilitation facility exists for our special wildlife. And somehow, as our local human population has expanded, so has the Center's work. There is a small committed team who run this place, but they also rely greatly on rotating volunteers. As the Internship Director and adjunct faculty for a local university, I have sent many students to the Center to complete their internship, and every one of them has had an extraordinary experience. Not only does the Center help imperiled wildlife, they serve the educational community, and the public at large. They teach interns and volunteers who then become wildlife stewards and educators themselves. Further, the Center for Wildlife reaches into the community to teach. Many times they have come to my environmental studies classrooms as guest speakers, and have provided thoughtful, and thought provoking lessons on co-existing with wildlife. I have come to rely on the Center for Wildlife, they are a unique place for the rehabilitation of diverse animals from owls and hawks to snakes and turtles, and a center for the education of our academic and at-large community. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67811		/users/profile/74119	bluefootedbooby	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I was an intern at CFW a few summers ago, and one day I was sitting at the desk when a large, gruff, mechanic-type looking man came in.  In his hands was a small washcloth, which he held out to me.  Inside, was a nearly newborn mouse.  Apparently the mice had nested inside his lawnmower, and he "didn't want to talk about" the rest of the story.  He was close to tears.  I think that moment really exemplified the importance of CFW to me.  People want to be able to  help wildlife and rarely have the means to do so.  It's important for people to give back to wildlife, and it helps raise awareness, especially with regards to suffering turtle populations in the area.  Everyone who works there is worth their weight in gold. I mean that, truly.  It was a wonderful experience, they treat their interns and volunteers like family, and their role in the community is so important.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67793		/users/profile/74101	jpaiger	Client Served	5	02/14/2011	We work with the Center For Wildlife year round. They bring their rehabilitated wildlife to our site to provide education programs. The programs are wonderfully popular with the live animals and then visitors are able to explore those animals habitats on our trail system. We are beginning a new K-2 program this week in collaboration with CFW that does just that: view the live animals, then explore their habitats. Our partnership with Center for Wildlife had added another dimension to our programs.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67566		/users/profile/73848	phatcaz	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	My mom takes daily walks in the field and woods behind her house. This field and wood surround a natural pond where there are many year-round wildlife residents. Canada geese are an almost permanent fixture there, whether overwintering or stopping by on their migration. One fall day, looking out toward the field getting ready for her daily walk, my mother noticed a Canada goose that had stayed in the same spot all morning while the others had not. She went to investigate. It turns out the goose had walked right into a rusty old metal foot trap that the farmer of that field must have left there for a fox or groundhog, but sure enough it had trapped this goose instead. My mom ran back to get a large basket, a towel, and something to pry the old rusty trap open. After successfully freeing the goose she waited for him to fly away. He didn't. He just sat down and hissed and hissed at her (his only defense). She bravely loaded him into the basket (he put up a very feeble fight) and decided to have him spend the night in the basket sheltered in the garage with food and water and if he hadn't regained his strength by morning, she knew just where to take him, the Center for Wildlife. Well, the next morning, the goose still would not stand up. So she called CFW and let them know what happened and they told her to bring the goose right in. The goose had some superficial wounds, was dehydrated and weak. Who knows how long he was stuck in that trap before my mother noticed him and took action. The staff at CFW cleaned and looked after his wounds, and monitored him for a few days while he hydrated and regained his strength.  My mom called to check his status after a few days and the wonderful caring staff at CFW let her know that physically he was healed, but he was showing signs of depression. See, the staff educated us that geese mate for life, and mated pairs raise and protect their young together. They are very social creatures and family-oriented and they show signs of depression when they are all alone. They asked us if there was still a flock of Canada geese in the field or if they had already moved on without our little injured guy. We confirmed that they were still there. So, the staff allowed us to come pick the now healed Canada goose up, bring him back to the field and release him next to that flock, in hopes that he would be accepted. They were on the fence with releasing him back to where he was first endangered by the farmer's foot trap but the benefits of being with his flock again outweighed the chance that he would stumble into another trap. We got the large animal crate as close to the flock as we could without scaring them off and opened the door to the crate. The goose hesitated, then took a few steps out and off he flew toward the flock. There was much raucous honking as he flew over the flock.  Suddenly 3 other geese took flight and joined him and they flew over the treeline together. I like to think that it was his family waiting for him to come back before continuing on their migration. The care and education the CFW staff provided regarding this Canada goose, not only helped to him heal but made that homecoming and family reunion possible. They are amazing.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67408		/users/profile/73678	beavermommy	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	I have attended CFW's presentations featuring their non-releasable wild animals.  I also follow their facebook page. CFW consistently presents pictures, stories, and most impotantly, education regarding wild animals of the New England area. Their staff is so knowledgable and the compassion they have for the critters is palpable right from the FB page! I carry gloves, blanket and supplies in my car in the case of wild animal emergency. I know that if I call CFW, they will assist me in the animal's rescue.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67357		/users/profile/73621	AMR11	Client Served	5	02/12/2011	I brought CFW three baby squirrels whose mother had been killed. They took them in and one of their wonderful volunteers cared for them. CFW is such a wonderful organization. They are truly concerned about the wellbeing of the animals and most importantly provide all the care and attention they need in order to be returned to the wild where they belong. They also share their knowledge with the public with open houses, animal ambassadors and through the web (website, Facebook, etc). They are always trying to engage the community in activities and fundraisers to help them continue their mission of providing a safe, nurturing environment for the thousands of birds, animals and reptiles that need their assistance.  Keep up the great work!

As a volunteer I have learned so much that I can pass on to others to increase awareness of our native animals, and the difficulties they face in their world.  As a preschool teacher I feel that I am educating the future stewards of the earth to be more aware of the effects of our actions on wildlife and the environment.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	67249		/users/profile/73503	jtisme1958	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	The CFW really lives up to it's Mission Statement: "...to rescue, rehabilitate and release sick and injured wild animals, and educate the public about wildlife and the habitats they need to survive". I have seen the passion that the staff and volunteers put into their work - they are truly dedicated to helping wildlife return to thier natural habitat after illness or injury. I am most intrigued with the lengths they go to to rehabilitate an animal when others would have just given up. Putting screws into a turtles broken shell, and fixing a wing of an owl so it can once again fly are just two examples of the amazing work done there.

Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66843		/users/profile/73055	Diver	Donor	5	02/11/2011	The CFW is an amazing organization-how they "do it" given the stresses involved I do not know; I first brought them an animal in 2006 and was so impressed with their dedication and persistence to the mission and although I'm not Bill Gates by any stretch of one's imagination I have since then donated thousands of dollars and continue to support them anyway I can. It's not often I back up such work with donations given the potential for scams but this outfit is the exception in a big way. They are worth EVRY DIME. They are creative in their fundraising approaches and I support all of them. I am a random, periodic donor for special needs they have that blind-side them as well as joining their 5-year donor program in 2006; I am now in my second 5-year committment. Anything anyone can do for the CFW will be money well spent.Thank you.

Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66682		/users/profile/72883	Ernie	Donor	5	02/11/2011	My first encounter with the Center for Wildlife was many years ago when a dear friends pet seagull was injured. Our friend (Polly) was paralyzed from the waist down and wheel chair bound. Polly lived alone directly on the ocean. She had befriended a seagull which she named Susie who came to her home every morning and tapped on the back door for breakfast. Sometimes she would come back later in the day knowing Polly would be happy to see her and give her a snack. One day Polly was visiting with us when her neighbor called and said that Susie was on the front lawn and hurt.  Susie had a very large fish hook lodged in her wing. Somehow Susie knew that if she got to Polly she would help her.  Polly and her neighbor brought Susie to the CFW where she was cared for until she was healed. Once healed Polly picked Susie up, brought her home and released her. Susie continued to come every morning until one day when there was no tap on the door. Polly got concerned and looked outside and saw Susie lying on the patio near the door.....Susie had died. Susie's death was devastating to Polly as she looked forward to their mornings together. Thanks to the great care given Susie by the CFW they spent many more mornings together than they would have.  CFW didn't just save the life of an injured bird, they saved the life of one of  Polly's best friends.              
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66359		/users/profile/72533	leighwaldman	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	I work at a Montessori school in the area, and we have both visited the Center for Wildlife and had them come to our school to give presentations.  This is a wonderful service in teaching children to respect and care about the larger world, the wild animal world in particular.  The Center staff brought in live animals for the children to see, thus providing concrete examples of what they're talking about.  As an extension of their visit, we dissected the owl pellets the Center provided, further enhancing the learning experience.  We are so grateful to have such an organization in southern Maine!

Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66122		/users/profile/72282	alexami62	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	Last summer my daughter found a painted turtle that had been apparently hit by a car. I called Karen and explained to her how terribly broken the shell was. She told me to bring it down to her and she explained how they screw the broken shells together and that often these turtles are released back to their own environment after rehabilitating them. Unfortunatly, this turtle did not survive despite the centers efforts to save her. They attempted to harvest the eggs that she was carrying as well but it was too late for them too.  I took my daughter to the center for a tour a few months later and Karen was more than gracious in allowing us to see what they do at the center. The work, devotion and dedication that they provide to injured animals is truly amazing. It was wondeful to actually see first hand the fantastic work that they do there.   
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66118		/users/profile/72279	Deborah Lauersen	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2011	The Center for Wildlife is an organization run entirely on private donations and serves the need of injured wildlife. If you have ever seen a wounded bird or turtle and wanted to help but did not know how, that is what the center for wildlife does. As humans encroach more on the habitat of wildlife we run the risk of injuring them. In most communities there is no place to take an injured wild animal and they are left by the side of the road to die. In York we have the Center for Wildlife. THe employees and volunteers are dedicated to rehabilitaing the animals and educationing the community to coexist with the wildlife in our backyard. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66096		/users/profile/72237	Erin B.	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I have volunteered at the Center for Wildlife for almost three years now and it has been the most rewarding experience I've ever had. Everyone at CFW has been so nice to me and extremely helpful, not to mention the hardest workers I've ever met. Every day they put in 150% to help injured wildlife recuperate and eventually return to the wild if possible. This organization deserves recognition for the amazing work they do with what little money and resources they have. I have seen animals brought back from the brink of death and later released in perfect health, and it's so amazing to watch and be a part of. I only wish there were more resources available to CFW to build more enclosures and hire more help because of the number of animals that come in (over 1600 animals every year!) CFW also provides educational outreach to the community using the ambassador animals that are non-releasable. Children and adults alike love seeing the live animal presentations and learning about wildlife. OK I know this is a long review but I could go on for hours about CFW and I hope to continue volunteering there for many years to come. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	66063		/users/profile/72221	ChrissieBenson	Donor	5	02/10/2011	I work with a company that held a fundraiser for The Center and I was incredibly impressed with the people who came out to help, both with the execution and organization. The Center's staff took a huge roll in planning and orchestrating the event which turned out to be a huge success for both The Center and my business. Their enthusiasm, dedication and hard work was unparralleled in any organizaion I have worked with so far. It was a pleasure to have had the opportunity and one I look forward to having again in the future.

I have been very impressed by the staff's knowledge base and their willingness to work with other organizations.  They bring valuable ideas to the meetings and are excellent collaborators.   I have seen them share their excitement and understanding of animals with public school children.  I have also attended their open house and was impressed with the facility and their focus on the well-being of the animals and birds in their care.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65853		/users/profile/71983	emjack26	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I  recently started working here at the Center for Wildlife and I immediately fell in love with the place and the animals. While working here one is able to obtain hands-on work with wildlife and help them make a full recovery. I have learned a lot in only a short amount of time. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I never feel uncomfortable asking a question because I know I will be met with a charismatic and intelligent answer. The people that work here love their job and you can see that when you watch them work with the animals. The animals here receive the best and compassionate care. This is a great place to volunteer and hopefully the Center will be around for a very long time. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65841		/users/profile/71967	Pat Carr	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I found the Center for Wildlife when I encountered an injured bird that needed help. When I brought the bird to the center I filled out a brief form which included a check if I wanted to learn whether my bird survived and when it would be released. My bird did not survive, but I always felt grateful that I'd found CFW to give the poor thing a chance. Some years later I wanted to visit CFW to see if I could help in any way. That very day I began as a volunteer. As a teacher I could only volunteer during summer, but that is when the need for volunteers is the greatest.  My first summers were occupied by learning how to care for every kind of bird from the tiniest to large birds of prey. I also helped with turtles and small mammals in the most rewarding situations I'd ever experienced.  Over time however I discovered my greatest talent and interest was working with and caring for baby songbirds, seabirds, woodpeckers, etc. I was in awe of how quickly a tiny featherless creature could eat, grow, explore and exercise their wings indoors; and eventually fly in the outside enclosures. And most exciting of all when the bird began to feed itself...be released again into the wild where they belonged!The work I did with the wildlife, other volunteers and staff at the Center for Wildlife makes me proud to this day because I know I made a difference.  I didn't begin the journey with CFW until I was 55 years old. I was privileged to see a small organization of dedicated naturalists expand, improve, and grow to build the extraordinary rehab facility it is today. I volunteered every summer until my joints and muscles began to fail me. I still miss the privilege of being so close to all the birds, mammals and reptiles that the Center for Wildlife offered me. The passion I felt about my work with CFW spread to all of the children and families that passed though my classroom door over all those years as well. I am forever grateful for CFW because it opened my mind to how fragile all living things are, and that we can each make a difference. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65830		/users/profile/71955	bborsa	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	The Center for wildlife gives wild birds and animals that are injured a chance to survive. As a volunteer, I feel privileged to assist the dedicated staff members in rehabilitating injured wildlife.  We have had the honor of helping bald eagles, osprey, peregrine falcons, various species of hawks, songbirds, opossum, porcupines, and many squirrels.  The center offers help for animals that would otherwise die in the wild, whether it be by the side of the road after being struck by a car, attacked by a domestic animal, or just found injured in the forest.  The staff is an extremely dedicated, intelligent group that had opportunities to continue their work in corporate America, but chose instead to help our planet.I have volunteered at the CFW for 5 years and feel honored to be able to have the opportunity.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65817		/users/profile/71941	rock04	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	I am part of a group that raises awareness about our environment and the planet's wildlife at my school. Center for Wildlife, Inc. has been a huge supporter of our group and has helped us set up awareness events in our school. We owe a lot to the great efforts of Center for Wildlife, Inc. 
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65790		/users/profile/71915	BWold1	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I have wanted to volunteer at CFW for two years, and the minute I turned seventeen, I applied and began to volunteer there. I have also formed a student organization at my high school to fundraise and raise awareness for the center and wildlife. I have had an amazing experience at CFW. From the first day i arrived for orientation and was taught how to clean turtles and make "opossum platters", I felt welcomed and supported by the people who work there and the atmosphere of the place. Take a long, winding, bumpy road past horses and goats, pass a lake on your left, and halfway up the side of a mountain sits the well hidden right turn marked with a painted wooden sign. Here is where I feel at home. The animals are taken care of with unmatched care and compassion. Staff conduct fundraisers and find ways to get the high quality technology, medicine, and foods that actually make a difference in these animals lives. In a world that is being degraded by the ease of consumerism and technology, it is reassuring to see a place that is entirely devoted to rescuing and reversing our negative effects as humans. I have seen so many barred owls come in to the center this winter after having been hit by cars, and each of them is assessed carefully and thoroughly, and here, they are given the best care that they could possibly receive. The Center is brought over 1,600  animals annually, and volunteers, interns, and a very few paid staff members are the heart of the organization. There isn't one person who makes it all happen: it is a passionate community working towards the same cause. And yes, it is hard sometimes. But it is the most meaningful cause I have ever come across, conducted in a beautiful and thorough way. Thank you CFW.
Center for Wildlife, Inc.	65521		/users/profile/71617	scottdd2828	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I started at the center for wildlife three years ago. at first it was only a class project in which i had to do a certian amount of community service, but after that first visit to the center i was hooked. I then applyed for the spring internship which i got. durring that internship i learned so much and really gained an appriciation for nature. Also i realized just how much work really goes into wildlife rehabilation. The hours are long and the work is back-breaking, but I knew from the momment i performed my first release that, it was all worth it in the end. I completed my internship, but was never able to say goodbye to the center, so that is why still to this day i am a volunteer. I am so appriciative of what the center has done for me, i have learned so much from everyone who works here, and gained a new outlook on the animals that are living in our back yard.

I started a friendship group in Germany and we are supporting Camino Seguro ever since. We visit the project every few years to keep track of the changes. We are proud tobe part of the supporting community as Camino Seguro is doing great work for the children at the city dump of Guatemala.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	260945	2	/users/profile/349539	sbanks17	Donor	5	10/01/2015	Took my daughter to Safe Passage in Guatemala in 2010--she had a passion for the organization and made donations as a high school student. The programs we toured were inspiring and impactful in an environment that otherwise offered little hope.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	260791	3	/users/profile/242772	Deborah82	Donor	5	10/01/2015	After bringing our second child home from Guatemala in 2007, we were looking for an impactful way to stay connected to the country and the children who grow up there in destitute poverty.  We found Safe Passage and have supported their work ever since. They bring not just nutrition and education for children,  but support for the entire family unit and dignity, to the community in which they work.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	185803	2	/users/profile/242772	Deborah82	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Safe Passage  fulfills the academic, social, and nutritional needs of some of the  most destitute children in Guatemala City.  The organization takes a whole-family view, and has also started programs supporting the education and economic independence of mothers as well.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	260773	1	/users/profile/349363	James172	Donor	5	10/01/2015	Safe Passage is creating a compassionate path, an ever-challenging path, to justice and peace and togetherness.   I'm very happy to walk with them and provide what little help I can.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	260707	2	/users/profile/349290	cquint	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I visited Safe Passage's program in Guatemala in 2014, and was so impressed not only with the care shown for the families they work with, but also with the professionalism and thoughtfulness with which the staff and volunteers approach the work.  In my ongoing interactions with the program since then, I continue to be impressed.  This is a high-quality organization that is motivated to do good, and which does good - and, important to me, carries out its work with a high degree of intention and strategic thinking.  Safe Passage is a wonderful example of how a great, simple idea that starts with one person committed to making a difference, can grow into a mature organization with a sustainable vision for the future.

The colleagues I worked with, and friends I made, were very passionate about helping the children and their families increase their well being, their health knowledge and involvement in education.  Camino Seguro's presence in the community helps create a positive environment and serves as a positive instigator of change.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	209891	1	/users/profile/272634	Mallahan	Donor	5	08/10/2014	I had the opportunity to provide medical care @ Safe Passage in 2004. After observing the quality of the program offered to the children of the surrounding barrio by Safe Passage I became a child sponsor and a general sponsor and continue today, 10 years later. The volunteers that serve here are all top quality people and the services that they provide to the children is invaluable. I visit the facility every few years and continue to be amazed at the great care provided. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	207626	2	/users/profile/231649	jf93	Volunteer	5	07/29/2014	I started working with Safe Passage during my gap year between high school and college as a volunteer classroom assistant in the early childhood center at Safe Passage in Guatemala. After originally volunteering for three months, I couldn't get enough of the amazing atmosphere, passionate teachers, and the amazing faculty that make up an organization that changes the lives of the children and families that they service that make a living working in the Guatemala City garbage dump. I went back to Guatemala for an additional two months to continue volunteering, and in between my time there was able to do a fundraiser and reach out to my friends and family to make donations so I could become a sponsor for two of my students that lacked sponsors. My new role as a sponsor parent allowed me to take the students out on fun trips to the zoo, chuck e. cheese, and out to lunch as well as form close relationships with their families. My time at Safe Passage for five months inspired me to work with children and families, and I look back on my experience with the organization as one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I was able to directly work with children in my classroom ages 4-6 doing classroom activities, singing songs, doing art projects, and assisting the teacher with everyday routines. It's safe to say the students taught me more than I taught them. They were the most inspiring group of preschool-aged children I had ever met, and walked into the classroom every morning so eager to learn. In order to give back to an organization that gave and taught me so much, I became an ambassador for Safe Passage to reach out to future volunteers and members who'd like to become involved with the amazing work they do. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175309	1	/users/profile/231649	jf93	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I volunteered with Safe Passage for 5 months (which was originally supposed to be 3 months) at the Early Childhood Center, also known as the Escuelita, as a classroom assistant with 4-6 year-olds. My 5 months working with my students was the best experience I've ever had, and I got to know the students, staff, and other volunteers so well. I formed relationships with my students that I'll never forget, and still think about them today. Safe Passage is an amazing place filled with amazing people. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	207607	1	/users/profile/183688	Megan36	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/29/2014	I first became involved with Safe Passage in 2010 when a close friend encouraged me to make the trip to Guatemala. After meeting the kids and teenagers, my idea of a month-long volunteer stay went out the window. Now, after four years in Guatemala City, I feel very confident in recommending Safe Passage. The organization has a clear organizational and budgetary structure with clear goals for community development through education. As a volunteer, I encountered an open and enthusiastic environment where I felt that my ideas were welcomed and my professional achievements were recognized. As a child sponsor, I have had a great experience with the Sponsorship Department staff who are always proactive in their communication about my sponsor child (now a teenager!). I would encourage anyone to consider visiting, volunteering with, or financially supporting this organization. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	137691	1	/users/profile/183688	Megan36	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I originally came to volunteer at Safe Passage for 4 weeks... that was 2 years ago! This organization is an incredible place to grow and learn both personally and professionally. I have been a Child Sponsor now for over a year and spending time with my sponsor child never fails to put a big smile on my face after a busy day!
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	187440	1	/users/profile/244453	Sandra53	Board Member	5	11/01/2013	I joined Safe Passage over eight years ago and have been involved with the organization ever since.  I had the privilege of meeting Hanley and became her friend.  Through the years I have seen the impact Safe Passage has on the kids, their families and the community.  Being from Guatemala, I feel very proud of the work Safe Passage does and will keep on supporting this effort with all my capacities.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	186521	1	/users/profile/243531	JPaterson	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	My wife and I originally became involved because of he story of Hanley Denning and the work she did to help the poorest of the poor in Guatemala City.  IN March of 2013 we made a trip to Guatemala to see and volunteer at the school.  Out trip an extraordinary and life changing experience.  The quality of the program was more than we had expected and the joy and love within the school and the work they do for the children was remarkable.  Since returning home we are both working to help Safe Pasage and are even taking Spanish Lessons so we can return. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	186445	1	/users/profile/243452	MaineMaid	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	I first became aware of Safe Passage 7 years ago when I had coffee with its charismatic founder Hanley Denning. In one short hour I was hooked. In part it was Hanley's deep commitment to the children and families living and working at the Guatemala City dump that motivated me to be come a volunteer and donor. In part it was the intriguing approach she was using. Weeks later, I was on my way to Guatemala to see this project first hand. I was deeply shocked at the appalling poverty at the dump. It was far more brutal than anything I had ever seen or imagined. I was deeply moved as I learned about Guatemala's tragic history.  But more than anything else, I was impressed by the vibrancy of the Safe Passage program. Using education as the central focus, this very smart approach addresses the whole child and the  whole family, enabling the children the opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. Safe Passage offers these children hope for a better future and the tools to attain it.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	177865		/users/profile/234461	Dean P.	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	My husband and I joined a Bowdoin Alumni Support Team in March of 2013 and were blown away by the experience.  We had known about the organization as a "local" effort since we live in Freeport, Maine, between Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine and Yarmouth, Maine, the home office of Safe Passage.   Listening to the goals, objectives, outcomes and achievements of an organization is one thing; seeing is believing!!  Safe Passage has conceived, organized and built an incredible program that offers education programs to children and their families through teaching, love and support.  Children are growing in healthy ways through improved nutrition, medical care, physical activity and enhanced self-image.  Parenting classes and skill building programs offered to family members provide opportunities for alternative employment rather than mere subsistence living.  The culture is changing through hope.  I can't think of a better way to role model for future generations.During our stay, my husband and I were deeply touched by the opportunity we had to help classroom teachers, if only for one week.  The kids touched our hearts, the student volunteers impressed us and we found the dedication local staff truly amazing.  And that includes people working in the cafeteria, sorting donated goods, on through and up through administration.  Each person as dedicated as the next.  As a pediatric nurse, I have worked with numerous programs serving children and families.   Safe Passage is second to none.   Congratulations, thank you and my very best wishes for your continued success and prosperity. Dean Paterson
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	176101		/users/profile/232490	jessbritt8	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I visited Safe Passage on a support team in March of 2010 and fell in love with the organization.  Having studied comparative politics and Spanish in college, I knew I wanted to find a job in international development, however visiting in 2010 sealed the deal.  The volunteers were such a large and supportive community that it made me feel like I could do it!  I moved to Guatemala in September 2010 and stayed through August 2012.  The complexity and holistic approach of the program never ceases to amaze me - from school uniforms, to nutrition, to social workers, to Saturday clubs, to entrepreneurship, Safe Passage truly makes an impact in many areas of these children's and families' lives.  
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175982		/users/profile/232366	TristanGreen	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	The first time I visited Safe Passage was in the spring of 2009. It was right after high school and it was a life changing experience. I was a teacher's assistant for three months and those three months led to me deciding to earn a degree in Global Studies from UNC-Chapel Hill. After 2009 I was hooked, I told everyone I knew about Safe Passage and the wonderful work going on at the project. I returned in the summer of 2011 for three months to teach English and Guitar at the project. It was an amazing experience to combine my passions for Guitar and Safe Passage together. I was able to combine passions again when I led a support team to Safe Passage in June 2013 to teach Ultimate Frisbee to the children at Safe Passage. Each time I go back to Safe Passage, even if I see different faces, the power of the work that the project does is amazing.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175981		/users/profile/232365	Will Todman	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	Safe Passage's work is incredible. I volunteered there for 3 months, working in a classroom with children of different ages, helping out the activities and with the setting up of a health programme. Their impact on the local community is evident - the children seem to really want to go there, they get a great deal out of it, and their parents are very grateful.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175873		/users/profile/232251	megan56	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	Safe Passage has been like a second home for me for the past 3 years. Every month that passes, I have a new appreciation for Hanley's dream and am even more convinced that providing education to the children and young adults in Zone 3 and Zone 7 in Guatemala City is the only way to empower the community around the garbage dump. The graduates of our program, 39 in total, are reminders that dreams can come true with hard work and the support of incredible volunteers, staff, donors, and sponsors! 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175196		/users/profile/231531	Shalynelise	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I volunteered at Safe Passage for three months in 2011 as a classroom assistant, and I loved the experience. I have volunteered with quite a few other organizations, and Safe Passage was one of the best for sure. Everyone was welcoming in the beginning, hard working throughout, and hard to leave when it was time for me to go. I only wish my Spanish language skills were more developed so I could have enjoyed everything even more!
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	175007		/users/profile/231309	alexis.wolterbeek	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	I was a teachers assistant in a classroom of 15 three year olds  for 6 weeks. It was one of the BEST experiences of my life! My parents had been heavily involved in the program for year and I'm studying international business, so I thought it be cool to see what this program was all about! I'm so happy I did, they were some of the nicest people to work with. The teachers were welcoming and the staff was amazingly helpful with anything and everything! The kids themselves were just incredible, being with the three year olds, they were too cute! It was incredible to see the resilience and joy that Safe Passage brought these children! I graduate this May and Safe Passage is in my top 5 choices of where I'd like to end up!
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	174985		/users/profile/231285	Jlm8920	Volunteer	4	10/07/2013	I was a classroom volunteer with 4,5 and 6 year olds at Safe Passage. The non profit is so wonderful,they help these children escape from severe poverty through education. Once they receive atleast a 6th grade education they can get a real job. A lot of them end up graduating from Safe Passage and attending the university. Safe Passage also has an adult education program now that helps these children's parents escape poverty also. This helps them get a real job and out of the garbage dump. Many of the children that attend have parents or family that work in the dump. It's a very sad situation but Safe Passage helps a lot and has made a huge impact in Guatemala City and the communities it serves.I definitely recommend this organization to anyone. I love it, it has a huge part of my heart. Go to Safepassage.org and read the story on how it came about and either donate, sponsor a child or take a trip to see it for yourself. I promise you won't regret it and certainly won't be the same afterwards.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	138494		/users/profile/184562	rogoza	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/13/2012	I began working at Safe Passage/Camino Seguro 6 months ago in the Donations/PR department. After working in several NGOs/non-profits in Latin America, I can honestly say the Safe Passage is extremely effective and efficient at addressing and meeting the need of some of the poorest communities in Guatemala City. Not only is everyone at the project like family, but they are whole-heartedly invested in seeing that every student in the project (children and adults) have all the tools they need to open a wide array of possibilities in their future that they wouldn't have if not for the amazing work of Safe Passage!
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	131765		/users/profile/177352	wilsonslader33	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Safe Passage is an incredible organization. I first volunteered there in 2005 for a week at the age of 15 and ended up returning seven times since with plans to return many times more. The longest stint was for a year in 2008-2009 at the age of 18. I took a year off between high school and college and had the best year of my life. The organization is supportive and well run. The staff and other volunteers are extremely warm and welcoming and the children will capture your heart and make you return again. I can say that Safe Passage truly changed my life forever. I realized how important it was to me to help others, therefore started to study social work at college. If i had never gotten involved with Safe Passage i don't know who I would be today. Hanley Denning will forever be in my thoughts.

Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	131074		/users/profile/176610	djgrell	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	My daughter and I participated in the mother-daughter week at Safe Passage in the summer of 2011.  It's a terrific organization that is making a huge difference in the lives of children surrounding the Guatemala City garbage dump.  They are helping to educate the poorest of children living in dire circumstances.  It was a terrific experience and we made many new friends.  We now sponsor one of the girls that we met while we were there.  It's an amazing place and most worthy of your support!
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	130609	1	/users/profile/176081	Stephanie61	Donor	5	10/29/2012	I volunteered for Safe Passage from 2004-2006 and have watched it grow over the years.  It does a fabulous job education the poorest of the poor in Guatemala City, integrating locals and volunteers in its efforts.  Its holistic approach to combatting poverty is incredibly effective.  It is the best run non-profit I have ever encountered in my 12 years of living and volunteering abroad in 4 different foreign countries.  If you want to make a difference in a child's life and actually see results, get involved with Safe Passage, Camino Seguro.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	130085	2	/users/profile/175534	LeAnn A.	Donor	5	10/26/2012	We sponsor through Safe Passage, and are continually amazed at the real, practical difference made in the lives of kids and families who otherwise live in poverty in the city dump in Guatemala City.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	130007	2	/users/profile/175454	Nathan7	Donor	5	10/26/2012	Safe Passage changes lives. For the three children I sponsor with my brother and sisters, it takes them off the streets and out of the Guatemala City garbage dump by providing them a safe place to study, eat, play, and grow. For the volunteers like my siblings, it shows them a world so different and so much more precarious than their own while empowering them to make real and invaluable changes in the lives of these children. For the mothers involved in the program, it provides a them with the skills and self confidence to create small businesses and better provide for their families. For me it has proven that a small group of people can make a big change if they put their minds to it and that even a small improvement in the life of a child is worth just about anything. In sum, Safe Passage gives people one of the most powerful gifts imaginable: hope.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129992	2	/users/profile/175439	jancallecielo	Donor	5	10/26/2012	I became familiar with Safe Passage in the summer of 2010 when my 21 year old son became a long-term volunteer for this group.  I heard much about what SafePassage was accomplishing from him during his first 6 months, and was so impressed with what the oganization accomplishes that I, under their support team program, recruited 4 others to put together a support team and we went to Guatemala in June of 2011 for a week of volunteering.  There, we saw first hand the incredible success and magic of this organization.  Let me take a step back in my story - in 1989 I went to Guatemala (one of many, many visits over the years) and adopted my son Nicholas.  He is the the son volunteering at Safe Passage now.  I returned in 1991 for my son Steven, and in 1995 for my daughter Rosie.  My daughter Rosie went with us on our SafePassage support team trip.   Safe Passage has wrapped its collective arms aroung the families living around and working in the Guatemala city dump - families that for generations have been at the bottom of Guatemala's poor.  Its mission is to  bring hope, education, and opportunity to the children and families living in extreme poverty around the City's garbage dump."  Today, Safe Passage has over 100 children in its 'estrilta' preschool (where my son has been a teachers aid in the 2 year old classroom for 2 years), and over 500 children in the educational reinforcement program.  The children in the estrelita are there all day, receives all of their meals, engage in a outstanding pre-school curriculum 'planting seeds' , get bathed, brush their teeth, see a dentist twice a year, get medical care, etc. etc.  THe children in the educ reinforcement program are provided with books, uniforms, backpacks and tuition to attend  the guatemala public schools(which are half day) and spend the other half of the day at safepassage where they have meals, brush their teeth!  learn english, get homework help, take music and art, do sports, ,  and on top of this, these 600 + plus children, representing over 300 families in the dump, often have an active mother or father in the adult literacy program , a mother who no longer works at the dump because she is successful in the jewelry cooperative, a family that is lifting itself out of poverty.  Safe Passage is providing these 300 + families a way out of the grinding poverty through education, and Caring - and not a lot of money.  THe program has a guatemalan staff of teachers and social workers, at any time over 40 volunteers from all over the world who commit a minimum of 2 months of the life to the program, and dozens of volunteer support teams from around the world that go to guatemala for a week at the program - Rotary clubs, high school and college groups,medical teams, teachers, etc. etc.  Never have I seen such an amazing impact on such  a large number of families - it truly is astounding.  Go to their site, www.safepassage.org and see some of the wonderful things these kids and families are doing.  And finally, for my personal perspective, adopting children who are in need of a family  because  of  poverty in a country comes with its own share of sadness, for the family that was but could not continue.  I am incredibly proud of the work of SafePassage in that they truly are providing what is needed for Families to stay together and thrive together.  
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129975		/users/profile/175420	Harry R.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I had the privilege of volunteering with Safe Passage in Guatemala two summers ago. Since then, I have visited the project once more and continue to support them. While I was there it was incredible to witness the life-changing work they are doing in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump Community. Safe Passage offers these families a way out of the dump, where many literally sift through trash for recyclables that they can survive on. The organization does this by offering children educational, recreational, social, and health services, and offering parents adult literacy classes, health classes, parenting classes, and entrepreneurship guidance. What is also admirable about Safe Passage is that it is truly preparing these families for self-sufficiency. By offering children and parents the tools necessary to succeed, their futures will be filled with many more opportunities as a result. The faculty and volunteers have such heart for the kids, and enthusiasm for the work they do. Safe Passage is a very special place, and I feel strongly that it should be placed on your 2012 Top-Rated Nonprofits List.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129825		/users/profile/175243	peigal	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	My husband and I volunteered for about 6 weeks at Safe Passage just a year ago.  I worked in the kindergarten class as a teacher assistant, and my husband worked primarily on a data collection project. We felt that the program was exceptionally well run.  Despite having volunteers arriving at any time and staying for a length of time determined by the volunteer, the organization is able to put people to work, using their talents and experiences to best advantage to serve the children and families of the Guatemala City dump neighborhood.  This program offers a level of enthusiasm, encouragement, and practical skill development that is life-changing for the children.  A new program helps the parents with literacy so that they may get out of the dump business, too.   In addition, there is recognition of the importance of good nutrition for these children, so that nourishing meals are offered, as well as a monthly distribution of basic food ingredients for the families.  It is heart-warming to see so many idealistic young people from many countries giving their time and devotion to better the lives of these children.  
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129712		/users/profile/175112	Anthony L.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	Safe Passage (Camino Seguro) does exceptional work in the slums surrounding Guatemala City's garbage dump. For a little under a year I served as an English teacher at this organization and was impressed on a daily basis by the impact of its educational programs on the lives of children. Further, Safe Passage seems to recognize that education alone is not enough to change lives and empower individuals, ensuring that participants -- both children and adults -- also receive support in the form of social, health and nutrition services. Safe Passage -- both in mission and execution -- far exceeds the efficacy of much larger organizations. I highly recommend Safe Passage as a valuable organization with which to share either time or money.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129708	1	/users/profile/175105	Mitch D.	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2012	Safe Passage not only changes lives in Guatamala,  they are instrumental in touching and changing lives here in our own communities.    My daughter participated as part of a service team from her high school,  spending 10 days at Camino Seguro working with the children.  It has influenced her dramatically.  This summer,  she started a project with her high school soccer team to help sponsor two fifth graders.  She has grown, and in the process she has changed lives in our community.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129704		/users/profile/175102	victoriapaxson	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I went to Guatemala to volunteer for two weeks when I was in high school, and few experiences have been more rewarding. Safe Passage does incredible things, from helping the kids do their homework and learn beyond the booklets, to providing food and supplies for entire families. As volunteers, we brought them to playgrounds, set up lunch time and even helped them learn a little English. Safe Passage has helped make the dream of secondary school and even university a reality for kids who previously would have been stuck scavenging the city dump like their parents, and has improved the lives of many struggling families in the process.
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129702		/users/profile/175099	asiram	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I volunteered with Safe Passage in the spring of 2003. Although it has been a long time since I was in Guatemala I continue to share stories about how impressed I was with this organization.  It is an excellent model of a non-profit that supports and empowers its local community.  
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	129698		/users/profile/175095	bobthecat	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I volunteered for Safe Passage (Camino Seguro) as part of a service learning project the summer before my senior year in high school, and I still cherish the memories and friendships I made there. The city dump in the heart of the city was filled with workers desperate to provide for their families; the children of these workers were not allowed to be in the dump until a certain age, so they were allowed to go to school - Safe Passage. I worked with 4th graders and their problem-solving skills, helping them make Rubes-Goldberg machines and encouraging them as much as possible. This was truly a phenomenal experience that cannot be relayed through words. If you have the opportunity, please volunteer with this organization. You will not be sorry. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	110422	1	/users/profile/150327	hokuliili	Volunteer	5	04/21/2012	Safe Passage is an amazing non profit that empowers at risk children of the Guatemala City Dump. Today Safe Passage provides approximately 550 children with education, social services, and the chance to move beyond the poverty their families have faced for generations. Safe Passage is a refuge for children contending with situations marked by extreme poverty, neglect and abuse. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	110358	1	/users/profile/150234	Kajetan	Volunteer	5	04/20/2012	I worked as a long-term volunteer with 2nd / 3rd grade children at Safe Passage from July 2005 till July 2006. Since then, I have visited the project several times for shorter periods in 2007, 2008 and 2010 and each time was amazed by the rapid progress of the organization and the children that it takes care of. Main tasks of the volunteers include assisting the Guatemalan teachers in their respective classrooms (helping children with their homework, organizing art lessons, workshops, games, etc.), teaching a particular age group in the highly interactive English program, organizing sport lessons in the Sports program or taking over long-term roles such as IT teacher or responsible of the projects library. Volunteers receive a formalized training at the beginning of their stay and are placed to make best use of their capabilities. The personal impact volunteers have obviously depends on the length of stay  long-term volunteers are able to develop a much more personal relationship with their colleagues, the children and their families, meaning that their guidance and help  especially in difficult periods  becomes extremely valuable. At the same time, short-term volunteers introduce fresh ideas, offer new perspectives and are absolutely necessary to keep the project going. In any case, the volunteering experience at Safe Passage is extremely rewarding  teachers, children and families are very welcoming and open, the working atmosphere (with extremely motivated volunteers and staff from all over the world) is great and realizing how little it takes to contribute to making a huge difference in so many lives is a great lesson by itself. During my various visits, I have witnessed constant improvements of the program: It nowadays not only targets children, but also their families and the entire community  parents can join the literacy program and community events are organized throughout the year. Furthermore, normal school education is complemented with sports, art and health programs; violence / drug prevention programs and professional psychological support for some of the children are other very important components that have been added in recent years. Even more impressive is the personal progress of many of the kids enrolled in the program  it is great to see how some of them develop into real personalities and young leaders in their community and finish school with ambitious plans for life. From a donors perspective, it would be nice if the impact of the program (number of students graduating, etc.) could be measured on a regular basis. While personal accounts and stories are certainly inspiring and important, impact metrics would help to make the work even more transparent. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	110253	1	/users/profile/150122	elizabeth.mcelhinney	Volunteer	4	04/19/2012	I worked in the Guarderia at Safe Passage - working with 3 year olds as a classroom aid. I did a lot of cleaning, reading, singing, pushing children on swings, and working with the kids on different art and learning projects. While I didn't feel that my personal being there didn't "impact" any one student or classroom specifically, I was always amazed at the program. Safe Passage has grown so wonderfully in the past 10 years. I visited as a high school group in 2006, returned as a graduate in 2007 to volunteer, and then came back to do some interviews in the summer of 2010. Every time I've been back they've added a new, crucial component for the community. When I visited in 2010 I was in the Women's Literacy building and I was BLOWN AWAY by the rapport between the volunteer running the women's literacy program and the women that came there daily. These women are of a huge age group but are all there to learn and it is, I'm sure, quite a challenge but so empowering (I imagine) at the same time. Safe Passage volunteers when I was there were super welcoming and great people, they are from all over the world. 
Safe Passage | Camino Seguro	97954	4	/users/profile/115653	John Gundersdorf	Board Member	5	09/22/2011	Charity Navigator's rating of Safe Passage indicates the organization has not had a audit by an independent auditing firm.   This is not the case.  For several years the firm of Mcdonald Page, Maine's largest accounting firm has performed a full and complete audit of Safe Passage.  They send a teams of auditors to both our USA location in Maine and to Guatemala annually.  We recently changed fiscal years and had both a six month audit of the extended fiscal year and and 18 month audit of the total fiscal year.   Apparently, this caused Charity Navigator rating system some confusion.  Safe Passage takes the audit process seriously, and the reports of our auditor are reviewed both by our Finance Commmittee and full board.   John Gundersdorf, Treasurer

Friends of Acadia	221599	1	/users/profile/285286	Aks2	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2014	Friends of Acadia is one of the best NP's that I have ever been a part of. They add so much to our community. They provide needed jobs for our local 15-18 year olds by sponsoring jobs in Acadia National Park, as well as Ridge Runner positions for older college students. They organize many volunteer days for locals and visitors and have benefited our local economy as well as being a great support for Acadia National Park. One of the best things is that the employees of FOA are also active in many other smaller non-profits in the area and offer their expertise and time willingly.

The pristine condition of the trails and carriage roads make our hiking most pleasurable. I also strongly support the role of the Island Explorer bus and advocate its use to everyone I meet in the park. I have never volunteered for an organization that showed such appreciation for my efforts. Thank you FOA for all you do!

Without their work maintaining trails and providing education as well as fundraising, I can't imagine what our visits to the park would look like. The federal government needs nonprofits like FOA to fill in the gaps in funding and to even do some of the essential jobs to maintain the park. It is a true wonder of the natural world, and we are all the richer for the work of FOA.

Friends of Acadia	187636		/users/profile/244671	JennBrandt08	Volunteer	5	11/03/2013	Friends of Acadia (FOA) is an outstanding organization devoted to Acadia National Park (ANP), in particular, and the great outdoors, more globally.  For the past eight years, I've been volunteering for FOA as a crew leader and office worker and have never felt so appreciated.  It's not the hats or t-shirts or even special luncheons they treat us to that do it for me, but rather the sincere gratitude the whole FOA staff expresses every time anyone volunteers their time and energy.  The volunteers are held in high esteem and our value as contributors to the Park's welfare and the greater good is never taken for granted. The staff at FOA are hard working and dedicated.  No gala is too big or trail installation too daunting for FOA to take it on and manage it with style and grace.  The people there embody espirit de corps and continually seek new ways to connect with people and organizations to promote ANP in all its glory. I am honored and grateful to be a part of FOA and am always proud at what they do.  You would be too!
Friends of Acadia	187423		/users/profile/244437	pine	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I support Friends of Acadia  because the organization and its volunteers work to preserve what is important to me-a way of life that includes the natural beauty of Acadia National Park.  The programs of FOA, including the island wide bus system, The Wild Gardens of Acadia, and the many activities designed to encourage young people to develop an understanding of the importance of preserving our natural heritage, all seem to further a way of life available few other places in the US.     I am grateful and recognize that this work has not been accomplished  without the vision, knowledge, and hard work of those associated with the organization. I am always interested to notice that the staff and the board  lead by example and are always on hand to help implement events and programming.

Acadia National Park is a relatively small park, but it is close to densely populated areas.  Friends of Acadia plays an essential role in engaging visitors in easily overlooked aspects of Acadia National Park, making the park experience much richer, all the while helping to protect Acadia in a myriad of ways.  They amplify the Park's voice, make the trails and transit system a joy to use, and help provide wide and clear vision for Acadia's future.
Friends of Acadia	182614		/users/profile/239483	mdijim	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	Many years (decades) ago, my wife and I started spending vacations in Acadia. These were precious one or two week escapes from the workaday world and life in suburbia. I always loved outdoor activities of every kind but gradually come to emphasize hiking/walking because of their simplicity and  high ratio of reward to cost (time, money, other). We vacationed in many places, but i liked Acadia best because it is a hiker's paradise. Although i volunteered to work on organizing hikes and doing trail work in my own neighborhood, i never once volunteered in Acadia during all those vacations. On one occasion, while bicycling on the carriage roads, i passed a group of volunteers lined up along a roadside ditch on their knees digging out growth which blocked drainage. Negatively, i thought, "Why waste your time in such a beautiful location on your knees grubbing weeds out of a ditch?" Later, i left my full time job to work as a consultant and we went to live on Mount Desert Island so that i could spend my spare time hiking and biking amidst Acadia's beauty. With time to spend, i appreciated Acadia's network of trails and carriage roads even more. Because of my hiking and trail work experience in other places, I knew that Acadia's vast network of trails and carriage roads required a lot of labor.  I also wanted to connect with my community and its many, many visitors. I took a job at a popular restaurant with the duty of, amongst other things, informing visitors about the history and recreational opportunities in Acadia. To be effective in my job i hiked even more and did a lot of reading about Acadia. A person with whom i worked in a small booth told me about her volunteer work with Friends of Acadia. In that small booth we shared there were many leaflets and fliers to give visitors information about Acadia. One of those described the opportunity to volunteer with FOA on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings during the warmer months, and i did so from time to time. Those few mornings volunteering with FOA introduced me to a whole set of people who volunteered regularly. Some of them lived on Mount Desert Island all year and had retired here from somewhere else. Some of them spent the summer here. Some of them volunteered during annual vacations. One way or another all shared an interest in the Acadia region's history and attractions. Many were also avid hikers or cyclists. I like these people and volunteered more and more to enjoy their company and the work we did together, but not as much as I would have liked to because of the time constraint of my summer job. One day, an FOA employee whose task it was to organize the volunteers, furnish them tools, transportation, and training, and coordinate with the National Park Service to find meaningful tasks that could be accomplished by volunteers, told me that he had decided to quit his job, not because he did not like it, but because an injury was making it difficult for him to carry out the physical part of the job. He told me this when I encountered him leading a group of volunteers working on a trail where i was taking a recreational hike. He and his colleague were impressed with me because I volunteered on rainy days when almost noone else did so. I did that not because i liked working in the rain for no pay, but because i liked being with them and believe that one can always have fun outdoors if properly clothed and equipped with the right attitude. With his encouragement and that of his colleague, I applied for a vacancy opened by his departure, and became an FOA employee. As an FOA employee working with my old volunteer colleagues and NPS staff, I learned more about FOA, its Board and its staff. One thing that surprised me was the extent to which NPS staff appreciated the work of volunteers. Certainly we were around only a few hours a week in good weather and lacked their skil, but volunteers nevertheless performed critical jobs well. Also, i was surprised by the amount of volunteer work done in Acadia by groups of high school and college students. Those who volunteer two or three mornings a week almost never see the large groups of students and summer campers who come to Acadia specifically to spend a week doing volunteer work, thereby contributing as many hours as the older volunteers. These youth are not as skilled as older volunteers who have done this work for years, but they are strong and enthusiastic. I loved my work and FOA, but i left the job after a few years because i did not want the stress of full time work. I did not leave FOA. I am back to volunteering, and my wife and i donate as much money as we can, a pittance compared to FOA's needs, to further FOA's mission.  FOA staff get around the country meeting staff of similar organizations at other national parks. They always say that others envy the scope and enthusiasm of FOA's volunteer program. Well, you would expect them to say that, but it is true. We visit other national parks and i always look for volunteer opportunities there. None have "friend" organizations as successful as FOA. There are many reasons for this. Most national parks are in remote areas. Acadia is on an island, half of which is not in Acadia National Park, surrounded by vibrant communities that depend on tourism. Acadia National Park is not the result of a government agency setting aside uninhabited land for a national park extending over hundreds of square miles. It is the result of dedicated local land owners purchasing or donating small plots of land here and there to preserve them from being over run by tourists or destroyed by unsustainable economic activities. The trails and carriage roads that FOA volunteers work so hard to preserve and protect as an adjunct to the even greater effforts of NPS staff were, mostly, built by private individuals long before the establishment of the National Park Service. Indeed, although the NPS maintains over a hundred miles of hiking trails, an equal amount of hiking trails built by volunteers are abandoned because NPS does not have the resources to maintain them. Acadia National Park is, in sum, not a government project. It started as a volunteer project and volunteers, organized and funded (because even free labor has to be supported with tools, transportation, coordination, and training) by FOA are critical components of its ongoing existence. People realize this and they come together to keep it going.
Friends of Acadia	175159		/users/profile/231491	cberman	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2013	The non profit group,Friends of Acadia, not only runs numerous programs in conjunction with the National Park Service, they also help maintain the splendor of Acadia through volunteer efforts that bring the community together and  improve the park for all.  They send out a wonderful newsletter, to those that are interested in receiving it, detailing all their programs and initiatives.  I live far from Acadia, and miss it when I am not there, but the news letter not only keeps me informed, it brings back  many happy memories from our trips to my favorite place in the world.  
Friends of Acadia	175022		/users/profile/231324	Acadia	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	Friends of Acadia works hand in hand with the Park and finds constructive ways to get people actively involved with supporting and caring for the park. Friends of Acadia is behind or actively engaged in every innovative idea that the Park tries out. People of all ages and backgrounds come together and know they all love this special place. Friends of Acadia keeps us all in touch with the park and with each other.

I joined because I appreciated all the work that they do to improve the park, fund projects, and more. Friends of Acadia volunteers and staff, and workers hired by the organization, spend many hours each year cleaning the park, restoring trails, building boardwalks, facilitating the use of buses instead of cars to transport people inside the park, and more.

Friends of Acadia	152165		/users/profile/203266	Lisa228	Donor	5	04/05/2013	The work they do in and for the park is so essential to keeping it attractive and usable for visitors, plus, they make a lot of information available to help people find their way around the park and to find interesting things to do in the park that will suit them.  Besides, Acadia is an awesome park!  Also, their fundraising outreach is tasteful, respectful and informative.

Friends of Acadia	128128		/users/profile/173262	Carrie34	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2012	Not just Acadia National Park, but the entire island would be incomplete without Friends of Acadia galvanizing people from everywhere to volunteer to keep our Acadia beautiful and safe.  My daughter who is a senior in high school is planning on majoring in business management because she wants to be a fundraiser for a nonprofit organization such as Friends of Acadia.

Friends of Acadia	128013		/users/profile/173140	Tom P.	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2012	I have tried to visit ANP yearly since moving back to New England in 1998.  It is a wonderful experience, and programmed activities only add to the natural value of the Park.  Without assistance from FOA, this park could not operated at the high quality that it does, and it would surely be showing significantly more signs of wear and tear from the heavy traffic it receives.  
Friends of Acadia	127957		/users/profile/173082	Mike55	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2012	We don't get to visit as often as we like, but when we do we always find this park so well kept and the staff you cone across is always so helpful and accommodating.

Friends of Acadia	124454		/users/profile/169309	bmchales	Board Member	5	10/03/2012	Friends of Acadia is a top notch organization in every way: it has a clear mission broadly shared by the organization's membership and Board; visionary leadership that listens to the community and its members; collaborates actively with other like-minded nonprofits; works to support Park priorities where appropriate; careful stewards of donations and funds; thoughtful in taking positions and key issues; and knows how to make being active in the organization fun and rewarding. From picking up trash along the roadsides, family fun day, to the annual benefit auction, this is a an exceptionally well-run and effective group.
Friends of Acadia	124240		/users/profile/169063	davidsho	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2012	I have been coming to this amazing place each summer for 33 years.  The thing that is most amazing to me is that it hasnt' changed much, only in a positive way, maintaining and improving what is there in the first place.  You can feel how much this land is loved and cared for by Friends of Acadia and I have supported them every year in their fine efforts.  I first came to Acadia alone, then with my wife, then my children and now my grandchild.  I always ask them around now, do you want to go somewhere else?  They say NO!  We want to always go to Acadia.  Thank you FOA for offering people a time to just focus on this beautiful piece of the earth.
Friends of Acadia	124075		/users/profile/168877	Nancy65	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2012	Acadia National Park is one of our country's most beautiful national parks and recreation areas.  The Friends of Acadia are unlike any group we know of affiliated with a national park.  They work hand in hand with the Park, with a large group of volunteers, in maintaining hiking trials and the carriage road paths used by walkers and bikers.  They also raise awareness of Acadia, it's history, it's opportunities and needs and conservation efforts. We discovered Acadia nine years ago and it is our favorite vacation destination.  The friends of Acadia newsletter keeps us connected with Acadia throughout the year.  Through it, we feel at one with the natural beauty and the incredible history of Acadia. In retirement we hope to spend more time in Acadia and become active volunteers with the Friends of Acadia, working side by side with others devoted to working in nature and conserving the beauty of this national park  treasure for many generations to come.
Friends of Acadia	122604		/users/profile/166993	Megan30	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2012	I live in the Acadia National Park area.  Friends of Acadia makes the park so much better, and puts on lots of interesting programs to encourage us to use the park.  My whole family volunteers with them as well.
Friends of Acadia	122573		/users/profile/166950	Marla OByrne	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/19/2012	I worked for Friends of Acadia for 16 years, and it was some of the most creative, caring work I've ever done.   I loved being a partner to one of America's national parks, with the surrounding communities, and with so many people who care deeply about this place and with the national park promise.  It was an experience of shared commitment, concern, and positive hopefulness.
Friends of Acadia	122555		/users/profile/166927	Amy_38	Volunteer	5	09/19/2012	My two kids and I have helped raked the Carriage Road in Acadia National Park and volunteered at different educational stations on Family Fun Day in July. Friends of Acadia thanks all volunteers with a cruise and small dinner every September. But this year was the first time we heard about it and joined the cruise. It was awesome. I have also volunteered with other organizations, but Friends of Acadia is the best so far in terms of how it's organized and how they show their appreciation to volunteers. 
Friends of Acadia	122546		/users/profile/166901	Carldog	Client Served	5	09/19/2012	Acadia National Park is an American treasure.

Friends of Acadia does outstanding work preserving the park, working with volunteers and partners to keep it clean and safe. Bravo!
Friends of Acadia	84463		/users/profile/93701	GeorgeDorrFan	Donor	5	03/31/2011	What does Friends of Acadia do? A better question would be, what don't they do? My husband and our two dogs and I visit Acadia National Park every year, and even with the difficulties that all the parks are experiencing in the last 15 years in terms of funding, we are continually amazed. The park would definitely not be in such great shape without the support--in terms of money, time, volunteers, scientific endeavors, creative projects, corporate involvement, resources, etc.--of FOA. I look forward each year not only to visiting ANP and the surrounding communities of Mount Desert Island, but I actually crave receiving the FOA Journal in the mail three times a year, along with the superbly produced annual report! FOA creates a community that cares not only about the park, but about nature and youth and peace and education and beauty and ethics--in short, all the things that make us human and make us yearn for a better future. In his book Time and Tide in Acadia, Christopher Camuto writes that, "Some days, walking Acadian summits, soaking up the informed silence of these moubtains, you'll want to bow to everything you see." I would submit that there are times when I visit the wonders of Mount Desert Island, I feel the same sort of reverence for the wonderful folks at Friends of Acadia.
Friends of Acadia	84391		/users/profile/93605	Mj S.	Donor	5	03/31/2011	Acadia National Park is a gift to all of us.  Last year I started a hiking group and my friends at Friends of Acadia were of great help to me putting the group together.  We hiked a total of 48 trails and each time you could see all the great work and energy Friends have done. With the new trail marker and keeping the trails nice.  The park is lucky to have them working so hard at keeping it so pretty.  So in closing I would like to say,  Thank You Friends Of Acadia for being here.
Friends of Acadia	84294		/users/profile/93476	susan	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	Friends of Acadia is known to everyone on Mount Desert Island as the organization that works to preserve the natural resources of Acadia National Park.  I have admired and supported FOA for years but have only recently, as a volunteer in the Wild Gardens of Acadia,  had the opportunity to work closely with their board and staff . The Wild Gardens are gardens of native plant communities located within Acadia National Park.  They began in 1961 as a volunteer project of the Bar Harbor Garden Club and have been sustained by volunteers since that time.  As the Gardens grew and visitation increased it became increasingly difficult for volunteers to maintain them and the Gardens volunteers, fearing for the future, appealed for help from Friends of Acadia, an organization sharing the Gardens volunteers commitment to conservation of the Parks resources and to volunteerism. Friends of Acadia embraced the project and, working with the National Park, established in 2010 the Wild Gardens of Acadia Committee of Friends of Acadia. In the short time since the formal affiliation I have watched the Wild Gardens, always beautiful and always an asset to the Park, begin to realize their potential.  Today a professional gardener, not  volunteers, oversees the workings of the Gardens and guides the work of a student intern.  Volunteers have been freed to serve as docents for the thousands of visitors and they help with the weeding and gardening when needed.  They work with the Head Gardener to plan habitat restoration and with Friends of Acadia to plan for the future.  Volunteers continue to help raise funds but now they have guidance and support in their efforts. Friends of Acadia, The Wild Gardens, and the Master Gardeners of Hancock County jointly published a guide to the native ferns last summer. Friends of Acadia has provided a structure in which  these activities, and many others, are planned and support with which they are executed.  Most importantly the Wild Gardens of Acadia, because of its association with Friends of Acadia, is assured of a future. 
Friends of Acadia	84216		/users/profile/93382	C Horner	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	Being a volunteer for Friends of Acadia is a wonderful experience! Many opportunities are made available for volunteers according to their time and interests. volunteers work on the trails and carriage roads in Acadia National Park from May to November, clearing brush, rehabilitating old trails, creating new ones, clearing drainage ditches, and improving vistas. other volunteers help in the Wild Gardens at Sieur de Mont Springs, on the Schoodic Peninsula and with the annual summer fundraising gala. In the spring many volunteers join in the annual Earth Day cleanup, which makes the communities surrounding Acadia as beautiful as the park. in the fall hundreds of people from all over come to participate in Take Pride in Acadia Day. Friend of Acadia does a great job of providing some thing for everyone, families, school groups, outing clubs, young and old. Friends of Acadia educates and trains their volunteers, provides tools, transportation and support for their efforts. And volunteers are well recognized for their contribution to Acadia in many ways, making the whole effort a rewarding experience. The result? Volunteers provide more than 10,000 hours of help a year to preserve, protect and enhance Acadia while enjoying a sense of pride and camaraderie.
Friends of Acadia	84112		/users/profile/93255	Jack R.	Board Member	5	03/30/2011	I was born and grew up on Mount Desert Island, so love of Acadia is my birthright.  When i came home to the island in 2006 to life the last best third of life, I quickly joined Friends of Acadia.  I have done regular volunteer work on ANP trails and carriage roads, done spring roadside clean-up on the island, written often for the FOA Journal, become a donor within my means, brought several friends into Friends and, since 2010, serve proudly and a member of the FOA Board, where I chair the Advocacy Committee.  I am currently part of a team doing a full review of the FOA Strategic Plan.  FOA gives me a community through which I can express values and commitment deeply important to me as a life-long conservationist.  The strength and dedication of the FOA professional staff and the quality of my colleagues on the FOA Board make my investment in Friends a joyful natural act.
Friends of Acadia	84094		/users/profile/93225	Jan Church	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	As a resident of Mt. Desert Island and frequent user of beautiful but cash-strapped Acadia National Park, i am often surprised at how much Friends of Acadia does to further opportunities for visitors to the Park, who numbered more than 2,500.000 people last year.  FOA organizes large numbers of volunteers who maintain and groom the legendary carriage roads I walk and ski on.  I marvel as I hike mountain trails beautifully  restored with FOA funds.  I join local friends who volunteer for FOA's annual roadside cleanup, and have served on a committee that plans walking paths from villages to mountain trail complexes. Our young granddaughter has enjoyed an FOA family day which encourages children to experience the outdoors.  I read the fine Friends of Acadia Journal from beginning to end for inspiration and information.  I like knowing that any contributions to FOA will be leveraged to the full through partnerships and use of volunteers to benefit so many, many people.
Friends of Acadia	83911		/users/profile/93012	Charles Eliot	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	A couple of decades ago my wife and I discovered Acadia National Park. Over the years we spent some of our vacation time there. We've also visited national parks in the west. Acadia may not match some of the western parks for grand scenery, but it is certainly the most scenic place on the east coast. Acadia was close to home, but it took most of a day to get there and a day to return, leaving not much time out of a short vacation. We chose to make the drive of six or more hours to get there because of Acadia's natural beauty, visitor-friendly surrounding communities, and unique features. Acadia's unique features include about 120 miles of hiking trails that typically lead to spectacular views within an hour, and a system of carriage roads, closed to motor vehicles, that cover 45 miles carefully planned to show the scenery without intruding on it. To add to the attraction, the carriage roads are festooned with beautiful stone bridges that carry the bicyclist or walker across babbling brooks and deep ravines while opening scenic ocean views. In addition, Acadia includes a remote peninsula encompassing an unspoiled section of Maine's rocky coast and most of a large island where visitors are limited and primitive camping under starlit skies is available. These features kept us coming back year after year. When it was time to retire we chose to live in Bar Harbor so that we could enjoy Acadia all year round. What does a new retiree do with his time? How do people make friends in a new town? Friends of Acadia provided us with tools that make for a happy retirement. FOA helps to take care of a small national park that gets millions of visitors each year in a location beset with harsh winters and fierce storms bringing wind and rain in abundance off the Atlantic Ocean. This environment calls for a lot of work to keep heavily used hiking trails and carriage roads in decent repair. FOA helps by raising funds for an efficient public transportation system that eases visitor impact, by raising funds to furnish the Acadia National Park management with tools, equipment and paid staff to maintain and repair trails and carriage roads, and by encouraging and supporting volunteers who give up some of their time to help maintain Acadia. As an FOA volunteer I learned about Acadia National Park's history.  Unlike western national parks, Acadia was not created by setting aside an undeveloped wilderness already owned by the federal government. Acadia's history goes back a long ways. Its first European visitor, Samuel de Champlain, founded the first European settlement in eastern North America just a couple of hours east of here in 1604. After the Civil War wealthy Americans, including John D. Rockefeller Jr.,  brought their families to spend the summer here. These wealthy summer residents, called rusticators, built most of Acadia National Park's hiking trails and carriage roads either by hiring local labor or by doing the work themselves. Anxious to preserve Acadia's scenery from over development, they founded the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations, a non-profit organization that bought land and set it aside preserved from development. This private organization gave its land, with all of its privately built hiking trails and carriage roads, along with endowments for their upkeep in many cases, to the federal government for the establishment of the first national park in the east. Unfortunately, two world wars and an economic depression reduced the federal government's ability to care for Acadia. In 1947 a wildfire burned half of Mount Desert Island, where the majority of the park's land is located. The 1947 fired burned many of the mansions used by rusticators during their summer stays and caused some of them to move on to other places. Hiking trails and carriage roads fell into disrepair and were subject to wash outsand land slides. It was difficult for visitors, whose numbers were reduced during wars and the depression, to enjoy Acadia. This and the 1947 fire devastated the local economy. Something had to be done to save Acadia. Friends of Acadia was established in 1986 and began raising funds to restore and maintain Acadia. FOA established a permanent endowment for the carriage roads, worked against attempts to surround the park with unsuitable development, endowed the hiking trails, built or restored trails that connect the park to local communities thereby affording local residents the opportunity to enjoy the park without driving, partnered with L. L. Bean to establish and support a free public bus system to carry visitors and residents to and from the park and local lodging places and campgrounds, and sponsored and supported volunteers to work on Acadia's trails and carriage roads, which is where I came in. Volunteering is really more about the volunteers than it is about the work they do, although any volunteer will be proud of his or her contribution to making the world a better place. In 2010 FOA volunteers contributed over 8,000 hours of their time to work on Acadia's trails and carriage roads. That is a lot of time, but it is unskilled labor that is the equivalent of less than ten seasonal employees. Volunteering has a tremendous impact on the volunteers themselves, the many visitors who see the volunteers at work, and people back home. Proud of their work, volunteers become enthusiastic stewards of Acadia National Park and parks in other places. That stewardship extends to political activity on behalf of parks. Visitors who see volunteers at work commonly offer profuse thanks, thereby enhancing the volunteer's good feelings, and become volunteers themselves either at Acadia or elsewhere. Some of FOA's volunteers spend the cooler months in the south, and, like one volunteer couple I know, volunteer as much at home, Great Smoky Mountains National Park in this instance, as they do at Acadia. Those 8,000 hours have a ripple effect worth many times the $100,000 or so it would cost to replace them with paid labor. I volunteered for Friends of Acadia for about seven years and my wife volunteers for FOA as well. We have met many of our friends in this area through volunteering. Volunteers whom we have met play important roles in this community. They volunteer at their local library or provide rides to people who need transportation to medical services. In this way the circle of people one knows grows ever larger through networks of other volunteer activities. By volunteering I've learned a lot about Acadia National Park. Despite its small area and millions of visitors, Acadia contains hidden wonders unseen by most visitors that I've been privileged to see through volunteering. The one thing that FOA's volunteer program has failed to do for the most part is to overcome the proclivity of today's young people to prefer staying inside with their electronic toys to getting out into nature by hiking and biking and kayaking. If we don't get young people involved in the outdoors we risk losing our parklands. In times of austerity how willing would they be to spend tax dollars on maintaining hiking trails or bike paths if they haven't climbed a mountain? If today's young people are fortunate enough to enjoy financial prosperity, how willing would they be to part with some of their wealth to support the environment if they haven't camped under the stars? FOA and many organizations are trying, but so far they have been unable to stem the ebbing tide of outdoor involvement. That has got to be the mission for the future.
Friends of Acadia	83884		/users/profile/92980	msiklosi	Board Member	5	03/29/2011	Friends of Acadia (FOA) provides the margin of excellence for all who visit and experience  Acadia National Park in Maine.  Working with the National Park Service, FOA has helped to conserve or purchase and donate to the Park many acres of private land within and adjacent to Park boundaries to preserve the natural surroundings.  FOA has secured private donations to keep a free, seasonal, hop-on, hop-off propane bus system (over 2 million riders to date)  that has taken hundreds of cars out of the Park and off surrounding roads, and reduced CO2 and other air pollutants by tens of thousands of pounds.  Miles of trails and carriage roads have been maintained with over $1 million from FOA, many of which my wife, Mary Ann and I hike with great delight each year.  Mary Ann and I pick up roadside litter on Earth Day, courtesy of FOA organizing 400 volunteers on Mt. Desert Island, where the bulk of Park acreage is located, and we both volunteer at the FOA office for various jobs throughout the year.
Friends of Acadia	83835		/users/profile/92916	Clifford Wagner	Volunteer	4	03/29/2011	We first learned about Friends of Acadia when we retired and now spend six months in the Acadia area.  We were drawn to FOA by all the volunteer support that gravitates to FOA.  Much of the volunteer effort helps maintain Park trails, Park roads and financial support.  We were interested in the development area and fund raising to help support the Park, as federal funds are not sufficient.  The most known form of support is the transportation system of propane powered busses.  These busses transport people free of charge anywhere in the Park and surrounding areas.  The use of the bus system reduces the number of autos driven in the Park, thus reducing the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.  All is not work, as the annual gala party held in August is a wonderful dinner and fund raising auction that helps bind the energetic group of generour volunteers.
Friends of Acadia	83823		/users/profile/92905	Margaret	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I have been associated with Friends of Acadia for more than 20 years in a volunteer capacity, most specifically helping with their benefit each summer to raise funds to support Acadia National Park.  Their work to preserve this national treasure is unsurpassed.  FOA also partnered with the Garden Club of Mt. Desert (of which I was President  2009-1010) and the Maine Natural History Observatory to publish "The Plants of Acadia National Park" in 2010, a field guide presenting 862 scientific descriptions of plants in the Park,  which is used by botanists and visitors  alike.  The guide is in its second printing.  I have never worked with more a more dedicated and professional staff than that of FOA.  Their work is vital to the maintenance and care of one of our country's most beautiful national parks.
Friends of Acadia	83719		/users/profile/92785	roro452	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	we began volunteering for acadia in honor of and sadly in memory of our beloved niece Danielle Faramelli. We as a family of atleast 30 people have been going to acadia every year for over 30 years. in 2006 danielle has expressed to her parents that she would like to volunteer there to give back some of the happy times acadia has given us--sadly she was killed in a car accident at the age of 25 before she could ever do this--her mom and dad didnt know if they could ever go to maine again since the loss of their only child-that summer her mom decided she could go if volunteering was part of our vavation--she had no idea all 25 or 30 of us would show up that day in maine-needless to say we fulfilled Danielles wish and have been doing this in her honor every year when we return to the beautiful state of maine-we come from pa, and its a 14 hour drive-we have mostly 6 or 7 carloads of people going every year and we will continue to volunteer in her memory until there is no one left--which wont happen because the third generation has already started-my grandson has been with us there for all 3 of his years already and will be there this year for his fourth year---we all love all of maine--acadia is our favorite having provided us many memories and now the chance to give back is both an honor and privelege.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	243376		/users/profile/73609	Maineiac	Volunteer	5	05/21/2015	I work as a volunteer for the DSQ because I want to keep the music alive and flowing.  These quartet members are the highest quality musicians and they live in Midcoast Maine and perform here (and around the country) all year long.  It is a magical experience to attend one of their concerts.  Their knowledge and interpretation of the music is exquisite as are their performances.  They are also community-minded and play for school children to encourage them to listen to and possibly play classical music themselves.  They have workshops for high school students where they coach them in quartet groups. The all teach students of any age and one of the members conducts two local orchestras who give free performances twice a year and conducts a Portland youth orchestra.   I wouldn't miss a chance to hear DSQ perform.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	125715		/users/profile/73609	Maineiac	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	The DaPonte String Quartet is a marvelous combination of professional musicians who love to share classical music with audiences from the general public to school children.  They play in our schools to interest our children in music and instruments.  They play in retirement centers for those who cannot travel to other venues.  They teach private students of all ages and conduct local orchestras. Their repertoire is vast and every series of concerts up and down the midcoast is a different program each time.  We are very lucky to have such a professional,  community-minded ensemble living in our area and performing year-round.  These are four world class musicians who come together to play with unparalleled strength and knowledge of the classics and produce quality, superb, performances.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	67345		/users/profile/73609	Maineiac	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	This is a professional string quartet in the Midcoast Maine area that performs concerts for the public but, as well, goes into schools and plays for the children and has Q&A with them to interest them in music and instruments.  They also play free concerts at nursing homes and retirement centers for those who cannot attend regular concerts.  These are four professional musicians who have moved to Maine to provide our area with possibly the only live classical ensemble year-round up and down the Maine coast.They also teach private lessons to our children and conduct community orchestras.They also have a half-hour free discussion before the concert explaining the composer's (this year Beethoven) thinking and musicality.  It would be a great loss to our community not to have these cultural events and these great musicians and the time they give back to our community and local schools.

With obvious pride, we have taken visiting guests from San Francisco, Chicago, and New York to their concerts and have watched the wonder on their faces at finding such exquisite music so "far away" from civilization!  Their pitch is always perfect and they approach each piece with enthusiasm and love.  They love what they do and they love doing it together.  And they are extremely generous -- they performed a concert for a medical/health partnership between professionals in Southern Maine and Haiti, Konbit Sante Cap-Haitien Health Partnership, which raised almost $5000.  They are a part of the fabric of the Southern Maine community and enrich the lives of very many of us.  We're blessed with good fortune.  Michael & Wendy Taylor

Remarks made by individual members of the Quartet are always interesting, scholarly, and fun. It is first-rate chamber music. We are very fortunate to have them in Maine.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	69431		/users/profile/75870	Cynthia Howland	Board Member	5	02/16/2011	I have been going to their concerts for a long time and have always been amazed at the energy and quality of their playing.  Their intelligent comments about both composers and music are teaching moments that help me understand the music better. The Quartet enriches the cultural life of Maine immensely through concerts and school outreach.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	142927		/users/profile/73599	strazoff	Donor	5	11/26/2012	The DaPonte String Quartet is a world-class clssical music ensemble that  -- amazingly enough -- chose some time ago to live and work in Maine.  It's not that life has been easy for them, but, having made this somewhat-odd choice, they are living for their music.  They rehearse for three hours every weekday.  When outside guest artists come to perform with them, they can't believe what a luxury it is to have this kind of intensive rehearsal, where , by working literally note by note, the four musicians make magic happen.  And meanwhile, they teach, do master classes, concerts, and many other acts of generosity.  Those of us who live in Maine have no idea how lucky we are to have them live among us.      
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	67337		/users/profile/73599	strazoff	General Member of the Public	5	02/12/2011	The DaPonte String Quartet is giving three performances this weekend, in three locations in Maine.  Last night, in Newcastle, they played quartets by Webern, Schubert and Beethoven -- three very different composers -- performed with musical insight and technical precision.  They received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience.  Members of the Quartet teach privately, perform in schools free of charge, and one violinist conducts a community orchestra.  They are an integral resource to an area of Maine that is culturally rich during summer months, and much less so during the winter.

This group does that.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	142875		/users/profile/189307	susan l b	Advisor	5	11/26/2012	One of the joys of living in Coastal Maine is that we have so many chances to enjoy the most beautiful music written for String Quartet, played by extraordinary, dedicated and professional musicians.  I very much appreciate the DaPonte String Quartet dedication to educating their audiences with thoughtful and comprehensive notes for every performance, as well as personal introductions for each piece.  This "extra" does so much to bring an element of excitement to each concert.  The Quartet is also dedicated to bringing this wonderful music to children of all ages and also to the elderly in nursing homes who may not be able to come to the concerts in person.  I personally feel very privileged to know these wonderful people, and to volunteer my services to them.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	80695		/users/profile/88069	Marie S.	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	I have been listening to the DaPonte String Quartet for 20 years--which is as long as it has been a Quartet--and I continue t think  it  is wonderful! My husband and I moved to Maine from the New York area, where we were used to hearing all kinds of  extraordinary music, and we were amazed to find world class music in what seemed like a rural setting. We were also delighted by the intimacy of the settings; we loved the fact that the members of the Quartet became our friends. And we were impressed by the Quartet's generous outreach to the community--their free concerts in schools, for example, and in  retirement home, and their concerts to benefit the restoration of historic buildings. Over the years, their programs have grown in sophistication, and their playing in excellence. I find it hard to believe, but they just keep getting better and better!

The musicians bring passion, expertise, intellectual rigor, and  a lively sense of programming to their offerings, whether Beethoven, a contemporary work, or the lives of the Mendelssohns.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	73493		/users/profile/80320	newcellist	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	The DaPonte String Quartet makes dreams come true. Classical music,  chamber music,  especially string quartet music have long been very important to me as a listener. For more than fifty years I listened, but also wanted to learn to play the cello so that as an amateur musician I could too make such music. A busy professional career and retirement  to rural Maine made that dream seem out of reach until I discovered the presence in mid-coast Maine of  the DaPonte String Quartet. Suddenly, although far from cities with arrays of world class music,  I found here  an extraordinary group of exceptionally well-trained musicians that was intent on playing the world's finest string quartets at the highest level and to do so generously for multiple villages easily accessible to me, and to my amazement a member of the Quartet  agreed to take me, a senior citizen novice, as a student.. TheDaPonte String Quartet contributions to this area are many faceted: they play in formal concerts and take mini-performances to village and rural schools, hospitals, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities. Through benefit performances they support other non-profit organizations. Members of the Quartet teach students of their instruments, coach amateur chamber musicians, and even serve as conductor of student and amateur orchestras.   The DSQ always gives the highest quality performances. They are known for their impeccable intonation, well-grounded phrasing, and exquisite ensemble sound.  Their level of excellence is, of course, partly the result of their  great talents and training at top conservatories, but most of all it is due to their sustained intensity of rehearsal and deep attention to understanding the compositions and the composers.  Their pre-concert lectures open the way for deeper appreciation of the music and reveal the commitment these musicians give to every work they perform every time. The DSQ has an unusually broad repertoire and offers more than 30 performances over the course of the year in multiple venues in order to be accessible to audiences dispersed over  a wide geographic area.Recognizing the income limits of many who live in this area, the DSQ has kept concert ticket prices at a very modest level.   To sustain their generosity , however, they have had to make personal sacrifice in income and to divert precious time and energy to non-musical tasks. With more support from generous donors, corporate and grant support,   the musicians could do more of what they all yearn to do, namely enhance the advancement of their own artistic development for the benefit of all concerned . These extraordinary musicians deserve wider appreciation and support from those who understand how valuable such artistic endeavors are to our culture and wellbeing.

Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	72223		/users/profile/78968	Taftable	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2011	Even though I am a total non-musician, I thoroughly agree with "Musiclover" who wrote that there seems to be "a magical coalescing of the minds and skills of these four, [such that they create] a single extraordinary instrument, the DaPonteString Quartet".  I have had the pleasure of knowing two of the members -- off and on, since 1982 -- and it doesn't surprise me a bit that they have achieved what they have achieved -- as professionals and as simply wonderful warm human beings.  These latter traits come through in their superb pre-concert talks and at the receptions afterward.  I come from out-of-state but from the commentary I totally agree that residents of rural Maine are lucky to have these four extraordinary public-spirited  musicians/teachers in their midst.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	71898		/users/profile/78616	musiclover	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	Heard this quartet , and had a chance to get to know its musicianswhen they visited the West coast. Music: absolutely superlative. The musicians:  four extraordinary people. Impressive and delightful, in so many different ways. I wonder if the level of music they make comes a magical coalescing of the minds and skills of these four, so that they become a single extraordinary instrument, the DaPonteString Quartet.  It seems to me that this quartet could, if it wanted to, and with  appropriate management, take its rightful place in the much larger musical world. But it also seems that these four are dedicating their lives to providingun-canned music and string-instrument education to the adultsand children of Maine.  Other parts of our country should be so lucky.    
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	71769		/users/profile/78476	Scribe	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	My wife and I have attended performances by the DaPonte String Quartet for a number of years and in all the venues in which they have performed, and we have been delighted with their musicianship and their skill in playing the music they have chosen. We have seen personnel changes over time, but the group keeps getting better. We particularly like the way the two violinists, Ferdinand Liva and Lydia Forbes, trade places to avoid the trap of one of them always being the "first" violin. We are also partial to the comments on the piece the quartet is about to perform, especially when Myles Jordan speaks: he has a profound sense of humor. Inspired by these comments, we have made a point of trying to attend the discussions an hour prior to each concert. What I have not said in this "review" is that all four members of the quartet are outstanding musicians and that their performances are absolutely superb. As elderlies with long experience in concert-going, we have heard many performances of much of the music the DaPonte chooses to perform, and we are always absolutely delighted with their readings, their interpretation, and their ability to come together as an ensemble to create a superb performance.

I have followed her career from her illustrious time with the Santa Barbara Orchestra and Santa Barbara Symphony to her time now with the DaPonte String Quartet.  To say she is a first class Chamber musician is an understatement.  She is a solid professional, respected by her peers.  To do what she has done, and bring such vital music to Maine is heroic.

They do so much for young budding musicians both in offering lessons and activities, but also by inspiring them with their deeply moving performances. They also offer free concerts for the community from time to time. Classical music is alive and well in our community. They play truly as one instrument  just wringing out of the music the depth of feeling they bring to it.  I enthusiastically look forward to each concert.

Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	70230		/users/profile/76758	banakcello	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	It was in 1994 that I first heard the DaPonte Quartet.  I was bowled over with the quality of their playing.  Subsequently we had them as coaches at our chamber music workshops.  Many of their performances stand out in my mind as exemplars of what string quartet playing should be.  Their intonation is as good as I can imagine possible.  They, unlike many quartets, utilize a very wide dynamic range.  That adds life to the music. At our workshops we had the pleasure of hearing them rehearse.  The quality of their playing doesn't just come from inspiration and talent.  There is a great deal of hard work to attain the level of perfection that they achieve. Alas, it has been a while since I have heard them, but I consider them to be an epitome of quartet playing.
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	70215		/users/profile/76741	mathomas832	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	I first heard the DaPonte string quartet play almost 20 years ago in Philadelphia.  The most impressive features of their playing are the impeccable intonation, and the extreme wide range of dynamics.  I have never heard a quartet that has such wonderful contrast in dynamics.  The most memorable performance of the quartet that I heard was when they played  Beethovan op. 18 no. 1, particularly the second movement.  The violin starts softly and then crescendos.  I had to lean forward to hear, and then wasn't sure if I was actually hearing the instrument in real time, or if I was just creating it out of memory.  The whole movement was played at the level of piano/pianissimo that was astounding.  I still get chills thinking of that superb performance.

Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	70073		/users/profile/76587	Helen P.	Client Served	5	02/17/2011	I have enjoyed many of the DaPonte String Quartet's summer concerts; each of them impressed me with the excellence of the performance and the warm professionalism of the performers.  After several years of enjoying multiple performances each summer (when I visit the area), I've yet to hear the same piece twice.  The DaPonte perpetually push and expand their repertoire, regularly inviting other wonderful artists to perform with them in dazzling quintets.   But they don't stop at lovely summer performances during the most attractive season in Maine (when the tourists and their purses bound) -- they continue these performances year round, bringing glorious music to the year round residents.The DaPonte provides world class musical performances to an audience that might otherwise never get to hear music performed at that level.  In addition to their work as performers, the DaPonte work tirelessly to bring music to young students, performing and doing workshops in schools. The members also promote music education in the area by teaching private students.  The DaPonte Quartet is made up of four truly amazing musicians.  As such, their strong suit is not scheduling and planning, but learning, teaching, growing and performing.  And thus, it is imperative that they have enough money to afford to hire a talented regular manager.

The accolades were warranted.   The Daponte plays to enthusiastic if small audiences in the small towns of Newcastle, Walpole, South Bristol as well as in Brunswick and Portland.   They bring a level of musicianship and musical pleasure unusual in rural America.  Each concert also contains explanations of the work and social gatherings to meet the musicians.  Thus the Daponte have really anchored themselves in the community.Receipts from ticket sales are no where nearly adequate to support musicians and their families.   The members of the quartet take on teaching assignments and private tutoring to make ends meet.   Yet, they find time to offer their services, free of charge, to help raise funds and awareness for earthquake and cholera victims in Haiti.  As a member of the board of Konbit Sante, the Maine based NGO which will benefit from their offer of help for Haiti, I strongly recommend the Daponte to receive a grant.

In addition to bringing world-class performances to mid-coast Maine  where there are no other serious musical opportunities, they are regularly  in schools, rest homes and with veterans' groups, in pursuit of theeir mission to expand the reach of music.  My particular  admiration for them is that they also teach--even those of us who come much too late in life to hope for real success, but who have always dreamt of playing. 
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	69962		/users/profile/76467	invinoveritas1	General Member of the Public	4	02/17/2011	I feel strongly that the DaPonte Quartet deserves support.  The musicians carefully chose well balnaced programs including "old chestnuts" as well as relatively unknown new compositions. Each concert is exemplefied by their expert musicianship and total focus on making good music.  Does applause really measure their success or that of any other performing group - I think not, in the final analysis.  Most people applaud politely - what is more important, I feel, is that to scan the faces of the audience during and after the concert, one sees a sea of smiles - happy faces -made so by the intensity and sheer personal delight with which they play. Most of the arts and even some of the professions participate because it is their "calling," not unlike a minister feels the need, nay "calling" to serve.  And so it is with musicians who certainly do not get rich, unless, oof course, they are world famous soloists.  Rather, most musicians have to scramble to keep their families housed and fed, yet they continue to feel that it is their "calling" and share their music with us. DaPonte meets our needs in this time of worldwide strife to bring us, if only for the duration of their performance, to a better place - one of peace and calmness - to a feeling of lightness,  less stressed  by their enlightened play. Let us give thanks and support them as best we can so that they will continue to provide us those brief periods of joy and peace. 
Friends of the Daponte String Quartet	69926		/users/profile/76429	PPAUL	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	The DaPonte String Quartet has been bringing high-quality classical music to communities all over the state of Maine for years. They perform in small venues, reach out to their audience by speaking before each piece, and are always available during intermission and after concerts to have personal contact with members of the audience. They perform outreach concerts in public schools throughout the state and provide workshops for interested amateur musicians. They could easily have made the choice to stay in a major East Coast cultural center and advance their personal careers. Instead, they opted courageously to commit to the state of Maine and its residents and to provide the greatest possible number of musical experiences to the broadest possible audience. Their concerts are always of the highest caliber, and their programming encompasses not only the standard string quartet literature but also works by new and emerging composers. They are cultural asset to the state and deserve to be supported to the fullest extent possible.

Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	121177	1	/users/profile/164881	klaf	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/21/2012	Ethel's Tree of Life has been a prominent part of my son's life for the past 3 years.  Originally, I thought it would be a great social outlet for him as he has autism and his social skills are at a much lower level than his peers...I was wrong!!!!  ETL is a group of peers  who support and learn with and from each other under the guidance of some spectacular volunteers and one incredibly dedicated lady.   The 8-week modules are broken down so that these students with disabilities can learn from the very basic to the finished product in genres such as food/nutrition, job search/career paths, as well as finding your way around a city and trying new things.  When these students get together, they smile more, communicate better, and become a participatory part of our society.
Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	110371		/users/profile/150250	Samantha15	Board Member	4	04/20/2012	Ive been on and off with Ethel's Tree of Life since 2009. I started with the summer work program because my daughter is disabled. It has opened my eyes to help me with my daughters disability and to help me be a better person. Ive enjoyed my time with Ethels Tree of Life and will continue to help out as much as I can. ETL is a great cause and Linda(the director) works well with the children bringing them to learn life skills to help them transition into adult life. I just hope that when my daughter comes of age that she too can become an ETL student.

It has been my privledge to watch Linda Higgins (founder) provide need opportunities of life experiences for disABLED adolescents and young adults. As a parent of an adult child with CP I know from experience that after school the programs for people with disabilities dwindles to almost non existence. This is a much needed program that offers wonderful practical life experiences for young people who would otherwise not be given this opportunity.

Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	55691		/users/profile/57907	Sarah M.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2010	I found out about Ethel's Tree of Life from my employer and she recommended I take my consumer for Friday activities. I saw a lot of changes in him as he started to branch out with others and he was always smiling. Before we left for his first activity, he was hesitant (very much so) and I think he had it in his mind that he would not going to enjoy it, after that afternoon, he looked forward to coming back each Friday. Linda is fantastic and I cannot say enough good about her. She is very aware of the specific needs of each youth involved in the program, sets realistic expectations and goals, and is always looking to make the experience as educational and enjoyable as possible. Not only did I see my consumer build friendships, but I found myself doing the same with other support staff and volunteers. I am always looking for ways to spread the word about this wonderful organization.

She ahs been on a train ride and couldn't stop talking about her day. She has learned to overcome most valid fears. Linda has done such a great job with all of youth in the years she has given her life and time to.
Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	55562		/users/profile/57760	PortsAdultEd	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/27/2010	ETL has proved to be an excellent resource for youth with special needs.  I have found the director, Linda Higgins, to be willing to collaborate on individual cases and to be willing to provide services that support youth who, despite an obvious need for support in developing occupational and independent living skills, are typically unable to access intensive case management and employment support services provided by public entities because their disabilities are deemed too mild to require such services.  ETL is a valuable resource forSeacoast youth who are working to develop independent living skills and overcome barriers to employment.    
Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	55522		/users/profile/57695	lindseym	Volunteer	5	10/27/2010	Ethel's tree of Life is a great organization that supports youth and young adults living with various disabilities. Students are able to explore different places such as Boston or New York and learn independent living skills at the same time. ETL offer a support group for youth to discuss their issues they are dealing with in a Sanford group. ETL was blessed with the opportunity to have two Americorps members volunteer their time to work with high school students with disabilities. Team Leadership and Career Corps was the program that allowed volunteers to integrate transitional skills for adult life while using the world around them to find their way in life. 
Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	55510		/users/profile/57678	Linda H.	Board Member	5	10/27/2010	Ethel's Tree of Life students achieve amazing things!  One achievement might be going on a trip for the very first time without a family member or support person, another might be being brave enough to take the train into Boston alone for the first time.  Other achievements might include becoming aware of opportunities to give of oneself in one's community, understanding life long learning opportunities, and, how to build on one's abilities.  Developing an "I Can" attitude may be the biggest achievement of all!

Ethels Tree Of Life Inc	53311		/users/profile/54402	rexs-mom	Client Served	5	09/24/2010	My teeneage son, who has autism, was in dire need of services to help him with social skills, independent living skills, and all the other skills that his typical peers were developing. In this past year, he has been involved in several different programs offered through Ethel's Tree of Life. As a member of "Choose to be Healthy", he learned to make better choices about how to spend his free time, healthier choices about the foods he eats, and to have a new appreciation of his own unique personality. His experience with "Job Club" helped him learn all about what it means to find and hold a job, from identifying his own skills, to communicating these skills to a potential employer, even experiencing what an interview is like through role playing. Throughout all this wonderful support he was also developing friendships, having joined a wonderful group where each person's gifts are nurtured and celebrated. I can't say enough about how fortunate we have been to find ETL!

These skills are learned more willingly in a setting without  the usual caregiver always there.  Also the time slot of two and a half hrs. gives me time to accomplish something  while I know my daughter's best interest and needs are being met.  I also do what I am able to help E.T.L. with the funding piece, and this is not so easy, as Exeter group is only one year old in our community.

By the end of her lesson, she was beaming with pride in her new skill.I also worked in the youth employment program the summer of 2009 and saw students living with significant disabilites gain skills and confidence as the program progressed.  Several came out of their shells, as they learned new skills both in independent living and in employment skills.  The Job Club, run this spring and summer by volunteers offered similar opportunities to more students.  It's great to see these young people build their confidence as they build their skills!

They sold her a phone charger for this powerful tablet and when it didn't work, told her the computer was junk and would she like to leave it with them and they would credit the $10 they overcharged her, in my opinion,  for the charger and would get her a Kindle for $100.  They never looked at the notebook or gave it to their repairman for a look over.  She sent the notebook to me.  I'm in SC and within a day determined it needed a new rapid charger that would work with that particular notebook.  If they knew anything about notebooks and tablets, they would know they draw more amps and a simple phone charger and cord, just won't work.  They could have at least let the repair person look at it.  I wouldn't take a broken child's toy there for new batteries.  What amazes me the most is that they offered to recycle it for her!  Good scam you got going there.  This can be posted in other places like the BBB.  Very unprofessional! VERY. Watch out if they tell you it's internally shot. Get a second opinion!

Representing Silent Sidekicks has been a rewarding experience for my pup & myself; she knows she's 'on duty' and ready to visit when her vest goes on!

Silent Sidekicks	310168		/users/profile/401526	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2016	As a volunteer, Silent Sidekicks is a great organization to work with. Despite being all over the state of Maine and Canada, they understand volunteers' needs by allowing them to serve in their own communities while being part of the organization. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who'd like to volunteer.

I am equally impressed with her efforts to recruit other volunteers and their animals into this wonderful service.  There is nothing quite like the feeling of being able to reach out and touch these animals.  The comfort and relaxation that these animals can provide is priceless.  One resident was even able to over come her anxiety of dogs with Morgan's help.  I can't say enough wonderful about the entire program, Danielle and Morgan.

Summer Camp Inc	82987		/users/profile/91795	jamie112	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	The Summer Camp exceeds any expectations its generic name may suggest. It's more than any camp I ever attended or worked at in my 22 years before I joined the staff there last summer. The Summer Camp brings girls from cities and rural areas around New England. It's fun, it's free, it's a sanctuary for these girls, many whom have had to face more adversity in their childhoods than many will for their entire lives. For 10 days each year, girls aged as young as 5 and as old as 18 come to the little camp in Bridgton, Maine for one of 5 sessions. They come on scholarships and many have never left the cities from which they arrive. They come from poverty, they come from group homes, they come from foster homes, they come from abuse, disorders, and though they might not be totally aware of it at such a young age, they come to The Summer Camp to overcome all of this.  The Summer Camp is small, only 8 cabins, but while the girls are there, camp becomes an extended family, and certainly one more stable and loving than the homes situations many are used to. It gives these girls a breath of fresh air, a chance to explore not only the outdoors, but to explore themselves and build their own community. It's an amazing place that allows these girls to realize there is more around them than the circumstances they were born into and it gives them a chance to build something that is truly their own.  We play games, we swim, dance...we go on camp out, we sing, make s'mores... Last summer I worked in the library and began maybe a career in literacy building and youth empowerment through creative writing. When they arrived at the library, many were less than thrilled to be in such an academic setting at camp, but I tried my hardest to help them see that writing can set them free. We made journals and did creative fiction and nonfiction prompts. They all took books back to their cabin and it was fun for me to help them select titles that I had had at my disposal but they had never heard of. It was eyeopening for me to hear what they wrote, to see how sharing helped them feel good about themselves and the trusting relationships I was able to form with them in the matter of a few days. I have never worked in such a rewarding environment, and I've been working with kids since I was still one myself (age 13).   The Summer Camp is magical for many reasons. But I think what sets this place apart from any other camp I have encountered is that it isn't just a camp. It's a home. No matter who jumps off that bus, no matter where they've been, what baggage they bring with them, there is something for them to discover, to work on, to take home with them. As a counselor, I think I learned and loved camp just as much as the campers. 
Summer Camp Inc	82939		/users/profile/91722	peggy	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	The Summer Camp provides girls from very poor and foster families with an opportunity to attend a sleep away camp in Maine.  For 10 days our campers are swimming in lakes, hiking, laughing and being told that they can succeed.  Many of our campers return summer after summer and will attest that their lives have been changed by the summer camp.
Summer Camp Inc	82793		/users/profile/20509	nmnyc	Board Member	5	03/22/2011	The Summer Camp staff continues to impress me with their dedication to creating a community where campers can grow and learn while feeling safe and challenged. Many girls arrive at The Summer Camp with lots of anxiety and anger. Slowly they learn to trust the staff and then they start to have fun. Each year they arrive back at camp with more excitement and less fear. And then we hear that they have decided to go to college and want to return to The Summer Camp as a counselor so they can give  back a little bit of what they were given at The Summer Camp. 
Summer Camp Inc	42499	11	/users/profile/43202	jbeezy1913	Former staff	4	06/01/2010	Tell your story here and help others understand this charityGood Ol, TSC. This camp is like no other. I truly enjoy it because it targets youth in low income and troubled areas. Everyday youth such as ours are always bagged down with issues and not just the teenagers, the younger ones too. TSC gives these girls an oppertunity just be themselves; to actually kick back and enjoy being a child. Most girls come to TSC not even having set at a table for meals and discussed how they day were, or some celebrate a birthday. It's little things like that that make me continue to travel ALLLLL The back to "The Great State of Maine" :) to enjoy these special moments.Yours Truly, JB

Summer Camp Inc	42290	9	/users/profile/43009	jessy1	Donor	5	05/31/2010	The Summer Camp is truly AMAZING!! I began working for TSC while attending college. It was simply a job to help pay the bills until I could get a 'real' job after graduating. Well, eight years later, I have graduated college with a degree in business, yet remain at TSC!! The Summer Camp is more than just a paycheck for me. It is a place where lives are transformed, campers and staff alike. As a child, I grew up in an unstable environment. Like many others, my parents divorced after years of arguing. I was tormented by the memories of my father physically and emotionally abusing my mother. Moving from place to place and never seeing my father, my self-esteem plummeted and wasn't on the mend until my early twenties. My childhood is much like the childhood of The Summer Campers. The Summer Camp is a place that I wish I had found as a young girl. A place to belong, a place to feel loved and accepted regardless of what life back home was like.
Summer Camp Inc	42047	10	/users/profile/42799	chelseas	Former Volunteer	5	05/30/2010	There really is nothing like The Summer Camp - you almost have to see it for yourself to fully appreciate the impact it has on campers; it's even harder to believe the impact that it has on its staff. Despite the sometimes serious nature of their circumstances, the women and girls of The Summer Camp are full of joy. The real essence of TSC is a place of summertime fun - late afternoon splashing in the lake, a 4th of July barbecue, the thunk of tennis balls across the court. Of equal importance is that The Summer Camp has really established a tradition of long-term support for its staff and campers. Previous reviews have mentioned relationships with the camps that span years and years - an impressive feat for an organization just coming on its 25th anniversary.For these reasons and more, The Summer Camp will always have a place in my heart.
Summer Camp Inc	41951	9	/users/profile/42718	legsofgold	Former staff	5	05/30/2010	I feel that The Summer Camp has empowered alot of the girls that use their services. I worked at the Summer Camp for 10 years. I have seen many of these young ladies go off to college and excel in life, If it wasn"t for them going to The Summer Camp some of them would have not dreammed they would go to college or anything else. The summer camp has help me as well as the girls learn many things that we can use in out day to day living. This camp is different than all the rest. I just want them to keep up the good job and conitue to touch these girls lives as they have done in the past
Summer Camp Inc	41800	7	/users/profile/42588	jentsc	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	I was 18 when I spent my first summer at The Summer Camp, Inc. as a life guard and camp counselor, and 7 years later I can say with absolute certainty that working there was the singular most formative experience of my late teens and early twenties. Having worked with other camps as well as other social service organizations I can now understand the unique and transformative nature of a place like this which changes the lives of its staff as well as the girls that it serves. TSC gives girls coming from what are often difficult home situations the opportunity to just be kids surrounded by positive young women who genuinely enjoy their jobs and want to see them succeed. Tracy and Dawn are the greatest supervisors that I have ever worked for and their leadership really gives the camp an encouraging home-like environment.
Summer Camp Inc	41751	8	/users/profile/42539	keri2	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	I worked for this organization for two years and found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences to date.  I met so many wonderful people inspired to make the lives of so many beautiful, talented, and loving girls a better one.  The Summer Camp provides a safe and structured environment, affording many girls with an opportunity they otherwise would likely not have received.  I've also had the opportunity to keep in touch with a few of my former campers and have seen them grow into amazing young women.
Summer Camp Inc	41741	10	/users/profile/42527	gia1	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	Working at TSC last summer was the most fun I have ever had. This is a place where children are given a safe space to explore and enjoy themselves. The staff is extremely dedicated and amazing at what they do. The campers loved being at TSC, and they were some of the most fun kids I have ever spent time with.
Summer Camp Inc	41732	6	/users/profile/42521	astongemay	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	I've been associated with The Summer Camp for over 10 years now and I can say honestly that the profound effect that the great people at this camp have on the girls who attend is nothing short of extraordinary. I need only to point to the high retention rate of campers and counselors alike to show you that the directors and staff all provide a nurturing and fun environment for all of the girls who attend.
Summer Camp Inc	41720	7	/users/profile/42512	isabel-hirsch	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	The Summer Camp is an organization that truly puts the people they serve first, namely the campers ages 6-16 that come for 10 days each summer.  The camp allows these girls to have a good time, be kids, participate in a variety of different activities, make friends, and grow as people socially and emotionally.  Also, I have never worked with such a caring group of counselors and directors.
Summer Camp Inc	41711	8	/users/profile/42501	ladydijah	Former staff	5	05/29/2010	My mother's social work company, CASA, got me started when I was 12yo. It was one of the best experiences of my life! I got to do things that I never would have done as a young new yorker. Hiking, Canoe, and Archery were and still are my favorite things to do. This camp introduced me to my love of photography. I am the type of person that falls in love with many things, and this camp has made this all the more possible. I love kids. This camp gave me the leadership skills I needed to positively influence other girls. I can still remember some of the girls by name that have personally influenced me as a person. I wish I could go every year. Since I have started going to TSC in 1999, my mother has brought over 20 girls to this camp, including my younger sister. When I get older I want to send my kids there. My favorite place is sitting on the dock watching the sunset over Washington Pond.
Summer Camp Inc	41655	8	/users/profile/42452	itskatieo	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	The Summer Camp is by far the most rewarding job I have ever had the pleasure of working and a place I hold very dear to my heart. It is a place I speak often about and very highly of because I have met some of the most incredible woman and children during the three years I have worked there. When I first arrived at TSC I was completely unsure of what to expect, but after leaving there my first summer I knew it was another place I could call home. I have made life-long friends there and had the privilege of watching my campers grow a little more with each year I came back. It is evident that you have made an impact on a child's life when they are running off the bus, screaming your name, and eager to greet you with a hug. I find this remarkable due to the fact that the girls are only at camp for 10 days at a time - it truly is a rewarding feeling to know how they remembered you and couldn't wait to see you. The Summer Camp really is a place for girls and women alike to break out of their shells, try new things, and experience different ways of life. It's a place to feel safe and supported and allows each girl there to feel like they can do anything. The Summer Camp truly is my home away from home and I know the children who return each year feel the same way.
Summer Camp Inc	41606	8	/users/profile/42412	alexis1	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	I started going to this camp when I was 9 and continued til I was 17. I highly enjoyed the time I was a camper. Everyone was so great and deeply cared about the campers. I then was a Staff member for 1 year. I loved being a counselor. The counselors are so much fun, so friendly, and easy to work with. There are so many good things to say about the camp that I can't express it in words. I love the camp with all of my heart.
Summer Camp Inc	41596	8	/users/profile/42404	rachel13	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	I worked for The Summer Camp for three summers, and I have to say that I have never found a "work" environment where I felt more at home. This camp helped to reinforce the reasons I want to be a teacher, why I want to work with children. I loved my time at camp, and look forward to being able to come back to visit and maybe to work again.
Summer Camp Inc	41586	8	/users/profile/42394	jerien	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	The Summer Camp is am extraordinary place, where for ten days the girls that come to the camp get to just be little girls.  Many of the young girls that attend the Summer Camp have experienced traumatizing events that many of us couldn't even imagine.  For the ten days they get to spend in the woods, on the pond, and exploring Maine on day trips, they get to forget about their daily realities.  At the Summer Camp, the girls get to meet other young campers who many have experienced the same traumas, and they also get to interact with older counselors who in many ways can act as mentors.  This camp is an amazing experience, not just for the campers, but also for everyone involved.  I personally, was inspired by the strength and courage of these young girls who have been through so much.  At camp they get to enjoy activities and environments their familial and economic situations don't allow for them.  The Summer Camp is a wonderful place where young girls get to express themselves and experience things they don't normally get the chance to.  I would definitely recommend the Summer Camp not just as an amazing place to work for the summer, but also for any young girls.
Summer Camp Inc	41581	8	/users/profile/42391	awogaman07	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	The Summer Camp is one of the most amazing places in the world. I have had the honor of working at the camp for two summers and I plan to make it three. I truely enjoy the work that I do there because I really feel like I am making a difference in the lives of the young ladies that I have had the oppurtunity to meet and be-friend.I believe that Summer Camps are a source of invaluable education. There are things children just simply don't/can't learn in school. There are also things you simply dont learn in under your parents supervision. Summer Camps are a place for children to have adventures while still under the supervision of trained adults. So I feel like The Summer Camp provides those valuable learning experiences to girls who would otherwize not have the oppurtunity to grow through that adventure. These girls especially need that. I dont believe that only privledged children should have the oppurtunities provided by attending camp (which are typically pretty expensive). That said,The Summer Camp provides a comprehensive camp experience to girls who deserve and need time to have adventures, meet strong female rolemodels, have three square meals, meet other children, and HAVE FUN! I really feel that this camp experience can have a powerful effect on a child's school and home life. For example, because I worked with the older campers in the "leadership program" This program involves community service on camp and off. I really have seen the girls take so much pride in what they are doing, especially since all are returning campers and have a really special connection to the camp. I will never forget seeing one camper who I had worked with the previous summer (before she was a "leadership girl") and was a real.... dramatic indivdual. She often misbehaved and caused some trouble in the group. This one day in particular, towards the end of the leadership's session, two younger girls were bickering really badly. I watched (carefully) as the older camper approached them, thinking she was in to cause more trouble. She was so calm and level headed. She completely surpised me. She let both of them speak, and they had a lot of respect for her and they listened to what she had to say about the situation. Eventually she worked with them to give each other a hug. It was so amazing. It reminded me that I was really doing the right thing by working at the camp. That these girls are the future leaders of the world.
Summer Camp Inc	41578	8	/users/profile/42388	dylan5	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	I worked one Summer in the kitchen at The Summer Camp I was amazed to learn some of the inner city kids had never been swimming at  the ocean or  a  Lake   Just hearing   the kids scream with excitement and Joy  was priceless Kids having the Chance to " Be Kids " in  a safe place and learn some thing says it all
Summer Camp Inc	41555	9	/users/profile/42367	megan10	Former staff	5	05/28/2010	From the moment I first arrived at TSC I knew that this camp was different- The Summer Camp goes above and beyond other camps and truly helps the girls to empower themselves and one another. I learned so much about the importance of listening to children and how to truly provide someone with leadership skills while working at TSC. I have taken so much from my short summer at TSC and know that it was my summer in Maine that has helped as I start my own nonprofit for education and empowerment of women affected by domestic abuse. I LOVE THE SUMMER CAMP!
Summer Camp Inc	40946	6	/users/profile/41833	keynews31	Former staff	4	05/27/2010	As a former counselor at The Summer Camp, let me just say that whenever I think about working at a camp, I always revert back to my time at TSC.From the counselor training sessions, to the readying of the cabins for the campers, to bus rides from NYC with the girls, to the rigorous yet exhilarating and most memorable camp sessions.It was a joy and privelege to work at TSC. It may not have been one of the wealthier camps financially, but it was the wealthiest at heart.I went home know that I touched the life of a little girl who came to camp withdrawn, but went home with hope.Or another girl who was selfconscious, but when home conscious that she mattered.I went home knowing the staff and myself, although EXHAUSTED AT THE END OF THE SUMMER, would turn around and do it again!!!Almost 10 years later, I want to say thank you Tracy St. Onge for affording me the opportunity to make a difference in those little girls lives, and forever be changed myself!!!
Summer Camp Inc	40432	6	/users/profile/41348	ethan1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/25/2010	I am honored to continue working with staff at The Summer Camp, as they fulfill their mission to provide a meaningful camp experience to needy girls.  The diverse, passionate, and dedicated staff take on a more challenges in a week than many of us do in a year, changing lives every summer.  As a doctor and chil psychologist, I only wish there was more than one of them so that more people could be reached.

I am so thankful she had the opportunity to attend the Summer Camp!  It was probaly the best experience of her life!
Summer Camp Inc	38803	2	/users/profile/39709	chloe1	Former staff	5	05/13/2010	I loved my time at The Summer Camp! I only worked there for one summer, but I wish I had learned about it a few years earlier, so I could have spent my summers during college there.The experience was overwhelming at times, but ultimately rewarding and fun! A session at TSC is such a great gift for the campers, many of whom aren't familiar with life outside a city. TSC also provides some much needed continuity to the lives of foster kids who are bounced around from house to house.
Summer Camp Inc	37991	6	/users/profile/38786	latoya1	Former staff	5	05/05/2010	The Summer Camp offers such great experiences for these young ladies, who, may never have gotten the chance to be campers and participate in
Summer Camp Inc	37920	8	/users/profile/38696	summerwatkins	Former staff	5	05/04/2010	I have worked at The Summer Camp for the last two years and plan on going back this summer. This has been one of the best experiences of my life, and has led me to seeking a career in the field.  The girls provide you with challenges, but the support and love that encompasses the camp exceeds any amount of hardship.  The rewards are great, and it truly does change the lives of young girls. The women who choose to work here are all extraordinary women with huge hearts, and they have become my other family.  I wish every young woman in the world could attend this camp!
Go! Malawi	88292		/users/profile/99245	megflynnie	Donor	5	05/02/2011	I have been in awe of the amount of time and passion that drives the founders and members of this incredible organization. Always the children and people of Malawi are put first. The desire to educate and provide healthcare, and most of all, to empower the most vulnerable, is a fresh, selfless approach to a not-for-profit. I have heard about the truly life changing experiences students (both young and old) have when they go on a trip. This is an amazing organization.
Go! Malawi	88168		/users/profile/99058	HelpLittleFieldHome	Volunteer	5	04/30/2011	I met Janet Littlefield six years ago when she was a teacher in Hebron, Maine. Even then she was an inspiration to everyone that met her. At the time she was supporting a few orphans in Malawi, Africa by sending part of her pay checks to help feed and put the children through school. She has since given up her teaching job so she could dedicate her life to helping more than 70 children in dire need of assistance. The Friends of Littelfield Home is located in the Mpamila area of Malawi. The goal of Friends of Littlefield Home is to reduce the factors that lead to poverty while helping the community to become self sufficient. There are 65 local orphans that are all provided with school tuition, school uniforms, school supplies, food, and food supplements for those that need them. Currently, all of the local orphans are housed at Friends of Littlefield Home but in the future, hopefully by the end of 2012 if enough money is raised, the home plans on building houses for the impoverished elderly in the area, as well as a house for 15 orphans from another area of Malawi. These 15 orphans are also provided the basic amenities that the children from Mpamila receive although they are not yet housed in the same village. The home provides a pre-school program to prepare the younger children for primary school as well as an after school tutoring program available to all the homes students.  The Friends of Littlefield Home provides transportation to and from hospitals to help those in the surrounding area with HIV/AIDS care and awareness. Janet has brought more than 150 friends to Malawi both to teach them about life in a third world country and also for the visitors to help teach the village. Everyone that goes to Malawi runs different workshops to help teach AIDS awareness, nutrition awareness, reading, health, hygiene, rainforest conservation, and much more. The home also employs patrolmen for the local forests to help prevent poaching, and illegal deforestation.  All of these services are provided through the money that Janet is able to raise, with the help of many that have visited Friends of Littlefield Home. All sorts of charity events are held every year from silent auctions to marathons in Death Valley with all proceeds going directly towards helping these children. Those that take a trip to Friends of Littlefield Home come back with a more open heart and a better understanding and appreciation for human life in general. What is being done at Friends of Littlefield Home is truly changing the lives of countless people. It is the hope that the children educated through the home will be better able to continue on to provide even better lives for their children and teach them to do the same for their children. It is a cycle that must go on and with the continuing help and care of people like Janet Littlefield, it is sure to. This organization needs all the help it can get! Please check out http://www.littlefieldhome.org/ if you would like to learn more or are interested in providing assistance to the children!
Go! Malawi	87805		/users/profile/98581	cemunro	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	The experience I had volunteering at the Littlefield Home in Malawi Africa was like nothing else I have ever done.  The village is so hospitable and appreciative of us being there.  The kids are beautiful and loving as well.  I learned so much while being there.  My love for helping others was enhanced after that trip. This home for kids is making a difference, not only for the kids but it is changing the village.  Helping to make this village sustainable by themselves is definatley a potential and this organization is on the way of doing that.  I can't wait to return someday!
Go! Malawi	87207		/users/profile/97829	Ktcoyne	Volunteer	5	04/26/2011	Littlefield Home is a wonderful organization. My experience volunteering with their organization was remarkable. The influence the volunteers and organization had on the children and community as a whole was life changing. 
Go! Malawi	87155		/users/profile/97760	andrew	Donor	5	04/26/2011	      I started running a couple years ago and joined  Team Littlefield. We are a group of runners that raise money for the orphanage, by putting on road races and get donors to sponser us in different races around.      Last year 14 of us raised over $1800.00 each through many ways and as a team. Then went to New Orleans and ran a half, and some of us a full marathon. I believe we almost fed 80 orphans for a year with the amount of money we raised.      Our goal this year has been to raise $40,000.00 as a team and I believe we are going to make it. Myself again and another large group will be embarking to Nashville this week to support team littlefield in yet another half and full marathon.     Janet Littlefield and her husband Bill are  wonderful people and have the children in Malawi in there best interest. They very much care, teach,feed, and love  these wonderful kids as if they were there own.     My support will be never ending, in many different ways, for this organization and the wonderful people involved.  
Go! Malawi	86563		/users/profile/96951	asway	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	Last year I knew I wanted to go to Africa to work at an orphanage.  After researching online and finding so many huge nonprofits advertising travel programs that would only send me information after sending in a deposit, I was nervous about the idea and my parents even more so.  I knew I wanted to go, but I wasn't ready to go with an impersonal online program.  Then I met Janet and learned about Friends of Little Field Home.  She was extremely helpful about the travel process and even more passionate about her goals in Malawi.  She made traveling to Malawi so comfortable.  I had an amazing time on the trip (June 2010).  I felt like I actually go to know the real Malawi, not just the tourist side of it like so many other travel programs offer.  The kids were some of the most amazing children I have ever worked with.  I always felt safe in the country- Malawi really is the "kind heart of Africa". I wouldn't trade the trip for anything.  I returned in January 2011 and began to see the new projects that are taking place.  Volunteering with LFH is really the best experience you could ask for in a nonprofit trip.  FLFH is such a passionate and inspiring organization run by some of the most caring people I have met.  
Go! Malawi	86538		/users/profile/96792	nkhalamba	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	I volunteered with Friends of Littlefield at their orphanage in Malawi where they do amazing job in providing underprivileged orphans with housing, clothes, and emotional support.  The home provides the children with necessary school supplies.  Also, the home sponsors high school level orphans by providing them with tuition fees which is a major contributing factor to high school dropouts among the underprivileged.  Also, the home helps in improving the health conditions of the Malawian rural communities through Sexually transmitted Diseases (STDs) awareness campaigns.  Currently, the home is also working on providing the community they are serving with micro-loans to boost the community's economy.
Go! Malawi	86464		/users/profile/96795	mking	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	Little Field Home is a light to the community in this part of Malawi.  It provides medical care as well as food and shelter and education to orphaned children.  Volunteers come not only to teach but to attend to the emotional needs of the children.  It is easy to fall in love!
Go! Malawi	86462		/users/profile/96793	Andy C.	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	The summer of my Junior year in high school was when I traveled to Malawi, Africa.  I was blown away, shocked, and thrilled.  Arriving at the orphanage was a feeling that can only be expressed by actually being there.  The orphans had no cell phones, lap tops, or even more than a few shirts to call their own.  What they did have was clean water, a roof over their head, and hot meals.  For them, this was enough, and that is what truly surprised me- having so little yet being so happy.  Always thinking of Malawi, I often wonder why more people can't realize that material objects aren't important, and that it is friendship and love that really add to happiness.  Please help maintain this happiness within these orphans by contributing to The Little Field Home so that the meals, clothes, and water do not come to an end.  You'll be surprised by how much even a little of your time can help.  
Go! Malawi	86434		/users/profile/96751	Janet	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	I founded this organization 7 years ago and this cause has become my passion, my drive, my life! We work incredibly hard collaboratively with the Malawians to come up with African solutions for the root causes of poverty.  We want our work to be sustainable, and Malawian run and we are adapting constantly to the changes and needs to help solve problems in rural Malawi. We are working on prevention and reducing the factors that lead to extreme poverty. This focus has led us to develop programs in education (from early childhood to secondary school and college), health care (from transportation to the hospital to outreach and awareness about common illnesses), micro-finance (loans for cooperatives and women to allow families to have economic independence and earn an income), forest conservation (protection of one of the last remaining rainforests in sub-sahara Africa, and HIV/AIDS awareness. We all very much want to make a difference! 
Go! Malawi	86423		/users/profile/96740	Patrick S.	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I met Janet and Bill this past year at Hebron Academy and slowly found out about the organization Janet had started over 5 years ago to help vulnerable children and their families in Malawi, Africa.  I listened to fellow colleagues and current students tell their stories of what they experienced in Malawi and how much of an impact they had on the local community.  I was convinced almost immediately that I wanted to travel there in the summer to help in the Ntchisi village with the FLFH new projects.  I was considering entering the Peace Coprs after college but it was difficult to leave my position as a boarding school teacher and coach.  Currently, I have been raising money with Team Little Field over the past few months while training for a marathon.  I was shocked to see how many friends and family wanted to help donate or be a part of fundraisers once I told them what the FLFH has been doing over the past few years.  It is a great organization with great people helping many, many people live better lives.
Go! Malawi	86420		/users/profile/96737	Georgia	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	I am a board member and a donor who first learned about this nonprofit through an article in the newspaper.  I invited the founders to talk to my college class, which led to student projects designed to help the organization and student interest in joining the group in Malawi.  One student earned a prestigious fellowship from the college to go to Malawi and since that first student, others have followed.  They find the experience transformative.  The organization has been nimble and smart, making changes as needed to help Malawians to help themselves.

Go! Malawi	86369		/users/profile/96672	Carley P.	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I went to Malawi, Africa with the goal to teach children English, haul water, educate the community about HIV/AIDS and go on two unforgettable adventures to a Safari in Zambia and Lake Malawi. However, from the day that I arrived at The Little Field Home, the eighty some odd orphans taught me more than I ever thought I could learn. When I went to Malawi during three weeks of the summer of 2009, I went for the experience. I went to see what life was like under the poverty line, and to give back to a community. I also went to be selfless, to help those who needed it, and to improve the lives of others. Stepping foot in Chigamba Village was so much more than I had hoped for. The children have smiles from ear to ear despite their conditions, they are always willing to take a walk, to assist with doing laundry, help with hauling water and always interested in reading, writing and learning. When the tears were streaming down my face when I had to say good bye, I knew it would be a see-you-later. And that turned out to be accurate when I returned during the summer of 2010. These children became a part of my every day life to this day as their photographs take up the majority of my wall space, and their memories take over all those I had previously made from prior experiences.

Go! Malawi	86352		/users/profile/96652	Kate M.	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I traveled to the Little Field Home Orphanage for the month of July in 2009 which was the summer prior to my senior year in high school.  To this day, I still connect my everyday life to my experiences in Malawi.  The children at the Home are some of the most remarkable young people I have ever met.  Their enthusiasm and positivity towards learning is unmatched.  I have gained a perspective and appreciation for my own life.  I also realized the incredible impact people can have on each other through kindness, patience and understanding.  Malawians are in an tragic position when it comes to education and health care and the FLFH works hard and effectively to help improve the quality of life and opportunity for the orphans and community members.  The FLFH changed my life and changes lives every day in Malawi.

I went back in Summer 2008 for 3 weeks and then went back Summer 2010 and spent 2 months. I left the first summer knowing that I would always want to go back and do my part teaching English and continue to inform surrounding areas of HIV/AIDS. The people of Malawi are the nicest people in the world, after all it is the warm heart of Africa! These kids take everything they could possibly get from you. Every time they sit on your lap, get a hug or kiss, they embrace. They remember every moment spent with you and I learned that when I returned. Everyone remembered me.  The best thing about these kids is that they want to learn. They ask questions, and spend extra time for help. I hope to return to Malawi in the near future for a 3rd time and I know it will even be better than the last two.

I originally started off as a 6-month volunteer through an internship program at my school. Now, I am about to prepare for my second 6-month trip with this organization. Friends of Little Field Home has an incredible mission to help the small country of Malawi, Africa. They not only want to help by donating and funding projects, but the organization continues to become a part of the community by interacting with the locals in such a unique way. They allow their volunteers to fully submerge themselves in the rich culture of Malawi which, personally, gave me a first-hand experience into the Malawian way of life. During my time there, I lived like a Malawian; I hauled water on my head, cooked with firewood, and lived with the very basic necessities. It was the most rewarding experience I have ever had the privilege to be a part of. I was given a lot of creative responsibility allowing me to make my own lesson plans for the children and to use my own ideas for specific projects. This is something that was very exciting to me. I can wholeheartedly say that this organization is definitely something to rave about and will always be a part of my life.

The organization's goals have expanded from helping individual orphans in the local Malawian community to designing and implementing programs that will benefit the entire community by providing employment to the most poverty stricken areas.  In addition, Friends of Little Field Home helps to reduce the number of orphans through family planning and HIV awareness, as well as providing a solid education so that young girls build their self-confidence and will choose not to have children at a very young age.
Go! Malawi	86289		/users/profile/96552	Readeo	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I went in summer of 2008 with a friend to help start a medical clinic at the orphanage. What I found was incredible; after an ordeal to get there, we stepped out of our vehicle to find 60 beautiful children circling around us. With the sun setting over the horizon these children smiled, danced and sang these simple words; "we are happy, we are happy, we are happy today". I looked around and saw the faces of fellow volunteers and the founder, who I had never met. The common thread were tears. Raw emotion, love bleeding out, hope in the air. The weeks that followed transformed me from a volunteer to an advocate. With education and some support we give these children a chance at a productive life and the opportunity to step up and help themselves and their community.  My wife and I personally sponsor a family of seven; we invite you to join us in supporting Janet, Bill and the entire Little Field Home mission.

Go! Malawi	86284		/users/profile/96534	billjf549	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	I think our organization is unique in how we operate.  We have developed a collaborative program with not only our partner committee in M'Pamila, but also with other community committees to ensure our programs are being run properly and that they are effective.  This system has allowed a greater amount of  people from the community to be involved in program development, and program assessment.  While we do have direct oversight from our Organization for all of our programs, it is very important to us to have our programs being run and evaluated by the community members who are most impacted by the programs.   The only way in which this system works is if there is a strong communication line between all the committees, and with our organization.  We feel lucky that this type of communication exists.

Not only do you get the opportunity to see the animals you love on a Safari in Zambia and visit the beautiful Lake Malawi you get to immerse yourself in a culture completely out of your comfort zone.  You are able to challenge yourself and grow as a person.  My experience with Little Field Home is one that will change my life and the way I view things forever.  For 3 days you live with a family in the village living the way they live.  The rest of the time is spent living with other volunteers and everyday waking up to love orphaned children, teaching and educating in order to help them see opportunities in their future.  Don't miss such an amazing opportunity for yourself.  
Aid For Kids	317057		/users/profile/408244	Anan	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	I volunteered for Aid for Kids H2H Program and really loved this kind of activities, in which we had a chance to hand over our gifts directly to street people. Highly recommend this NGO for your volunteer work!
Aid For Kids	309609	2	/users/profile/400961	AidforKids	Board Member	5	10/10/2016	Here we publish a letter from one of our volunteers, Duy Lyford. The FB account Akira Nguyen mentioned in his letter was later said by Thomas Le Cao Tam that he created it, Joy missed recording the conversation though.  Duy Lyford: duy.lyford@gmail.com To Whom It May Concern, My name was used without permission, in stories that are not true, by a person I do notknow, Akira Nguyen. I cannot comment on all her stories I will address those that haveaffected my family and the friends Ive made through Aid for Kids. I have known the Degenhardts for more than 20years-they were key in my adoption(from Hanoi) and those of my 5 siblings (from Hue, Ho Chi Minh, and Phnom Penh). Itwas Joy Deegenhardt who personally brought me to America at the age of six-my familyare grateful for the work Joy and the Degenhardts have done for us. My personal relationship to AFK became more professional when I joined AFK as avolunteer and eventually directing a project of my own design through AFK. As avolunteer I was involved in a number of foreign aid-projects. Some of these projectsincluded taking dentists/dental students across Southern Vietnam to provide free dentalcare for hundreds of local children. The volunteer students I worked alongside wereamazing-and their contributions to the community were immediate. I was also involved in projects to reunite families; displaced for myriad reasons,including adoptions. In fact, my eldest sister was able to reunite with her biologicalsister in Hue on a similar project a few years earlier. I had the privilege to join the teamthat would find and eventually reunite an adoptee, Rachel Shultz to her biologicalVietnamese family. This adventure will be a memory Ill cherish forever. It was a shock to see that Akira would accuse the Shultz family of any wrongdoingthere are few people I hold in higher regard than the Shultz family. Through theirimpressive personal fundraising efforts, a modern bridge was financed and built nearthe home of Rachels biological family. It was a functional bridge that still stands todayand one that has transformed the lives of the local village. The donation raised by the Shultz led to a practical solution, which resulted in immediateand significant impact on a whole community. Rachels Bridge was such a thoughtfulidea and should serve as an example to all NGOs on how to use financial donationseffectively. Akiras accusation of wrongdoing by any member of the Shultz family isabsurd. My father died in 2010we asked those affected by his death to withhold flowers andinstead to donate that money to AFK in his memory. I do not know how many peoplecontributed money in my Dads honor. We trusted AFK to put any donated money togood usemy sister visited Vietnam in 2011 she visited an education center built withfinancial aid from AFK. While there my sister saw a plaque with my Fathers name, hungon the wall in his memory and thanking him for contributions.  Akira has stated that I was disappointed on my visit to Cam Ranh Bay in 2013 whilevisiting a library supposedly built in my Dads memoryHowever, I have never been toCam Ranh Bay. This story is completely false and one that I will not forgive.In 2013 I quit my job in the US and moved to Vietnam to lead my own education projectunder the banner of AFK. It was a volunteer project in collaboration with a childrensrehabilitation center in HCMC. The goal of the project was to provide special educationtraining to teachers and the staff working at the center. It was incredibly fulfilling towork at the center. Prior to arriving in Vietnam I had attempted to raise money for the project. Though I fellwell short of our fundraising goal of $25,000 USDI was too excited about the projectto be disheartened. I was passionate about the good we would accomplish, andbelieved once people saw the work wed garner the financial support to fund the projectlong term. Unfortunately, after 7 months of work the money I had raised for the project wasexhausted and my own personal savings was nearly gone. With no money to continuethe Autism Education Project, and the dwindling of my own personal saving I made thepragmatic decision to find a paying job. It was a tough choice but driven by my personalfinancial well being--nothing else. Akira has claimed in her investigation that money I had raised was misappropriated andkept in the pockets of AFK.I did transfer all donated money that I had raised to AFK, butthey in turn transferred this money to the rehab center that provided me access asneeded. I was the only person given access to the projects funds and can verify that allthe donated money was used as intended. The allegations against the Degenhardts and AFK are serious and if true would bepersonally heartbreaking. However, by my account there are no merits nor truth in thestories written by this so-called investigative journalist, Akira Nguyen. She has notdemonstrated professional integrity nor an ability to sound out facts from fiction. Herreporting has been ill-researched and can be easily proven as false. I question the truenature behind her agenda as the search for truth is clearly not her priority.Sincerely, Duy Lyford  Date: February 19, 201647 Xian Yang Bei Lu Shanghai, China, 200040Contact #: +86 136 6152 3364

I live near Joy's apartment and has witnessed all Tam's schemes to kick her out of her own house and even Vietnam!!

Aid For Kids	278618	1	/users/profile/368585	Writer	Former staff	1	02/01/2016	How does Aid For Kids, USA charity organization stole money of Vietnamese poor children?1- First Story: Mr Duy Lyford who is a Vietnamese Adoptee come from Bac Ninh Province, a local in the North of Viet Nam is living in the United States. When his adoptive father was died in United States, his family had fundraised amount 2500 USD in his Dad's funeral. After then, his famly donated all that money for Aid For Kids to buid a library for poor kids in Cam Ranh Bay Area (It is located at Khanh Hoa Province). Joy My Lien Degenhardt gave his family a report that Aid For Kids had already used that money to set up a Library in Cam Ranh Bay. But when he come back Viet Nam in 2013 to visit this place, he did not see any library in there. Mr Duy Lyford was disappointed very much. Because His dad's wishing for Vietnamese Poor Kids did not come the true.Before the day, Mr Duy Lyford come back Viet Nam to help Kids who were autism as volunteer in Aid For Kids.(Duy Lyford also a specialist autism). He had also fundraised from his friends in United States amount 10,000 USD for autism project and He wired all of that money for Aid For Kids. But when he was Ho Chi Minh City where this project was action (the Orphanage at 38 Tu Xuong Streets, HCMC). The Director of this orphanage told to Mr Duy Lyford that Joy My Lien Degenhardt/Aid For kids only transfered for this project, grand total about 2,500 USD. First at all, Mr Duy Lyford thought that he would stay in VIet Nam for helping autism kids about one year, but after 3 months working He knew Joy My Lien Degenhardt/Aid For Kids used him and all Donator to get money for her private life, so he decided moving to China for helping autism kids in there.

It is remarkable what a positive impact this group makes with the very limited resources they have. The leaders of this group have provided much needed humanitarian services to thousands of children and families in Vietnam since 1993.  This group often works in remote villages which sometimes offer limited communication services and other infrastructure which can make the process of organizing these dental missions a challenge. It is difficult work and sometimes requires the ability to adapt to last minute changes that occur when working in a foreign country. The agency staff goes to great lengths to meet or exceed the expectations of the many skilled and professional dental volunteers.

None the less we were there to treat kids and loved to do so.  The volunteer staff that was there to help was amazing and guided us the whole way.  But the main organizer was not there for over half the trip.  Besides feeling taken advantage of and not welcomed we were informed that we over paid for the trip.  We were informed that the trip cost a total of $800 for us all when we all paid $1,500 each.  The organizer would not give and itemized receipt and to add insult to injury gave thank yous to us on the last day with misspelled names and half of us had empty gift boxes.

It's a warm, welcoming, supportive, sympathetic and informative community and space for new (and established) parents. I was SO grateful for the prenatal classes, which answered so many questions and helped to take the fear out of labor and childbirth, and also for the Blossoming Newborns series which provided a friendly and structured space to chat with other new mamas about the challenges and joys of being a new parent. It's been so good to share stories and listen and know that other folks are going through the same things as me! Everyone at Birth Roots has been incredibly thoughtful and careful about providing a supportive, positive environment where folks share experiences without feeling judged, or feeling that there is a right and wrong way to parent. I really appreciate the work that Birth Roots does to support new parents and new families! I'm in a few Facebook groups with other new mamas from all around the country, and I've seen that very few of them have anything as supportive as Birth Roots to help them through the whirlwind of being a new parent, and it's a lot harder to navigate alone. It seems like Birth Roots is a really special and unique organization!

Birth Roots Inc	86837	1	/users/profile/97330	Laura T.	Client Served	5	04/22/2011	Birth Roots is amazing. Last April, I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl. On the advice of a friend with two children, we went out as much as possible. But going out with a tiny infant, when you're barely accustomed to even being a parent, can be tiring, especially since I only knew a couple other people with infants. At my prenatal group's 6 week reunion, someone mentioned that they were taking a class at Birth Roots. I practically ran to my computer when I arrived back home, looked up the classes, and signed up for one. Going out...to a place with other babies and mamas! What a relief! That first class was amazing - it was so wonderful to meet and connect with other moms in the same boat we were in. Sleepless nights, feeding concerns, we discussed it all. It was really great to know I wasn't alone and the things that my lovely daughter was doing, however frustrating they might have seemed, were normal baby things. After that first class, we went on to take several more classes and meet countless other mamas and babies. It was with a heavy heart that I realized we were taking our last class not too long ago! But I now have this amazing group of people that I see and talk to on a regular basis. Recently, we just had a giant birthday party for nearly 30 families. A week doesn't go by where I don't see at least one other mama and baby from out Birth Roots days. The connections we made there are amazing! Truly a lifesaver!

Birth Roots Inc	86765	1	/users/profile/97236	cody.fisherstrauss	Client Served	5	04/22/2011	I first found Birth Roots through my midwives office when I was looking to take a birth class other than the one the hospital offered.  I signed up for the Bridge Package, which included "Birthing from Within", a breastfeeding class, and a class about the "Fourth Trimester" (the first three months after your baby's birth) My experience with these prenatal classes was absolutely wonderful- I went into labor feeling confident that no matter the particulars of my birth experience, I would find a way to focus on the joy of bringing my baby into this world. As great as my prenatal classes at Birth Roots were, the real value of this organization for me came after my son was born. I took all three of their postnatal classes, starting with "Buds", when my son was just 2 weeks old.  During pregnancy I was so focused on the birth- and for nine months this excitement built and it ended in this spectacularly beautiful event- the highest emotional peak of my life.  When I started settling into my new life with this unimaginably amazing little creature there were a whole host of new emotions that came with the haze of sleepless nights, worries about whether my baby was getting enough milk, whether I was doing this or that right, if I'd ever have another moment to myself or to spend with my husband. If I had spent this postpartum period without the company of other new mothers, I wouldn't have known that this was completely normal. I might have felt guilty for thinking about my own needs. Sitting in a circle of my peers, I listened to story after story just like my own.  I formed such a tight bond with these women that a year later, I count them among my best friends, and we continue to support each other through the highs and lows of parenting. I can't imagine how much harder this year would have been without Birth Roots to foster these friendships.

I am more than happy to write a review here, in hopes that another mom will benefit from my suggestion to get to Birth Roots NOW!I have an almost 1 year old. I'm 30. I spent 2 decades prior babysitting, nannying, and then becoming an elementary school teacher.  I have experience with how to raise children.  But being a mom...the sheer physical exhaustion and mental roller coaster made that knowledge useless. I was at square 1 with all of the other new moms. My baby cried a lot, didn't want to be put down, I felt lonely and I live in a rural area--no neighbors to visit easily and an unsafe road for walking.I saw a Birth Roots publication in my midwive's office and decided to sign up for a postnatal class.  It was heaven. Suddenly, with other moms to talk to and a guide from the organization things were easier for a couple hours. Then, as I became friends with the other moms our group expanded. We used the Birth Roots facility until our babies started toddling. Then we were ready to take flight on our own.That's what Birth Roots *really* does. It gives you this support system, this family (or flock, it's called), and confidence as a new mom.  Then, with those roots in place you are able to fly from the nest and be the best parent that you know how.A couple of weeks ago my flock had a big 1st birthday bash for all of the babies. There were about 30 families there! And all of those babies have such a place in my heart. Such an amazing event.While I'm speaking of the social aspect mostly, you don't need to only use Birth Roots to build a network.  They provide help with breastfeeding, birthing classes, eating and sleeping.Because of how much I blog, write and share about Birth Roots I constantly have pregnant or new moms asking me about this organization, wondering if this is something they should check out. Without hesitation--yes! you will be a happier mom. And as my own mother used to say, "When mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy."
Birth Roots Inc	86415		/users/profile/96732	jenndoe22	Client Served	5	04/19/2011	Last March I gave birth to an amazing little man.  He was healthy and happy, we were truly blessed.  I felt so prepared for motherhood.  I assumed breast feeding would be a natural, wonderful bonding experience for me and my young son.  Yikes was I wrong!  We struggled a great deal in the first week.  An amazing lactation consultant came to my house to assist us and she reccommended Birth Roots to us.  After week 2 and cleared for driving I bundled up my little guy and made my way across town in search of anwsers, help, reassurance... something.  After that day we did not miss a monday @ Eat, Sleep, Nurse.  The program is free and facilitated by very knowledgable woman.  The environment was so warm and inviting, we loved snuggling up and listening to others dilemas and sharing our own.  We then moved on to taking the Buds class.  I met some amazing moms and had found my" Flock".  Then came the sprouts class and my flock grew.  We would meet and share stories and just enjoy adult conversation.  As the babies grew and developed we would watch them interact.  It was an amazing 5 months... then back to work I went.  It was so hard on me.  Thankfully my flocked stayed together and we just celebrated our one year birthdays together as a group.  I thank BirthRoots for bringing us together and being there to lend support to so many new mothers.  It is such a scary and vulnerable time and I am so greatful I found Birth Roots.  I reccomend them to every pregnant woman I meet... or see in the grocery store :)
Birth Roots Inc	42464	9	/users/profile/43127	leah3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/01/2010	Birth Roots is to the perinatal phase (9 months before and 9 months after birth) what a doula is to the hours of labor and childbirth, an advocate for acknowledging and meeting a birthing woman's non-clinical needs to feel safe and central to her process of becoming a mother, both physically and emotionally.  Women who participate in the Birth Roots Community gain increased self-awareness about their transition and are much less likely to feel traumatized by the birth process and are more able to employ skills and resources for preventing postpartum depression.
Birth Roots Inc	42308	9	/users/profile/43026	cmf8	Client Served	5	05/31/2010	I attended a prenatal class at Birth Roots that was by far the best class I have taken anywhere, ever. I thought I had read every book and was prepared for labor, but the prenatal class took birth preparation to a different level. It was a very powerful educational experience that impacted the participants as individuals, parents and couples. The newborn class was also amazing. I don't know how I would have survived the first three months with my very fussy daughter without the tools, laughter and wisdom that emerged from that group. Birth Roots is an incredible community builder. Our group is still getting together weekly nine months later to support each other as hard working, new moms. These are friendships that were born at Birth Roots and are here to stay.
Birth Roots Inc	41714	9	/users/profile/42504	ab1	Client Served	4	05/29/2010	Very important experience after my son was born - went 1x a week (at least) on and off for the first 6 months for classes and just to hang out with other new moms. Helped SO MUCH to normalize the experience, get help learning how to care for my son and myself, and connect with other women going through similar things. Still in touch with other moms/babies one year later!
Birth Roots Inc	41314	9	/users/profile/42154	julie-saxe	Client Served	5	05/28/2010	After giving birth to my son, I realized I was  not at all prepared to care for an infant.  I don't think you can be truly prepared.  But fortunately, I stumbled upon Birthroots.  The weekly classes I took provided a place to talk, laugh, and learn with other mothers. We commiserated over our sleepless nights and learned that we weren't alone in raising our newborns.  I finished taking my classes seven months ago but still meet for weekly playgroups with the friends I met at Birthroots.  I feel truly lucky that I found Birthroots when I did.
Birth Roots Inc	41313	8	/users/profile/42153	jennifer37	Board Member	5	05/28/2010	Birth Roots changed my experience when I first became a mother.  The support, the understanding, the array of resources helped me feel less alone in the transition of becoming a mother.  I needed Birth Roots so much, that I quit my old job and joined Birth Roots board, then started facilitating classes! It is a much needed community resource for our area to support new families with celebrating the joy and beauty of becoming new parents as well as the struggles and challenges it also brings.  The directors - Leah and Emily are brilliant!!
Birth Roots Inc	41190	8	/users/profile/42070	sraahmaclaughlin	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	Birth Roots is an amazing place. What they offer women, children, and families in the community is truly not available anywhere else. Their non-medical model for supporting new parents offers a caring and safe environment for deep learning. Men and women get the information and support they need to feel empowered throughout the perinatal period; facing labor and birth from a place of strength and knowledge, they start their parenting journey off on the right foot.
Birth Roots Inc	40905	7	/users/profile/41792	renee9	Client Served	5	05/27/2010	I have no idea how to sum up the wonderful  expriences I have had thanks to Birthroots.  I found a safe and welcoming place to learn about and prepare for labor and delivery, express the my many feelings experienced during and after pregnancy as well as meet new friends and supports.  The prenatal classes I attended contained more than just the birthing basics. I gained confidence in myself and my body.  The class also provided an opportunity for my partner and I to envision our labor experience and communicate our expectations and fears.  I have since utlized Birthroots through their resource booklet, facebook posts and look foward to attending future events hosted by Birthroots.
Birth Roots Inc	40805	7	/users/profile/41697	kate12	Client Served	5	05/26/2010	Birth Roots is an amazing organization, and is likely one of the main reasons why I have managed to avoid postpartum depression.  I am a new mom and after a particularly tough labor, delivery and week-long NICU stay, followed by severe feeding problems, I was feeling isolated and was having trouble finding enjoyment in my new role as a parent.  We took the Sprouts session of the Blossoming Newborns class at Birth Roots when my daughter was almost three months old, and this almost instantly transformed our experience.  We found a wonderful community of babies and mothers with whom we still gather on a weekly basis.  We also found a safe, baby-friendly space in which to spend time when we want to get out of the house.  Because of Birth Roots, I have gained confidence as a mother, feel more educated about my choices as a parent, and am able to celebrate the joys of parenting more fully. I have found a support network that I can always turn to for guidance, empathy, and companionship. We are now taking the Seedlings class and also participate in the Eat, Sleep, Nurse group for breastfeeding support.  Our family is incredibly thankful for Birth Roots, as it has truly helped shape our postpartum experience and connected us with people who are likely to be lifelong friends. Without Birth Roots, I imagine we would be struggling more with developing our confidence as parents and establishing friendships with other new parents.
Birth Roots Inc	40776	9	/users/profile/41668	misty	Board Member	5	05/26/2010	Birth Roots is the most personally helpful, most inspiring organization I've ever seen in action (and I consult with nonprofits, so that's saying a lot). As a pregnant first-time parent who recently moved to the area, my husband and I went into this experience feeling completely alone, and a year later, we feel that BR is responsible for our entire social support network and so much of our confidence as new parents. From our childbirth education (Birthing From Within) to the amazing, unique Blossoming Newborns series (with classes for each postnatal "trimester") to a breastfeeding prep class and drop-in group, Birth Roots' orientation has always been about helping us to become educated, understand our choices, and feel fully empowered as new parents - setting the stage and tone for all of our parenting experiences yet to come. We have also taken advantage of prenatal couples counseling, postpartum doula support, lactation support, and baby sign and singing classes, and we turn to Birth Roots' community resource guide every time we need help finding services or provides. EVERY NEW PARENT NEEDS A BIRTH ROOTS IN THEIR LIVES - IT ISN'T A LUXURY, BUT A NECESSITY. It is not an exaggeration to say that this organization is the reason I as a new mother survived pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period. I could never have known in advance how much new parents - particularly new mothers - need (physically, psychologically, emotionally), nor how this transition would be the defining experience that sets the tone for family dynamics to come. Because BR is so responsible for my sense of success as a new parent, I have joined their Board and recommend them to every pregnant person (even pre-conception families) I meet.
Birth Roots Inc	39702	8	/users/profile/40670	meg3	Client Served	5	05/20/2010	I recently heard Birth Roots described as a safe space where a new mom could go with breast milk leaking onto her shirt and feel supported.  Before becoming a new mom 7 months ago I wouldn't have appreciated that description, or the importance of having such a space.  Birth Roots has been a haven for me these past months.  It has connected me with helpful resources, improved my parenting skills, and most importantly helped me find my flock (mothers with babies the same age as mine).  Engaging with my flock helps me feel supported, empowered and more confident as a mother.  I know I am not alone, even in the middle of the night if I happen to be awake with my baby.  I've attended two incredibly helpful "Blossoming Newborns" classes at Birth Roots, a "Baby Booty" yard sale, the Birth Roots open house, and a baby-friendly showing of the movies "Babies", sponsored by Birth Roots.  Also, I use the Birth Roots Perinatal Resource Guide.  These are just some of the ways Birth Roots helps support me and connect me to a helpful, healthy, family-friendly community.  I wish every new parent could have a Birth Roots in his/her town.  It has had an enormous, positive impact on me during this tender time of transition.
Animal Welfare Society	320481		/users/profile/413058	Writer	Donor	1	12/24/2016	They ARE AWFUL ! I have been helping AWS for years now ! I have four Dogs I got from them and they are My family . Everything was fine until the new staff ( director ) came on board ., Last Christmas By The Sea we did a tour of the Inn and raise 1035.00 for them in five hours ! Every time I went up this past Summer and Fall to hand over yet another donation from a Guest of Our I told the Director We are doing the tour again this year and hopefully with more advertising We can raise more money this year . Time comes and I e-mail Her and even try to call and no answer from both ways ????? I even advertise in "The Portland Magazine " the event  !!!! I am one of the largest donor to The Antique Show they have ! And Tonight I received an e-mail from a Guests who has made a couple donation to them in our name and She wanted to make monthly donation and the person they spoke to said We don't know Andy and couldn't find their name nor donation they made in the past !!! I have all of this as proof by e-mail and other file .This Christmas I received donation in My Christmas Cards to AWS but I sent them back saying I no Longer can support a private Club because that's what they have turned into . Lots of Puppies to make money off of them but where are the Mothers of those Puppy ?Are they a puppy Mill Now ???? Also They are No Kill but they transfer some dog away and as Far I can figure from when I ask those animal shelter they are a Kill Shelter ???? I ask but got no answer from Abgail the director ? It is sad when They get so big that they tend to forget what the Mission was to Help those Homeless Animals. And What did it cost to build that plush office building for them ? Wouldn't that Money to wise to Use for The Animals . To say I am hurt would be an understatement . I felt I was doing My Share in Helping Those Animals . Yes I do support other Shelters but AWS was My pride and Joy . We need New Staff in management . Gail was Wonderful the past director .
Animal Welfare Society	252470		/users/profile/340540	Bobbi J.	Donor	1	08/10/2015	I have called AWS, left messages, and filled out applications to volunteer. I have never to this day received a call or acknowledgement of any of my efforts. I moved to Wells in 2002 and pursued AWS off and on since. Calling and getting the responses of the staff being out on maternity or on vacation is getting old. Yet, 3 or 4 times a year they manage to contact me for a donation. I have donated money, litter, and food and NEVER even received an acknowledgement. The idea is great but the staff is NOT interested in actual help. It seems to be a private club.
Animal Welfare Society	248163		/users/profile/335851	Tookie	Volunteer	5	07/12/2015	The AWS is a great part of the Kennebunk region. The staff is very dedicated to making the best situation for all of the animals that come in to the shelter. Everyone is very caring, friendly and helpful.
Animal Welfare Society	201465		/users/profile/262952	missmoonmaker	Client Served	5	05/31/2014	My dog Pedro is a 8 year old Chihuahua/Pug mix. Pedro was having some very difficult and painful bouts of ongoing prostate issues that were very painful for him that last year left him in critical condition. The vets finally figured out after all these years that Pedro had a testical in his abdomen (even though when he was a pup he was neutered.) Apparently, when Pedro was  young in Georgia, he had a hernia which left his testical undetected for 8 years after! Pedro LOOKED like a neutered male on the outside but INSIDE his little system was producing enough testosterone levels to be an intact male! Apparently, 8 years ago, they missed one and well...I found out the hard way and many years of trying to resolve his bouts of pain.  Not many dogs have to get neutered TWICE IN LIFE! This year we all finally figured out they mystery to Pedro's "special circumstances" and 8 year old Pedro went in to Spay/Neuter Clinic with great success! The vets and staff there were very kind and thoughtful and proceeded with the procedure with great ease. The ARL took great care to make sure that my dog was comfortable after and even called me on their off times after hours to make sure he was ok and answered questions that I also had after house.  Thank you ARL for giving this little guy another start at life without pain!  Yes, in fact Pedro is "half the man he used to be," but he is going to feel a heck of a lot better and will finally be able to settle down into his golden years!  Warm and Furry Regards, Jennifer

We first went there when we decided to adopt a dog for our family and found the perfect match on their awesome website.  Ever since that first visit, we fell in love.  Our dog is perfect for our family and was already so well trained and obedient!  We have been coming back for visits and special events and even hosted my daughter's birthday party at the AWS last year.  My kids love to collect donations for the AWS for their birthdays instead of presents because they just can't seem to get enough time with the animals!  My daughter is already hoping that she can volunteer at AWS when she starts her community service hours.  AWS Rocks!  Always looking for a way to support them!
Animal Welfare Society	201138		/users/profile/262605	bragadog	General Member of the Public	5	05/28/2014	AWS is top-notch.  We coordinate efforts with them to find forever homes for abandoned pets.  They always do exactly what they say they'll do.

Animal Welfare Society	201132		/users/profile/262598	star_bblake	Client Served	5	05/28/2014	We adopted our dog from AWS.  Initially, we walked straight by or future loved one as he was not what we thought we wanted.  We took the dog that I saw online for a walk and we could tell that she just was not a good fit.  We were about to leave when a volunteer asked if we wanted her help.  She spent about 10 minutes talking about what we wanted out of a pet and brought us to 'Buddy's' kennel.  At first, we thought she was crazy, but she told us to just take him for a walk and maybe throw him a tennis ball, from what she heard she thought that once we saw his personality out of the confines of a kennel he would be a good fit.In about 15 minutes we were a family and we haven't regretted our decision even for a minute in the 7 years that have flown by.We also took the obedience classes that AWS offers as a way to bond with our D'Argo (his forever name in his forever home).  He was an adult dog then with a very dominant personality and had been a stray, but someone had definitely shown him lots of love.  We loved the instructor and the structure of the class.

It is the cleanest, most cared-for shelter with the most caring staff I have ever encountered in comparison to other shelters and rescue organizations I have known. Every animal is treated with respect and loving care. I can't say enough about all that they do for animals in their shelter and in the community at large. I highly recommend that people visit and get to know the staff and see their animals. They have a great selection of dogs, cats, bunnies and birds!
Animal Welfare Society	200247		/users/profile/261407	NBTherapies	Volunteer	5	05/14/2014	AWS helps all.  I have seen so many animals with serious medical problems be given the care they deserve and a good home found for all.  The staff are caring, compassionate people who go above and beyond for every animal.  AWS has many programs for educating the young, promoting spay/neutering, obedience classes for owners, and many more.  As a volunteer, foster home, and adopter, I have seen it grow from a one room shelter to the facility it is today with many rooms for cats, dogs, and small animals (and of course birds too) with many outdoor yards for play time.  The facility is clean and the animals well cared for. I am homored to be part of this organization.  Our community is fortunate to have them. Thank you AWS for all that you do.

The outreach programs for the surrounding communities have been innovative and outstanding in their reach and scope including not only the spay and neuter programs but the feral cat and prison adoptees program. The facility is always clean and fresh with much credit to be had by their staff and volunteer personnel as they are the backbone to any animal shelter.

I have had many volunteer and work experiences with international non-profits and can say with confidence that Matawi is a model of how to merge a challenging mission with concrete programmatic achievements. The result is an organization that fosters education and leadership opportunities in the global refugee community. This year, the organization hosted an incredible function in NYC that generated conversation and a deeper awareness of the tremendous barrier that young women in refugee camps face in accessing higher education.  It was an incredibly moving and effective event.

I have felt for a long time that education and women's empowerment play critical roles in all of these areas.  Matawi is an organization I believe in because it focuses on its beneficiaries and does not attempt to impose values on them as a condition for help, and they do this with a view toward providing education and assistance for women from some of the most challenging backgrounds in the world.

Matawi makes a tangible difference in the lives of those it benefits, also serving the greater good in a way that has the potential to change entire generations.  What is perhaps most incredible is that its founders find ways to foster the organization on both the beneficiary and donor sides while remaining true to its core values: education, cooperation, and empowerment.

The leadership teams diverse array of skills and experiences, coupled with their vast international network, leads me to believe that this organization will create lasting impact among the global refugee community.I am particularly impressed with Matawis Dadaab Young Womens Scholarship Initiative (DYWSI). This element of Matawis work focuses on increasing young Somali refugee womens access to higher educationboth within East Africa and the United States. As a staff member of an international foundation myself, I have witnessed numerous organizations attempting to capitalize on the hot-ticket development item of girls education. Donors are notoriously eager to fund girls education as it appears to be an uncomplicated and uncontroversial method of achieving womens empowerment (as opposed to reproductive health initiatives, economic empowerment projects etc.).  Matawi makes the argument that, especially when working with refugee populations, assuring girls access to educational opportunities is anything but uncomplicated. In fact it takes exhaustive, multi-pronged strategies to ensure that one young woman is able to attend a tertiary institution. Matawis strategies involve partnering with its networks to provide an array of essential services within refugee camps such as SAT preparation courses and workshops on application essays. Its staff also researches and publishes scholarly articles on the range of cultural barriers restricting young women refugee students from academic enrollment and retention. Additionally, Matawi works with college admissions offices in the United States to advocate on behalf of the applicantsopening doors for both the recipients of Matawis scholarships as well as all refugee applicants. In short, this is an impressive initiative.Another exciting aspect of Matawis work is its Memoir Initiative, which collects personal narratives from diverse community members on issues ranging from educational opportunity, forced migration, globalization, security, hardship, and family. These stories have been published as an anthology and are also utilized for interactive lesson plans for K-12 students in Lewiston, ME.  This project continues to develop and take on new and exciting forms, continually finding new audiences to engage and inform.It is obvious that I could continue to rave about Matawi. If I have not demonstrated why I have given this organization a 5 star ranking, I encourage you to explore their website (www.matawi.org) and find out for yourself. If youre already sold, I encourage you to visit the donation page on their website.
Matawi Inc	41593	9	/users/profile/42401	dwurzburg	General Member of the Public	5	05/28/2010	Matawi is an incredible organization. Their commitment to the global refugee community is extremely inspiring and much-needed in a world where the prevailing narrative of economic globalization often fails to recognize its effects on developing populations worldwide, and particularly on women in those populations. The Dadaab Young Women's Scholarship Initiative is particularly pertinent in the pursuit of fostering change both here in the US and in Somalia.My personal relationship with the leadership of Matawi confirms and strengthens my belief in the important work for which they are known.
Matawi Inc	40994	6	/users/profile/40163	matawi	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	Patti and I first traveled to the Dadaab Refugee Camps in 2007, returning again the following year in 2008.  As a cluster of camps, Dadaab is remarkable in a number of ways--it has been in existence since 1991; its numbers continue to grow, now nearing 300,000 refugees.  Poignantly, life in the camps offers no long term, durable solutions for refugees.  In fact, a generation has been raised in Dadaab with little hope of repatriating to Somalia, integrating into Kenyan society, or resettling to a third country. Within the camps there exists a school system run by the UNHCR and its implementing partners--Care and Windletrust.  Nearly 300 students complete high school each year but only around 35 are young women.  From there, only the slightest percentage of graduates are able to access higher education.  While in the camps, Patti and I heard over and over again stories of youth who wanted nothing more than to further their studies--to be able to apply the hard work that they had already put into their schooling to higher education and meaningful careers.  Matawi was founded in part as a response to this articulated desire, with an emphasis on providing educational opportunities to girls and women.  Matawi is a very young organization, having incorporated only in 2009, but is already sending one new student to college in East Africa and has laid the groundwork for many more to apply to US schools.  I am deeply honored to be a part of Matawi.
Matawi Inc	40741	6	/users/profile/41636	lauries	Board Member	5	05/26/2010	matawi is completely devoted to women's empowerment.  this non profit was born through the collaboration of american women listening to somali refugee women in the dadaab refugee camp.  these refugee women shared the stories of their journeys into the camp and the limitations posed by the educational opportunities in the camps.  through the publication of their stories, compiled as a meaningful book of memoirs, matawi launched its scholarship initiative efforts to bring girls out of the camp to be college educated in the united states and in kenya by selling the book and building a community of contributors who are now the foundation of the non-profit's donors. i have met many of the somali refugees in maine and am awed by their courage and creativity.  working with matawi has increased their insight and capacity as well as empowered their future opportunities. additionally, matawi is actively involved in local progamming in the state of maine where many somali refugees have resettled.  the research branch of the organization is actively studying the refugee communities in dadabb and lewiston maine with hopes to build future understanding and opportunity.
Matawi Inc	40340	6	/users/profile/41266	patricia10	Board Member	5	05/24/2010	After visiting Dadaab Refugee Camps in Kenya,  I helped to found the organization, which raises money for scholarships given to young women at the camps.
Matawi Inc	39544	7	/users/profile/40498	winnie2	Volunteer	5	05/19/2010	In 2007, I, met with Patricia Buck and Rachel Silver (Co-founders of Matawi) when they came to Dadaab Refugee Camp of Kenya for research. I was working with Windle Trust Kenya as a teacher and counselor. During that time, I was teaching an Advanced English Course to 25 refugees. Central to the curriculum was Reseach Methods and Writing, a course that I invited Buck and Silver to co-teach. In return, my students focused their research on issues realting to women empowerment. My students were earger to apply the knowledge on enthnographic research that Buck and Silver taught. The following year, Buck and Rachel came back to Dadaab Refugee Camp. The findings of their previous research had shown that there was negligible progress in regard to women education and that more cordinated efforts were needed to improved girl-child education in Dadaab. They founded a scholarship project called 'The Dadaab Young Women Scholarship Initiative'. This was aimed at reaching out to young women who had finished high school and had good grades for college. They chose candidates based on their Kenya Certificate of Secondary education (KCSE)grades, English Proficiency and their involvement in the community. I was involved in the selection process. I also edited the video on the initiative.They also engaged the young women in a memoirs project where they shared their stories. I hepled transcribe these stories into an anthology entitiled 'They were very Beautiful. Such Things are. Proceeds from this anthology go towards the scholarship initiative.During the 2008/2009 academic year, I worked at Bates College as a Learning Associate for the Education Department. Central to my job was making presentations to colleges on behalf of the refugee applicants; their contextual background and how it has affected their acadimic preparedness. As an English Language Learning (ELL) Specialist, I worked with Bates College students to prepare Lesson plans for ELL teachers in Lewiston and Portland, Maine.  I am currently working with Urban Promise Internation, a non-profit aimed at reaching at risk youth. I am in the process of writing a funding proposal for a TOEFL and SAT Center for Refugee Women. Hopefully if it is funded, I plan to have young refugee women enrolled for free classes. I strong support all that Matawi is doing for refugee women.
Matawi Inc	39284	7	/users/profile/40233	smalyata	Board Member	5	05/18/2010	As a teacher in Lewiston, Maine, I have been involved in the Somali refugee community there.  In 2007, Patti Buck, a professor at Bates College and one of the founders of Matawi, connected with me and we collaborated on a memoir writing project, "Memoirs for Change."  My middle school students, including both native Maine youth and refugees from Somalia, worked together during the school day and in an after-school writing workshop to draft, revise, and share stories from their lives.  The students learned so much about each other and formed long-lasting bonds during this process.  We had a culminating celebration of writing at the end of the project where students read their stories aloud and families came to listen.  Their stories were published in a shiny, illuminating anthology entitled "They Were Very Beautiful: Such Things Are" along with several memoirs written by refugees currently living at Dadaab.  The proceeds from this wonderful book are used to help young female refugees continue their education after completing high school.  Matawi offers incredible opportunities to aspiring youth who have persevered and successfully overcome hardship and obstacles.  Matawi also educates us about the adversity refugees face and it helps build caring communities through the power of sharing stories.

As a school counselor, I often work with female students who have low self-esteem and have a hard time recognizing their strengths.  Hardy Girls' programming helps girls and young women take a critical view of the messages that they get from media sources and empowers them to take action and change this culture for the better.

As a public school educator, woman, and mother of two daughters, I am beyond thankful that we have access to HGHW.

PBG, (Powered By Girl) the website for girls by girls that HGHW launched is amazing! It's full of spunk, satire and passion for girls and the issues that we face in today's harsh and uncompromising society. HGHW's mission to eliminate negative, sexist and stereotypical portrayals of women and girls in the media is one that is dear to my heart. I have two little sisters that are aged six and four. My hope is that by the time they are 16 they will see real, positive and powerful women in ads, movies and television shows. I think that HGHW is making this happen through their programs, websites and events.

Hardy Girls has educated me on the issues that face girls and women today, as well as how I, and others, can address these issues and encourage positive change.

Because of my experiences on the Girls Advisory Board I feel more comfortable working with a team, speaking in public, teaching younger girls, and I know that my voice and what I have to say matters. In a world where girls are taught to blindly follow the media, Hardy Girls gives girls opportunities and the support they need to speak back and to encourage other girls to do the same.

Hardy Girls Healthy Women Inc	141685		/users/profile/188059	Peggy20	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	Hardy Girls Healthy Women is more than an organization for girls. It's an organization for everyone who not only believes that we can have healthier relationships and stronger kids, but that we can help kids be stronger by giving them a sense of power and allowing them to hold the reins. I've talked to so many girls who feel less alone because of Hardy Girls, who know it's okay to be brave and nothing less than necessary to remain true to who they are. Engagement - and I suppose, ultimately, that's what I love most about Hardy Girls Healthy Women is their ability to engage girls in the world and with each other - is so key for young women - and HGHW puts engaging with the world on so many levels within reach of girls in Maine - and increasingly - girls everywhere. It's an extraordinary feat.

Hardy Girls Healthy Women Inc	141475		/users/profile/187803	deborah.tolman	Advisor	5	11/20/2012	HGHW is a remarkable, young, innovative and unique organization working with girls to encourage them to strengthen their ability to know, be grounded in , be comfortable themselves and therefore to explore what they can know and do for themselves and with their communities.  Rather than "empower" girls, HGHW focuses on how to support girls to empower themselves, providing programming in everything from developing critical thinking through fun activities, to conferences for girls to learn and hear from one another, to a curriculum to develop literacy for being a critical thinking girl in a society that gives very mixed messages.  I am proud to be part of HGHW, its ability to grow smart and to partner effectively, to develop and use resources strategically, to have fantastic leadership, and to have become a model organization for working with girls in the country.

I have had the humbling opportunity of meeting many of the remarkable young women Friends of Thai Daughters has helped.L. lived with her drug addled mother,  and was forced to beg food from other villagers to eke out  meals for herself and her siblings. She had no identification papers, and so would never be able to go to school. Through a lucky twist of fate she was introduced to FTD, which not only provided her with her first pair of shoes at age 12, but gave her a safe roof over her head, three healthy meals, education, and most importantly, love and security. Today she is a college graduate and an accomplished artists whose work has appeared in galleries from Bangkok to Boothbay Harbor, Maine.M. is a college graduate who now runs the FTD Sunflower House, passing the lessons she learned to the next generation of girls.K. has started her own translating business in Chiang Mai, A. leads a book group for young FTD girls, and P. is an au pair working for a family in Washington D.C..The list goes on. Young girls who had no hope of an education, no hope of escaping a life of prostitution, no hope at all - whose lives have been transformed. They have been provided with the gift of stability and love. They have been allowed to study, to expand their horizons and see a world outside the dirt floors and endless poverty of their villages. They have been given a future.FTD does not  have a big payroll, an oversized fundraising operation, or professional marketing. What they have is a committed group of volunteers willing to help raise any amount of money they can, because they know that even $20 can make a difference.Get to know FTD. Become a part of an organization not just talking about changing lives, but actually doing it.

The atmosphere is more like a family than a project. Every single girl loves being there and gets the love and attention they deserve in life. Keep up the good work!
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	298273	4	/users/profile/389120	Writer	Donor	5	07/27/2016	It is a great honor to be involved in Friends of Thai Daughters. This organization provides shelter, education, food, safety, hope and love to young girls who would otherwise be taken advantage of and/or possibly lost forever due to poverty, lack of family, lack of documentation to sex trafficking.  FTD is a beacon of hope that, hopefully, will inspire others to get involved. 
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297720	4	/users/profile/388530	Writer	Donor	5	07/22/2016	A great organization. Girls, many from impoverished tribal families living along the northern border of Thailand, are prime targets for being sold into the sex trade. For a lucky few, FTD has provided a place to live, a chance to grow up with an education. We met some of these pre-teen age girls when they were first rescued by FTD. Now 10 years later we were honored to see them again as college graduates. These girls have not only been saved from being trafficked but are now leading productive lives. Also, they have not lost contact with their families or communal roots and they are doing much to help the girls that are coming along in the program behind them. FTD is great organization. The model and philosophy they have put together should be emulated by many more groups. 
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297567	4	/users/profile/388369	Julie265	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/21/2016	I first learned about Friends of Thai Daughters through its co-founders Patty Zinkowski and Jane McBride. Patty was volunteering for the land trust I directed.  I've worked for many NGOs over the years including the Girl Scouts, Special Olympics and a women's center in the Peace Corps. When it was time to move on from the land trust, I didn't know if I wanted to work with another non-profit/NGO unless it was the real deal - free of politics and really making a difference.  I found that in Friends of Thai Daughters.  You are one degree of separation from the lives you are transforming. FTD is changing lives, one at a time. Its heartwarming, its real and its making an unbelievable difference in the lives of these girls. 
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297560	3	/users/profile/388362	Writer	Donor	5	07/21/2016	An enthusiastic supporter of FTD since 2006 when I went to Thailand and met Mee, Pui and Khai, the first three "daughters."  The organization does a superb job of providing a safe, supportive and loving environment for at-risk girls, allowing them to achieve their once seemingly impossible education and life goals.   Many of the program graduates now serve as mentors/models to their younger "sisters" and have developed deep bonds that will last a lifetime. 
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297480	2	/users/profile/388282	jackmcbride	Donor	5	07/21/2016	I have worked with and donated to Friends of Thai Daughters for many years.  Their mission is truly inspiring and their success has been notable.  A wonderful organization!
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297465	4	/users/profile/388267	pauli	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	I have been involved with FTD since it first started.  I have watched the first daughters grow from shy teenagers to confident, college graduates.  These young women are wonderful role models to the newest generation of young daughters just now joining FTD.  It is a testimony of the education, love and support that the FTD family has provided that continues to spread happiness and safety to so many in need.
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	297361	3	/users/profile/388149	PEEZ	Board Member	5	07/20/2016	FTD is a non-profit with integrity and a mission to help some of the poorest kids on the planet.   From inception to today the volunteers, Board, and staff both in country and globally have worked as a team to promote long-term, comprehensive and intensive support of Girls in Thailand.    Great organization doing tremendous work for its size!
Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	294959	4	/users/profile/385747	Charles75	Donor	5	07/08/2016	FTD is a unique nonprofit in the service it provides for impoverished and endangered young girls in Thailand. It not only is a rescue and protective shelter but offers a loving and nourishing family environment with education, emotional support  and opportunities for achievement beyond high school. Having met and hosted several of FTD success stories and knowing the founders and management, I feel very confident in providing support for this unique and extremely effective charity that empowers mostly tribal young girls. A lot of bang for the buck.

Friends of Thai Daughters Inc	100741	4	/users/profile/124432	peezglobal	Board Member	5	11/17/2011	Friends of Thai Daughters was created in 2002 and received non-profit status in 2005.   Founders have successfully created a model of educating poor, hill tribe, girls from the Mekong sub region of South East Asia.   Through the creation of Baan Tantawan (Sunflower House), located in Chiang Mai, Thailand,  they offer safe housing, life skills and a fully paid education from elementary through university level.   They assist with identification and nationality status issues.   In 2011, a second Sunflower House was built on the Thai/Myannmar border to offer safe housing to orphaned refugee children.   A small classroom is scheduled for construction in early 2012 and sceduled for completion March 2012.   Friends of Thai Daughters is a U.S. based 501(c) 3 non-profit.  There are no paid staff, only volunteers.   Money raised through letter writing campaigns, friends, family and foundations goes directly to the project.
Common Dreams, Inc	321210		/users/profile/414482	grumpy2	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/14/2017	I'm a climate activist and an engineer / scientist.   I've dedicated my life to fixing climate change.   As such I do the math and know some things that disagree with the "renewables-only" zealots who want to immediately shut down nuclear power.    And therefore all my comments get deleted off CommonDreams because-- they are in denial.  I work and invest in solar power, love wind power, and if they were sufficient to fix climate change before it fixes us, I would be a renewable only zealot.    But they miss the mark.  
Common Dreams, Inc	282570	4	/users/profile/372728	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/16/2016	Common Dreams has behaved like the covertly funded "Left Gatekeeper" media. It has censored the 9/11 controversy and misled its readers and is thus compromised. It is an unreliable source and it will not publish criticism or corrections. 
Common Dreams, Inc	276875	1	/users/profile/366700	Writer	Client Served	1	01/17/2016	Commondreams no longer carries comments, the most informant section. Thus it has been diminished by 80 percent.
Common Dreams, Inc	238639	6	/users/profile/323993	justanartist	Donor	1	02/27/2015	IF you wish to support a group that sensors  and  limits free speech by commenters who routinely hold more insight and knowledge then the authors of their own articles then by all means spend freely. My experience has been that the comments portion of Common Dreams has been the most informative and educational portion of my internet reading and time after time I have seen brilliant commenters censored or they just "disappear". This leads me to assume that Common Dreams purpose is to  collect those dedicated to truth, freedom of speech and knowledge into a tightly controlled corral in their attempt to keep the two party system facade alive. With their recent decision to completely censor their commenters and totally control the comment portion of their organization with an in-house commenting system, I fear all value to this group has been lost. It is all about controlled propaganda now on the internet which is the last free space humans  have to communicate freely without borders. Sad commentary today when truth and freedom are corralled into smaller and tighter spaces, fending off the ever growing mass of power fueled by money. It is an obvious attempt to destroy such sediments. When truth and freedom are feared,  killed, or silenced  it only means one thing...........that the opposite is desired.
Common Dreams, Inc	236547	11	/users/profile/320506	Iowa B.	General Member of the Public	1	01/09/2015	common dreams has engaged in censoring political speech in its comment thread for years.  i was one of those folks banished from communicating w/ open-minded, freethinking people b/c my views did not conform to traditional politics. on its face, this seems innocuous. however, the commondreams webpage claims to represent progressive values. being exposed to facts, links and arguments from many perspectives/ideologies is fundamental to understanding how the "progressive left" thinks. censoring unpopular opinions (or popular opinions that do not conform to the editor's picadillos) is not progressive. in fact, this is regressive, reductive, conservative politics. neutralize alternative points of view and then claim there is no alternative - i believe we've seen this kind of thinking in the past. commondreams receives the bulk of its funding from democratic leaning foundations, but lies to its potential fund raising base when it claims they (the broad base) represent the bulk of commondreams funding. it is disingenuous to not reveal this fact, while soliciting money - as it is disingenuous to herald the rights of free expression while censoring opinions one doesn't subscribe to. 
Common Dreams, Inc	236252	12	/users/profile/320066	zupan	Volunteer	1	01/04/2015	Forgive the bluntness, but...f#*k Common Dreams, for the only thing common about  this site is that those who are "disappeared" from their comment section, are never given a chance to contest their removal, let alone are they told "why."And yet...the infamous site pet Siouxrose, who ironically butted heads with nearly all who were banned, remains to this day to bash and belittle any who dare to question the wisdom of those writers and their beliefs whom the site owners deem worthy of printing.In others words, any who question the wisdom of keeping one's lips tightly attached to the ass of the Democratic Party. Again, my apologies for the language, but if being "candid" is what you desire from any who are to give a review of the site Common Dreams---I believe that the use of profanity would be a given.
Common Dreams, Inc	234840	10	/users/profile/304489	drone	General Member of the Public	2	12/03/2014	CD's largely one more hypocritical outrage business in an endless sea of them. I've been banned 3 times by these clowns--or, more likely, clown, since it was probably Big Craig in all 3 cases--and my crime was largely mixing it up with democrats who were probably donors.  I think the site can tolerate a reasonable difference of political opinion, but as Brown himself openly admitted in their comical "investigation" of a single idiot poster, they basically dance to the tune of large money donors. I'm still shocked the dude not only admitted it, but was actually bragging about it.  In any event, it's nothing to get worked up about because for radicals, hacking off people with cash is a way of life, and this is one of the consequences. Sure, teh hypocrisy is obnoxious, but these guys are no different than almost any other operation out there making a living selling outrage to political junkies.  Bottom line is fairly simple: if you just get unlucky nough to draw the attention of someone who is an officer or operative from the Democrats or is a larger donor, you're probably toast. If not, you'll probably live to agitate another day.  I do confess that, like many of you, I'm completely baffled by the SiouxRose Cloak of Internet Invincibility. I've never encountered a worse person on political boards before that managed to never be banned. I'd love to actually get the story on that--not conspiracy speculation, but the truth.  Anyhoo, if you're thinking about donating to a political agitation operation, there are far better ones to do it with than CD. They're decent retailers of other people's work, but contribute absolutely zero of their own work to any cause nor do they contribute a unique environment for activists to exchange ideas and discover each other. they're simply another business out to make a buck or 200,000 from keeping people mad all day.
Common Dreams, Inc	216294	12	/users/profile/279775	Panda112011	General Member of the Public	1	09/22/2014	According to the site administrators of Common Dreams: "Our Mission: To inform. To inspire. To ignite change for the common good." Except, this statement is not true. In fact, I think a more apt slogan for Common Dreams is this: "Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket."Eric Hoffer Ive been a long-time reader of Common Dreams, allegedly a progressive site, and over the years I have come to determine the site is not what it purports to be. Though its not quite classified as mainstream, it serves as another establishment internet medium to keep those who self-identify as liberals clinging to the coattails of the Democratic Party, a decidedly non-progressive cabal of neo-liberal political operatives, and, like its counterpart, the Republican Party, comprises one half of the two-party fiction that most people think of as oppositional. In reality, both factions serve elite capitalist and imperialist interests at the peril of the common good. In other words, Common Dreams functions very much like NPR and The Nation. It pays lip-service to populist causes favored by liberal progressives, such as diversity and the environment, but in truth, Common Dreams has a vested interest in maintaining the Democratic Party status quo, which entails pleasing its politically-connected, Big Money donors, none of which are denoted as funders and backers on the Common Dreams website. Big Money, politically-connected donors and the common good are antithetical concepts, just like capitalism and democracy. This inconvenient truth is not lost on the administrators of Common Dreams who clearly understand this, which is why they disguise their fealty to their Big Money donors in a cloak of populist rhetoric and neglect to mention them on their website, which is dishonest. From the website, this deception: Common Dreams is funded by the pooling together of thousands of small donations from our readers.  Left unmentioned is that Common Dreams receives the bulk of its funding from wealthy patrons and foundations.  Thus, to maintain its populist credentials, it is essential for the site to 1) maintain the false notion that all of its funding comes from its quarterly fundraising drives, i.e., from its pool of loyal readers, and 2) publish some articles that recognize and are even critical of some inherent flaws within the existing capitalist power structure, while it pushes the false dichotomy of two-party, electoral politics as the only viable vehicle for liberal progressives to achieve reform of such flaws through their continued support of the Democratic Party.  Vigorous debate within the comments threads is encouraged, but ONLY within permissible parameters. Those who attempt to reveal to other readers the vast discrepancy between Common Dreamss quarterly, reader-pooled fundraising efforts, which annually total approximately $200,000, and its combined, aggregate annual revenues of approximately $600,000, which include money received from foundations and wealthy benefactors, are censored.  Furthermore, those whose radical or independent political views veer too far outside of the parameters of permissible thought, i.e., express opinions considered too far to the left, will find themselves subjected to censure and, if necessary, complete censor. Like our governments political class, Common Dreams does not appear overly concerned with small-time donations from its horde of individual commenters (the CD masses, if you will). On the contrary, individual members of the comments crowd are expendable, as Common Dreams cares mainly about its politically-connected, Big Money patrons, just as our kleptocratic political class acts as State Capitalisms courtier on behalf of Wall Street, the Pentagon, the intelligence apparatus and large transnational corporations.  Common Dreams doesnt want the majority of its readers to figure this out; however, especially since site polls indicate that most of its readers have been conditioned through mediums such as Common Dreams to support and vote for Democratic politicians as lesser-evil alternatives, especially when juxtaposed against the Republican candidates.  Thus, individuals who post comments, which point out Democratic Party complicitybipartisan consensusin system-wide corruption, or who voice vigorous support of third-party candidates or point to the complete futility of elections as a viable mechanism for progressive change, are disproportionately among those whose opinions are disapprovingly shunned as the unserious, irrational rants of cynical purists, and, should they persist, are typically targeted for attack and/or censor. Implicit in Common Dreamss unwritten policy of arbitrary, hair-trigger censorship of left-leaning critiques, is a fear or threat that maybe just maybe by allowing some of these dissenting viewpoints to take hold within its comments threads, some of the Common Dreams faithful, who may be politically undecided prior to an upcoming election, might just put two-and-two together and decide that the Democratic Party is not only just as bad as the Republican Party in waging class warfare against the public-at-large, but possibly even worsea more effective, as opposed to, a lesser-evil.  Censoring or banning those who intelligently, articulately, and rationally point out the complicity of the Democratic Party in a two-party conspiracy against the public temporarily eliminates this threat AND contemporaneously sends a loud and clear message to anyone else in the comments threads who might be thinking of voicing dissident views that they, too, can be disappeared. Common Dreamss administrators clearly understand that eliminating a few voices here and there, sans explanation, is an effective means of silencing further inconvenient and unorthodox opinions, even if only temporarily, while maintaining the illusion that the site seeks progressive unity. It is important to note that serial suppression of independent political opinions cannot possibly be reconciled with any serious commitment to progressive politics on behalf of the common good, i.e., democracy. In fact, it would seem the antithesis. Thus, though Common Dreams portrays itself as a progressive website, its obvious to me that for purely political purposes, Common Dreams periodically culls its public comments forum of intelligent, persuasive voices, particularly prior to an upcoming election of importance, and especially if those voices are gaining traction in exposing the fraud of two-party adversarialism, which could hinder voter allegiance to the Democratic Partys preferred candidates. Such a practice on the part of Common Dreams would appear in conflict with the IRS Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Public Charities concerning political campaign intervention: "On the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that would favor one candidate over another, oppose a candidate in some manner, or have the effect of favoring a candidate or group of candidates, will constitute campaign intervention."  Recently, Common Dreams issued a new spate of banishments. None of the myriad people who have been banished without notice from commenting, either recently or in the past, violated the tenets of the sites posted Comments Policy. On the contrary, the single, glaringly apparent and defining criterion used against those who have been unceremoniously expunged is political bias. The only individual who, conspicuously, is never subjected to even the threat of censure or banishment is a commercial astrologer, who also self-identifies as a mystical visionary and published author and who, as of this writing, has amassed, just since Common Dreams formed its approximately two-year-long association with Disqus, nearly 18,000 comments, all of which are exclusive to Common Dreams.  To point out that this woman is a daily fixture at this site would be an understatement, as she treats this site as her personal blog, with the apparent blessing of the site administrators.  It should be noted, too, that this individuals avatar/screen name matches and identifies her with the name of her easily accessible commercial website.  Unlike those banished without warning for positing unorthodox political views, the commercial astrologer routinelydailyviolates the sites stated Comments Policy, with total impunity. Written complaints by other commenters of her voluminous site violations are ignored. For many, the question looms, Why? Per the Common Dreams Comments Policy, the following delineated site prohibitions make-up this commercial astrologers standard modus operandi within the comments threads: 	Slander, personal attacks or abusive, hateful, offensive, or racist language or material (Unsubstantiated allegations that other commenters are paid to post; vicious, bullying tactics, unwarranted accusations of anti-Semitism, etc.); 	Comments off-topic to the article (e.g., astrology);	Intentionally inflammatory rhetoric;	Links to inappropriate or unrelated content (e.g., her articles at astro.com);	Identical, repetitive comments posted on multiple articles; and	Blatantly promotional content.  I mention this because it would seem these posted comment prohibitions were developed specifically to maintain a certain level of civil decorum among the sites commenters and to prevent certain disruptive, unethical, offensive and intentionally divisive behaviors.  Ostensibly, site guidelines are necessary to ensure that the site maintains lively, interesting, and intellectual discourse from all perspectives without devolving into an echo-chamber of one individuals megalomania, paranoia, political agenda and unrelenting self-promotion. Yet, in spite of these posted prohibitions, I have witnessed these violations on the part of the commercial astrologer exacerbate,unaddressed for a number of years. Tellingly, this commercial astrologer focuses the majority of her vituperative propaganda (character defamation (libel); abusive, hateful language; and intentionally inflammatory rhetoric), against those individuals who generally end up banished from posting further commentary based solely on their political views. This does not appear to be a coincidence. In fact, it has become increasingly apparent to me that the commercial astrologer and Common Dreams may have established a possible quid pro quo arrangement to implement purposeful propaganda techniques with the goal of discrediting or intimidating people from voicing comments that serve as indictments of the two-party status quo, and, in particular, the role played in it by the Democratic Party. Intelligent, rational and independent political opinions that conflict with Common Dreamss unstated, but obvious allegiance to and support for and from the Democratic Party and some of its Big Money players, sponsors, pundits and business interests are routinely expunged. Along with a coterie of acolytes, the commercial astrologer acts as the Common Dreams gatekeeper of permissible political opinions and as its reliable, obsequious apologist for its stable of moderate, progressive, liberal-lite political writers.  Through the use of abusive intimidation tactics and classic propaganda techniques, the apparent objective is to incite divisiveness in effort to silence dissenting opinions that do not inure to the support of the Democratic Party and/or its affiliate pundits, many of whom also post articles at Common Dreams.  Anyone voicing criticism of the Common Dreams line-up of liberal-lite, progressive writers will eventually be subjected to attack, degradation, and unsubstantiated accusations of being a right-wing shill who is paid to post. When these bullying tactics cease to quell the problem, the individual subjected to denigration is often disappeared, by the site administrators along with access to all of his or her recent commentary.  This is a pattern familiar to anyone who has visited Common Dreams on a fairly regular basis. Acting as the sites attack-dog, the commercial astrologer is permitted unlimited run of the comments forum, a public, tax-exempt platform, which conveniently provides her access to a captive audience of thousands of potential customers, to both overtly and subtlety advertise for her various private business interests, which include, but are not limited to, her self-published books, movie scripts, charts/readings, numerology services, workshops, career guidance, relocation services, and relationship compatibility.  In addition to peddling her own version of junk-thought to the public, this commercial astrologer frequently provides both overt and subtle plugs for other questionable commercial purveyors of junk-thought, which include David Icke and Michael Greer.  Yet, despite her repeated Comment Policy violations, which in no way comport with Common Dreamss paean to the common good, the commercial astrologer remains a site fixture. Her ubiquitous presence at this site leads me to believe that she quite possibly functions as a Common Dreams insider, who is permitted unfettered use of this public forum to peddle her various manner of junk-thought, perhaps, in exchangequid pro quofor serving as the sites guard-dog of permissible opinion.  In my opinion, this arrangement does not appear coincidental, nor does it seem incidental. If true, this sordid arrangement could be a violation of the IRS Compliance Guide pertaining to private benefit and inurement.  To wit: "A public charity is prohibited from allowing more than an insubstantial accrual of private benefit to individuals or organizations. This restriction is to ensure that a tax-exempt organization serves a public interest, not a private one. If a private benefit is more than incidental, it could jeopardize the organizations tax-exempt status." There is no explanation that could possibly justify why the administrators of this site, who profess as the sites mission to stand for the common good, would permit the use of this sites public  comments forum to inure to the benefit of this one individuals private interests, while also allowing her free rein to sow discord and perpetually bully and defame their other commenters unless her continued presence and divisive behavior are, in fact, intended and deliberate, i.e., desired, condoned, and actively promoted by the sites administrators.   Based on my years of reading and analyzing the commentary at this site, this is the inescapable conclusion I have drawn from this set of circumstances.  Of course, only an IRS investigation can confirm the validity of this speculative assessment. Needless to say, Common Dreamss mission statement is a lie.  Perhaps at the time of its inception, the administrators actually did intend the site as a source to ignite change for the common good; however, this clearly is not the case today. Instead of promoting methods for its members to come together to organize, the site prefers atomization, as anyone who attempts to exchange contact information will be subject to censure.   In summation, it is my opinion Common Dreams has degenerated into just another politically-connected, money-making racket, and as one longtime, anonymous commenter succinctly put it:  "The site is a lucrative cash cow for Craig and his colleagues. Its effectively a cyber-Veal Pen front for the Democratic Party, thinly disguised beneath a non-denominational (i.e., non-partisan) philosophy promoting moderate progressive liberal-lite lesser-evilism".Anon. Indeed.
Common Dreams, Inc	215220	3	/users/profile/278603	Zelazny	General Member of the Public	3	09/16/2014	I agree with the various commenters that CD censors a lot of people.  But CD censors a lot less people than other liberal sites like Alternet or the Guardian.  While I understand the frustration of some commenters about banning because of criticizing Sioux Rose, I find many of her posts very informative.  I do agree she quickly criticizes others without giving it a lot of thought.  But I disagree with complaints about her relationship to Trudeau and Ickes.   Trudeau may have had run ins with the law over his diet book, but most of his problems with the book came from attacking big corporate food companies, who reacted.  The FTC banned Trudeau's Mega Memory tapes, although no doubt exists as to their effectiveness and their use of memory techniques known for centuries.  The many time world memory champion, Dominic O'Brien, has a set of CDs on memory that use many of the same techniques.  Try them. My larger complaints with CD come from its insistence of publishing articles by democratic party hacks on a regular basis, despite the consistent comments from the readers complaining about this.  In 2016 they will support the democratic candidate.   I enjoy reading the comments on CD, invariably more interesting and observant than the articles.   CD does a good job of reprinting some less radical articles, but avoids publishing articles by effective critics of the democratic party. Unfortunately, CD refuses to publish articles by any really trenchant thinkers, except very occasionally.
Common Dreams, Inc	214973	11	/users/profile/278300	gregoryh	General Member of the Public	1	09/13/2014	Common Dreams routinely blocks independent progressives too critical of the Dem establishment and CD article-selection practices that support it. By "blocks" I mean suspends their accounts to delete their comments and so that they can no longer comment.  Its primary source of donations is from wealthy funders of foundations who made a killing as corporation owners and execs, and may help explain the AIPAC corruption of the Dem establishment.Its new website uses a Madison-Avenue-lie to claim "Common Dreams is funded by the pooling together of thousands of small donations from our readers" and "We are...100% reader supported."  Further, as is well known among experienced commenters using the site, CD has long refused to enforce commenting policy routinely violated by a commercial astrologist  who aggressively attacks independent progressive commenters and recklessly alleges they are paid right-wing trolls. The same commenter is a long-time friend and business-beneficiary of the infamous huckster and convicted felon Kevin Trudeau, the incontrovertible proof of which can yet be found in a recent-enough "Trudeau Channel" you-tube video of the two of them in commercial action.In accord with Guidestar's community guidelines (ie policy) I have not entered that commenter's user name or other identifying information. Instead I would urge any foundation or individual contemplating a donation to Common Dreams to investigate this matter for themselves and consider the potential for publicized allegations of violation of 501c3 law in the conduct of CD vis-a-vis that commercial commenter.  At issue is what explains CD's long failure to enforce policy.  Is the commercial commenter "donating" to CD and helping it purge dissident commenters, quid pro quo for the commercial value of publicity on CD? Only an IRS investigation could determine that. As it is, there is clearly the appearance of potential for impropriety, which most 501c3's avoid like the plague. Thank you for making it possible to bring this to the attention of your users, who turn to these reviews for just such information as I have now provided. There being a spate of CD commenting-blockings of outspoken independent progressives in recent days, including that of one who made mention of the business relationship between Trudeau and the aforementioned commercial commenter, you are apt to receive more such unfavorable reviews of Common Dreams.

Common Dreams, Inc	145950	12	/users/profile/192502	iowapinko	Client Served	1	12/05/2012	This website censors posters that they do not agree with. I had used CD as a source for news and a format to exchange thoughts and commentary with fellow progressives. I have multiple sclerosis and require periodic rest throughout the workday, so I used this 'down time' to read and post. I had noticed that several frequent posters seemed to suddenly disappear, but I had no idea they were being censored for their opinions! Then the editors presented the results of a survey of on-line readership on their presidential preferences for the 2012 election. The results indicated an overwhelming vote for Obama. This just didn't jibe with the opinions expressed on-line at all, which were very overtly anti-Obama and in support of third party candidates. I am a social worker by profession, (MSW) and took a basic statistics class in grad school, and thought that the format of their 'survey' was ridiculously unscientific, easy to skew, and stated that I thought their methodology was unsound in a post. The post was censored. I re-posted it. Censored again. The third time, I was censored and precluded from further comment, and when I was bold enough to ask why, there was no response. The people managing this site are censors. They have no business being in a role promoting community interaction. The damage they have inflicted on the progressive community over the years is not insignificant. Please do not contribute to this injustice.
Common Dreams, Inc	130958	9	/users/profile/176478	zresearcher	General Member of the Public	1	10/30/2012	"We do not censor comments for their political opinion. Period." Craig Brown   This is simply not true. I have been censored and had my IP blocked several times four years ago.  When I inquired as to why, none of my emails were ever answered.  
Common Dreams, Inc	122446	15	/users/profile/166762	Visiting Professor	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/17/2012	Common Dreams is one of the most dishonest non-profit organizations I have ever come across in my entire life.  DO NOT contribute any money to this group -- unless you want to support censorship.  Craig Brown, the Executive Director, runs Common Dreams to support his Democratic Party allies.  To that end, his editors consistently (1) distort news stories to make them favorable to the Democratic Party and (2) delete comments that do not match his political views.  He regularly banishes commenters who criticize the policies and actions of Democratic politicians, and then banishes anyone who dares mention his practice of censorship on the website.  He gives no warning in advance of banishment, and offers no explanation about the banishments after the fact.  Indeed, he does not respond in any way to inquiries about his banning of commenters.  (It is abundantly clear that the banishments have to do with the content of the remarks, because those banished have not violated any of the written comment policies -- while many people who HAVE violated the comment policies by posting intentionally inflammatory or insulting or libelous or racist comments have not been banished.  Tellingly, during Obama's campaign for president in 2008, many people were banished from Common Dreams for declaring that they did not support his candidacy; the same thing is happening on Common Dreams right now in 2012-- people who don't support Obama are getting banished.)  Worst of all, Craig Brown erases the entire comment history of people he has banished, removing every trace of their existence from the site, including the responses of other people who replied to their comments.  This  behavior is straight out of George Orwell's novel, 1984, in which the workers in the Minstry of Truth destroy historical records and throw the true facts down the memory hole.  In this way, Craig Brown is even WORSE than the editors of the mainstream media whom he criticizes for manipulating truth--at least they don't go back and change all of their past editions by deleting articles. Craig Brown also makes it impossible for readers to come together to organize by refusing to let people exchange email addresses or any other contact information. In fact, if you try to do this, you are certain to get banned.  Craig Brown then has the audacity to announce publicly:  "We do not censor comments."   This is a blatant lie, and Craig Brown lies like this because he knows that if his donors knew the truth about his rampant and vengeful censorship practices, they would stop giving him money.   That is exactly what should happen, though:  people should stop giving Common Dreams any money at all until Common Dreams agrees to stop its politically-motivated censhorship practices and agrees to restore all of the deleted comments.  This is particularly important to commenters like me, who posted over 400 comments during a two year period, and then had them all erased over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2011.  Many of my comments were quite lengthy and involved hours of research and investigation -- as it was my goal to provide accurate and up-to-date information to the readers of Common Dreams.  I frequently got positive feedback from other community members for my work.  Several writers who publish regularly on Common Dreams even let me know how much they appreciated my comments.   Regarding DONATIONS to Common Dreams:  there seems to be something fishy going on.  The income for 2011 for CD is about $600,000.  But Common Dreams says in its donation appeal letters, "We rely on small contributions from our readers" and "Did you know that we survive entirely on the generosity of our readers? Thousands of small donors who keep our small staff churning out news & views for the progressive community, 365-days a year. Common Dreams is truly a grassroots community. "  Well, let's do some calculations.  Common Dreams runs fundraising drives four times a year, and raises $50,000 each time.  That comes to a total of $200,000 from small contributions from its readers.  CD also lists $50,000 in income from foundations.  That leaves the majority of its income -- a whopping $350,000 to be exact -- unaccounted for.  I would like to know who makes the sizeable donations to cover this amount.   In summary, Common Dreams does not live up to its stated mission to bring the progressive community together to organize for change for the common good.  In fact, its activities are often in direct contrast to those ideals, particularly when it behaves in clearly partisan ways to promote the election of Democratic Party candidates above all else.  This overriding goal encouraagesCommon Dreams to lie to its community and to the general public and to its donors -- which ultimately serves to weaken the progressive cause and promote dishonesty in our society.   PLEASE, if you have money you want to  donate to progresive causes, don't waste it by giving it to Common Dreams.
Common Dreams, Inc	117608	7	/users/profile/159885	Yunzer	General Member of the Public	1	07/03/2012	My experience is similar to the other commenter.  Any comments, no matter how civil, within-policy, and on-topic, are deleted, always without explanation, if they cross a certian line to the left of US liberal orthodoxy.  In particular, any comment mentioning that Commondreams will delete comments is rapidly deleted, even when on-topic.  Commondreams never replies to e-mails requesting clarification on this hypocritical policy. 
Common Dreams, Inc	115650	9	/users/profile/157489	007baby2007	General Member of the Public	1	06/18/2012	CommonDreams is supposedly committed to transparency but engages in unwarranted censorship of commenters whom, without violating the site commenting policy, are censored and prevented from participating in the group discussion. They are NOT transparent about when they apply the censorship, and commenting on the censorship is a sure way of finding yourself banned. They are NOT responsive to enquiries by their readership nor do they practice journalistic integrity by stealing articles/resources off the internet without proper citation. Frankly, I find their unwritten editorial policy to be Orwellian in nature.

Operation Tribute	89175		/users/profile/34350	goliath1951	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	Since I began with this organization, I have watched it grow from just a state organization to a regional organization.  Channel six, an affiliate of NBC, has honored the founder, Marc Badeau, as a 2010/2011 NBC 6 Who Care Award Recipient.  The Governor has honored this organization  by giving it the 2011 Maine Governors Award as Maines Outstanding Non-Profit and Vermont has just nominated this group for their Outstanding Non Profit.  This year over 32,000 Christmas presents were given to children of military personnel in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island,  and parts of Western New York.   Every year this group grows and grows and will soon become nationwide with your help.
Operation Tribute	33556	3	/users/profile/34350	goliath1951	Board Member	5	03/19/2010	I was involved with Operation Tribute for a few years now.  I have been more involved with the fundraising end with the Knights of Columbus.  The program is first rate in that it is not a needs based program but a tribute to the unsung heroes of the military services, the children.  The anxiety that the children have is just as real as the adults but they seem to be overlooked.  This program brings them to the front line so to speak and recognizes them for their sacrifice of their parents.  I currently sit on the board for the State Deputy of the Knights of Columbus and I am very proud to be a part of this organization.
Operation Tribute	34468	9	/users/profile/35323	peacepirate	Volunteer	5	04/02/2010	This organization is truly amazing. I have worked with them as a volunteer for several years and it is obvious that those involved genuinely care and work their hardest to better the lives of those whose family members are in the service. The amount of money raised is impressive and the organization can truly make a big difference.
Operation Tribute	34451	6	/users/profile/35301	david18	Volunteer	5	04/01/2010	Operation Tribute is one of the most meaningful organizations that I have ever seen.  The organization provides a christmas gift to children of militaries families.  The gift to is show our appreciation for their bravery and show them that we are proud of them and proud of their Father of Mother who is serving their country.  We need more organizations like Operation Tribute in the world.
Operation Tribute	34295	6	/users/profile/35112	seadogsfan1	Volunteer	5	03/31/2010	In my first year in Key Club, I was extremely pleased with Operation Tribute. So much effort and caring goes into the process of giving each gift. I was able to help in this process, and was welcomed warmly (even though my gift wrapping skills were questionable!) I look forward to volunteering again next year, as the organization is something I would like to be a part of long after my high school career.
Operation Tribute	34294	10	/users/profile/35111	hsbalcomb	Volunteer	5	03/31/2010	As the President of the Gorham High School Key Club, I have seen over the past three years this organization grow and evolve to remarkable heights. It could not be run by better people and could not service a more touching cause. Thank you to all the wonderful volunteers who devote their time to this program. I will miss working on this project as I enter into college next year, but will be sure to make it back at some point to support the cause.
Operation Tribute	33257	4	/users/profile/34072	bill6	Board Member	5	03/15/2010	I became involved with Marc Badeau in 2007 when he launched Operation Holiday Cheer (OHC), a program designed to provide a holiday gift to each child of Maine's military families that desired to participate. The premise was elegantly simple, regardless of one's beliefs about the war, the children of Maine's military familes deserved a show of support and appreciation for their sacrifice as children of military members who were deployed or facing deployment. In that first year, 8,000 gifts were distributed to over 140 cities and towns in Maine with a personal letter addressed to the child. Renamed, Operation Tribute, the program now recognizes the children of those serving, regarless of service or component and has expanded from Maine to include all of New England, New York and New Jersey. Not suprisingly, expansion over the entire Eastern seabord is the next step. I was so impressed by the purpose, organization and impact on the children of the Maine National Guard that I volunteered to serve on the Board of Directors.
Operation Tribute	33028	4	/users/profile/33859	bob8	Donor	5	03/11/2010	Our company works with many different nonprofits every year.  Because of the sheer number of requests of support we receive, we must be very selective with whom we work.  Operation Tribute rises to the top of all nonprofits because they make every effort to work as partners with private sector businesses.  It has been a pleasure working with everyone at Operation Tribute.
Operation Tribute	32916	4	/users/profile/33746	jimv	Board Member	5	03/10/2010	I have been a member of the Operation Tribute since before it was formed.  I was the first person with whom Marc Badeau discussed the viability of the project.  I have found great satisfaction working with Marc and the rest of the volunteers.  I've done everyting from wrapping and sending presents to the children to soliciting major contributors.  The final result of reading the thank you notes from the children and their parents makes it all worth while.
Operation Tribute	32901	9	/users/profile/33728	paulb1	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	I have witnessed firsthand the growth of this organization, as I've volunteered my time consulting to create various marketing and public relations strategies. I have seen this concept mushroom from an informal discussion at a local pub to a humanitarian powerhouse, whose goal is nothing less than providing smiles on the faces of children who have the difficult burden of having a loved one deployed or the possibility of having a loved one deployed in military service. The staff of Operation Tribute have made a huge difference in the lives of so many people, not least of which are the lives of the volunteers who spend their time wrapping gifts and playing a small part in the collective duty we all have as Americans to remember and help the families of those who are making the ultimate sacrifice.
Operation Tribute	32891	3	/users/profile/33719	patsurette	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	Operation Tribute is a great group of volunteers who bring joy to the children of military families every year at Christmas. It's been an honor to be associated with such a fine group of patriots.
Operation Tribute	32832	4	/users/profile/33663	noname1	Former Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	Fine charity, fine people, a worthy cause.  The feedback from the military families honored is truly moving.  My highest compliments!
Operation Tribute	32817	7	/users/profile/33649	max88	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	This is a great program. I am a volunteer and am extremely proud of my time spent with this organization.
Operation Tribute	32809	8	/users/profile/33628	holidaycheer	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	The children of military families live their daily lives with the anxiety of either having a parent deployed or returning home on any given day and being told that their parent(s) are being deployed.  Operation Tribute is an organization that clearly understands and works diligently to show support for these children during one of the most difficult times of the year - the holidays.  The level of generosity and professionalism of this organization is unmatched.  In this day when so-called not-for-profit groups retain 20-40% of every dollar for administrative fees, Operation Tribute boasts that over 97% of all monies raised go directly to the gift with an all-volunteer organization!
Operation Tribute	32761	1	/users/profile/33582	clb3014	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	I assisted the organization with the wrapping of presents prior to the holiday season. The gifts were given according to age and gender, and then wrapped in festive packaging to celebrate the season.

They support the Gold Star families of Maine with a run/walk in memory of their fallen, but also supply scholarships to the children of these families to assist in the continuation of their education. I became involved first, to honor the 4 fallen from my home town. The emotion of the day, was being able to shake hands, hug, and thank those families who's member has made the ultimate sacrifice.

The Circle of Giving	45606	8	/users/profile/46492	aberton	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2010	I first learned about the Circle of Giving through its co-founders Ken and Linda Davison. They turned their own experiences into a way to help others. The mission of the organization is clear at every event I have been to. They are doing great work and giving support to cancer patients and their families through doing errands, treatment bags and loaning scooters.
The Circle of Giving	45379	8	/users/profile/46272	mmars	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2010	The Circle of Giving is a labor of love for the founder and board members.  The Circle of Giving is a way to give back to people who are dealing with cancer. The treatment bags for people being treated for Cancer are one of the things that stands out the most in my mind, but Linda Davison and the Circle of Giving are always looking for new ways to help. When I have been at events I have been impressed by the level of commitment to the people they serve.

Linda Davison is the most generous person that I know and her commitment to this organization is in complete honor of her late husband, Ken. Her children are also involved in every aspect of the non-profit, which is an excellent way to teach them to give to others who are in need and to remember the caring nature that their father displayed in his life. I am honored to be able to help The Circle of Giving in any way that I can and am proud that my children have also been involved in such a caring organization.

I decided I wanted to become part of this wonderful organization when I saw what amazing people Linda and Ken Davison are. With everything that they were going through with Ken's diagnosis, and prognosis, they still wanted to to anything and everything they could do to help other people in the same situation as they were. We may not be able to change the outcome for these cancer patients and their families, but if we are able to lessen their burdens and worries even a little bit, then we have done what we have set out to do!

After knowing what a big heart the founder Ken had and what he battled through, I felt that I wanted to help this organization by being a part of it. Sometimes it's the little things that maybe over looked that the Circle of Giving can make happen. Like a treatment bag that has items in it that will support them through the chemo. A little thing that makes a HUGE difference.
The Circle of Giving	43575	7	/users/profile/44451	joe-wagner	General Member of the Public	5	06/10/2010	The Circle of Giving is a group of organized, energized volunteers who provide support services to those undergoing treatment for cancer and their families.  As a cancer survivor, I know first-hand how important assistance with the basics of life [transportation, household errands] is when the primary focus is on following a set medical protocol.  As a member of the Maine State House of Representatives, I also have an appreciation of the sacrifices that are made for the sake of serving others.  Linda Davison is a tower of strength in her efforts to support those in need.
The Circle of Giving	43561	7	/users/profile/44453	lindad40	Board Member	5	06/10/2010	My husband, Ken and I co-founded The Circle of Giving during his 5 year battle with Colon cancer.  We saw the needs of cancer patients and we felt the need to pursue establishing an organization that could assist cancer patients with all the burdens that arise.We provide treatment bags to chemo patients that include necessaties during treatment. We provide hard goods (Scooters, canes, walkers) to those who are in need and cannot afford.Our longterm goals are to acquire vehicles that we will use to transport patients to and from treatment, prescription / grocery pickup,etc.  We need office and community space so we can provide counseling, meals andand group sessions.  We need office space because my home is currently the 'office'.We have provided assistance to not only Maine residents but also MA, OR, TX, NY.  We will provide service to any cancer patient that needs it.

The services provided with their med bags and the volunteers which give their time and support is just so meaningful to the patients who some have no one to talk with or come to have a relationship with. When my Mom passed away from Cancer 48 years ago it was much different than it is today. I felt terribly alone even though I still had my Dad. I had no siblings and 2 young children so the support that is out there today with "The Circle of Giving" organization is absolutely wonderful.
The Circle of Giving	43348	8	/users/profile/44178	katwoman452	Board Member	5	06/09/2010	I became acquainted with The Circle of Giving (Cancer Patient Resources) through a friend. As I learned about the history of the foundation and what they provide to the community, I wanted to become involved in a more personal manner. They reach out not only to the patient, but to family, friends and neighbors as well. Handmade "Treatment Bags & Double Fleece blankets" are provided to the patient to be used during treatments. They also have a "Helping Hands" program which assists the family with housekeeping and lawn care.  These are just two examples of the many that The Circle of Giving provides.
The Telling Room	29318	1	/users/profile/30344	parkola	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	When I moved to Maine from Vermont about a year and a half ago, I was so excited to discover the Telling Room.  Nothing quite like it exists in Vermont, that I know of.  I've been a writer and an educator most of my life and I jumped at the chance to be involved in TR activities.

The Telling Room	28402	1	/users/profile/29453	listgeek	Volunteer	5	02/15/2010	Volunteering at the Telling Room is a great way to engage with the Greater Portland community, to encourage folks of all ages to write more, share more. The staff there are extremely dedicated, and the youth provide a wealth of new ideas and perspectives. Field trips, potlucks, workshops, master classes, open study hours -- there's always something fun in the works.

I love to help students find and write their stories and I love the magic that happens when they get to get up and read it. Each student grows an inch or two when the hear the audience's applause.
The Telling Room	28116	6	/users/profile/29195	gofine	Volunteer	5	02/12/2010	The joy for me comes from working with students as they learn to trust that I truly want to hear their stories. From that foundation of trust we collaborate to build the best version of their story we can. The witnessing and partnership in shaping a student's story is the magic behind the mission at the Telling Room. The result is a strengthening of each student's own believe not only that their stories matter, but that their lives matter.

From star-studded readings with Elizabeth Gilbert for the whole community to the weekly one-on-one mentorship this organization provides to some of city's neediest youth, The Telling Room provides a valuable resource for our community.
The Telling Room	27716	6	/users/profile/28803	yebokathryn	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	As a volunteer new to The Telling Room this year, I consider it a great privilege to participate in this group's programming. The TR staff does an outstanding job connecting with young people from such a range of backgrounds, meeting these kids where they are, empowering them to tell their own stories, all the while maintaining a fun, enthusiastic atmosphere.It's a place where kids learn to communicate without traditional structure, where supportive staff encourage creativity, but always with a goal...challenging students to think and define for themselves without giving way to negativity. Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of this group is their ability to maintain high quality, innovative, and ever evolving, up to date programming while maintaining awareness of the changing needs of the greater Portland community and of their target beneficiaries. The connection happens at The Telling Room, every day, and its been a pleasure to witness. -Kate Bradbury, Telling Room Volunteer

Not only do individuals enter the space as volunteers, but they quickly take on the role of co-teacher with a healthy and respectful sense of give and take that is the foundation of any collaborative teaching. I always know that anyone who has made their way through the volunteer training is up to the task of supporting and encouraging students of all ages to be creative and to proudly say "I am a writer."

I was not disappointed.  I attended a workshop for educators last weekend, actually ahead of my intent to bring my middle-school aged daughter and our home-schooling writers group down for a visit/class.  My experience was delightful, and far beyond my prior experience with "teacher workshops."  The event was thoughtfully organized, graciously hosted, and wonderfully stimulating, both professionally and personally.  I am so impressed by the staff of the Telling Room and the breadth of experience of the attendees!  It was truly remarkable. What a gem in the fields of education and writing.

We have been unable to find a place that will support her writing & storytelling around where we live.  We have to travel an hour to get to the Telling Room but well worth it.  The staff is so helpful, and welcoming!  The Telling Room is an important place for young writers & storytellers because there is not many places around that can relate to young writers and what kind of space they need to accomplish their writings.  The program is put together very well, the Telling Room enlists the help of young writers to help with their programs.  The Telling Room is truly a organization that  deserves kudos for their conitnued support to the arts community.

From the first workshop they ever held (in the furnace room of the basement at a local public school) to today's programming that reaches over 1,000 Maine kids in a year, this organization has never lost its smart groove or its ability to connect to that sparkly little devil that lives inside all kids: unapologetic creativity. We all have a story, but here in Portland, Maine, it's The Telling Room that celebrates what we have to say and teaches us how to say it better. The world needs a lot more Telling Rooms.

Typically when you do find a program that meets all of the above requirements, it comes with a big price tag.  I was thrilled to find the Telling Room!  Since homeschooler do not get any tax write offs nor do we get any government funding, it is a costly endeavor to homeschool, especially with multiple children.  The Telling Room is an invaluable resource for our family.

They go above and beyond serving this rural community that has minimal assistance out there for stray animals.   They are very through when it comes to checking vet and personal references on people looking to adopt cats/kittens from their rescue.   I have never seen nor heard of them turning away a cat in need.   They are an excellent resource to this small community, helping bring awareness of services that are available for low income spay/neuter program, lost pets etc to many via social media outlets and their website.

Halfway Home Pet Rescue Inc	227532		/users/profile/291265	KBHarnish	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	I've had the opportunity to work with Halfway Home Pet Rescue in a number of ways over the past several years -- from adopter to supporter to Board member.  I've watched the organization grow from the founder's home to a new facility that's ideal for caring for and rehoming cats.  The team of dedicated volunteers that makes HHPR work demonstrates their compassion for animals through outreach and education programs, spay/neuter campaigns, and more...plus they roll up their sleeves and take on cases of terrible abuse and neglect.  They fight for the best interests of cats in the community and aren't afraid to take a stand on behalf of an animal in need.  They are tireless in their efforts and command my respect and admiration -- to honor this indomitable spirit, we named one of our adoptees after Norma Milton, the founder of HHPR. In addition to the wonderful things they do for the Caribou area, HHPR was a fantastic supporter of the Ark Animal Sanctuary in Houlton after a devastating fire destroyed the Ark's new facility.  All too often, rescues can be competitive, if not downright cut-throat, when it comes to securing limited finances -- but HHPR immediately shared the news of the fire with their supporters and asked for financial and material donations to help the folks at the Ark.  I think this says a tremendous amount about how big the HHPR hearts are...

My family recently adopted two sweat little babies from The Pet Rescue and my kids liked Norma so much they've asked if we can go visit her sometime. This says a lot about this lady because kids have a way of knowing if a person is good hearted or not, and Norma and the other ladies definitely are. I would recommend adopting from this organization. Also, the two babies we adopted are so loving, it is obvious that they were cared for with love prior to coming home with us. How a person treats an animal speaks volumes about them, and these animals are treated with love...

Halfway Home Pet Rescue is a very dedicated group that have seen their share of hardships but despite that, they keep going for the sake of these animals. In my opinion, they deserve a lot of credit for saving the lives of countless cats and kittens that would otherwise never had a second chance. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, dedication, hard work and for providing excellent care for so many animals in need.

This much needed group has helped countless cats and kittens that would have otherwise suffered and died had it not been for their relentless efforts. Norma will always find a way to help a cat or kitten in need. Cats that enter their care are the lucky ones, they will turn unhealthy cats into healthy adoptable pets. Their work is greatly needed especially since we have very limited amount of resources. Working with a small budget, they will always put the cats first. I especially love the free roaming area that has recently been added which has greatly reduced the stress for those awaiting their forever homes.  Halfway Home Pet Rescue is most definately worthy of support and praise for all they have accomplished.

I learned of halfway home pet rescue several years ago and am an avid cat lover.  I volunteer for another similar organization in my local area.  Because of our love of caribou, and because of the dedication and devotion of Norma, robin, and the entire halfway home group, I have given donations raised at my annual "pawsitive party" to Norma and halfway home for the past two years and intend to do so again.  Norma and her staff believe that all unwanted, neglected, abandoned and feral kitties deserve love, respect, and care.  Their no-kill philosophy is especially important to me, as they value all life, not just the newest and healthiest.  Given their rural location, I believe it is harder to raise money to support the efforts and mission of the group....this is another factor in our desire to donate what as we can, when we can to halfway home.  I heart this group!!

What is unique about this organization is that it is effectively run with volunteers including the rescue and daily cleaning of about 35 to 45 needy cats every day. They do not take any taxpayer money, but instead do constant fundraising to pay for the Leukemia/AIDS testing, spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, all medical needs from injuries, and parasite prevention treatment. In addition, these dedicated volunteer occur the unusual additional care of the trap/neuter/relocate of feral colonies. Caribou is often on the national news as the coldest spot in the U.S.  In addtion to caring for the feral colonies, the volunteers build insulated shelters for colonies living without shelter. In addition, to all of this, the volunteers have also organized a free pet food pantry and monthly sort donated food boxes for shut-ins, disabled, elderly and low-income families so that their beloved pet will not have to be turned in a shelter while the family faces a difficult time.  All of these volunteers are heros.  Most work at full-time jobs but find time to help at the shelter every week.  I am proud to be a board member and a full-time volunteer for Halfway Home Pet Rescue.

My ancestors were from the Corinth area.  Eleven of them are buried in the Corinthian cemetery.    We found Historical Society volunteer, Pauline S, via e-mail prior to making our trip.  She answered a few basic questions on line and then while we were in Maine, she and Carol gave up time from their busy day to go with us to the cemetery, find our ancestors' graves, and give us a tour of your marvelous museum.  That's above and beyond the role of volunteer, we think!  The coolest part of the story . . . . one of her ancestors was married to one of my ancestors.

They have done a wonderful job of utilizing the old Grange Hall and turning it into a museum with something of interest for all ages. Being involved with another historical society, I must admit I am always a bit jealous.  They have the volunteers who, obviously, are willing to share their interests in preservation and their time to produce eye catching displays, in a building so well suited, historically.  Although I have not personally experienced the use of their archives, I have heard from others that they are well organized, and their keepers are always willing to share their help and their knowledge of Corinth's past.

Corinth Historical Society Inc	177851	1	/users/profile/234443	Pauline3	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	Corinth Historical Society started out as being more like a traveling show.  Everything we had acquired through donations and purchases were stored in trunks and boxes for decades.  Whenever there was a town function we would ask permission to set up a tabletop display to interest people in preserving Corinth's history and recruiting members.  I believe we had around 30 members before we had a building so the interest was there. Eventually a former Grange Hall which had been given to the Town became vacant and we pounced on the opportunity to use the building as a tenant and prove to people that we were serious about the work at hand.  Up until then people were reluctant to donate family historical artifacts because it was only going into storage boxes and brought out occasionally.  Having a building with our name on it showed citizens we could now accept donations and loans for display. In our outreach, there is an annual Children's History Day where the entire fourth grade classes from our consolidated school are given a talk at the school of what to expect at the museum and then a day for them to visit and discuss the uses of various items with volunteer guides.  This usually brings around 70 to 80 children and remind them this is a free museum and invite their parents to come back with them during the summer months. We have worked very hard creating meaningful displays and the vast majority of the investment has come from dues and fund raising activities with volunteers.

My family dates back to the very first days of Corinth's history and I am grateful that there is a place I can go to find any information I may need. I have attended a meeting and was able to assist the society in removing some un-wanted appliances to free up some much needed space.

Their quarterly newsletter is one of the finest I have seen come from an organization of this size, comprised entirely of volunteers.  In fact, at the time of my Mother's passing, everyone was in agreement that as a family we would work with the Society to set up a segregated fund to which people could contribute money in lieu of flowers at Mom's funeral.  Days prior to her passing, Mom even made it clear that she felt the Corinth Historical Society was the only place for her most prized possession:  her father's favorite rocking chair.  She made that donation above allowing one of her children to have it, so strong was her commitment to the organization.  We all agreed that it was a great place for her memory to be honored.

Fulbright Academy	51197	2	/users/profile/51759	owl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/27/2010	I have found the Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology (FAST) to be an outstanding and valuable nonprofit organization. I find it particularly valuable in building national and international professional networks. I am a 3-time Fulbright Awardee having had awards in two different countries and parts of the world. Participation in the last four FAST meetings has allowed me to start, with Professor Baronies from Ecuador, the International Undergraduate Research Symposium  (IURS) which is an activity of FAST. In addition participation in FAST has allowed me to expand the number of countries participating in IURS.  The IURS brings undergraduates and their advisors together from around the world to share their research findings (both students and advisors make presentations) and interest. In addition to the presentations the symposium has two workshops, such as on preparing manuscripts for publication.  Also students visit local science based industries so that they may see science in action. Thus, through the IURS FAST is developing the next generation of international researchers and potential Fulbrigh Scholars.

We had a small group of alumni volunteers who had a similar vision, and we slowly built the organization.  Today, FAST is leveraging the knowledge, abilities and connections of the Global Fulbright Alumni Community, with programs worldwide, and as the executive director I have the pleasure of interacting with thousands of alumni - and using the network to help many meet their personal and professional goals.
Fulbright Academy	50642	6	/users/profile/51173	catmyser	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/18/2010	Fulbright Academy is an amazing nonprofit doing genuine national and international SERVICE.  As a professional bioethicist and  3-time former Fulbright awardee, who also serves on the Executive Board of my local Northern CA. Fulbright Alumni Association (5 years), I can attest that Fulbright Academy does yet more impressive REAL SERVICE in the USA and around the globe than other Fulbright alumni organizations more local and regional in their outreach.  The expanded outreach of Fulbright Academy alone is amazing.  I constantly marvel at what Executive Director Eric Howard & his team of supporters and volunteers are able to achieve with their tireless work and genuine creative and cutting edge concrete ideas implemented successfully for real service.  Any donor funds are put to concrete and efficient and EFFECTIVE use.  That's all Fulbright Academy needs to do yet more on very little.  It is an extremely worthy charity and as a professional ethicist I give it my highest recommendation.
Fulbright Academy	50511	6	/users/profile/51015	teeguidotti	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2010	This is an unusual organization devoted to technical analysis and problem-solving, drawing on the thousands of current and former Fulbright scholars and their hosts. This is a large, sophisticated, and significant talent pool that can bring experience and global perspective to issues both small (repairing a telescope in Morocco) and huge (global health). The value added is that FAST brings "Fulbrighters" together on basis of technical expertise and interests rather than country program, which had been the only basis for alumni groups previously.
Fulbright Academy	50369	6	/users/profile/50984	daniel-twomey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/15/2010	Hello, In April 2010 the Institute for Sustainable Enterprise at Fairleigh Dickinson U. partnered with FAST to organize a Forum on Human Values and Sustainability. Along with Eric Howard, Ex. Director of FAST, I headed up the project team that organized and ran the Forum.  Partnering with FAST enabled us to engage a greater array of advisors, speakers and participants to the one-day Forum.  FAST, and Eric Howard in particular, were wonderful partners who were engaged in every aspect of the Forum.  We had bi-weekly meetings over the six month planning period with about half of the 7 person project team calling in on Skype.  The Forum was a great success--an in-depth dialogue across business, academia, government, and non-profits (people and issues).  The Forum also prompted the project team to publish an article ("Human Values and Sustainability: Can Green Swim Upstream" in the journal, People and Strategy) and present an All-Academy Workshop on human values at the Academy of Management annual conference in Montreal in August.  All of these activities were self funded.  The point is that it was a highly collaborative and productive partnership. FAST not only does good works worldwide but its members live their commitments and  values.    In March of 2010 my wife, Rose, and I attended the FAST conference on Sustainability in San Francisco.  It was an international gathering of diverse and caring  participants.  FAST is building a community that will continue to expand in service of worldwide needs.

Institute for Humane Education	111006		/users/profile/151080	grussell	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2012	  Thank you for this excellent interview with educational innovator, Zoe Weil. At a time when the social service structure here in Maine, and indeed across the United States, is being dismantled by well-meaning but poorly-informed individuals and equally ill-equipped legislators, the message of humane education has never been more sorely needed. It reaches far beyond the realm of education and deep into the field of social service, sowing the seeds of an expanded level of consciousness that incorporates justice, respect and compassion for all life -- people, animals and the environment  and giving hope to many who feel discouraged and disempowered by current trends and problems.As clinical coordinator for a large social service agency, my primary role is to supervise, train and educate those teammates who perform in a direct care capacity. In this role, I have found IHEs vision, philosophy, resources and clarity of purpose to be an invaluable asset when it comes to challenging all of us to remain committed to life-long learning, to break from the perception of discipline-specific and professional isolation, and to remind all concerned that we come into our respective fields with a unique set of skills with which to protect the environment, advocate for human and animal rights and defend the inherent value of all cultures. From Zoe Weils TEDx talk (The World Becomes What You Teach) to the numerous free resources available on the IHE website, the Institute for Humane Education has helped keep the fires of passion, curiosity and reflection burning in me and dozens of other social workers, direct care staff, administrators and clinicians who spend their days at the tip of the service spear affecting the lives of hundreds of people with serious mental illness, intellectual disabilities and emotional trauma. Thank you IHE from your brothers and sisters in the social service world who are also working every day for a just, compassionate and healthy world.George Russell, LCSW, CSWM
Institute for Humane Education	110735		/users/profile/150729	Fiore	Board Member	5	04/25/2012	The Institute for Humane Education, and the people who work with this organization, impact the world we live in in a substantially positive way by helping to educate others about the choices we make everyday by reaching teachers especially. In helping teachers educate their students about how to make well-informed decisions about food, transportation, work, purchasing choices of consumer goods, IHE helps to transform our world into a more peaceful, just, equitable, and healthy one. I discoverd IHE through my own work in education- that introduction has inspired me to make changes to my life and work that hopefully will ripple into positive change in my life and community. I am deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of all involved with IHE. They continue to reach out and collaborate with other organizations and individuals- an attitude that demonstrates their dedication to their mission. I have also had the opportunity to witness how IHE manages the people and inner workings of the organization. They walk their talk for sure. Very compassionate, passionate, dedicated people. I deeply appreciate the role model this organization can offer to other organizations.Thank you!

This organization changes lives - I know that because it has changed mine.  Furthermore, it's founder and president does her work as a volunteer, not a paid employee!!!  How many organizations can say that?  I support IHE not only with my time but also with my financial contributions because I know my money will go directly to helping children create a better tomorrow.

Institute for Humane Education	110146		/users/profile/70752	Caroline	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2012	I have been part of two seminar/online classes with IHE. I have learned so much about environmental issues, compassion for our planet and the creatures who live on it, respect for and tolerance of other points of view, the importance of critical thinking, and the joy of taking positive action for my beliefs. Zoe Weil, president of the group, has been an inspiration to so many people, living her life with truth and integrity, and she teaches her life lessons with respect and compassion. The IHE programs, whether they are for teachers or those who want only to learn more about themselves and their relationships with the world and each other, are beautifully crafted. They explore choices and offer their students new ways of looking at life's issues and their own experiences. I love, love, love this organization!

It is presented in a clear, concise way without bias. The instructors and mentors are accessible and extremely knowledgable and helpful. In fact, not only is the course about humane education, it IS humane education. Having been an Art teacher for the past 25 years and taken numerous courses and already holding a Masters in Administration, I have found this program to be by far the most applicable and meaningful course I've experienced.The Institute for Humane Education is a fabulous organization.

As a high school teacher for 7 years, I had incredibly high standards for what I expected in going back to school myself.  What IHE provided not only surpassed my expectations but opened new doors of insight and learning which benefited both me and my students.  The personalized education, truly humane work ethic, fascinating subjects and go-at-your-own pace timing really makes this program and winner.  I continue to stay in touch with my teachers to this day- and they are people I plan to know for the rest of my life.

Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens Inc	66412		/users/profile/72589	bblake	Donor	5	02/10/2011	Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens is a must see destination that holds up well to return visits. It is on top of our list of diversions to enjoy with summer guests and it never disappoints. The spectacular ornamental and specialty gardens, water features, stonework and sculpture of CMBG pair beautifully with the rugged natural surroundings. The Caf and Gift Shop successfully complete the Gardens experience. 
Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens Inc	63289		/users/profile/69195	KDonnelly	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	I live very near the gardens. When we have company, it is a definite stop on our list of to do's. Each year and each season there is something new to discover. My grandchildren love the new children's garden, and especially lunch in the cafe, which has always been outstanding. I love the peace and solitude when I visit and wander on my own. When I retire, I am going to volunteer. There is nothing negative I can say. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. I am very proud to have this beauty in my town.
Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens Inc	63272		/users/profile/69178	ktobrien	Donor	5	02/04/2011	These gardens are fabulous!! A great combination of formal gardens and totally native, wild, gorgeous places with trails. A five-senses garden, rose garden and children's area merge gracefully into a less-sculptured hillside with a meditation garden (not to be missed, even if you are not given to meditation), and that leads to completely accessible but totally wild areas. Trails that are not too difficult for even novice hikers criss-cross from side to side, linking areas like the azalea garden and the fairy gardens. Definitely somewhere to take the whole family--kids can pretend to row a boat and haul up lobster traps, pump water and water the flowers, get misted by some neat rock whale fountains, and of course pose for pictures.

Each visit is memorable.   In addition to the helpful staff, there is a wonderful cafeteria seving delicious fare at reasonable prices,  and the new children's garden is delightful as well as educational.

My husband and I went to the Fairy Festival with our daughters who at the time were 4 and 5 years old. We were not sure what to expect and were so impressed with everything. Not only was it beautiful, creative, interesting and informative; it was also very fun. The children's section is amazing. Being an artist myself I loved the sculptures. I must also say we were impressed with the quality/integrity of the food offered. We have been to botanical gardens all over including Atlanta and Brooklyn, NY. We visited when the gardens first opened and cannot wait to visit again this year. After the garden we visited the town of Boothbay, which was also an excellent experience.

I have taken acting, auditioning and playwriting classes at Acorn and they have experienced and fabulous instructors.  The Maine Playwrights Festival is one of a kind here in Maine and the only place I have found truly thought provoking theater since my return.  Naked Shakespeare brings 'high art' to the pubic like no other group in the area.  Acorn's regular staged readings of local playwright's work, their audition newsletter, their kid's programs and phyzigig and hosting an annual auditioning event are just some of the ways they nurture theater artists of all ages and levels of experience.  I would be bereft living here in southern Maine without this organization.

I had taken a long hiatus from theatrical pursuits and found this opportunity to be a wonderful way of getting my feet wet again.  My experience with the Festival was incredibly positive and rewarding.Acorn brings together passionate and talented individuals who have a deep desire to make quality theater accessible to the public.

Gulf of Maine Research Institute	38417	9	/users/profile/39287	clescl10	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/09/2010	I found the staff to be genuinely interested in the various programs at NSF.  They asked relevant questions and were very enthusiastic.  The work that is done by GMRI is first class and the educational activities are truly impressive.  The people of Maine are fortunate to have the GMRI.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36967	8	/users/profile/37731	juliancoles	Former staff	5	04/26/2010	GMRI is a world class institution. I beleive it will be looked at in years to come as the most significant public/private partnership in Miane. The research is world class and the education is a transforming opportinity for young children through out the state.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36936	8	/users/profile/37698	sheila3	Volunteer	4	04/26/2010	I was immediately impressed with the science class GMRI provided for 6th graders. Honestly, I don't think I have ever seen children so excited about science!Now that I've learned a little about GMRI, my wish is that its symbiotic relationship between education, research and the community continues to flourish.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36725	8	/users/profile/37512	pumkinbell	General Member of the Public	4	04/23/2010	Even before moving to Maine five years ago, I disovered the Gulf of Maine Research Institute's website.  I have consistently found it chock full of information; and of course, the photos that go along with the many articles and postings are glorious!  Thank you for all you do in educating both our children and everyone else and for sound research.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36690	8	/users/profile/37475	Brenda	Volunteer	4	04/23/2010	The people involved with this organization are so committed not only to their work, but to the Gulf of Maine as a whole. They realize the importance of collaborating to achieve a common goal: A Healthy Ocean Stewarded by a Vibrant & Science Literate Community.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36679	8	/users/profile/37464	Michele	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/23/2010	What a great organization with wonderful and committed people. They are always open to collaboration and new ideas. I like that when I call them about an idea or to find information, they always find a way to address it.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute	36610	6	/users/profile/37400	Patricia	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/22/2010	I can only speak to GMRI's educational center because that is the portion I know best. As an instructional consultant who advocates for experiential and inquiry-based learning, I think that GMRI is doing a great job of pressing the boundaries here.  I look forward to seeing them go even farther in this direction, as well as diversify the settings for their teacher professional development.
CIEE (Council on International Educational Exchange)	260535	8	/users/profile/349111	Walker88	Former staff	1	09/30/2015	As a former staff, I strongly condemn the current practices of this organization and particularly its CEO. What was once a mission oriented non profit environment has been changed to a mercenary, profits over people culture. This has been driven by the new CEO who has driven the experienced and principled leaders out of the company. Countless individuals have left in protest or been forced to leave. The board of directors either has its collective head in the sand or simply does not care how the fabric of the organization once known for quality and staff support and development is being shredded by the CEO. To those considering joining CIEE, beware. Talk to those within the organization and get the real story.

She has been working ten years to get some sense to this horrible high school exchange student-business!  She is working hard to fix the damages these exchange organizations are doing to the reputation of the USA. Mother2014 from Finland, robbed by ciee, had my son abused and humiliated by ciee
CIEE (Council on International Educational Exchange)	205086	8	/users/profile/267177	Mother2014	Client Served	1	07/03/2014	I had a horrible, terrifying, extremely bad experience with ciee this year. Our teen was on ciee:s so called " high school plus"- program. From the first day we had serious problems with ciee not  providing what was agreed on. Ciee:s way of operating is unbeliavably unprofessional and incompetent throughout.Family #1 had undocumented people living with them. One undocumented person over 18 in the same room with our teen. Family #2 host father ,Arnel Sison, had anger control problems. When we asked to get another family, local coordinator Peter Porciuncula told me:" I think your son is telling you a string of lies" and ciee issues him a " warning letter for " not adjusting" !!!  Ciee's ." Support director Laragh Kavanaugh" orders some totally unnecessary vaccinations to my son just because of her total incompetence!!!! Family #3 no problems, but Laragh kept harassing our teen with threats of being sent back home if this family is not satisfied.... There was absolutely no support available. Only accusations and threats.After our teen had attended this school for about a month, ciee dismissed him for not doing well enough in school. The school start had been delayed because of ciees problems with families and vaccinations!! And the dismissal procedure by ciee: the" director/ vice president of participant services Keith Stone sent Support manager Aaron Schuit from Portland(Maine) to take my son out of the family (who had kept him until the and of the " program" ,if ciee let them to) to a LOCAL hotel, which is very strange and scary and leaves these disturbed people too good of an opportunity for God knows what!!  Support manager Aaron Schuit had thanked our teen for being dismissed, because that is why he got to travel to California!!!! The next day our teen was threatened to be taken to jail if he did not go to the LAX airport with Aaron. All I want to do is to warn and inform other parents and students about ciee's ways of " promoting world peace and undertsanding between the nations". All they are after is your money. After they get your money they will not care about the agreements but break their own rules and blame it ALL on the student. It is unbeliavable that this kind of organization is allowed to operate with young students!!! Ciee's strategy seems to collect the money, but not to offer reasonable families and the support is a joke. But I am not laughing. Ciee seems to have a pattern of dismissing students early/ make the students to want to leave early without refunds of course.Do not trust this company. They will steal your money and lie to your face.Csiet and state department are NOT supervising these organizations well enough. They let this go on. Check the background of the biggest boss of ciee also.     Terrified, shocked mother
CIEE (Council on International Educational Exchange)	231580	4	/users/profile/295157	R-He	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/31/2014	My husband and I had a horrible experience as a host family.  We've had other students before, and even one through CIEE which was great - but when a teen acted up and made a complaint, the organization did NOTHING to get our side of the story - they were fine with illegal pictures being taken from our home, and cared nothing of our own children who's lives they effected.  It was so atrocious - and when we companied to the main organization, they didn't care in the slightest.  I would highly recommend anyone wanting a foreign program to look for another one then this one.

Portland Trails	138124		/users/profile/184160	Sadie Sarvis	Volunteer	4	11/13/2012	Portland Trails has shown a wonderful commitment to the ecosystems in the Portland area despite the challenges of being in an urban environment. They have frequented public schools and not only been productive this way, but sparked awareness and interest. 
Portland Trails	100923		/users/profile/60051	Jack A Rozelle	Volunteer	5	11/22/2011	Volunteering for Portland Trails gives one a wonderful opportunity to experience a variety of outreach venues. I was able to help with 16 of the 30-some events. Meeting new people, seeing workplace settings, learning about what the Portland area has to offer, allows one to see how Portland Trails benefits all who live and visit the area. Our new map shows 31 trails that provide healthy experiences for young and old, able and handicapped, walkers/runners/cyclists. 2011 provided a dozen Discovery Trek guided walks; I throughly enjoyed the four I went on. Even through staff changes, Portland Trails didn't skip a beat.
Portland Trails	57159		/users/profile/60051	Jack A Rozelle	Volunteer	5	11/16/2010	I moved from PA to ME 19 months ago. One of my first tasks was to get a map of trails where I could ride my bicycle and walk. I've been on 16 of the trails and love the Discovery Treks. Wellness Fairs have been my volunteer focus. They are a wonderful way to learn more about the community and share about Portland Trails at the same time. The staff are wonderful at encouraging me. I feel that I get more than I give. I thoroughly enjoy volunteering. It is a great way to support Portland Trails.  
Portland Trails	57677		/users/profile/61048	Patrick L.	General Member of the Public	5	11/23/2010	I moved to downtown Portland about two years ago and one of the first things I looked into was what, if any, urban trail(s) existed.  Since then I have been checking both urban and rural trails off my list (and the official Portland Trails map that can be picked up for just a few dollars) - walking some almost daily - and volunteering when possible.It's always a pleasure to see Portland Trails staff at events around town, and they're as receptive as can be when contacted via phone or email.  They seem, no, they *are* genuinely happy to hear from the public... after all, they love the trails as much as we do!
Portland Trails	57128		/users/profile/60008	dirtmom	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2010	I love the woods, hiking, nature etc., but live and work in Portland, not in the remote area I dream of. I'm also 57 and can't always hike and climb the way I used to. But every single day I go out for an hour or two and walk on Portland Trails with my dog. I've seen turkey and deer, snakes and frogs (no bear, yet). There are waterfalls and wildflowers. I'm not sure, but I think you can walk to a trail from any place in the city. If I had a million dollars, I'd buy up every scrap of open land in Portland and give it to Portland Trails.

Portland Trails	27876	1	/users/profile/28957	susandoran	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	This is one of the best nonprofits I've ever come across, and I say that from the perspective of a former consultant to nonprofits, foundations, and associations, as well as former senior staff at the national Land Trust Alliance. I chose to be on the board of Portland Trails because it is an amazingly efficient organization, and yet is also warm, friendly, inclusive, engaging. It is super effective in creating trails for all to access and enjoy, promotes healthy lifestyles and alternatives to over-reliance on cars, and initiates and convenes partnerships and cross-sectoral collaborations with other nonprofits, neighborhood groups, local and area businesses, schools, colleges, and universities, and government -- with the net result being enhancing the quality of life for all Portlanders. I volunteer for Portland Trails because my efforts are never wasted--this is not an organization that exists to perpetuate itself; it's a community of people working toward tangible goals, showing real results, literally "on the ground." If I sound passionate about this organization, it's because I am: and with many good reasons!
Healing Through Horses	235994	3	/users/profile/319697	Abby21	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/28/2014	Healing Through Horses is a welcoming, healing place where there are no judgements and pressures placed on anyone.  It is one of the few places where our clients can feel calm and in control of their own decisions when their daily lives are filled with various forms of therapy and people directing them constantly.  I find the work to be so rewarding there because there is instant gratification in watching someone's mood change from cloudy to bright in the course of one hour.  What makes HTH so unique and different from other programs is its small size and one on one interaction with instructors/therapists.  The horses there are also happy and healthy which makes a huge difference in their ability to serve our clients.

Well done!!!
Healing Through Horses	235073	2	/users/profile/312402	Norma7	Client Served	5	12/07/2014	Healing Through Horses has made an amazing difference in my daughter's life.  My daughter has emotional and intellectual delays. She also suffers from PTSD. Through her therapy at HTH she is learning to control her temper and to understand that her emotions affect those around her.   These are lessons she hasn't  been able to learn with people.   Working with the horses, she has gained a self-confidence I hadn't thought possible.  Learning to  control such a large animal has given her the ability to face other challenges in life and be successful.   I would highly recommend Healing Through Horses to anyone looking for a therapy to improve their life.

The museum is well-done with lots of Native American artifacts, art, and history.  They do a great job of illustrating the role that Native Americans played in our early history and the impact that they have in Bar Harbor today.  The Abbe is more than a museum, it is a community center where they have school programs and public programs geared toward educating all about our rich Native American culture.  We are very fortunate to have this great resource in our community.

There is a wonderful team spirit and genuine desire to learn among the Board, staff and volunteers that make this a very satisfying place to serve as a Trustee. Outreach to the community, both tribal and nontribal, is vibrant and continues to keep the mission front and center so that the Abbe's place as a unique resource for the State of Maine, the entire Northeast U.S. and the country, is clear.

They treated the stories of the native populations of Mount Desert Island with dignity and respect and it is clear that they care deeply about their relationship with these peoples as well. I also enjoyed thoroughly my visit to the Abbe facility in Acadia National park. A truly wonderful nonprofit that deserves its accolades and support. 
Seed Tree Inc	84636	2	/users/profile/93912	Carol	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/01/2011	If biased as a founder and CEO, I've also had the best chance to get a long-term and comprehensive view of SeedTree's impacts, first-hand -- on the people, communities and lands served by this action-oriented organization. Though they do not yet meet all my ambitious hopes, they far exceed any initial expectations.  Examples from my field visit to Nepal include a woman in a 1996 nursery group who just sold her flood damaged trees planted then for over $2250, another enjoying mulberries and profits from selling silk cacoon fed on leaves of trees we helped her plant.  A third told how her improved stove not only gave her a smoke free home, but halved her need for fuel wood. Stories like these from the thousands served by our projects are my greatest reward.  
Seed Tree Inc	84548	2	/users/profile/93799	Cloe	Volunteer	5	03/31/2011	I am amazed at how many trees this organization plants, how many local people in Nepal, Peru, and India it involves in the work, how many education classes are taught and other community improvement projects accomplished (like public water taps, latrines,  biogas digesters, and improved smokeless cookstoves)...... and all on a very low budget. The executive director works tirelessly to coordinate all this, and takes very little compensation. SeedTree is the biggest bang for my buck of any organization I have ever donated to.

Seed Tree Inc	84497	1	/users/profile/93738	Rob L.	Board Member	5	03/31/2011	SeedTree has planted millions of trees with engaged community members around the world. We have been planting native species long before most realized the importance of both protecting local genetic sources, and minimzing the risk of introduced exotic species. In addition to tree planting and watershed restoration, SeedTree has provided educational scholarships, community wells for fresh drinking water, biogas and fuel-efficient stoves to reduce pressures to unsustainably harvest trees, etc., etc., etc. This is a fantastic organization that's about as lean and mean as they come. Virtually all of our funding goes directly to making an impact on the ground.

Seed Tree Inc	81576	1	/users/profile/89374	Suraj	Client Served	5	03/09/2011	 I first heard about SeedTree three years ago when I was in my first year of Bachelor of Forestry Science.  But within a year I became a work study scholor for SeedTree in Nepal.  My experience with SeedTree is awesome.  I got a chance to learn a lot from being close with this organization.  I am involving myself in maintaining the ST KKG Scholarship and communications coordination between SeedTree and its projects in Nepal. I have got a chance to offer my young vision into project formulation and implementation. Conserving and renewing the  endangered ecosystem with human ecology is not easy task in present situation but also SeedTree has succeeded to make a example in this field by implementing different working modalities and project such as Nursery management and tree plantation, information and Environment Education Class, Bio Gas, Alternative Energy etc. SeedTree believes and focuses on an action oriented program which directly benefits the ecosystem. SeedTree, though having limited fund, is doing a great work in community level. The output from limited resources is making SeedTree more effective. If SeedTree is able to increase funds, then more activities in field will result.

ENE is a great resource for articulate and non-partisan assessments of environmental issues and challenges affecting Eastern Canada and New England states.  Currently at stake are the budgetary constraints of state and local governments to continue investments in long-term energy efficiency plans.  To date, ENE has proven itself a remarkably effective champion of green industry and cleaner environmental standards that will positively impact job growth and state budgets over the long-term.

While fostering the Shepard he was determined to have an infection and desperately needing a teeth cleaning.  After hours of transporting and carrying this poor pup AHR paid for his blood work testing and treatment.

Almost Home Rescue of Maine / New England	247700		/users/profile/61576	Tia S	Volunteer	5	07/07/2015	AHR rescues adoptable dogs from the south that otherwise likely won't make it, and moves them up to the northeast for adoption. This all volunteer group has amazing organization, efficiency, passion, and coordination to save as many dogs as possible. Their knowledge base is extraordinary! Each dog is loved and tracked, from the south, while in transport, through adoption, and beyond so that no dog in their care is ever abandoned again. My Loki is an AHR dog, as are so many in Maine, and I have loved volunteering as a dog transporter. We need volunteers, fosters and adopters!

Not only do they receive excellent care and lots of love, but the volunteers expend an incredible amount of timefundraising and educating the community on the realities of caring for horses.The cost to feed and care for these beautiful creatures is astronmical. If anyonewould like to help; 4R opens their arms and hearts to all that wish to contributetime, ideas or money to keep these horses safe. I can't say enough good thingsabout the people and shelter. Thank you for all you do.

I was very pleased with all I have learned about this organization. While I was there and since. The work very diligently at fundraisers to raise money needed to care for these animals. The ways they go about it are amazing. Some of the things they do are for the horse community and others are things that help out just about anyone from near and far. Everything they do gives back to anyone who may help their cause. I feel very blessed to have met them and be apart of their giving to the community.

Each and every volunteer at 4R, there are NO paid positions, has a vested interest in the success of 4R. Each horse or other animal coming into 4R is handled with love and confidence. We want the animals to understand that they will have food and proper care for their health and well being.  The volunteers and board members know that each of them is as special as the animals we work with.

The quality of speakers, the superb organizational skills of FMM leadership, and impact of their continued community consciousness messages is beyond anything I've seen in twenty-plus years in the field.
Friends of Midcoast Maine	37747	9	/users/profile/38442	benh	Board Member	5	04/30/2010	I have been involved with this organization since 2003. In that time I have watched them grow and evolve to meet the needs of Maine's midcaost communities. Like many non-profits they have struggled through tough economic times, but FMM has been fortunate to emerge a stronger organization! One area in particular that distinguishes the work of FMM, is their focus on bringing community members to the table and effectively engaging them in the discussion. This ability to build community through the process will become even more critical as we face the many challenges ahead in our effort to build sustainable communities and preserve our quality of place.

Healthy Smiles for Me Inc	149990		/users/profile/200000	Susan818	Client Served	5	02/25/2013	I will be forever grateful to the help my family received from HealthySmiles. My 8 yr old son has struggled with dental issues for as long as I can remember, so when we went to the dentist and he was told that 3 more teeth had to be extracted he burst into tears, remembering the last time he had one removed while fully awake.  My heart broke because I knew the cost to have the teeth saved would be out of our families financial reach. The dentist told us to contact Healthy Smiles, and after talking with Cindy and explaining our financial situation, that we were a family of 5, I worked P/T and my husbands hours had been reduced from full time to P/T, our income was just short of qualifying for State Support - she assured me that she could help. I couldnt believe it, we were able to save two of the three teeth while he was under a mild sedation at a fantastic facility that specialized in children. It was a very positive experience for him and I will be forever grateful. Susan

She had been on an allergy medication that messes up the pH of your mouth and she got a large cavity. The tooth needed to be extracted and a space put in.

Not only did they arrange for the care and take care of the financial end of things, the issue was discovered by Cindy during an examination done at my sons school.  I am a single, working mom who makes too much money for assistance but not enough to afford dental care for either of us so organizations like this one make all the difference.  Thank you.  
Healthy Smiles for Me Inc	131989		/users/profile/177588	robert.b.belanger	Board Member	5	10/31/2012	I was honored to be asked to work with Cindy Leavitt. I had heard the stories of the children she wanted to help and how so many families are unable to afford some basic oral care for their children. These are working families that don't fit in the bracket of State Aid and sometimes it is just a co-pay that keeps a child from having the confidence to smile. Sometimes more extensive work is needed; I have children and I know what some of this cost. I can imagine how devastating I would find it to be unable to sooth my child's pain or see his confidence diminished because of a basic need or preventive measure was not afforded. I can attest that as a board member, no one takes a salary and all proceeds go directly to children that need care. Healthy Smiles 4 Me also has a fishing derby fund raiser. We are committed to bringing smiles to Maine children. Please help us do so.

The student success rate is phenomenal because this unique program, the head of school and staff  are beyond compare. What they are doing is truly amazing. Kudos to all of them.
Wayfinder Schools	133257		/users/profile/178630	dott	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/04/2012	The Community Schools at Opportunity Farm and Camden is the newly merged entity (July 1, 2011), formerly Opportunity Farm for Boys and Girls - and The Community Schools of Camden. A new alternative high school opened Fall 2011 and it is it's second year of operation (with 140 combined years of working with at-risk youth in Maine). There are 2 campuses with 2 high school programs on each campus. #1,The Residential Program is a 9 month intensive, comprehensive, strength-based program for high school age students who were unsuccessful in traditional school settings. Along with traditional academics, the students learn life skills, work at a job/apprenticeship placement, study ASL, engage in Environmental Green Initiative projects and weekly social service projects, monthly Experiential Learning Expeditions, prepare weekly meals on a budget, are Environmental Mentors with 4H Programs for younger children, utilize the Arts and critical thinking in all aspects of the program - and use Restorative School Practices for resolution of differences/conflict and to practice effective communication skills. #2, The Passages Program is a home-based teen parent program supporting students in 7 Maine counties. The major support for these students is that Community School Teachers go into the students homes - since the major barriers for high school completion for young parents are transportation, child care, and housing. Along with traditional academics, Passages students work with their teachers one-on-one in parenting and life skills, early child development with a significant emphasis on early literacy. As well, students learn job skills and work toward post-secondary education options. Graduates from both the Residential and Passages Programs have been highly successful in obtaining jobs upon graduation - and many enter post secondary education institutions. I have observed amazing growth in the students who come through this school - and have high praise for the dedicated staff who work one-on-one to move these wonderful young people into a successful adulthood.

More recently, I have been volunteering on the trail maintainers work days, to give back some modicum of the enjoyment I have gotten over the years. The workdays are well organized, so our time is useful and the camaraderie of the crew is strong. I continue to be impressed with the aesthetics of the trail routes, and I appreciate GRLT's outreach into the community to highlight the available trails and the need for conservation.
Georges River Land Trust	55344		/users/profile/57430	Connie	General Member of the Public	4	10/25/2010	GRLT is doing a great job protecting land. The garden tours are a big hit. I would love to see all the Maine Land Trusts coordinate their maps of trails and unify the graphics for a network of maps. Having the public use trails brings home the need to donate to Land Trusts.  Another thought is to have specific projects you are raising money for posted in a public way with a chart on how the progress is coming.  If a goal is visible more people join in to reach that goal. 
Georges River Land Trust	55324		/users/profile/57405	vorrei	Donor	4	10/25/2010	GRLT is a wonderful organization doing important work.  Most or all of the people involved in the organization are a real pleasure to know and to deal with.   I wholeheartedly support their work.   I do however have a couple of suggestions.   1.  I know a substantial donor to the Land Trust who was not even given free tickets to the garden tour and was disappointed not to be recognized in that way.   Obviously substantial donors should be thanked in that simple way.   2.  The process of donating an easement, which i and several friends have explored, is complicated, legalistic, and costs money to the donor beyond the gift of the easement.  Donors are also encouraged to open their land to hiking members etc.  I think steps should be taken to make this important form of donation as painless as possible, with fewer add-ons besides the donation of the easement itself.  While it is understandable that the Land Trust may incur costs maintaining a donated easement, they might get more donations if they covered those costs themselves through fund-raising.

I would be absolutely lost with out them. They are invaluable in their role. Many times they just know what to say or do, when the survivor is about to fall apart. If I'm at a lost for a question asked of me by the survivor, the volunteer is ready and able to step in and help me out, or at least can find the answer for the survivor in a time;y fashion.When I'm in the middle of a case, and am working at collecting "evidence", I cannot leave the room, thus my volunteer is my link to the "outside" world. If the patient needs a drink, or a warm blanket, the volunteer is ready and willing to do anything to help the patient/survivor feel more comfortable and once again feel in charge of their life.

Brick Store Museum	164041		/users/profile/217912	AnnaKChatterley	Professional with expertise in this field	4	08/01/2013	When I first found this Museum in 2006, I had lived in the area for quite some time and hadn't known it was just up the road, about 15 minutes away. Upon my first visit, I discovered a museum that was at once welcoming, expanding, hard-working, and interesting. Exhibitions continue to be a mix of art and history. I am amazed at the ability of this museum to produce the amount of exhibits and programs that it does each year with its limited staff.  It is a well-organized institution that really is "larger than life" in the sense that it is able to do what many mid-size museums do in a small museum's "body." The Museum is open year-round, and offers programming to match, never ceasing to put out a new event or educational program. They offer the "tried and true" All Souls Walk (a great Halloween treat!) and the Holiday Tea in the fall/winter, but are also really evolving to become a community-centered organization that tries new partnerships with surrounding non-profits and businesses. They have never done the same thing year-after-year, something is always different about the Museum when you walk in - I know from experience that this takes a significant amount of work, but the rewards for such an investment are great.   This institution is also a wonderful resource for local history. With impeccable filing and organization, the archivist and registrar are able to find almost anything you're researching. And with over 70,00 items, that says a lot. Their volunteers are truly dedicated, two of them offering almost full-time hours to the Museum, and that says a lot about an organization to me. This place is truly special, and I can't wait to see what they do next. I really encourage anyone to visit this museum and give the staff and volunteers there the courage and support they need to keep creating great experiences for visitors.

Technically this "land trust" is a "non profit" organizationBUT... this "non profit" organization does not post on its web site its total incoming revenues AND its total outgoing expenses.  WHY? As an IRS approved non charitable organization, why isn't the Brunswick Topsham Land Trust providing FULL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF ALL OF ITS PUBLIC CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND GIFTS?   There is a somewhat new Executive Director who has been in charge for a few years.  Before that, she was a member of the Board BUT...her college degree is NOT LISTED nor is her PRIOR WORK HISTORY.  What are her qualifications to be in charge and have access to so MUCH PUBLIC CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND GIFTS?   The Executive Director of the Brunswick Topsham Land Trust is in charge of a $7 million dollar capitol campaign that has been underway recently.  What exactly is this money being used for? This "non profit" also receives charitable donations from the public for membership fees, financial gifts including stocks and major financial gifts and gifts of REAL ESTATE (yes, REAL ESTATE - MAJOR GIFTS FROM THE PUBLIC!!!).  What exactly are these major charitable donations being used for?   Why is this "non profit" NOT providing FULL and OPEN PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY OF ALL THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND CHARITABLE DONATIONS IT RECEIVES???  The agenda for upcoming Board meetings are NOT POSTED so the public is not invited to attend AND the permanent minutes of its Board meetings are NOT POSTED.  The minutes of its subcommittees are NOT POSTED.   Hmmm,  there is a pattern here of non disclosure.  I wonder why the Executive Director and the President of the Board are not providing full disclosure as a non profit organization.    If you have any experience with this "non profit" land trust, report them on this website.

Bath Area Food Bank	322471		/users/profile/416315	Ann_151	Board Member	4	01/31/2017	The Bath Area Food Bank Executive Director Kimberly Gates and members of the Board recognized that students do not learn well, if they are hungry.  To help meet the needs of food insecure students; mini food pantries were started at the local high school and elementary schools.  If the families of students have run low on food due to any number of reasons, these students have somewhere to turn, that helps them get through their days.  A confidential way to them to get additional food to tide them over the weekend and vacations has been offered to food insecure students.  This helps our future generation.Ann Schroeder
Bath Area Food Bank	322423	1	/users/profile/416236	darreby	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2017	I have watched this small organization grow and thrive, ALWAYS trying to find new ways to find and feed the local hungry people - often people are nervous about asking for help. This place makes our neighbors feel welcome. And Kim Gates, the director, has made it one of her missions to get as many different groups (and individuals) in the area to come and man the Food Bank, meet the clients, and become transformed themselves through their volunteering. I wish every town in the country had such a good, efficient, loving group of people to take care of our neediest. Bless you all!
The Grace Gawler Institute for Integrated Cancer Solutions	159094		/users/profile/211214	mailmahern	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2013	It is easy to perform the glamorous; but cancer is not glamorous. To anyone diagnosed I cannot imagine a better recommendation that to direct them to the Grace Gawler Institute. Although understanding has moved on from the old reductionism it is still rare to find holistic approaches to care and treatment but I can assure anyone concerned that they will receive such an integrated  care at this most valuable Institute. Michael Ahern, on behalf of the School of Human Ecology.
The Grace Gawler Institute for Integrated Cancer Solutions	106337		/users/profile/73450	tehg	Board Member	5	02/13/2012	I am honored to serve on the Board of the Grace Gawler Institute and support its invaluable work in supporting cancer patients through the very confusing maze of often conflicting information from both mainstream and alternative sources. Grace's untiring work in researching the very latest developments in both areas and integrating them into usable protocols for clients and their oncologists is a valuable resource for those in their greatest hour of need. She continues to demonstrate a unique ability to research proven breakthroughs worldwide that often go undetected for lack of time or resources. In short, Grace is a light in a world of shadows.
The Grace Gawler Institute for Integrated Cancer Solutions	67205		/users/profile/73450	tehg	Advisor	5	02/12/2011	I have known Grace Gawler for about five years and during that time have come to respect her brilliant multidimensional approach to cancer. By researching each person's particular issues and working with their oncologist, she is able to offer the best protocols from both traditional medicine and leading edge complimentary therapies. It is this combination, in addition to the emotional dimension, that many in the healing profession leave out, that makes Grace's work so powerful for every one of the 13,000+ clients she has worked with over the past 30 years. Were I to find myself with any type of cancer, my first call would be to Grace. And now that she is working with clients via Skype, her brilliant mind and compassionate heart are available to anyone anywhere in the world.

Grace is a world pioneer for cancer support medicine and unique in that she works closely with oncologists and cancer specialists in a collaborative environment. This approach ensures the best results for her cancer patients. Grace's institute is currently widening their outreach and impact by training volunteers called "Angels of Grace' who will support cancer patients in their homes and hospitals.  
House In The Woods Military And Family Retreat	321120		/users/profile/414336	packardrl	Client Served	5	01/12/2017	I was one of two of the first soldiers to get to experience HITW. We got to go bear hunting and fishing on the lake everyday and also got to take a floatplane Ride. Paul House and his family treated us like we where part of his family. Great people and a great place to experience the great outdoors of Lee, Maine. Thank you HITW!
House In The Woods Military And Family Retreat	321118		/users/profile/414332	mabert	Volunteer	5	01/12/2017	Mike Albert  VolunteerOver four years ago I got a call from a friend Jim Zumbo telling me about House in the Woods.  I live in Maine and am a Vietnam Veteran however had never heard of HITW.  Jim is and outdoor writer from Wyoming who helped Paul raise some money for HITW.  Jim called me with a request to bring Live Lobsters to George and Terry Galliger's Camp on the lake.  Since we sold Lobsters from our hardware store this was not a problem.   Paul House was made a donation of a guided Moose Hunt by the Passamaquoddy Indians on their land.  Paul who also knows Jim contacted him to see if he could find someone to pay for a hunt and HITW got all the money.  This person paid $14,000.00 for the hunt.  It was great for HITW and gave me the opportunity to meet Paul House.  A year went by and I could not get HITW out of my head and wondered what I could do to help.  I called Paul and he said come to one of his Bear Hunts.  The great people George and Terry opened their home on the lake to all the Vets and others who came.   I ended up helping them cook, washed dishes, cooked Lobsters and even went with George to the Dump.  Nice man who let HITW use their home on the lake for six years until he passed away last year.   I have helped on three different Moose hunts so far and have made some good friends from some of the guides to the Vets who attended the hunts.  I still wanted to do more for HITW and got a group together to put on a Golf Scramble at Martindale Country Club in Auburn, Maine on May 22nd this year.   We have a great group helping.  One is a man who lost his son in Iraq six years ago three Vets and a owner of a car dealership.    We all see the great things HITW is doing and with the new Lodge they are just getting started and will do so much more.  I will continue to do what I can to help.  When you spend a week with Vets that get so much from spending time with others who can understand what they may have gone through and see how happy they are even if they may suffer from PTSD, missing legs or arms.   I always get a great feeling doing what I can to help.  I find myself watching an smiling a lot seeing the good coming from the Active Duty and Vets and their families who spend time at HITW.
House In The Woods Military And Family Retreat	321117		/users/profile/414330	smoulton	Donor	5	01/12/2017	House In The Woods is a great organization designed to help veterans and their families.   I became aware of the organization by watching Welcome To Lee, Maine, a movie about the town of Lee and two Gold Star families that live in the town.   After watching the movie, I knew I needed to help them in any way possible.   The company I work for has done several fundraisers and will continue to help them in any way possible.   I was fortunate enough to experience what they do first hand, as my Dad and I went on a fishing trip with them.    I was amazed at the healing atmosphere experienced on the trip.   I knew it was a good program, but after experiencing it first hand, I am a true believer in the program.   
House In The Woods Military And Family Retreat	320934		/users/profile/413996	BrenFaye	Volunteer	5	01/07/2017	Approximately two years ago one of my clients, Rich a resident of Maine, advised me of a project which he knew would interest me. (Rich is a Vietnam veteran). He sent me a video link to watch of the House in the Woods pre-construction site when it was basically an area in the woods of Maine where some trees had been cleared, where stood Paul House explaining his vision for a retreat for veterans, explaining his inspiration came after losing his son in Iraq in 2007.In July 2016 Rich asked me if I would work with him to raise some funds and, at the same time, make more veterans aware of this new retreat. He sent his plane and pilot to Plymouth, MA to fly me to Maine where I was invited to House in the Woods to meet with Dee and Paul House.The day I toured the lodge the HVAC system was being installed and sheetrock was being delivered the following day. Since then much has been accomplished at the construction site. It is getting very exciting!Ive always been an advocate for the veterans. My son Marc joined the Corps as a member of the 3rd RECON Unit and remains a steadfast Marine. Many of my family and friends served, some in Vietnam and some in Korea.  One of grandsons will be leaving for the Army within weeks. Sadly, my sisters grandson, Matt Bean of Pembroke, MA was also KIA in Iraq June 2007. Matt was 22 years old.My goal is to make a large group of people aware of the need to financially support this great retreat for all veterans from all wars/conflicts, from every state in the United States and those who are actively serving.

Over this time, I have personally observed and been involved with the outreach, coordination, and education efforts of the ASWM.  They have been instrumental in assisting states and tribels improve wetlands and water quality protection programs.  I have learned and applied considerable information obtained through conversations with other state and tribal representatives during ASWMD conferences and hosted training events.  The ASWM is on the cutting edge of what is happening in the field of wetlands and water quality legislation, regulation, and litigation.  They also instrumental in assisting states and tribes to coordinate on a variety of issues, ranging from reviewing Corps of Engineers Nationwide Rermits to partnering with NGOs to increase the public's awareness of the importance of wetlands and to developing new and inovative ways to enhance, restore, and protect them.

The professional expetise ASWM provides to state, tribes, and others has made all the difference in helping me to develop an award winning state wetland program (Environmental Law Institute Award for Wetland Program Development 2007).  What I really appreciate about ASWM is their leadership putting on webinars and conferece calls, writing technical and policy papers, and coordination with others states on pertinent  issues facing wetland management and protection.  The information is accurate and timely and their website is loaded with valuable resources.  Executive Director, Jeanne Christie has been great to work with and has provided tailored and practical assistance to evaluate our state's statues, rules and practices and worked with me to developed recommendations to advance wetland and riparian protection.  As Siskel and Ebert say, ASWM gets "Two Thumbs Up"!

ASWM serves a critical role in the wetland community as a clearinghouse of cutting-edge wetland science and policy information.  Additionally, ASWM bridges the chasm between state and federal wetland managers and facilitates much-needed dialog between the two.  I highly support the work done by the Association, and consider their work to be highly ethical.

The expressions on their faces are beginning to harden ... they look bored, alienated, almost disgusted. Those are not the expressions I see on the kids in the afternoon programs at STAR ... they are enthusiastic, happy, interested, engaged. What makes the difference is they have not been abandoned by the grown-ups around them. They are treated with respect yes, but still guided by grown-ups interested in sharing new skills and new experiences. So they stay oriented and part of life, not disoriented and sidelined.

Special Surfers	252600		/users/profile/340684	GailHC	Volunteer	5	08/11/2015	This is a life changing event for all that participate.    From the special surfers, to their parents, to the Special Ops surf teams that help the mobility challenged surfers, to the surf team volunteers who tirelessly keep the enthusiasm and fun in the surfing, to the "land volunteers" who make sure the special surfers and their parents are welcomed and suited up for their afternoon of fun - this is a tremendous event that just keeps giving to all involved.   To see a child who has challenges, not want to touch a wet suit get transformed into a smiling kid who does not want to leave the water, you can't imagine what a significant event this truly is.   It is now run three times during the summer months and the participants are looking for more!    This entire event is managed through the hard work of Nanci Boutet and her team and about 300+ volunteers who give their time enthusiastically on the day as well as some very special donors.    I've never seen anything like this and am privileged to be just a small part of a very big idea.

Or the tears rolling down my face as her mother? My child looks 'normal' however she is far from it. She struggles to learn to read and write, struggles with friendships, intense feelings, debilitating anxiety and more. She has been kicked out of programs, bombed out of others. With Aquaholic's Special Surfer's program she is surrounded by caring volunteers, in water- which she loves- and gets to experience success. Now she has something she can talk about at school.        Amazing!!!  From a very grateful Mom.

The smiles and joy and sheer fun had on both sides of the board are beautiful.  With the help of Special Surfers, my children overcame fear, and nerves, and pain.  They were just 2 kids out on the waves learning to surf and soar.  Thank you for giving them that experience, that freedom!  
Resources First Foundation	94455		/users/profile/109240	Lynn W.

With their help we now have a mapping function where landowners can find foresters who fit their needs.  This is a great service to members of the Association of Consulting Foresters and to the public.
Resources First Foundation	92571		/users/profile/106232	Eric H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	The Resources First Foundation offers essential, organized information that empowers landowners to make wise decisions as they consider ways to conserve their lands.  In Connecticut, 90% of the states forests are in private ownership, and over half of these private landowners are 65 or older. Despite the need for landowner information, the University of Connecticut no longer has a dedicated extension forester, the states Forestry division is under-resourced, and the federal government is similarly reduced due to budget cuts. This makes private resources for private landowners like RFF even more critical.

I was very impressed with the whole process. Years later, and I still follow AVP to see how they're doing, and periodically see if a show is near me so I can go see one again. When my child is old enough, I'll be taking him too.... Every school should have them come in, and I'll be pushing my son's schools in years to come to bring them in too.

Day One	201983		/users/profile/263596	dcranshaw	Board Member	4	06/06/2014	Youth are vulnerable and oftentimes need, or could use, help from outside their family and community to avoid or deal with substance abuse.  Resources for providing help are limited and dwindling, presenting another challenge to the safe development of our son's, daughters, nieces and nephews. For decades Day One has been a stable provider and leader in the effort to promote education, prevention and treatment of substance abuse amongst youth.  Addressing the threat from many directions (home, community, schools, judiciary, corrections and more) Day One provides alternatives to address the diversity of individual and family needs.   Alcoholism was ramped in my parents generation and with many of my relatives, including my father.  When my children began matriculating into their teens and I became aware of the level of abuse within our community, observed the denial amongst parents, questioned the effort of law enforcement, parents and the schools to address the growing problem and mourned the tragic loss of drunken teens in automobiles, I knew this was nothing like the partying with which I was familiar growing up.   I worked to revitalize a local community group that had floundered only to watch it fade away again over time.  Lack of resources, lack of continuity, and the absence of a true community effort continue to undermine local populist efforts.  Day One has the experience, resources and commitment to help communities and individuals.  I became a member of the Board of Directors almost two decades ago because it was obvious this non-profit agency was a leader with a genuine mission.  They provide quality services, are proactive in developing and adapting to new/alternative treatment, and most importantly focus on their clients and potential clients needs, not on financial profit.  The agency and staff are in sync together, living the mission.  Few organizations can even begin to match the credentials and personality of this bedrock in our community's and state's efforts to weather this storm and help our youth avoid the destruction posed by substance abuse.

Otherwise, I think they'd probably even get better treatment at a pet store of all places! (I put client served though my little cat and I are both being neglected by this sham)
Animal Refuge League Of Greater Portland	235451		/users/profile/319015	rositapete	Volunteer	1	12/14/2014	 This is the worst animal shelter for cats I have ever visited.  The animals are kept in small cages,  and despite the existence of one room for free-roaming, it is kept empty.  I visited  a particular cat that won my heart for weeks, and for weeks it had a sign saying volunteers could not touch him.  He sat in that cage with matted hair hanging off and finally, I started to remove the mats myself.  He was gentle, loving and did not deserve the "no touch" sign.  When I could stand his treatment no more, I went to adopt him and was told he was transferred but the staff were not permitted to tell me where he was.  To further promote this cat's misery, the facilities director told me he was transferred and adopted.  Assuming this to be a lie, I continued to search for him and finally adopted him from the New Hampshire ASPCA on Memorial Day.  His paperwork indicated that on the day that I went to ARLGP to adopt him, he had not yet been transferred.  I am disgusted with the treatment this cat received and with the lies I was told to prevent this animal from being given a good home.  The welfare of the cats here is not important.  What is important is the egos of the staff and their imperious right to promote misery for the animals. The New Hampshire shelter was wonderful!
Expanding Opportunities	318517		/users/profile/409704	Jwatkins1	Donor	5	11/08/2016	Expanding Opportunities is an ernest organization working to help street children and orphans obtain food, clothing, shelter, education and medical care. They strive to reunite children with family members. They run an African Crafts and Art store called Aina Moja to help fund their projects and at the same time, it supports struggling artisans in Kenya. They run a nature camp in Maine to teach children wilderness and survival skills. Expanding Opportunities has founded and built a home for street children and is working to provide public education services in a rural Kenyan area. All of their work is good and their director is very hard working.
Expanding Opportunities	220814	1	/users/profile/284505	ainamojashop	Donor	5	10/08/2014	Expanding Opportunities is a wonderful small  non-profit organization  that helps support it's six projects in Kenya. I focus on the Artisan Support Project, Aina Moja.  Items are purchased from Kenya at Fair trade... mainly from artists  who live back in the bush... Artist who cannot go into town to sell their wares because lack of funds or disabilities and such... We get to know the artist and their story.   Their wares are brought back to the USA and sold online and at a very small shop located downtown Belfast,  Maine. Once the artwork is sold the funds go back into the project to  help support more artists as well as Expanding Opportunities  Street Kids Project.  Funds help send our Boys and Girls to School.  It goes towards the school fees, uniforms, school supplies as well as their food..   To learn more about Expanding Opportunities,  I wish everyone would take a moment and look at the website..www.exop.org and www.ainamoja.com  
Carrabassett Valley Academy	196302		/users/profile/256621	CVA_grad_dad	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/24/2014	As a parent of a CVA graduate, I saw first hand how the small, caring community assisted my child in developing confidence, the ability to overcome adversity, the pursuit of individual dreams and goals, and learning time management skills.  In public school, my child was just another number but at CVA my child was valued as an individual.  Even though my child wasn't the strongest athlete, the same personal attention was afforded by teachers and coach as they gave to the top athletes.  I highly recommend the school for those kids who have a love of winter sports.  I would also tell their parents that the school put as much attention into the academics as they do to the athletics for which they're known.
Carrabassett Valley Academy	112793	2	/users/profile/153518	cvaexperience	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/23/2012	Great snow sports program!  CVA also has a few great teachers.  If the level of nepotism at the school was corrected the overall student experience would be enhanced significantly.   Looking back on our child's high school experience at CVA I would asked to talk to other parents of students with no school affiliation to get unbiased feel for the CVA experience ahead.

CrossWalk Community Outreach	100157	1	/users/profile/121731	missym	Volunteer	5	11/02/2011	This organization is well run. The people are polite, caring, and professional. They help many people in our area and they go above and beyond to make people's lives better. They have free nutrition classes, blood pressure screening for free, help everyone with food and run a class act.  They even helped out our town when we lost power during Hurricane Irene, offering meals free of charge and a smile. We are a better community because of them. The most important thing they offer is a sense of community. They work with local schools, counselors and other agencies to help provide clothing to needy children in our district and emergency food boxes to anyone in need. They also do the "Coats for Kids" program and this year will help the "Toys for Tots" collect toys and may even feed the volunteers a meal free of charge while they are sorting the toys out. They are also strong advocates for the hungry, meeting with various boards and organizations and getting the message about hunger issues.  They are passionate in what they do and it shows.

Mano en Mano | Hand in Hand	106077		/users/profile/65393	LMThomas	Board Member	5	02/06/2012	Mano en Mano is a great nonprofit because they are able to do so much with so little.  The board, staff, director, community and volunteers are all totally committed to making Mano en Mano as successful as possible.  By making Mano en Mano successful, we are making the families, students, and individuals we serve successful too.  We are all working towards the day that our organization will no longer be needed.   Right now we provide educational support services, help with interpreting and translating, provide low-income housing, create opportunities for cultural expression and enrichment, and advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves.  And, we want to do more. If the future, we hope to create an Educational Resource Center that will help individuals, students, families, and businesses find the resources that they need to be successful.  Resources like classes for ESL, Spanish, home ownership, personal finance, and business development and individual instructional programs that can help students focus on the areas where they need the most help. Supporting Mano en Mano can help make this happen.
Mano en Mano | Hand in Hand	62320		/users/profile/65393	LMThomas	Board Member	5	02/01/2011	I first started working with Mano en Mano in the summer of 2010.  I worked providing educational services to migrant youth working in Maine.  During that summer, I experienced first hand the huge difference this organization made in the lives of the people that they served.  Through Mano en Mano, many families are able to access services they would be not be able to otherwise.  They can have an interpreter at a doctor's appointment.  They have access to affordable housing.  They are supported in their education with scholarships, GED classes, English classes, and tutoring.  They can documents translated for them.  Without Mano en Mano, many adults, children, and their families would have to face the difficult challenges of trying to be successful alone.
SENATOR GEORGE J MITCHELL SCHOLARSHIP RESEARCH INSTITUTE	227944		/users/profile/291655	bethany1	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	My daughter is a Mitchell Scholar, and not only does she get an annual scholarship to help pay for college, she also gets unique leadership opportunities, assistance with internships, and financial support through fellowships to pursue her dream.It's amazing to me that one deserving student at EVERY high school in the state of Maine is chosen each year as a Mitchell Scholar.  What a way for George Mitchell to support our talented students!
SENATOR GEORGE J MITCHELL SCHOLARSHIP RESEARCH INSTITUTE	42981	8	/users/profile/43736	piper	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2010	The Mitchell Institute is a wonderful organization run by an incredible staff.

The state of Maine is lucky to have this available to it's youth.
Harvest Hills Animal Shelter Inc	153933		/users/profile/204750	compassion4animals	General Member of the Public	2	04/09/2013	I have adopted three cats from this shelter and I donate my time and supplies whenever possible.  This shelter has several volunteers who are extremely dedicated to the best interest of the animals while in the shelter and as they are being adopted.  The shelter is clean, and the health of the animals is well-monitored.  There is lots of room for improvement with the public relations, promoting adoptions, screening, matching, and supporting adopters.  Much more enthusiasm needs to be inspired in the reception staff.  There are so many fundraising events supported by the community, but never any adoption events or outreach that I've seen in the past 6 years.  I strongly believe that all animal shelters should have a trainer on staff or on call at least part time.  Any dogs surrendered to the shelter should be formally temperament tested upon intake and any issues worked on with a trainer or at least a volunteer.  I have been informed that several dogs were euthanized for behaviors that were likely due to the stress of confinement and could have been modified with minimal training.I hope that the board will address some of the weaknesses in the operation of this potentially wonderful shelter.  They do help many animals, and they coud help many more with some inspiration and updated protocol.
Harvest Hills Animal Shelter Inc	147434		/users/profile/167808	AES2	Volunteer	5	12/30/2012	I volunteered here for eight months in 2010.  The animals are loved and well-cared for.  Staff and volunteers keep all the animal areas clean and help to socialize the cats and dogs.  Harvest Hills staff are very professional, friendly, and talkative.  I never felt like a burden when I needed to ask a question about the daily routine or animal care.  I have adopted three cats from here and all are social, loving, and definitely grateful to have a forever home! If you don't like dealing with animal poop or have senstivities to cleaning materials like bleach, this volunteer job might not be for you.  Harvest Hills also have opportunities to be involved in fundraising, so if you'd rather stay clean, ask how to help in other ways!
LA ARTS	98358		/users/profile/116800	Karen Montanaro	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2011	It is my pleasure to thank and praise L/A Arts for their invaluable work in Lewiston/Auburn schools. Ive been a visiting artist for over 20 years now, bringing mime, dance and movement to children and teens of all grade levels.  I have taught in hundreds (thousands?) of schools and have been hired by many arts organizations.  In my experience, L/A Arts stands out as a leader, not only in their commitment to the arts in education, but also in their understanding of what enrichment really means and how to make it happen. This year, I am particularly grateful to L/A Arts for a unique workshop-experience that they designed for three elementary schools and me.  This spring, Caite Carson-Gabriel (Arts in Education Coordinator) arranged for me to teach a core group of students from each school.  The only requirement for acceptance into this core group, was that students express a genuine interest in working with me. At Caites prompting, students were prepared for my workshops in such a way as to maximize the educational experience for all of us.  That is, students visited my website and learned about my professional career before I arrived.  They also knew that there would be zero-tolerance for discipline issues.  In other words, even before I arrived at the school, L/A Arts made sure that the students had high expectations of me, as their teacher, as well as high expectations of themselves as students.   With such preparation, the success of these workshops was virtually guaranteed.  I found myself teaching at a new level, spontaneously inventing new exercises and challenges for these eager students.  Their level of participation brought me to new heights in terms of how I communicated and functioned as a teacher and guide to discovery.  I was delighted to see the students focus their attention and participate in every challenge with energy and enthusiasm.  I was particularly rewarded to see their obvious joy and surprise when their performance exceeded even their own expectations. I hope that L/A Arts is given every opportunity to continue their invaluable work in Lewiston/Auburn schools.  It is an honor and privilege for me to be included in L/A Arts progressive and committed vision.
LA ARTS	98220		/users/profile/116633	Tamera G.	Donor	4	09/27/2011	L/A Arts' Arts in Education program is one of the greatest opportunities for children in our community to interact with and learn from professional artists. Musicians. Singers. Authors. Painters.  These wonderful artists come to our schools ad spend several days or more working with students and teachers to bring them to a new level of understanding how the arts integrate with education and our day to day lives. Without the program, too many of our students would never have a fine arts or performing arts experience. And if we do not bring an appreciation for the arts to our students, where will we find the future generation of supporters for the arts? Where will we find the creative people who will grow our economy?

Coastal Humane Society Inc	149549		/users/profile/199343	DianaU	Volunteer	4	02/17/2013	This is a great humane society that seems to do all it can with limited funds. I volunteered at the shelter in 2011 as a dog walker. The dogs were walked on long paths through the woods multiple times a day, their cages were always kept clean and dry, and the staff worked hard to maintain their mental health. The shelter was thoroughly cleaned in the mornings, and every animal was treated individually. The volunteers were treated with respect, and seemed to be honestly valued by the staff members. It was a great experience. I think that if a pet needs to find temporary shelter, this would be one of the best places for them to land. Since that experience, I moved across the country. If I was still in the area, I would love to volunteer at this organization again.

Salt Bay Chamberfest	72031		/users/profile/78762	amy gerson	Board Member	5	02/21/2011	Salt Bay Chamberfest is a non-profit music festival in mid-coast Maine founded by cellist  Wilhelmina Smith. The festival embraces the music of living composers and brings them together with their classic counterparts. The festival is a unique experience bringing world class musicians together performing in a barn in Damariscotta.  The concerts are preceded by lectures that introduce and educate the audience about the music. The experience of attending these concerts is  astoundingly powerful and intimate.
Salt Bay Chamberfest	71949		/users/profile/78668	Ginny Swain	Board Member	5	02/20/2011	I discovered Salt Bay Chamberfest when I first started summering in midcoast Maine thirteen years ago.  The wonderful four-concert chamber music festival was founded in 1995 by Wilhelmina Smith, a cellist who had recently graduated from Curtis Institute of Music, as a way to gather her musician friends and have the fun of playing together.  Since then the festival has been held every August in Damariscotta, Maine.  I continue to be impressed by the talent of these musicians and the obvious pleasure they feel while making music together.  Mina Smith's vision has made the festival a real attraction.  People from up and down the Eastern seaboard even arrange their travels so they'll be in town for the concerts.  Chamberfest brings top quality musicians such as the Brentano String Quartet, Ignat Solzhenitsyn, Jonathan Crow, and many others to perform programs around a theme, such as Spirituality in Music or Borders/Conflict/Music.  Most concerts feature a combination of pieces from the Baroque, Classical and modern periods together with works by living composers.  Often the composer is present for the performance and takes questions from the audience.  The setting is an acoustically excellent former cow barn (truly!), where musicians and audience mingle easily and the atmosphere is relaxed.   In 2010, the barn (over 200 seats) was full for every performance and Chamberfest had incredible reviews from Christopher Hyde in the Portland (ME) Press Herald.  During the two-week festival, SBC also holds two master classes in which talented young music students from Maine are coached by the visiting musicians.  These classes are open to the public and free.  And this year, for the first time, there'll be a free one-hour family concert at our local Lincoln Theater.  SBC is growing its audience and becoming more visible, while staying true to its mission.  Please check us out at www.saltbaychamberfest.org!

Pope Memorial Humane Society Of Knox County	72313	1	/users/profile/79062	KathH	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	This shelter supports 20 towns and has a dedicated group of volunteers who provided over 6,500 hours of love and labor to help the many animals living in their temporary home there (and probably many more that volunteers  forgot to enter in the log).  They do so much to find homes for these pets:  their website has photographs of many of the animals up for adoption, they place a friendly cat in several bank branches to showcase them in the community (and help customers pass their time in line more enjoyably!), they arrange volunteer medical treatments with local vets, they hold several regular fundraisers and continue to experiment with new fundraising events, and one employee has even shrink-wrapped her car with advertising for the shelter and sponsoring opportunity spaces!   Not only do they  go all out for their animal friends; they also help a lot of humans.  They provide community service opportunities for students, companies and first-time offenders, giving them a chance to learn about animals, their care and how good it feels to help out in one's community.  They also provide a place where unemployed people can take a break from job hunting to do something good and productive, meet like-minded volunteers, and receive praise and thanks from the fabulous staff for a job well done - such treatment is a huge boost to the ego of someone whose full time job is looking for employment.

No Limits Limb Loss Foundation	272524		/users/profile/361589	jeb786	Volunteer	5	11/19/2015	Camp No Limits is an incredible nonprofit organization that serves children with limb loss/difference and their families. I was fortunate enough to experience the magic that is Camp No Limits this year. I volunteered at the Maine camp location and met the most inspirational children and families. They blew me away with their sheer determination and "no limits" attitudes. The sense of community that is formed in such a short time is awe inspiring. Everyone became family. It was hard not to tear up at the end of the session when everyone was saying their goodbyes. I can't wait to volunteer again. This was truly a life changing experience.
Community Concepts Inc	99832		/users/profile/121173	housing guy	General Member of the Public	2	10/27/2011	This agency is funded mostly by the feds and State of Maine.  Unfortunately, their executives are very overpaid - especially when compared to the front line workers who make peanuts.  The administration has been in total disarray since the CEO of 30 years left.  Lots of infighting and an unwillingness to bring in new blood to help direct the organization in a shrinking govt funding situation.

PROGRESS CENTER INC	22845	10	/users/profile/23857	maintenance	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/18/2009	I have worked with people living with developmental disabilites for twelve years at The Progress Center. My primary role has been as the maintenance supervisor. This has been a unique role in that I have had the opportunity to get to know the people we support not as a staff person but just as Larry the guy who fixes things. This has been a great opportunity for me and I have learned that people are just people, whether we've been diagnosed or not. We all have dreams, desires and the same basic needs. The biggest and most positive change that I have seen is the move towards community inclusion for the people we support. When I started at The Progress Center we were a typical agency, to " protect " the people we should have allowed to grow we kept them isolated from the general public. We bused them to and from Day Program , kept them in the building doing mundane, often childish activities, herded them on a bus and took them to community activites in large groups, which scared the hell out of people in general and highlighted the disabilites of the people we support. About five years ago we started to adopt the principles of inclusion. That all people flourish doing what they are interested in and in being part of the fabric of the community. Everyone has a gift and to be encouraged to develop that gift and become engaged in the community allows people to develop. I have seen tremendous growth and progress in people's confidence and self worth by being treated with respect and dignity. One person living with a disability sharing their life with us as a classmate, team member, club member,friend, neighbor or coworker is just anouther person and has as much to offer society as anyone. There is no need and it's a great injustice for us in our ignorance and showing our disabilities and need for control to segregate our fellow human beings in special dances, seperate housing , special classes, clubs or sporting events and steal from them the chance to make mistakes and develop naturally that we all take for granted. I am very proud of the development in our attitudes and the fact the we encourage community involvement. It's not easy and requires a commitment in actions not words. There is always a choice between concience and conveinence and I'm proud of the direction The Progress Center has been moving in. L.J.

Amazon Pueblo	189255		/users/profile/246954	BenjaminAngulo	Board Member	5	11/24/2013	I have volunteered with this project for two years before it became incorporated, and I continue to be very active as a board member and volunteer in the village.  When I first visited the village three years ago it changed the way I thought about poverty, humans' place in nature, biodiversity, and what I could do to help the people whom I met in the village of La Libertad. The project's goals of helping the village by assisting them in all areas with developing sustainable business is admirable.  I believe this model helps the volunteers to have the most impact with the resources that are available. We have had volunteers who have had life-changing experiences while in the village.  We hope to be able to share incredible positive experiences with all who help support our cause.

Advocates For Children	286496		/users/profile/376566	Erika_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Giving is the greatest act of grace. Giving back has always been important to me...at least so I thought. In my mind, I was doing 'the best I could' by volunteering on select weekends at our local animal shelter, by purchasing a toy each year at Christmas for a child in need, or by donating unwanted clothing to our city's women's shelter. It wasn't until I moved to Georgia and started working at Advocates for Children in 2013 that I learned the value and the true meaning of giving.Advocates is a non-profit organization providing many programs and services geared toward the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Now, I am no stranger to studying the many socioeconomic problems that communities face. I was, in fact, a Sociology major. Contrary to my own beliefs, I was quite sheltered in seeing the reality of the hardships that many families, especially the children, endure in the face of poverty. I saw, and heard those stories first hand when I began interacting with the children at Flowering Branch Children's Shelter, one of Advocates' eight programs. I had worked at Advocates for less than two months when one of our youngest residents made his way up to my office to barter a handmade drawing for one of the lollipops in my candy jar. He was a new resident who had not yet settled in, and was quite down since we were nearing the holidays and he was separated from his little sister. In our few short minutes of conversation, it occurred to me how mature this sweet, soft spoken young boy was. At only 11 years old, he was forced to care for himself, foraging for food and finding shelter wherever possible. He shared stories of his life and experiences as if they were normal children's activities. As if sleeping in the rain, eating food from dumpsters, and traveling busy highways in the dark of night were comparable to building a puzzle, playing tag, or watching a movie. Not once did he talk about his life as if it was lacking, in fact, he was proud. He eagerly showed off his light up shoes, riddled with holes, plagued by a dying battery. He was beaming with joy when we told him that he would get Christmas gifts in just a few short weeks, not because he was excited to beef up his toy collection, but because he couldn't wait to give them away to his little sister. In his mind, she needed them more.In that moment, I knew that I had to do more. I had to give in any way that I could. I had to be an advocate for children. Because of Advocates, and that sweet little boy, I learned the value in giving my time and my talents to bring awareness to child abuse and neglect. I now take pride in meeting new people and sharing with them all of the ways that they can make a positive difference in their community. I continue on each day, hoping that one day I can inspire good actions in others. Many people equate giving with writing huge checks to charities. Financial contributions are absolutely essential when it comes to allowing organizations to continue their great work, but giving time by way of volunteering is equally as important. Advocates was the reality check that I needed to understand what my purpose in life was, and it was the catalyst that kick-started my passion for giving. I hope that my giving story will inspire YOU to love, to serve, and to give.

I am proud of and believe strongly in the staff, board and volunteers at HVWA, as well as the many communitymembers, who pour their hearts, skills and vision into making sure that HVWA's programs and services continue to grow and prosper.

Clyde Bailey Drop In Center Inc	92024	1	/users/profile/105426	Dottie P.	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2011	Im an alcoholic. My name is Dan. Ive gotten into the habit of saying those two simple phrases. They fit the curves, the angles and surfaces of my mouth now like a well-worn article of clothing fits my body. They have come to define me, just as my sweat-stained Marlboro hat and ripped jeans with dog-eared paper back in the back pocket defined me in college. I am comfortable now, with the admission of those two defining sentences. Such was not always the case, however. Like any good, real alcoholic I had spent a long time building up an image of myself that did not include powerlessness. I had sewn from my self-deceptions a coat of intentions and planless dreams that left me wondering why others did not see how good I was and how hard I was trying. When my wife, newly the mother of our beautiful son, finally asked me to leave, to just not come home from work, I was drinking every day. I would go to the pub near my office in downtown Boston on my lunch break and drink a liquid carb repast of IPA while sitting alone, devouring classic works of fantasy/sci-fi by Edgar Rice Burroughs. After work, I would stop in at the pub on my way to South Station and my bus north to South Berwick, Maine, where we were living. I would inevitably stay at the pub a few minutes too long, and miss my usual bus home. This setback would, of course, afford me the opportunity to go back to the pub, or to go to the new pub located right in North Station where I could catch a later train to Dover, NH, where my wife could pick me up. Somewhere in that meandering trek home, I would stop and procure a bottle for the ride in to work the next morning. Nothing not my wifes pleas, not the overwhelming miracle of my little boy waiting for me at home, not the quiet fear of losing my job could open my eyes to the fundamental wrongness of stowing away a bottle of brown liquor for breakfast the next day.  To open my eyes to the problem, it took my wife telling me on a Friday morning, Dan, I dont want you to come home today. I want you to get on the train after work and take it all the way to the end in Portland. I want to take a weekend apart. I can focus on the baby, and you can go to your brothers and focus on you. I didnt want to hear that, but I went. That was in November of 2007, and were now legally separated, talking together and working together as partners only to discuss our son. Since I came north, I quit my job in Boston, and have started to go to AA regularly. At 36, I now live with my parents in Raymond, Maine. Im unemployed and have been living off of and supporting my wife and son with my savings from the last 12 years. In some ways, things look grim, but in another, things look better now than they ever have. You see, Ive surrendered now, and can now, therefore, make a beginning. One place stands out in my history, as it does for so many of us in this area, as a beacon of hope and fellowship. That place is the Clyde Bailey Drop In Center in Casco, Maine.  I was so afraid when I first moved up here, so confused and befogged, that I panicked at the prospect of finding meetings to attend. It seemed such a hassle to have to thumb through my district 17 meeting book and track down the different churches and community centers where I would supposedly find my cure. Eventually, I stumbled upon the Clyde Bailey Drop In Center and found, to my comfort and delight, a group of people who seemed connected like a large and variegated family. Even better, I was told, most of them met at the Center every morning at 9 for the various formats of meetings offered. Here was a place I knew would always be there. Here was a building, inside of whose walls I felt safe and able, with the help of my new-found friends, to confront the demons I had been nourishing all these years. Here was fellowship. Here was a solution. To this day, I make just about 5 meetings a week at the Center. It has become a home to me at a time in my life when I dont have a home; unless you count my parents couch. The Clyde Bailey Drop In Center is so important because it offers people like me a safe and consistent haven to feel at home, to feel like I have a place to hang my hat among my fellows. It is where I learned that I was an alcoholic, and that I was not going to find my cure anywhere, but could secure a daily reprieve with the help of a higher power and those other alcoholics around me.  I thank God for the Clyde Bailey Drop In Center and the family Ive found there every day. The Center has made such a difference in my life, lighting my road to recovery with a beacon of hope.

If they seem to be doing anything that they enjoy or lifts there spirits the administrator will make up rules on the fly that we're not there in the policy my mother signed. We were led to believe it was a great home until mom was settled in than we noticed  what was really going on. Please avoid if you can.
Elmhurst Inc	287304		/users/profile/377288	lilypea	General Member of the Public	1	04/26/2016	This organization is shady. The little good they do is offset by the cuts they make to their consumers' services, while an elite few line their pockets. It is shameful and exemplifies how the term "non-profit" can be a misnomer. 
Martins Point Health Care Inc	149286		/users/profile/198924	Jordan15	Client Served	1	02/12/2013	This 'review' is for the Martins Point 'Health' Care in Biddeford Maine. I highly recommend going to this location if you don't care about your health and just want a doctor to tell you any problem you have is in your head so you don't have to worry while being on a ton of pharmaceuticals. I was a patient here for 3+ years. Then when I was actually sick and I mean deathly can't-get-off-the-couch-constant-pain sick I of course went to see my 'doctor'.  After a year of constantly being ignored, criticized for researching my own illnesses (and being correct in the end), constant waiting, and being told over and over 'its all in your head' I finally got fed up and decided to find a new Dr. Seriously they tried blaming 50+ symptoms on depression.. Really? I have CPPS, teeth pain, constant headaches, costochondritis, constant dizziness, and 45 other symptoms from depression & Anxiety?. Is that so? I think you need to go back to medical school.  I have lyme disease. I told them 'I think I have lyme' oh-so-many times (After being bitten by and around ticks). They said for certain "no you don't" every single time. 5-7 months later of constant severe pain and suffering along with constant tests (2k+ out of pocket on just copays alone) it was discovered that hey I actually have lyme.  Even after getting 80% better with lyme antibiotics. Even with a lyme specialist saying that I have lyme. Even after constant daily pain and then suddenly getting better they still refuse to test for co-infections and refuse to say I have lyme disease.  Note to anyone who may think they have lyme: DO NOT trust any PCP saying you don't have lyme disease. DO the research yourself. GET a specialized western blot from Igenex. GO see a LLMD. DON'T listen to ANYONE when they say all your symptoms are in your head. If you'd like any help/information in regards to lyme your more than welcome to contact me. Email: Jordan@wasted-illusions.com

United Way Of Oxford County	286497		/users/profile/376567	Kimberly_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Small local nonprofit focused on bettering community conditions and creating a healthy and safe environment for all.My charity of choice is the United Way of Oxford County. This organization has been in existence for almost 30 years and in that time has invested around 1.5 million dollars in a small rural county in Maine. Every United Way is individually incorporated and run by a local board of directors. Many people do not realize that their local United Way is a separate entity from the national United Way. United Way of Oxford County has one staff person, their Executive Director. She works tirelessly to reach out into the community and is looking to bring programs that will create lasting change. Oxford County, Maine is a rural county made up of many small towns. In 2010 it was listed as the least healthy county in the state of Maine. Many organizations came together in response to start to work to make Oxford County a healthier county, and a greta place to live, work, and play. United Way of Oxford County has joined in this effort and is putting a lot of resources towards promoting health and wellness. It plays a large role in the Oxford County Wellness Collaborative, an organization made up of community members, businesses, and other nonprofits who are all working together to create a healthier Oxford County. Most recently, the Wellness Collaborative have started to dig deeper by making strategy maps that will incorporate measures and track real outcomes of initiatives created to improve community conditions. United Way of Oxford County has played a big role in this phase. This small nonprofit is also involved in other initiatives such as their Food Pantry Project where they coordinate food drives with local businesses and donate all items to local food pantries. So far in 2015 they have donated around 400 pounds of food through this initiative. This past summer they also ran a Backpack Project. Through donations from local businesses and foundations, United Way of Oxford County was able to stuff around 450 backpacks full of school supplies and donate them to the 5 school districts in the county. They also are planning to bring in some new projects in 2016. One is called the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. This program will mail a book to a child age 0-5 every month. By the time they enter into kindergarten the child will receive 60 books. The literacy rates in Oxford County are shockingly low and this program will be a step in the right direction to have kids get excited about reading and learning. United Way of Oxford County is currently in talks with partners to try to get this program up and running. The other project they are looking to bring to the county is a Diaper Drive. SNAP and WIC benefits do not include the purchase of diapers, which are very costly. The United Way of Oxford County will set up a day where there will be several donation locations and all diapers will be donated to organizations that work closely with families with young children. This organization truly does a lot of its local community. As a very small non-profit every donation makes such a difference for the community United Way of Oxford County serves. That's my giving story. I'm proud to support United Way of Oxford County. More information can be found at www.uwoxfordcounty.org.

Maine Equal Justice Partners Inc	38216	2	/users/profile/39106	steve19	Volunteer	1	05/07/2010	I have volunteered with Maine Equal Justice for a number of years now. This organization, formed to serve low income individuals with advocacy and information about state laws, policies, and rules, as well as some Federal information has often been the leader in helping the voices of low income people in Maine to be heard. Staff members make special efforts to hear all voices and give equal treatment to all. They all understand well the pressures of living with low income, the necessities of daily life for people who must rely on various benefit programs to eat, be housed, raise their children, get heat, and more. In very informal settings the staff of Maine Equal Justice Partners helps people feel comfortable sharing information that helps policymakers and legislators understand the situations of low income individuals. Through more than 10 years of work, Maine Equal Justice Partners has made a significant difference in the lives of many residents of Maine through their tireless advocacy and structured policy discussions.

Lubec Memorial Library	212933		/users/profile/276037	wallypop	Volunteer	5	09/01/2014	The Lubec Memorial Library serves a very important role in our small seaside community in what is the poorest county in Maine.  The library has six public access computers making the opportunities of the Internet available to citizens who either don't have computers or don't have Internet access at home.  The staff works hard to make available to its patron any book in the in the Maine Library system through the lending library system.  The older Lubec population is served very well by a staff that knows their reading preferences and makes sure that those books are available for them and often delivers those books to them in the winter when they are apt to be house bound.  Most importantly, the library and its staff work hard to encourage reading amongst the communities children.  The library sponsors many different events that encourage children to read, to use their imaginations, and to see beyond the boundaries of Lubec.  Some of these programs are accomplished through the local elementary school and others the library sponsors itself, mostly in the summer time.  For example, recently the library staff collected boxes and boxes of unwanted Legoes and used them to put on a weekly Lego afternoon wherein the children could come and either  build their dreams individually or collectively.  The library is almost entirely self-supporting as it receives very little money from the town and none from the state.  It has a very small endowment and depends on donations for its operation.  Many would say that the library is the glue that holds the town together.
Maine Island Trail Association	23821	2	/users/profile/24953	Ross	Former staff	5	12/11/2009	The Maine Island Trail is one of the most well managed and well thought out land conservation projects I have ever encountered. By combining recreation and land management interests in a way that simultaneously preserves undeveloped coastline and gives people who pledge stewardship access to it they have truly made the coast of Maine a better place.MITA accomplishes all this by educating land owners, both private and Public, that there is real value in wilderness. By providing a financial link through voluntary membership fees between recreational users and land owners, MITA has forged sometimes unlikely relationships on the coast of Maine and facilitated community discussion about conservation that is long overdue. I know that there are several other organizations that have sprung up that use the ingenious MITA model of stewardship and conservation and hopefully there will be many more as MITA has proven it successful.

I look forward to,reading their updates on the birds in their care.  In rural areas of Maine, they provide an essential service.   As is the case for many non profits, they have to rely on financial and volunteer support to be able to provide the care they provide. I am learning so much from the daily and weekly posting about the avian world and the efforts we can all put forward to make our world a safer and healthier one for birds.  I have tremendous respect for the high level of skill and talent the staff and volunteers demonstrate.  They are making a difference to these beautiful creatures and  giving us all a greater understanding of the world of the birds in their care.

I say good fortune because among the areas I visited, Bath, Maine and the "Maine Maritime Museum" was top on my list.As someone interested in "Maritime History" and having retired from a Seattle Shipyard it was on top of my list to visit. Once I visited the museum it only substantiated that my desire to visit the museum was well founded.I found the docents extremely will versed in the "Maine Maritime History" as will as being friendly. My questions were answered by the person I asked or I was referred to someone who could answer my question.Last but not least the buildings and exhibits are in tremendous shape and it's easy to see the folks involved with the museum are proud of their heritage and want to share it with people who come to visit. The dory built by the folks and auctioned off was something to behold.I'll have no problem recommending your museum to anyone who is travelling to your part of this country. In fact I've told one of my brother's that he must make it a part of a future visit to your area. He has over forty closer to fifty years of experience on the water.Thanks again for making my visit to your wonderful museum an experience I'll always be pleased to have made!!!Shawn J. Murphy

Most if not all of the members of it are part of some religious cult that thinks they have a king appointed by some god but this is not mainstream and does not seem to have any connection to any reasonable christian, jewish or moslam faith. Its difficult to know exactly what their goal is because they seem to be helping themselves more than helping others. I would not support this organization myself as tis mission and accomplishments seem inflated and self serving. 
Center For Ecological Living And Learning	161306		/users/profile/213920	Dave Oakes	Board Member	5	06/24/2013	The Center for Ecological Living and Learning (CELL) offers life-changing sustainability education programs for students who believe that they can make a difference in the world: students who would like to play an active role in creating long-term solutions to problems facing our local and global communities and environment. CELL offers college semester (and short course) programs focusing on a theme of sustainability through community. Our Middle East Program has a more specific theme of sustainability and peace through community. The purpose of any CELL experience is to ignite a life-long commitment to living sustainably and to giving and receiving support for this commitment throughcommunity. During the course of a semester program, students learn about the concepts of sustainability while living in eco-villages and learning from internationally recognized partners who are modeling how a small group of committed people can make a big difference in achieving local and global sustainability.At the end of a CELL program, students develop action plans that empower them to return home andemploy what they have learned in their own lives and through implementing sustainability initiatives in their own communities. This individual and collective action is at the heart of what CELL is all about!  CELL currently offers programs in Iceland, Central America, East Africa, and the Middle East and a new U.S. based program that will showcase exemplary sustainable initiatives taking place in our own country.

FRIENDS OF MOY-MO-DA-YO- INC	226183		/users/profile/289925	Jan_54	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Co-ed day camp program started by alumnae of former all-girls Camp Moy-Mo-Da-Yo, established in 1907.  I attended as a camper/counselor for many years in the 1950s, and gained lifetime friends and values there.  Now the day camp, borne out of our 100 year reunion of our founding, reflects those values (sportsmanship, friendship, honesty, perseverance, optimism, cooperation, respect) in its mission and programs.  Along with the values, the campers sing hundreds of songs that we have recorded for them.  Most of these campers are local, underserved children, who would never have these opportunities to gain lifetime skills in a relaxed cooperative environment without financial assistance.   Parents often write letters of gratitude for the growth they've seen in the their children after their time with us.  We've provided canoes, archery equipment, and other camping gear, as well as scholarships.  More children could benefit from this healthy experience on a lovely American Camping Association certified waterfront if we could offer more scholarships.  Please consider lending your support, as each summer is a financial challenge. With advance appreciation ~Jan Saks, an eternal Green Teamer

Attending an 1870s class in the one-room schoolhouse; preparing a meal of home-grown ingredients in the "farmer's cottage," or cutting ice on the pond during a winter "live-in" --  all of these activities and many more have helped to shape visitors' understandings about times past, and about their own lives in the modern world. We're very proud of what we accomplish at Norlands, and the fact that we routinely exceed visitors' expectations. But there are always opportunities for improvement. We look forward to finding the resources needed to do even more and even better, so that we can "far exceed" those expectations.

Boothbay Region Community Resource Council	314718		/users/profile/406071	Loweran74	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2016	Every year The Set For Success Program gives all school supplies and backpacks to all the children in the Boothbay Region Elementary School.  They make sure every child has what they need to start of the school year successfully. The Boothbay Region Community Resource Council has many other programs to help our community such as Food for Thought and The Community Garden to make sure all the local children have the food they need all year.  They give fuel assistance to those in need and also have the Woodchucks that deliver wood to heat homes as well.   They offer addiction services to help our community members struggling with addiction.  I can't say how lucky we are to have the group of people in our community who started this wonderful nonprofit.  They do so much for so many.  Thank you!
Maine Grain Alliance	177976	1	/users/profile/234579	FarmerAnn	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	Simply, this organization has changed a region.  One long time resident of our town told me that she was proud to live here again because of the direct work, but also the ripple effect of the Maine Grain Alliance and it's programs and connections.  New businesses have started, tourists make the Skowhegan region a destination and not just a stop on their way north, and farmer and bakers see new viability for their businesses.  MGA's work doesn't stop in Maine.  Annually, people come from all over the country and even from abroad to attend the Kneading Conference where professional and novice farmers, millers, malters, bakers and wood fired oven enthusiasts come together to show off and tell of their crafts.  The ideas gleaned and new friendships made are taken back with participants to their homes and flourish there.  As a farmer, I can't say enough about the Maine Grain Alliance.  Farmland is going back into production around me and our profession is being honored and appreciated and supported by our community and becoming a source of pride as in its early years.  This organization is truly a labor of love as its mission is carried out by a group of core volunteers and myriad enthusiasts willing to put some elbow grease and occasionally money where there mouth is and where their hopes for their community lie.
CAMBODIAN ARTS AND SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION	59330	1	/users/profile/63965	Laura G.	Donor	5	01/01/2011	After visiting Cambodia in 2004, I become intensely interested in helping the people recover from the genocide of Pol Pot. I was looking for a charitable organization that had low overhead, spent its money on useful projects and not administration and advertising. Although there are many charities and projects I could have participated in, I chose this one because of the focus on helping young girls. Young girls are often sold into sexual slavery because the families can't afford to feed them and boys have more opportunity for work, and therefore are of more financial use to the family.  I held a fundraiser for the Cambodian Arts and Scholarship Foundation and also sent my own money to provide food, bicycles, uniforms, and education so that girls could go to school. I got handwritten updates thanking me and updating me on the progress.
