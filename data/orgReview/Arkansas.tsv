Safe Places Little Rock	154486	1	/users/profile/205317	Dee_14	Volunteer	5	04/12/2013	Working with Safe Places has been rewarding experience where I was able to come to terms with the abuse that I have experienced in my life by helping young girls deal with the destruction of domestic violence.  It has open my eyes to the need to be in ministry in that area of social justice, and it gives me hope that organizations like Safe Places exists.

Safe Places Little Rock	151325	1	/users/profile/202003	Hiding In the Open	Advisor	5	03/20/2013	My closest friend is in the third abusive relationship since we've been friends. I lost my best friend from my high school years to domestic violence and come from a family that sees women who don't obey them in adulthood as property absent without leave. I do not want to lose another friend to domestic violence. I know how prevalent it is in our society. I appreciate your site being here because when my friend is going through a rough patch I use this website to remind me of all the things I learned in 1997 when I left my own abusers.

I will continue to give substantially to make sure that this organization  is able to continue doing the work it does so professionally and with a great deal of heartfelt care. It is very easy for others who do not know to speak ill of another organization, but it is impossible to speak ill of this one when you truly believe they have saved your life and the lives of your children. I urge any and all persons to try to help Safe Places continue for many years into the future through volunteering and giving all that you can. My children are a testament to their work and not just for a few months. We have worked with them for almost eight years.

Safe Places Little Rock	123575		/users/profile/168255	lkelley19	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	Safe Places to me, is exactly what the name says. I had the chance to work with elite experienced staff. I helped teach intervention to at risk teens and could not believe how hard some of the lives of our youth really are. Being able to share my experiences with the group and listen to there problems, I became more than a advocate. To some of the youth I became a confidant, someone they could actually trust. I do believe that Safe Places changes lives for the community and families who believe in the organization.

Safe Places Little Rock	114031	1	/users/profile/155168	Daisy Rothschild	Client Served	5	06/06/2012	My family was completely destroyed by violence from my spouse against me. My four children suffered from being exposed to that violence for many years. I truly believed that I could not raise 4 children on my own. So I was trapped and had no idea how to get me and my children into a safer place. That's when I found a safe place in Safe Places. Their work was definitely a family intervention and not only was I supported, but they cared for my children as well. I tried many organizations for help over many years, and there is just none that match the kind of help Safe Places offered. Today, we are safe, on our own and thriving. From time to time, Safe Places is still there if we need help and that is so comforting. As my children grow up, issues do arise because they did not get out unharmed at all. But Safe Places helps us work through those times.

Safe Places Little Rock	113549	2	/users/profile/154505	andmtz	Client Served	5	06/02/2012	As a victim of a terribly violent assault I felt I had lost my voice. Everything around me seemed to be suffocating me. I was completely overwhelmed by what had happened to me, how it was handled, and how to move on afterwards. I didn't know how to talk to anyone about what I was going through and dealing with. I sank into a depression and just kept it all inside. I didn't know where to turn. Then someone mentioned Safe Places and their group meetings to me. I was very reluctant at first. I had already been visiting a counselor elsewhere and still felt very alone. But, I decided to come to the group and see.  I'm so happy that I did. From the very first meeting I didn't feel so terribly alone anymore. Each woman there had a different story, but we were all going through some of the same emotions. Depression, shame, disbelief, fear, anger. We were all carrying some of the same burdens. Our group facilitator was fantastic with helping us talk openly about our feelings, about the pain, about our fears, about all of what we were dealing with. Each week as I listened to these courageous women talk about their feelings I began to feel less and less suffocated, less alone. Eventually I was even able to start sharing my own feelings. I am still healing and learning to cope with what happened to me. It's a process and a journey. But, I am getting my life back, my voice back, and even my smile back.  Safe Places started me on that journey.  I am saddened that the groups have had to stop, but am in hopes that someday they can continue again.  I will continue my journey on my own for now, stronger because of the help I received at Safe Places. Thank you so much to the staff and volunteers at Safe Places, for without you I'd still be alone and weak. Thank you for helping me to find my voice again.

Working as a chaplain in the areas of military and civilian sexual trauma, domestic violence and PTSD, I have made several referrals to Safe Places.  The feedback from these women has highlighted what compassionate, skilled and understanding care they received.  Perhaps the most important comment I received was, "I finally found someone who will listen."  Kathy Findley, the Executive  Director has such a heart for women and children.  She has perservered even when there was a question about whether or not Safe Places could continue.  I am so grateful for such a place and such dedicated people in Central Arkansas.

Safe Places Little Rock	40254	8	/users/profile/41179	jennduke	Client Served	5	05/24/2010	I was a victim of domestic voilence back in 2007. I tried to get assistants through a local shelter because I couldn't go back to my apartment with my 3 kids. The shelter turned me away saying that I would need to feed and bathe my children before coming there. At this point we were pretty much homeless. I had enough money for a hotel room for the night. My last call was to Safe Places. Angela called me right back. I told her my story. For a week I was in a hotel. She got the shelter that turned me away to pay for my new apartment for 3 months until I was relocated to Texas. She also made sure that we had plenty of food, and clothes. She made sure that my children were taken care of for Christmas that year also. I went to classes at Safe Places, and learned alot about myself, and how to know if a person is an abuser or not. It is funny because now I can be just in Wal-Mart, and can see a couple. I want to grab her so bad when I can tell, and tell her that she can get out of it. The signs are so obivious now with what Angela and Safe Places has taught me. I still to this day keep up with them. They also went to all my court dates with me, and held my hand through it all. They are my angels.

Safe Places Little Rock	38946	2	/users/profile/39868	lisa21	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	I was given the opportunity to serve as Volunteer Photographer for the Princess Program a few years ago. This proved to be a very rewarding experience, as I learned so much about the young ladies - our future!
Safe Places Little Rock	38623	2	/users/profile/39506	angel-mom	General Member of the Public	5	05/11/2010	I would like to personally say thank you, Safe Places, for allowing our youngest daughter to go through your Princess Program last year. I first read about your program through an email I received and at that point I knew it was something she needed to participate in. I called Ms. Angela and from that initial contact, I knew this program would have a positive impact on my daughters life just from the sincerity Ms. Angela had for the program, itself. As a Mom, I knew it would be a great opportunity for my daughter because of the leadership skills she could develop and also the community service she would be involved in. My daughter DID NOT want to be a part of the program....at all!! But after the first day, she could not wait to come back. You see, my daughter has been bullied since 6th grade and as parents you hurt for them. Safe Places was an answer to prayer because she got a chance to share her experiences and be around other young ladies who also had similar experiences. She also learned that there are so many forms of bullying. She also got the opportunity to be a part of teaching other young people how to handle situations, similar to her experience. I can not say enough about how wonderful Ms. Angela, Ms. Kathy and the entire staff made her experience in the Princess program one she will never forget. She is now such an advocate that every opportunity she gets to share what she experienced at Safe Places, she does. She also recruits, constantly; potential participates for the Princess program. She has a had a wonderful 8th grade year but not 100% bully free but now she is able to cope with it so much better and help other girls not suffer like she did.  The staff at Safe Places were always available to answer not only the young ladies questions but never missed opportunities to keep the parents informed about what was going on. I sincerely appreciate this program for not only existing in this community but for all the hard work that Ms. Kathy, Ms. Angela and all the staff, do to help make things better for so many women and children. We thank God for allowing us to experience some of what Safe Places offers to so many othersa place of comfort and peace. Thank You

There at Safe Places in Little Rock is where the healing began. Our advocate's name tells it all - Angela - a name that comes from the word "angel." And that is definitely what she was for my family.I actually lived in California with my children, and I had been in a shelter for a while after suffering unspeakable domestic violence at the hands of my husband. I was in hiding, and had been for a long time.  But the shelter had done all they could do for us and we needed something else. It was my advocate at the California shelter that actually found Safe Places for me when searching for options on the internet. She read all about the services they offered and felt it would be a perfect place for me to go.I emailed the director and found a compassionate listener who made me feel that they would care for me and my children and help us move forward. She probably never thought I would actually travel to Arkansas from California, but after we corresponded several times by email, I felt very safe.I packed up my two children and the few possessions we had and started towards Safe Places. Because I was in hiding from my husband, who had also abused my son, I was careful not to use any credit cards along the way for fear of being traced and found by him. He was powerful and had his ways of finding us no matter where we were.So we arrived, pretty much unannounced, on the steps of Safe Places in Little Rock, a place I never thought I would be. There we found our protective angel, someone who cared for me and my children and met every need we had. We had some very complex needs including medical needs for my son, and our advocate worked tirelessly to meet every one of them.Now, years later, I still remember our advocate as a person who moved heaven and earth to keep us safe. I have had help over many years from many different people, but none were more caring than Angela McGraw.

I truly believe there is no other agency in the Little Rock area that provides services to such a broad population.  Safe Places deals with the after effects of violent crimes, and works with community organizations to prevent future violence.  This holistic approach shows the center's dedication to ending violence against men, women, and children.

I began 3 years ago in my current position as school counselor at a rural school in Arkansas and slowly started getting the word out to kids and families in crisis about some food available on weekends through their backpack program. Now, with the support of the Rice Depot and now involved local community members, I am now feeding over 50 kids on the weekends plus a snack during the day at recess. So many kids in AR are hungry and Rice Depot offers a tremendous service to meet that need!  Thank you for all your hard work!
Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	87903	4	/users/profile/98709	Kenneth	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	Our church, Wesley United Methodists in Conway, AR has served the community for over 15 years with a food pantry. Almost from the beginning we have been associated with and depend on the Arkansas Food Bank to supply the bulk of donated food we provide to persons in need. We have served thousands of families averaging 3.5 persons each. Totaling the numbers is not possible but we have had an effect on thousands of persons lives. For the most part persons we help will come to us a few weeks or months and then become self sufficient. But there are some who have needed help for years, such as those disabled and unable to work or those with a serious illness and without funds. It has been my privilige to volunteer in this effort for the last 8 years since I came to this church and have had a close association with the rice depot.

At a professional development early in my career, I learned of the Arkansas Rice Depot and it's ability to provdie school supplies to needy students/schools. Armed with the Art Therapy training that I viewed as a way to open up the door to communication with the struggling students, I sought the resources I was unable to purchase on my own, and that began a wonderful journey with the Arkansas Rice Depot. Through the past eight years, I have had the opportunity to meet so many needs that would have otherwise gone unanswered without these generous resources provided through donations and commitment from organizations and individuals throughout the state.  Now when a student comes to me hungry, I can feed them at any time of the day. When a student's family can't afford to prepare them to return to school after the summer, I can provide the students with a brand new, stuffed backpack encouraging an excitement about the school experience.  When a student comes to me worried about the family's lost income, or inability to have enough food for the month, I can invite them to come weekly to take a pre-packed bag of weekend supplies home to combat the fear of a long, hungry weekend away from school. We have even joined with churches in the community to fill the gaps that sometimes exist between what the Rice Depot has on hand, and what we need., making it a collaberative experience. This is such a God-send, and I know firsthand the relief and encouragement the students encounter because these resources are there..

Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	87043	1	/users/profile/97615	Gina W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	     As a high school counselor in a rural Arkansas community, I see many children whose families are not able to provide adequate food in the home.  Many of these students live in extreme poverty.  Some also live with disabled parents or gradparents who exist on a fixed income.  Unfortunately, we also deal with students whose parents have made poor decisions concerning drugs and alcohol.     I can vividly recall a young man who attends our school.  At the beginning of the year, I noticed he was very thin and often appeared unkepmt.  He was also very tired and had high absenteeism.  When I called him into my office, I did so under the pretense of discussing his grades.  As we began to meet weekly, he opened up a lot about his home life.       He and his younger brother were basically raising themselves.  Their mother worked at a bar and was rarely home.  The boys had no money, little food, and few household supplies.  Eventually, I discovered the boys had one box of microwave popcorn in the home.  They would pop one bag every day after school and split the bag.       Of course, in this instance, I did have to contact Child Protective Services.  However, once their situation was resolved, I was able to provide weekly food backpacks to help sustain the boys after school and on the weekends.  Mom continued to work a lot of nights and weekends, but I could rest easier knowing the boys had quality, filling foods they could quickly prepare.       Mom has stayed off drugs while keeping her bar tending job.  Both boys have gained weight, have better school attendance, and are better socially adjusted to their teachers and their peers.  They discreetly receive their food every week in a plain, nondescript backpack.  Food For Kids has made a huge differnce in their quality of life.     This story is one of many that I could share concerning how this program has assisted students in my school.  Some are just as serious; some are less serious.  Regardless of the severity of the case, I sleep better knowing that I can immediately meet the needs of my students thanks for Arkansas Rice Depot and their Food for Kids Program.

Each delivery has been a tremendous help to our students and their families. Ms. Rowlan and her staff are always so curtious and helpful.

Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	87016	1	/users/profile/97582	Renee Gattis Holt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	As a counselor at a small school district in the Northwest region of Arkansas, I have seen many positive results from offering the backpack program. Our school district is 81% at poverty level, and the food that is sent home each weekend is greatly appreciated. The kids make sure they have their backpacks turned in every Monday morning so they can be refilled and sent home again on Friday. We have rules and guidlines that have to be followed and the kids know if they break these rules that the backpack can not be sent home with them. We have not had any trouble with it being taken out on the bus, the backpacks have been returned to be filled so this year has been a success because the ones that return the backpack every Monday are the ones that truly benefit from the food from the Rice Depot. We have had better attendance rates, and less behavior problems, and our test scores have improved. I am so greatful for the Rice Depot and all they do to help us supply our students in need with food to keep them from being hungry. We offer breakfast, lunch and a snack daily here at school so the backpacks allow them to have food in the evenings. Some of our students would not achieve very well if this was not a free service to our school. Thanks for everything.

Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	87007	1	/users/profile/97568	Charlotte	Client Served	5	04/25/2011	As a school counselor in SW Arkansas I serve many children from low-income families. Some of the children eat breakfast and lunch at school and may not eat again until breakfast the next day. The Food For Kids Program allows me to send backpacks full of food home with these children.  This would not be possible without the Arkansas Rice Depot.  It is easy too! I email a request for food, the food is delivered right to my school and I fill backpacks and the students in need pick them up on their way to the bus. 
Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	87005	1	/users/profile/97566	sgoodknight	Volunteer	5	04/25/2011	I am a school nurse in a small school district with a very high poverty rate. We have many students in need of basic essentials like food, water and school supplies. Without the help of the Arkansas Rice Depot we would not be able to supply all the children in need with a snack here at school or be able to send food home with them. Since we have partnered with Rice Depot in stamping out hunger we have seen an increase in our children's happiness, alertness and learning. Children who would not have a backpack or school supplies like the other children now do with the help of the Rice Depot. They have what they need to succeed not only materially, but emotionally. Thank you Rice Depot and everyone who volunteer their time and give their financial support for helping us love and educate our students.

Families can apply simply and it does not involve much paperwork which allows services to be spent directly where it is needed... on  food.  I can also directly see the benefits when students present hungry to school and I am able to fufill their need.  The Arkansas Rice Depot Back-pack program is a valuable program that assists families in need of food.

Our zone is a  very economically depressed area, so the need is tremendous. We have families living in our zone that cannot afford the bare essentials for life.  Food is sometimes a "luxury."   The Arkansas Rice Depot's Food For back packs program is  one of the finest programs ever!  On Monday's we have students come to my office with big smiles saying that they had really good food to eat for the weekend.  It makes a huge difference in their health and school performance.  The smiles are just a bonus for the rest of us:)  Thank you Rice Depot.   Suzanne Pitts RN BSN

It has been a wonderful experience and they have been a wonderful resource!  We have about 70 students on our backpack program and the Rice Depot has been great about donating items for these students. We have volunteers from a church come pack the items into bags for the students and then another member of the church delivers the bags of food to the different classrooms. We are very appreciative to the Rice Depot for all they do, and I would highly recommend their services to any other school that has a backpack program.

Arkansas has the highest rate of child hunger in the nation.  The are answering this need with the Food For Kids Backpack Program.  It's a simple solution - give a child a backpack with a kid-friendly meal to take home after school each day and on the weekends.  Hungry children can't learn.  They act out in class.  They get sick and miss school.  Teachers see a great improvement in both behavior and grades when kids are enrolled in the FFK program.  98% of the money donated to the Depot goes to feed people - whether it be the Food for Kids Program, Food For Families, Food for Seniors, food pantries, or disaster relief.  The Depot is accomplishing the most good with their resources.  I'm honored to be a part of their program.

This is an organization with heart and determination to see that no person in Arkansas goes to bed hungry.  The team truly loves each other and they labor above and beyond the call of duty everyday to meet the growing needs of the impoverished and homeless.  As a new employee I was instantly welcomed and put to work.  Everyday is busy and demanding, but worth it hearing the incredible stories of the lives we are helping to transform.  Children are performing better in school because they are eating regularly.  Families are able to pay their bills because the burden of rising grocery bills is lessened.  And people are reminded that they are human and loved by God.

Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	23750	1	/users/profile/24880	melissa	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	I enjoyed volunteering at the Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.  One thing that is wonderful about volunteering with this organization is that you can bring a group of all ages, and everyone can be involved on the same project.  It unifies your group and crosses age boundaries.  Our group not only volunteered, but also received a tour of the facility to educate us more on the mission and services of the Arkansas Rice Depot.  We were treated warmly by the staff and not rushed through.  I believe our group definitely has plans to go back and volunteer here again.
Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	23726	1	/users/profile/24854	djh54	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	I have been involved with this organization for several years and the work that they do providing food for the hungry students in Arkansas is amazing.  They work on a shoe-string budget and manage to serve multitudes who would otherwise go home hungry from school each day.  Our county suffered terribly from the ice storm in January of 2009 and Rice Depot provided emergency supplies for families who were without essentials during the weeks without electricity and water.  The ways Rice Depot reaches out to meet the needs of all Arkansans are so numerous they can't all be listed but our state is blessed to have this organization working for the least and the underprivileged.

Few organizations and individuals would even attempt to take on this task. But Arkansas Rice Depot does, day in and day out. This tremendous statewide, faith-based food relief agency reaches out to thousands of hungry citizens each year with creative, proven and successful programs. There is such a need to feed the hungry and care for the forgotten and downtrodden, and Rice Depot fulfills that need.I have been involved in and supportive of Arkansas Rice Depot for more than 15 years. I am a member of the Board of Directors and past Board President. I have seen firsthand the work that this organization and its dedicated staff and volunteers do on a daily basis. They make a difference in the lives of those who are hurting.
Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	23617	6	/users/profile/24734	Presbyterian Pastor	Board Member	5	12/09/2009	My experience with Arkansas Rice Depot goes back to the mid-1980's.  At that time I was a pastor serving a Presbyterian church in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Our church had a food pantry and, discovering that the Arkansas Rice Depot would make high quality rice available to us free of charge, I began, each time I made a business trip to Little Rock, to load up my station wagon with rice, which we would then repackage in 3 pound sacks together with recipes provided by ARD for distribution to our clients.  Later, as ARD expanded over the state, we picked up the rice, and later also beans, from a site in Ft. Smith.  Now coverage has spread over the whole state, with ARD trucks delivering food to over 300 pantries statewide.  My most recent experience with ARD is their "Food for Seniors" program.  Through that program an 80 year old member of our church with virtually no family and living on $600 per month that has to cover his rent and all other living expenses has delivered to his home each fourth Saturday a huge box of food.  It is quite literally "manna" from heaven for our friend, feeding him for several days and enabling him to have extra dollars with which to pay his utility bills.  His financial squeeze is such that he heats only one room of his house during the cold of winter, so you can imagine what a blessing it is when he receives food that will feed him for a week!

This is now our second year before Christmas to come serve together as a group.  Both experiences were great.  The Rice Depot staff found tasks they could complete that they enjoyed doing.  And the girls felt like they were doing something that mattered.  The staff stayed in evening hours to make this possible as well.  Another thing I appreciated was the description of the programs.  Most of these girls haven't been close to being in need and so it is an eye opener for them to realize that people nearby have basic needs.  It makes me thankful that the Rice Depot works to fill real needs in the community and provides outlets for people of all ages to serve in.

This was my second time volunteering.  I work in the downtown area of Little Rock and often see the homeless individuals. It's heartbreaking to see my fellow brothers and sisters out in the cold with nothing to eat. Our Youth Dept at my church, New Creation Bapt Church, was looking for a way to help out.  After seeing an article in the newspaper about volunteers at the Arkansas Rice Depot, I thought this would be good for our youth.  We took about 10 youth and their parents one Sat. and rolled our sleeves up and got to work.  Our kids were so excited to be helping, I don't think they wanted to go home.  The Arkansas Rice Depot also has a Backpack Program for hungry children in the Arkansas schools and I can't wait to be a part of that also.  Please endorse the Arkansas Rice Depot and help feed more hungry!  Thanks
Arkansas Rice Depot, Inc.	23577	8	/users/profile/24686	shorn	Board Member	5	12/08/2009	I have been associated with the Arkansas Rice Depot for over two years. When you see the end result of their efforts to feed the hungry, it is a heart warming feeling. It's main focus is to provide food to children via a back pack, food that can be taken home, prepared and consumed with-out adult supervision which is the case for most of these children. Without this food, many of these children would go to bed hungry as most of the time, the only food they get to eat is their school lunches. As a result, children are not as sick as often and do have better grades in school as they do not have to worry whether they will have something to eat in the evening.

It just makes me feel good to know I can contribute my time and resources to such a worthy cause. Bravo ARD!

My partner and I were looking to adopt a puppy and one night we stumbled upon Rock City Rescue.  We had never heard of it, but after further research we thought it seemed reputable ( not to mention we found a puppy we thought was adorable and a perfect fit for us), so we submitted an application to make him a part of our family.  After submission, we received an immediate response from Rock City Rescue notifying us they received the application and would be in contact with us shortly.  The next day we received a call asking if we had any questions and they provided us with their own references. We soon found out they contacted all three of our references, proving they truly care about the well-being and future care of their animals.  Shortly thereafter, we were notified Marquis was going to become a member of our family!  We were given information about his transportation to Connecticut and we were put in direct contact with his foster mom.  Now two months after adopting Marquis we are so grateful to have him in our family - his foster parents cared for him deeply and that is apparent in their continued interest in his well-being and how well he has adjusted into our home.  We cannot thank Rock City Rescue enough for the amazing puppy we can now call our own! Abby and Erinn

Their dog adopter selection process is also not transparent. I suspect they prefer people who give them donation, so first time dog owners do not stand a chance.After the bad experience, I decided to leave behind all charity intentions in me and went and bought a dog from a dog breeder.

I have fostered for just about every rescue in my area and Rock City Rescue is the only rescue that provides holistic food for foster animals. They provide all supplies needed, crates, bedding, medications, toys, puppy pads, food, etc. I've really enjoyed my experience as a foster for Rock City Rescue. I am allowed to communicate with the adopters and have always been super pleased with the homes my foster animals have received and I enjoy receiving updates on my foster animals. All of the animals I've fostered have been completely vetted before adopted. I'm very proud to be a part of this rescue.

Any homeless pet which lands in RCR's care has got a great life to look forward to.

I was not looking for a dog as we had  to put our 16 year old German Shorthair down but there was something that drew me to this dog. I contacted CASEY at Rock City Rescue but was hesitant when I found out the pups were in Arkansas and I am in New Jersey.  Did not want to deal with a puppy mill.  Well she sent me a 5 page application, called all of my references and my Vet and once approved we talked at length about my dog, who was at a foster home with siblings, and about the transport who would bring her to me.  It was so exciting and scary not getting to meet my pup ahead of time but that snowy December day the transport posted photos of all the dogs and when it pulled up all of the adopters ran to the bus. I got to see all three of her family and then she was put in my arms.  Thank you Rock City as this cute little white Shih Tzu has brought so much love to our family and was meant to be!  You are a wonderful organization and I highly recommend to every one I know!

Our vet had suggested we consider adopting/rescue another dog. Although we felt guilty since it was so soon but our vet was right. Maddy would have wanted us to love another dog and even though it would never replace her it would help our family. We went on petfinder and immediatley knew a new dog/puppy was the best medicine for our families broken heart. We began to search and a adorable litter of puppies from Arkansas fell on our radar. We immediately filled out our application with Rock City Rescue. We received a call from Casey that we were chosen to adopt!  After speaking we waited as they checked out out references. Soon after we were told that Jersey was ours and she was coming to New Jersey to her new family! Rock City was amazing and put us in touch with her foster mom..she also was amazing and sent us photos and videos of our new baby! It is very evident they truly care and want to find good homes for these animals. We can't thank them enough for their, time, dedication, and love. Jersey, her siblings and mother were rescued and because of all there hard work she is doing amazing.  She is the sweetest dog and has so much love to give. It is evident from all the love they have shown her she just melts your heart with her sweet face. Thanks Rock City for all you do and for letting us be Jersey's family!

Our family  was in need of another dog to help us ease the pain of losing our loved one and we began a search during our vacation at the end of August.  It didn't take long to find some adorable puppies that looked like just what needed.  From the beginning their communication was constant, reliable and honest. We loved how thorough they were with our background check! They love dogs as much as we do. Once our background check was complete they immediately began the process of coordinating our Lily's transfer. Everything about the process was smooth and in-line with what dog lovers would hope for and expect. We, along with three other families, met the awesome delivery crew at the same time. The pups were well cared for from start to finish. We were so happy and confident in them every step of the way. We continue to keep in contact, not only with the foster parents, but also the rest of the litter's adoptive families. We have referred our family and friends to Rock City for their rescues.

They put in a lot of effort checking references and talking to my vet to make sure he was going to a good loving home. I was informed about what River liked and was used to. I was even pleasantly surprised when he was sent with food a collar and a leash. The foster mom he had put in a lot of effort which is evident in his behavior at only 10 weeks old. They are an amazing organization that goes above and beyond for their four legged friends.

Rock City Rescue	240880	4	/users/profile/327239	KarenClark00	General Member of the Public	4	04/09/2015	I have to tell a story about an adoption that did NOT happen, but that I nonetheless had a very positive experience. I had sent an inquiry about an adorable border collie pup named Oreo (as of this writing, he is still available), thinking that my husband and I were in agreement about adopting a second dog.  I was thrilled when Casey called to tell me Oreo was still available. I asked her a lot of questions and was given very good, knowledgeable  answers that showed great familiarity with the border collie breed and its behaviors, as well as with Oreo himself. I would say we spent about 10-15 minutes talking, and I definitely gushed like a person who was about to adopt. Unfortunately, when I told my husband the good news, he expressed serious reservations about the long-term financial committment of taking on a second dog at this particular time (we have just bought our first home...need I say more?) and I was forced to contact Casey by email and tell her that I had spoken too soon and we would not be following up with a completed application. I was very apologetic for having taken up so much of her time, because time, as we all know, is one thing nobody EVER has enough of - especially anybody who works with rescue animals. I just got a return email, and Casey could not have been nicer or more gracious.  In a personal - not computer-generated - message, she set me at ease about my blunder and she invited me very cordially to look at the Rock City Rescue dogs again when we ARE ready to adopt, and you may be certain that I will!

Rock City Rescue	234650	2	/users/profile/301951	rainbowb-2A	Client Served	1	11/29/2014	I remain heart-broken, & need to tell my story.. I decided to adopt a rescue after losing 2 great dogs, one only 3 months ago. I fell madly in love with a puppy named "BINDI". After waiting 3 or so days & not hearing back, I also put an application for a puppy from another rescue. As I was filling it out, Casey Carter contacted me by phone. I was SO excited when she told me there were no other applicants & I could be sure of adopting her. I asked her a few times if she was ABSOLUTELY SURE that she was mine & she said YES. I told her of my experience with dogs, which included training, working as a vet tech, grooming, running a kennel. We were both very excited & I felt my heart lifting after feeling so down without a new puppy to love. she said she would get the process of the transport going, BINDI was in foster care. She said to fill out the application form. During filling it out, I bought a name tag, some tos, a collar, etc. I told her my lack of computer skills. After submitting it, she e-mailed me saying it was the wrong phone for 1 reference, & the vet reference was only who I used for 7 months, & she needed a longer history. I e-mailed her the numbers. Still being very happy & excited, I printed pictures of her to show, bought a crate & a gift for Casey, I was so grateful. I waited... I received an e-mail from her saying very coldly, (unlike her past warm messages), that she chose another applicant due to me giving her the wrong phone numbers. My heart was broken, I cried, & became angry. I e-mailed asking her how could she do this to me, after promising she was mine? I received no reply. I will never use another rescue for fear of this happening again. It's so disappointing & sad because of so many dogs needing homes.  LESLIE OTT      ( i should add that i was ready to volunteer before this happened)

This puppy is so well behaved and immediately adjusted to his new surroundings.  He is in great health and well trained for only being 4 months old.  I would absolutely recommend getting a dog from this rescue.  Casey, the director, gave frequent updates via e-mail and text.  It was an absolute pleasure dealing with everyone involved.  Thank you casey for a grat dog and all your assistance.

She had been so well cared for in her foster and I've talked to others that have adopted and it's office that their fosters care for the dogs and socialize them well.   Casey has also always been available to me even after the fact, and even answering about other dogs to answer questions or give suggestions, guidance!

Rock City Rescue	214493	2	/users/profile/277764	bleubomberune	Client Served	5	09/10/2014	I have always enjoyed the companionship of at least two dogs.  Companions for me and companions for each other.  When my sweet Malamute, Larissa passed (08 Aug. 11) I waited, as I typically do a few months to recover from her lose (maybe not enough mourning time) to start my search for a companion for my handsome Husky, Sandor, and of course me.  My local searches proved fruitless. I literally stumbled over the dogs water bowl when I came across Rock City Rescue.  I initiated contact with Ms. Casey Carter, inquiring about the precious Malamute "Adele".  Ms Carter explained RCR's adoption procedures and forwarded required adoption paperwerk.  The scrutiny RCR required in vetting prospective parents caught me by surprise.  the background check was equivalent to a job applicant at Langley.  RCR's diligence and care in selecting a new home and parent(s) for dogs in her care is equal to or surpasses two well-known pet rescue/adoption organizations in Jersey and one national organization for Husky's and Malamutes.  (not AMAL). Once my credentials were verified and approved  (one month) the only remaining process was "Adele's" ( changed name to Adelaide) delivery from Arkansas to Jersey.  The dog delivery service was excellent.  Adelaide's leaping out of the van into my arms was Nirvana like.  It was love, pure blissful love. It will be three years this November when Adelaide came into my life.  She and Sandor are very good together.  RCR founder, Ms. Casey Carter and i stay in touch exchanging dog stories, especially about Adelaide's initial acclamation  to her new home and her maturation into young adulthood. Ms. Carter is a caring, hardwerking professional and knows what is necessary to operate a successful dog rescue/adoption organization.  I,  without any hesitation would recommend to a qualified sentient being,  looking to adopt a dog to Rock City Rescue and Ms. Casey Carter.  
Rock City Rescue	214412	2	/users/profile/277673	crispimitch	Client Served	5	09/10/2014	Rock City Rescue is a friendly and reliable source to adopt a pet no matter where you live in the US. The price to adopt is cheap considering they make sure you get a healthy pet with all the shots and neuter/spay already taken care of. They pride themselves in keeping an open line of communication with you even after adoption incase you have any general questions that could potentially save you a trip to the vet. You can tell that Casey takes much pride in her work as well as the foster parents to these pets. Highly recommended! 
Rock City Rescue	214007	2	/users/profile/277223	Brittany Maia	Client Served	5	09/08/2014	   I came across Rock City Rescue on pet finder when I applied to adopt my Jade. Casey was prompt on getting back to me on my application process, my references told me that she was more than thorough with getting information on us and she called the dog kennel I was working at. Prior to adopting Jade I did not meet her. I listed my concerns with Casey about that and she was more than understanding and reassuring. She explained Jades temperament and personality to a T. Jade is now one of the best dogs I have ever had. I had applied for a few dogs prior to finding Rock City rescue and it was a long and honestly dreadful process. Casey made it easy for us.    I now foster for Casey when needed. She is still very prompt at getting back to me if I have a question or concern about my foster. And I can tell you that is VERY rare. I have backed out of three rescue groups because of this. When Casey says she is going to do something, she does it. That is a very hard attribute to find now. She cares greatly for her animals and I trust her completely. Whenever I hear someone wanting to adopt or foster I always recommend Rock City and tell them that Casey will try to find them the perfect pet for their needs. I am still stunned at how perfect Jade is for us. I am forever grateful to Casey and I am now forever in her debt.

If we were going to get a second dog, we wanted one that was similar in breed mix, hoping that their energy levels would match (Dezi is a VERY high energy dog).  We reached out to Casey and inquired about the adoption process, and filled out the application.  I was really surprised when I soon heard back from our references (dog walker, doggie day care, vet, mom) that Casey had reached out to all of them in order to make sure that Penny was going to the right home, asking a ton of questions about our life with Dezi in NYC.  We were ecstatic to learn that we would have a new family member coming to us soon via doggie transport.  When we picked her up, it was clear that she had been well cared for by the transport, and she was ready to come home and meet her new family! Casey immediately connected with me via Facebook, and made sure to check in to see how Penny was doing.  She still checks in with me almost a year and a half later.  Not only did Casey act as a rescue for our girl, she also served as her foster mom, nursing her through parvo.  I know that it was hard for Casey to give Penny up, but we are forever grateful that she felt that we were the right family for her.   Casey is great at what she does because she truly cares.  I continue to follow her rescue efforts and know how passionate she is about the animals that come into her life, and how picky she is about making sure that they go to the right home...I can't fault her for that.  I do, and will continue to refer people to Rock City Rescue when they mention that they are looking for a new family member.

I fell in love with her face. I immediately expressed interest. Within a few days (I was a little impatient) I got a call from Casey Carter. I filled out the application and started the process of adopting Daisy. I was amazed at the extent Rock City went through to make sure I would be a fit owner.  My vet was phoned, and all of my personal references. And I had to wait a bit, cause Daisy had to recover from her heart worm procedure. And then I found out how this amazing process works. Daisy was being fostered by Boxer Rescue of Texarkana-so I got to speak with Sandra Lippert and find out all I needed about this lovely little girl. Next, I learned about the transport! Daisy came from Little Rock Arkansas. Got Orphans Transport leaves Arkansas, delivering animals to their new owners up the coast of the  US - as far (that trip) to Vermont!   I was so impressed with the entire experience. And I can't stop telling people who I meet about this amazing rescue network.  Thumbs way up!   ROCK CITY ROCKS!

We decided on a beagle but wanted to rescue a dog rather than to buy one from a breeder. So my daughter, at only 11 years old searched through several different rescue's and found Rock City Rescue with a litter of beagle pups up for adoption. She contacted Casey herself and we began the process of adopting one of the puppies, Brigitte. Casey was always there for us and graciously, warmly answered all of my daughters many phone calls and questions. She was there for us after Brigitte was home with us and was always helpful if we needed to contact her. Casey even celebrated Brigitte's one year birthday with us this Feb., via the internet ,and seemed as excited as we were that Brigitte was growing into a beautiful, healthy dog. Casey continues to impress me with her dedication, professionalism, and enormous love for the animals she is helping. I highly recommend Rock City Rescue.

I came across a very cute little dog and inquired about him. It took 5 days to get an email back. This email requested my phone number and e mail address. I had included this info in my original e mail!  I then requested the adoption application. I finally received a phone call 7 days after expressing interest in the dog. I thought the phone call went well, she emailed the app, I filled it out and returned it the same day.  I received an email 2 days later stating they would call my references.  On Aug 24,I had expressed hope that since I would have a 3 day weekend coming up it would be great to start the 2 week trial period then. NO NEWS!!!! Then Sept 5th they emailed they were concerned that he (the dog) would be outside while I worked and that it was their policy to not adopt dogs that would be outside dogs. Again I explained that he would be indoors with me when I was home and if he proved to be house broken then I would do that. I hate to keep one in a kennel for hours. I work 4 miles from home. At this point I am aggravated and stated that I wanted the pet but felt maybe the foster did not want to give it up!! I can find one cheaper and a lot less hassle than going through this rescue! I was emailed back a short terse reply of Fine then do that! I am sorry , but I thought your job was to find these pets a good home! This sweet looking fellow surely did miss out on this good home!

Heifer Project International, Inc.	310987	5	/users/profile/402328	4possum	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/15/2016	Do not waste your money and your hope on this group. All you are doing is contributing to a group that sucks up money, sends animals into an unsustainable situation, and pays its CEO about twice as much (last report I saw was $258,000( than the average for nonprofit CEOs.  Don't be caught up in the pretty photos of animals that won't survive and prosper inthe situations they are being sent into.  What a crock. 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	280658	17	/users/profile/290123	Lisa_K	Donor	5	02/21/2016	I have been donating to this organization since 1994, ever since I personally visited their projects in East Africa.  Owning a livestock animal in Africa immediately lifts an entire family out of poverty and into the middle class.  I am impressed by how the projects are run, by local community members who determine their own criteria for chosing which family is most deserving of an animal first.  That family then must give back to the project the first offspring of that animal, such that the project is self-sustaining and eventually benefits everyone in the community.  Not only is there a rise in income (through selling milk, eggs, etc.), the family has improved nutrition, better access to primary education (which costs money), support and education about farm management from others in the project, and pride in having the resources to support themselves.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	274311	17	/users/profile/363695	Writer	Donor	4	12/12/2015	I have given to Heifer International for a couple of yrs. I would hope that most of my donation goes towards what the charity was intended for - livestock for families to make an income on and then pay forward with a contribution towards someone else in their village. I realize my expectations are high and they do have expenses. I will continue to contribute but would like their non-profit to work on lowering their expenses so that more families are affected by these donations. Please only send a small card and envelope 2x/yr for donations. The complaint of so much solicitation from Heifer International is well warranted and expensive - there goes my donation. If expenses do remain high, then perhaps a change of management is needed. Take a look at other charities that have low expenses - it can be done. Let's get back to the idea and passion of it's originators - thank you!

Since then I have been inundated with solicitations even though I already am a member.  Apparently they have a high paid CEO who thinks this a good way to run this charity. I started this year with a thought of donating a pig, but with each unnecessary solicitation, I am not down to perhaps a flock of chickens, or maybe nothing.  Maybe they have too much money and don't care if they waste it.  I was also annoyed that donations are switched by them to whatever they want.

I have been a supporter of HI's initiatives for several years and fully support their "teach a man to fish" approach by helping to provide solutions to hunger as well as providing resources to help create sustainable agricultural opportunities that help lead to financial improvement.  They are committed to providing agricultural resources that can create sustainable and long term solutions. Some may value a crop over an animal, which is fine, but I find the demonizing of leveraging animals for production (meat, wool, eggs, etc) short sighted and ill informed. HI's goal is admirable and is deserving of support.

Heifer Project International, Inc.	271243	12	/users/profile/360051	Writer	Donor	3	11/05/2015	I don't have much more experience that some of the people with their negative comments on here. Perhaps they receive donations from companies for some of these ideas, like return address labels.  But if they didn't send out their brochures, I imagine they would not last long. I know I wouldn't necessarily remember to donate. Furthermore, they aren't giving all these animals to people to eat. No, I'm not donating any rabbits, but I would imagine the goats are for milk and the bees are for many things. Noone's eating the bees. So if you don't want to contribute for these reasons, well, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going to! People in these countries need a jump start and are willing to work to improve themselves. Sounds like a great mission to support.

Heifer Project International, Inc.	253300	13	/users/profile/341471	Gigihelen	Donor	1	08/18/2015	I have a monthly donation to Heifer But with l the mailing I receive biweekly, I will not be renewing my donations.  I believe they are spending far more money on mailing than on the purposes of the donations such as buying animals etc.  a dissapointing venture on my part.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	235533	24	/users/profile/319140	Nairb	Donor	1	12/16/2014	I gave a general donation of about 50 dollars at the start of this year. I have since received disgusting amounts of mail from them. I know charities need to ask, but Heifer International brings it to a level that is beyond ridiculous. I receive something from them at least every two weeks, often once a week. It's not just a piece of paper with a return envelope, it's almost always some grandiose bells and whistles envelope with muti-textured cards and glossy fold outs of things like "FOR ONLY 30 DOLLARS YOU CAN GIVE THEM A HIVE OF BEES, FOR 50 DOLLARS YOU CAN GIVE THEM A GAGGLE OF GEESE". I half expect confetti and music on some of the larger envelopes that will appear on random days nowhere near holidays. I'm quite convinced that I'm right on track to making that 50 dollars back via mailed solicitations. I'm not exaggerating, if every envelope and "catalog" I've gotten cost .25 cents, I've been mailed at least 10 dollars. So I suppose my donation has served to solicit 4-5 people, myself included. I thought the solicitation would die down in a month or two after I gave, it didn't. I even sought out how to remove myself from the actual mailing list, but couldn't find it on their site. So I tried to ignore it, figuring they would cut ties. They are a large charity, surly they have a system of removing non-giving ex-patrons after a few months. Nope, apparently not. The train never slows down and it ever stops. Their mailings kept coming with reckless abandon. I finally had enough and seriously looked into how to remove myself from their mailing. I had to get the information from a totally unrelated website dedicated to helping people get off mailing lists. I googled the email address for this, and it actually is on Heifer's website. It's under their "Privacy Policy" and under the obfuscate question of "How do you contact us regarding your information?" It's nestled in between how you can remain anonymous (which, if you are hell bent on donating to them I IMPLORE you to do, you'll thank me.) and reviewing "your personal information". It's, by the way: remove@heifer.org; send them your full name, address, phone number (if you gave it, might be a trick to get your number, who knows), and email address you used. Good luck, because I sent the request a month ago. While it's slowed down, I've received two mails since (three really, but I requested and received the one of the three about two days later. Please also note that three mailings a month is something I consider "slowed down" from them). One was their extravagant multi-paged color glossy Holiday catalog with bees, geese, ewes, chicken, yak, and every other thing bursting at the seams. The other is something simple yet probably a bit more sinister. Every other envelope you can clearly tell is from heifer a mile off, this recent one-the one that got me on here to finally voice my problems with them- is subtle. Only my name and address on the front, with the nonprofit stamp (which tipped me off instantly). On the back, on the top flap is, "Pierre U. Ferrari" in big bold and in smaller normal writing the Heifer International address. Inside is a letter headed only "Pierre U. Ferrari" letter, a "Beat the Tax Deadline" letter, and the only paper to carry the previously omnipresent logo which is the actual contribution paper. So not only have they seemingly ignored my request and kept sending me stuff, but instead of sending me the over the top overflowing envelopes they are now sending me (and somehow this is more insulting) stealthy, mostly incognito solicitations under the auspices of the CEO.  If you need to give to them (expect your donation to go DIRECTLY into marketing and solicitation), do it anonymously. If you love receiving mail or are very, very lonely (or have an enemy whose mailbox warrants ubiquitous bees, water buffalo, chickens, and water fowl) then giving to them will solve your problems.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	197727	28	/users/profile/114251	Debra 1	Volunteer	5	04/15/2014	Heifer International's goal is to work with communities to end hunger and poverty while  caring for the Earth.  When I first heard about Heifer International, I read the information, saw the YouTube videos, and participated in a Heifer project at my church.  I knew they sponsored projects in the US and abroad.  They gave animals to families to improve nutrition and health (such as heifers that provide milk).  Part of their program included training for families in animal husbandry before they received the animals.  Each family that received animals was expected to "Pass the Gift," or give the first born animal to the next family in need, after training that family in animal husbandry.    This all sounds very good and sounds  like an organization I could and would willingly support.  But I am one of those people who want to know for sure this is what the organization does.  So I travelled for 21 day with Heifer International in the Philippines.  I met and talked with people in communities with whom Heifer works.  I listened to their stories, and I watch the respect they showed to the Heifer workers.  I watched the care they gave to their animals and how they taught others to care for the animals, so they would be ready when their animals came to them.  And I am here to say that "HEIFER INTERNATIONAL DOES WHAT IT PROFESSES TO DO!"  I listened to parents talk about the malnourishment their children suffered before Heifer came into their lives.  Parents shared with me how they were able to send their children back to school, because they sold the extra eggs, milk, etc. their family did not use.  I guess one farmer truly put it in perspective for me.  He said, "If I die, my children will weep.  If my water buffalo dies, my children will starve."  For me that was the turning point in my relationship  with Heifer International.  I am now a regular donor and have added Heifer International as a beneficiary in my will.  I volunteer for them whenever they need me, working with schools, civic organization, and churches to introduce them to Heifer and / or assist them with their Heifer projects.  In my book, HEIFER INTERNATIONAL IS THE REAL THING!
Heifer Project International, Inc.	148094	24	/users/profile/114251	Debra 1	Volunteer	5	01/15/2013	I would like to respond to the review written in October 2011 from the person who thinks Heifer recipients treat animals as a commodity.  They don't sell the animals because they can't feed them.  Before they receive an animal from Heifer, they receive training from Heifer about caring for their animals, using the bi-products of the animals (milk, manure, muscle, etc) to bring their families out of hunger and poverty and to educate their children.  They have a CAHV worker (Community Animal Health Volunteer) in each community or a nearby community that is trained by help families when their animals become sick, need vaccinations, give birth, etc.  They teach families that all members within the family have value and are equal.  They sponsor projects for women, who, in many countries, are considered less valuable than men and are not allowed to own land or animals.  As far as being a religious based group that inflicts their religious values on the projects' participants, that is not true.  They would with community members who are Catholic, Presbyterian, etc., and at no time did I witness Heifer trying to convert the Filipino natives toward any specific religion.  That is not the mission of Heifer.  Their mission is work with communities to end hunger and poverty and doing it in a manner that cares for the earth.  So, before making statements about an organization, especially one that does so much to help millions of people in the US and abroad, you might want to check your information.  Having seen Heifer doing their work up close and personal in the Philippines, I know those statements to be untrue.  And by the way, their pride in their animals is very apparent.  The animals are cleaner than any animals I have seen on farms in NC.  I have watched them wash and care for their animals  with great compassion.  The animals that end up in US supermarkets should be so lucky!
Heifer Project International, Inc.	134810	21	/users/profile/114251	Debra 1	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I became familiar with Heifer International in 2000 when I made a donation to the organization.  In 2004 I travelled with several volunteers and staff members to the Philippines to see if Heifer did what it said it did with the funds it received.  I visited Heifer projects on the island of Mindanao, Cebu, Bohol, and Luzon.  I stayed in project participants' homes and talked to them one on one.  I can say, with all confidence, that Heifer International does exactly what it says is its goal:  "To end hunger and poverty while taking care of the earth."   The project participants were some of the poorest people I have ever met, but they were the first to offer us the best they had to give.  One man said some thing to me as he tried to express to me the importance of Heifer in his life and the lives of his family, "If I die, my children will weep.  If our water buffalo dies, my children will starve."  I will never forget those words and the profound meaning they had for me.   I finally understood what Heifer meant to these people and what a change Heifer had made in their lives.  I became a volunteer for Heifer in 2004 and have continued my work as a volunteer, speaking at schools and organizations about Heifer international.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	97375	14	/users/profile/114251	Debra 1	Donor	5	09/12/2011	I became involved with Heifer Projects International in 2005 when I travelled for 21 days with Heifer in the Philippines.  Being my first trip out of the US, I had no idea what to expect.   What occurred for me was a life changing experience.  I had the opportunity to see Heifer projects in action.  I talked to the people participating in the projects and listened to them explain how Heifer had helped them to change their lives and the lives of others in their community.  They explained how Heifer had provided them "a hand up, not a hand out" and had equipped them to help other members of their community by "Passing on the Gift" of animals, knowledge, and know-how.  One man really put in perspective for me what Heifer meant to his family,  "If I die, my children will weep.  If my water buffalo dies, my children will starve."  Since that trip I have also been a volunteer for Heifer, going into schools, churches, community events, etc., and speaking about Heifer. Heifer does what it says it does, "Heifer works with communities to end hunger and poverty and protect the Earth."  I know this to be true.  I have seen it for myself.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	197432	6	/users/profile/258101	gala62	Donor	4	04/11/2014	I have been donating to Heifer for several years now. I generally only donate to local charities, but when I first heard of Heifer, I researched them and found that I really agreed with their approach - help each community to become self-sufficient. It is a practical approach that I believe in.  My main complaints/concerns are similar to ones already mentioned. When I make a donation, don't acknowledge it with another appeal for money. Also, reduce the number of appeals. Thankfully, I have not been contacted by phone. That would be a huge issue for me. I fully plan to continue my modest donations. They help out the poorest people live a better life.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	193206	23	/users/profile/252363	McGee17566	Donor	1	01/27/2014	I made a small donation to this organization at Christmastime. Since then, I have received emails, phone calls and heavy, glossy mailers sent first class postage asking for more, more, more. Now, it does not bother me that a charitable organization would be trying to solicit donations, but I feel at this point (only a month after making my donation) that my money has been swallowed up campaigning for me to give more, rather than going to the poor who I intended my donation to help. I will never donate to them again.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	192455	12	/users/profile/251283	kekort2	Donor	3	01/12/2014	I gave to this charity because I respect what they are doing globally.  They not only donate an animal to a family in need and train them how to take care if it, they also require that the family donate the first female offspring to another family in need.  And then that family must do the same.  It's what they call "passing on the gift."   Like a lot of other people have said, my donation left a bad taste in my mouth when the card they sent to say "thank you" also included requests for more money.  Saying thank you with your hand out for more is not being thankful at all.   I will say, though, that Heifer is not the only charity that does this.  I have donated to Christian Children's Fund, Samaritan's Purse, the American Red Cross, and the ASPCA, and they all do that.  It's a real turn-off.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	190688	8	/users/profile/248953	Rothfaust	Donor	5	12/14/2013	I have donated to Heifer for several years now. And every year, I'm impressed at the good work they've done, and the improvements they've made in their organization.  I would also like to mention that they've been around for sixty years, and have received hugely prestigious awards for the work they do.  I see a lot of one-star reviews here that contain things that are flat-out wrong about the organization (They don't push Christian ideology, for example.) Others involve well-intentioned people who are simply misinformed as to the facts. (Animals are a vital part of a farm's sustainable ecosystem, for example.) 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	190216	15	/users/profile/248326	hmdudley	Donor	1	12/09/2013	A couple of years ago,  I donated to Heifer as a part of a donor matching program. Donate $10, it was matched.  The problem is, they have since spent every dime of the money I donated trying to solicit more. Now, I don't mind the nice Christmas labels and address labels they send each year, but the glossy brochures and mailings I regularly receive far outweigh the very small donation I was able to afford. Further research on this charity has unearthed an unsettling amount of negative feedback. I don't regret my donation, but I won't be bothering again. 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	164195	28	/users/profile/218165	square-peg	Donor	1	08/04/2013	I made a small donation to Heifer International last December, writing "one-time donation" on my check.  Since then, I have been bombarded with phone calls and mail solicitations for more money.  The amount they are spending on the calls and printed materials has long surpassed the amount of money I sent them.  I would never give to this organization again, and I have spent time e-mailing and telephoning in order to be removed from their call/mailing lists.  Even an assurance that I would be removed from the lists from their customer relations manager has been a farce, since I received yet another solicitation three days ago.  Enough is enough!  I have reported this company to the BBB with the hopes of getting some action.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	150560	11	/users/profile/200764	caesarubicon	Donor	5	03/05/2013	I am 81 years old, and Thank God, manage to bear my infirmities and serious physical limitation.  My wife and I live on a very modest monthly income which often does not see us all trough the month.  We are THANKFUL for what we have and we have long ago decided that that there is NOTHING which approaches the reward of GIVING FROM ONES NEED and not from ones EXCESS.  So the 1st $279 we receive each month must go to WORKS such as HEIFER PROJECTS.  Our only regret is that we don't have more so we could GIVE MORE.  We are BLESSED and we simply CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO GIVE TO SUCH FOR DOING KINDNESSES WHICH WE, PERSONALLY, ARE SIMPLE UNABLE TO DO!

Heifer Project International, Inc.	150356	30	/users/profile/100431	L Thieme	Donor	2	03/01/2013	I have donated to Heifer many times in the past.   This year they called & my husband made a pledge over the phone.  When the invoice arrived, I paid it within the week.  Not surprisingly my check to them cleared the bank within the next two weeks.   Since that time, I have received 3 more invoices reminding me of our pledge & asking me to send in the amount we pledged.  I suspect that I'm going to be receiving these letters for the rest of the year if not longer- each one beginning with the line"occasionally a delay may occur in posting new gifts to our system, so please accept my sincerest apology if you have already sent in your gift & our letters crossed in the mail."  Right- likely they are just hoping that we've forgotten we sent it in, or that someone else gets the mail & sends in another.  It's been months now & I'm officially fed up.   
Heifer Project International, Inc.	150067	14	/users/profile/200088	gmajackie	Donor	5	02/25/2013	Heifer International is not a "christian based" charity as some have stated.   They do NOT try to force any form of religion on the recipients of their gifts.  They are concerned with helping people to survive and better themselves by giving them the knowledge and tools to take care of any animal given.   Before a recipient receives an animal Heifer investigates the land and discovers what animal will be able to survive in the prevailing conditions.  Also they educate the recipients on how to protect the land from over use by the animal given and how to use the animals by-products (manure, etc) to enrich the earth.  Recipients are given all the information and training needed to keep their animal(s) healthy and feed while at the same time not further destroying the land.  I believe this is one of the best "direct to the needy" charities around.   Knowledge acquired and then shared continues on and on.  Heifers' goal is to give the poorest people the chance to change their lives by giving them knowledge along with the gift of an animal.   I tell everyone who wishes to give me something, to give a donation to Heifer International instead.  I do not need a card saying they gave in my name...nor do i need a fancy receipt from Heifer when i donate.  Charity is charity.  Yes, I list them on my taxes but proof comes in the form of credit card statement or sometimes even a canceled check!  If the IRS doubts me...no big deal, it is not like i am giving millions.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	149637	21	/users/profile/199501	HAACKE SUSAN	Donor	2	02/19/2013	I have supported Heifer International for a number of years now, however I was somewhat disturbed and disappointed to get a call this past weekend from a paid solicitor trying to get me to make a donation.  I don't know the finanacial details, of course, but telephone solicitation is, I bleieve, an expensive way to get donations.  I do hope that Heifer Int'l abandons telephone solicitations, as I won't be giving any money that way.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	145919	6	/users/profile/192525	QueenMama	General Member of the Public	1	12/04/2012	Instead of giving to Heifer International (a Christian-based org), I give to Plan Canada (no I am not Canadian). The difference is that I'm not forcing Christian beliefs on other faiths (mostly Muslim), but I do not get a tax break, nor should anyone expect one. That's what "charity" is all about, people. And that's OK with me. At least with Plan Canada I know where my gift is going without forcing Christianity on folks who already have their OWN faith. Go to plancanada.ca/greatgifts. Big NO to Heifer.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	139761	14	/users/profile/185891	Joyce childers	Donor	1	11/15/2012	My 7 gift cards to be sent to receipients did not include the extra specific message. One was written as if the receipient made the donation to her last name from her first name. There is no email access for answering questions. Telephone personnel was very uninformed. Had to give the complete order twice and was read back the messages and they still did not appear.  I will NOT dionate again.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	125939	8	/users/profile/66945	amyc	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Heifer Foundation locates needy people in needy countries and teaches them how to raise animals AND share them with their neighbors, allowing them to earn enough to pay school fees for their kids and eat better and even, sometimes, afford medical attention.  Did I forget something?  And Betty's slide shows about the people who are involved in their homes makes the whole deal very real.  Thank you Betty.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	122056	15	/users/profile/166165	kcmo	Donor	5	09/08/2012	My sisters and i have donated funds to this organization for several years. We use it as Christmas gifts to each other as we do not need more stuff. I had to write, email, and finally call them to get them to stop sending me solicitations for funds. It was redundant in my case for them to try to convince a donor to donate. Finally I yelled at them on the phone and the solicitations stopped. I still donate and plan on sending a little more this year as one of my sisters went to Kosovo on business and got to eat a meal with a woman and her daughter who had received a cow. As most people know a lot of men were killed in Kosovo and so the women were left to farm on their own. The lady told my sister that the cow literally saved their lives. The milk products and the hope the gift inspired.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	107731	9	/users/profile/146271	jkenite	Donor	5	03/08/2012	I always recommend this charity to others. The objective is to provide a sustainable life, mainly to women and children. I have given since 2003. They produce a magazine that I read from cover to cover about conditions and solutions in various areas of the world. I am a much better educated person about the difficulties in the world due to their information. I then leave the magazine in doctor's offices or my university to pass along the information to others. Since the work is meant to be self sustaining, the impact of my contributions lasts beyond the animal given. I consider it more than a one time gift. That being considered, there is more impact per dollar than a gift of clothing or food. I will continue to donate in the future.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	102542	17	/users/profile/134049	MelNel88	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/21/2011	In 1980 I worked as a student in international development in Panama.  I met a development worker there who excoriated Heifer International.  He said HI's gift of an animal trapped impoverished farmers in a cycle of debt because they could not afford the necessary feed so Heifer gave them a loan for it which they could only pay back by selling the food they produced rather than eating it.  A year ago I met someone involved in HI who said they have changed.  But I don't have personal experience of that change.  It is time to sign up to make monthly contributions to my favorite charities through my employer, the University of Massachusetts, and I want to give to a charity that helps the poorest of the poor help themselves, and HI talks the right talk, but I need to know that it walks the walk, too, and does not draw the poor into a monetary system in which they start out so far behind in the game that it is a harm rather than a help.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	102432	22	/users/profile/133512	paint4paws	Donor	1	12/18/2011	After researching Heifer International, it seemed it was a reliable place to use my money to help people.  I proceeded to donate money. I felt excited that rather than using money for my own material goods, I'd be helping people in an impoverished part of our planet.  I donate to many charities, but this seemed to really get to needy people more directly to help themselves.  I envisioned donating money and marking a map to show where my donations where used.  I hoped to cover the map with my donations.  I didn't want to know a specific person receiving the donation, but rather what country/region where my funds were used.  I thought that was a reasonable expectation:  Where was my donation used?  I asked Heifer International roughly where my donation was used so that I could start marking my map, and continue to donate.  What Heifer Internation stated was they couldn't tell me where my funds were used.  Furthermore, they didn't even provide me any message (card/email/letter) to provide me of proof that I even had made the donation.  They told me to print my own statement from the website.  In fact, they seemed surprised I asked.  The whole experience left me wondering if indeed they even used my donation to help people?  Why couldn't they tell me where my funds were used if it is a honest organization?  Just how honest is Heifer International ?  Sure they show a few key places in their brochure  where donations were used, but shouldn't they have to account for every dollar? 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	102175	11	/users/profile/132367	rlc_1210	General Member of the Public	5	12/10/2011	We have donated to Heifer International for many years primarily due to the work that they conduct and the people they serve around the world. Their focus on educating the recipients of the cow, chickens, beehive and more about how to care for their animals, sustain themselves and their families from what they produce (milk, eggs, honey) and then paying forward through generosity of teaching someone else in their village and giving them an offspring to sustain their family -- and on and on -- is a charity grounded in dignity and respect. I've also had the privilege to spend a week at Heifer Ranch in Arkansas to learn beekeeping from Heifer's master beekeeper, Chuck Crimmins. This gave me an opportunity to see, first-hand, the care, dedication and belief the entire Heifer staff and organization embraces in service of others.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	101733	21	/users/profile/131119	jgroub	Donor	4	12/05/2011	I have been donating to Heifer for a number of years now; it is the main charity that I donate to each year.  I believe in its mission and its approach.  However, the one thing that always causes me pause every year is the ratio of money donated to money that actually gets spent on the program - it is "only" about 73%.  The biggest problem I see is that they spend far too much money on fundraising, mostly in the form of about 5 or 6 glossy catalogs I receive each year.  I would like NOT to receive this, and just get emails instead, to save the money for the actual program.  Unfortunately, there is no way to opt out of not receiving all the mailings.  I consider this a problem for the charity.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	101128	34	/users/profile/128517	cheryncp	Volunteer	5	11/27/2011	I am an area volunteer for Heifer International and would like to clear up some misconceptions in a previous post. The original animals Heifer donates to needy families are neither sold nor eaten. They are an opportunity for a family to earn a living through the sale of the products the animals produce such as milk, eggs, honey etc. The first offspring of the animal is passed on to another needy family and so on. I have been to Heifer headquarters (green),in Little Rock, Arkansas to the Heifer Ranch in Perryville, Arkansas, and on a study tour to Armenia and I can assure you every cent that is contributed to Heifer International is well spent. Heifer does not give people an animal and leave them, they are there educating them on the care of the animals, supplying veterianary care and help in producing feed among other services. Heifer is one of the most transparent agencies you will find. I am proud to be a part of this organization that has been around since 1944 and has helped many people become self sufficient and communities come together that once were at odds and they have empowered women and educated girls where otherwise they may not have had that opportunity.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	99543	9	/users/profile/115555	ardeth01	General Member of the Public	1	10/20/2011	Every year I send this group an email asking them to stop sending me their catalog, and every year i get their catalog in the mail!  I am totally against what they do with live animals, treating them like they're nothing but commodities to be bought and sold, sending them to poor people who then often turn around and sell them to get some money because they can't afford to take care of them.  Dealing in the animal trade does not seem to me a worthy or realistic charitable endeavor at all, and I'm sick and tired of their ignoring my repeated requests not to bother me with appeals.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	94632	12	/users/profile/109486	Betty F.	Donor	5	07/29/2011	I give monthly to Heifers, and while they do have some "office" problems whenever there is a money issue, their work makes them worth my time and money.  In my opinion, it is more beneficial to work on long-term, sustainable means of subsistence so that impoverished people are give a way to earn their living, as opposed to short-term solutions. While it is very important to treat the immediate 'symptoms' of poverty, and I am not impugning those charities in any way, I like that Heifer treats the 'disease' behind the problem.  I know the President makes over $250,000 but this is hardly obscene considering she is running a huge organization at a fraction of what other CEOs would make.   In short, I am a big fan of this charity and would happily recommend it to anyone. 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	94037	19	/users/profile/108585	Peggy Holtman	Donor	2	07/19/2011	I have long admired the work that Heifer does and was happy to contribute after the Haiti earthquake with funds designated for that effort. I began receiving requests for additional donations immediately. I currently receive solicitations via phone, email and US mail at least once per week. This is far too much time and resources spent on fundraising.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	89357	11	/users/profile/101517	Debra	Donor	5	06/01/2011	I am a agricultural conservationist by trade and am extremely impressed with the creativity that Heifer uses to tackle hunger, poverty, and the downtrodden plight of women in poverty-stricken regions.  They prove that the old adage, "give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime" is still true.  Solving complicated hunger issues through locally driven initiatives offers a hand up with dignity and causes permanent change to occur.  If I could give this organization more than 5 stars, I would.  I am confident that this organization is a good steward of donor monies. As for the comments about the CEO's salary, I  believe that the laborer is worth his/her hire.  This person is responsible for piloting a large, multinational organization dependent on donor funding which holds the fate of thousands in its hands.  Compare the salary with CEO's of for-profit corporations of similar size for a more accurate reading. 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	86861	26	/users/profile/97366	Jan Matusak	Donor	2	04/23/2011	In the past, during the Christmas Season, I have donated animals and agricultural products to my friends and family. Before I donate, I always check the Charity Navigator Website to verify Project Expenses vs. Administration and Fund Raising costs. Your organization meets expectaions in this regard, however the President's salary is too high. 
Heifer Project International, Inc.	59482	7	/users/profile/1559	J. Sparks	Volunteer	5	01/05/2011	Of all the many organizations working to end extreme poverty that I have studied, Heifer seems to me to have the best combination of pragmatism and idealism.  They recognize that the problems they wrestle with are complex and intertwined: how hunger is related to social injustice, war, environmental degradation, gender inequality, ignorance (both here and abroad), and apathy. They manage to fight all of these problems together. Founded by an extraordinary man--Dan West--after his experience doing relief work in Europe during the Spanish Civil War, this group continues to refine its methods and spread its idea that impoverished people all over the world can solve their own problems--and then go on to help others-- with just a loan of livestock and training, which they then pass on to others.  My own experiences with Heifer have included participating in various fund-raising and public outreach projects, including a joint fundraiser with the African Children's Choir and a recent banquet in California's wine country, projects that are run primarily by grass-roots volunteers--interesting, fun, passionate, wonderful people!   I have also attended two educational weekend seminars, "Heifer University 101" and the more in-depth "Heifer University 201," which were both excellent--very informative and inspiring.  So whether you want to learn more about how to fight poverty and its attendant problems, put your own shoulder to the wheel with active participation, or just send your donation dollars to a group that will spend them well and multiply them, check out heifer.org.  This is a great group.
Heifer Project International, Inc.	59024	20	/users/profile/63433	elliotjc	Donor	1	12/22/2010	My contact with Heifer Intl. has been brief, and possibly never again.  I ordered a llama online, using my PayPal account.  About an hour after placing the order I checked PayPal.  There I discovered they had made two identical charges.  I don't know if I hit the wrong button, or if they are doing something.  Immediately I sent an email message that the second charge was a mistake and to please remove it.  When no one replied, I phoned a number I found on their website.  A man with whom I talked said he would take care of it.  Meanwhile, both charges have been made to my credit card linked to the PayPal, and the PayPall account now shows that both items have been paid.  I don't know if there is any way to get this corrected, but I do know that I will NEVER do this again.  Also, I will tell my story to anyone in the world who will listen as a cautionary tale.  
Heifer Project International, Inc.	22987	11	/users/profile/24031	Tom Lyon	Volunteer	5	11/24/2009	For over 25 years Heifer International has been a major influence on my life.  For over 60 years Heifer  has been sharing resources and knowlege with limited resource farm families  across the world and in the US. I have visited projects in Honduras, Maine, New York City, and Appalachia and met impoverished people whose health, dignity and hope have been restored through Heifer's unique work.   I have been blessed with the opportunity to share these stories with schools and congregationa as a heifer volunteer, and to meet international "partners" in Heifer's work.Heifer "invests" donors funds with  marginalized men and women who, records show, respond overwhelmingly and "pass on the gifts" they receive to others, thus leading to new levels of selp-sufficiency in small rural villages worldwide.

It helps them learn to stay on task, self-direct in areas that they need more growth and training, and to have a vision for helping the community and those around them. EAST Initiative provides professional-grade software and the training needed to understand it to children who, in a few years, will be the leaders in our cities and towns. These students will have knowledge that the regular classroom cannot provide.

Kids who lack motivation or direction acquire skills and new goals through technology and the applied sciences associated with community service projects.

I CONSTANTLY hear from parents, kids, and community leaders that EAST is an outstanding program.

The program is about the students, not the marketing of instructional materials or out-of-touch exams. The EAST classroom expects the best from every student, recognizing each individual's pluses, without subtracting their so-called minuses. Students are encouraged, motivated, and yes, nudged into reaching higher and further than they thought they could go. No student idea is minimized - no 'far-fetched' concept is discounted. EAST students are given the great gift of respect, whether in elementary or high school. Skills learned in EAST can transform a community. Students with an EAST background can change the world.

Environmental and Spatial Technology Inc	220288	1	/users/profile/283939	shelly1962	Advisor	5	10/06/2014	I have been a facilitator for east initiative for just a few months and I have already seen how this program empowers children to make decisions, lead other students, solve problems, and get involved in ways they never thought they could. I am a firm believer of the flipped classroom or the fact that kids learn best when they are the ones responsible for gaining their own knowledge with the assistance of a facilitator. EAST is all of that and more rolled into a classroom that puts the technology in their hands to help them solve the issues of today. My favorite thing is that the technology is secondary to the life long skills that problem based learning allows the students to develop in a very real setting. I wish all classes could have this structure!!!

I feel the teaching takes on a holistic approach touching the body, mind and soul. Not only do they teach in areas of practical rehabilitation, they also teach practical life skills that equip these men to be productive in their personal life as well as their family lives. The inspiring thing about Shepherds Fold is the tremendous ministry that is given while running on limited funds. Shepherds Fold is a place for men to come to know Jesus, be freed from the bondage of addiction and in return they go out and become productive members of society.

I have seen great changes in some of the men. It is truly a great feeling to see them praising our Lord and living changed lives for the better. Shepherd's Fold has given these men an opportunity to change their livestyles and regain their families. The Foldi is an asset to the surrounding communities and churches.

They provide the men with a safe place to live, food, guidance and most of all love. They help the families of these men by providing diapers, food, etc while their family member is trying to get their life straightened out.  They help the men, when the individual is ready to get a job and provide transportation to the jobs and transportation to all the various church functions they attend. This ministry does not have a lot of big money backers like some of the other ministries and struggle to provide the needs for the men. I wonder sometimes how they manage to do all they do but I know God is providing because he knows the hearts of the director and knows he is reaching out , ministering, loving, and supporting these men who have done nothing more than make bad choices. That is what God wants us to do and Steve McCracken and his staff are doing just that. My son has been there and I know first hand, what this ministry has done for me and my son. I pray for God's most richest blessings so they can continue to do what they do and to be able to grow so they can help more men. There's so many more men out there wanting and needing help. This ministry deserves to be given the recognition of being top-rated because they are one of the best.

The Fold does more than teach you how to get sober it also teaches you how to function in society as a productive member. You learn where to go to stay plugged in with people doing the same thing like overccomers and celebrate recovery. I have been out of the Fold now for a little over a year and still remain sober and have got married and just had a baby girl. I also hold down a full time job to support my family. I have two step children which means there are five of us to provide for. I praises God for the Fold and the relationship I have with Him now because of the time and love that the Fold showed me.

They teach these men that they are the head of the house like the bible says and therefore; the men learn how to do this, this brings husband and wives back together and is more stable to the children that they may have.

The men there are hungering for healing, redemption, and change from their lives. Most of the men are young and have made some foolish choices.

The staff and director are very professional and help to transform the lives of men with severe addictions. My son, who is 19, has been there 80 days. He has done so well. The ministry operates purely on donations. The people who work here are selfless. The men are so lucky to have found a place like this.  i have donated money, food and other supplies on a regular basis. I will continue to support the ministry after my son leaves the 8 month program because I can see firsthand that the funds are being used properly. I work in the social work field. All recent studies show that the faith-based drug rehab programs are showing the most success  due to the angle they are able to reach the men and women. Shepherd's Fold has people on their board from a variety of religious backgrounds. This would be a wonderful non-profit to support.

I have heard their testimonies and heartfelt songs sang in our Church services.  Mr. Steve McCracken takes his position as a God called leader of this organization as important as being a Husband and Father to his family.  His family's support is also evident as they are at all the services and attend events in support of Shepherd's Fold. I on occasion am blessed to be able to give support financially to Shepherd's Fold, and I have never felt as if support they recieve was not a blessing to them and used in the best way to further this ministry.  Mr. Sam Roberts has worked hard as well to forward the work of this organization to as many men as they can serve.  He is God called as well and puts Shepherd's Fold high in his priority and his service to the Lord In my opinion, Shepherd's Fold Ministry is a priceless gift to the many families who have had their relationships restored and made even better by the walk with Jesus Christ that these men find while in the Fold.

Hats off to you, Steven, and your dedication to these men! May God continue to bless you, and all the participants in your program.

As Steven said at our CMA meeting..."we are the only Jesus some people will ever see." Let's all let our lights shine out to our communities, and share the love of Christ!

Yet, God is always the author of forgiveness, restoration, and renewal.  It is a blessing to see how God uses Shepherds Fold as His tool to reach men that desperately need Him and His favor.  Through bible study, worship, guidance, and a tremendous amount of love, Shepherds Fold guides and points men towards God and His Word.  It is always a blessing for my family and I to work or visit with the ministry of Shepherds Fold.  I am thankful to God for creating this great ministry.

Jones Center For Families Inc	102296	1	/users/profile/132993	heflin	Client Served	2	12/14/2011	As a regular user of the pool (and a donor), I'm very disappointed in the quality of the experience lately. My husband and I (try to) lap swim twice a week. I have not kept count of how many times the pool has been closed due to a problem with the bromine level, but it is not uncommon. We call ahead to see if the pool is open, but the lifeguards (whom I realize have other responsibilities) do not always answer the phone. Yesterday, for the first time, we were asked to get out of the pool in the middle of our swim due to a problem with the bromine level.  The locker/shower room is a wonderful convenience, but while the men's showers have warm (sometimes too hot) water, the women's showers are ice cold most of the time. Taking a shower in the summer isn't too bad but in the winter, it is a very painful experience. I have discussed this with three different employees at three different times, but the problem has only gotten worse. I was told to use one of the two family shower rooms (which have warm water) but these are not always available. These problems have increased in the last few months. One final issue is that we had been swimming regularly for over a year before anyone bothered to tell us that we could buy a discount card (20 swims for $15). We had been paying $2 each every time we used the pool. The Jones Center is a generous, unique gift to the community, which I greatly appreciate. However, if the situation with the pool continues to deteriorate, I will have to stop patronizing it.

I was planning my baby`s 1st year birthday and apparently the jones center was perfect.  so i called and spoke to the scheduling assistant (Lizbeth Ponce).  Who helped me reschedule for a larger room that same day.  But unfortunately for me, she mis informed me, or should i say, did not inform me that i had to pay 8 days  after the scheduling.  4 days before my babys birthday party i called to pay the reservaton, but my room had been given to someone else (i again spoke to Lizbeth).  When i asked for an explanation of why she had not mentioned the payment required within 8 days, she only said " WELL, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW OUR RULES".      So , today 11/29/2011, i have emailed and left a voicemessage to the Coordinater and the Recreation manager.  But had no Response!..  We will see if they do call. But i would recommend that if anyone planning anything at the jones center, from  a small event  to a large one.  Please, make sure you speak to someone who treats you well.

It provided for us not only an ability to participate in Russian Club of NWA gatherings, but such a big variety of activities for children and adults as well!  We are always delighted to be in this warm, welcoming, family oriented  environment, provided by great  team of workers and volunteers.    Considering that State of Arkansas is among the least wealthy ones  in the nation, and the Resession althogether,  -  the  Jones Center's free services, include an ice scating field and  a pool, look more than incredible!   Probably, it's a serious burden on Jones family and other sponsors of this venue, to keep it as it is.

I took the kittens in when they were old enough  to be spayed/neutered along with their shots.  These kittens were easily adopted afterwards and people actually PAID for the fees as a way of reimbursement. I think when someone buys a pet they tend to place more value on it and take better care of the animal. I LOVE ARKANSAS FOR ANIMALS!!!

As one of this year's American Hero Dogs John  D has brought the Association into the limelight, and folks like me (who live in other states) have been made fully aware of the hard work, dedication, triumphs and resolutions the teams have brought to so many, regardless of where they are located.  One of the most honorable and unselfish things I read lately was that John D went to his award ceremony in Hollywood sporting a new cut over his eye from a search conducted just before he left.  Clearly, his work comes first, and is his passion; nothing was more important than aiding in the search.  I hope I never have to use the services of a search team due to a catastrophe, but if I were in that position, I would want representatives from the AK Search Dog Assoc., Inc in my court!

They are a true asset to the State of Arkansas as they are made up of compassionate volunteers who wish to serve their community.      The dedication and commitment required by these volunteers, to assure these services are always available when a person is lost, is huge.

They are ready to respond in times of crisis -- whether that crisis is a tornado, a missing child, a crime scene, or some other situation in which a dog's power of scent can be put to good use.  Recently, they have expanded their mission to take part in trials to detect ovarian and thyroid cancer.  The handlers believe in the power of their dogs to do amazing things.  And they do!  When not training or on a mission, the dogs are ordinary, lovable house pets and include rescue dogs and mixed breeds.  The handlers come from all walks of life with different day jobs, but they are united by a common passion.  These dedicated volunteers break from their normal activities to activate 24/7.  They do so at no cost to those in need of their services.  This organization greatly deserves the support of their community!
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186910	5	/users/profile/243918	Jennifer291	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I would like to say I am a volunteer for the Arkansas Search Dog Association, but the truth is, I didn't have the grit to stay the course with this dedicated organization. Training sessions happen almost every week for several hours at a time, and the group is passionate about their mission, and their dogs. I did go to a few sessions and was amazed at what I saw. Dogs given a scent at a building on the south side of the Arkansas River were able to track a volunteer across a bridge to a stop on the north side --- crazy! Even my fat beagle did fairly well, but not like the highly trained dogs like John D, who I swear should be on CSI. These volunteers regularly drop everything to search for missing people, sometimes in horrible conditions, and have to be knowledgable to work with law enforcement and sensitive to the family members of those who are lost. I've also been following the work the dogs are doing with cancer research. How amazing is that?!? We are learning so much from our canine companions, and organizations like Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc., are proof that they may be the key to exciting new developments in medical research and law enforcement. 
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186908	1	/users/profile/243916	CeZi	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	ASDA is an amazing organization that does not hesitate to answer "yes" when asked to volunteer their time, their dogs and their effort whenever they are needed.  They do so whether it is for community education, response to natural disasters or to find missing persons.  The ASDA's dedication and time is given freely and with heart and passion, and lives are saved and loved ones found as a result.  Their recent work with cancer research is another example of their amazing dedication.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186866	4	/users/profile/243872	olddean	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I have followed the activities of ASDA, and particularly the work of John D, for several years.Their commitment to continuous training and finding new uses for these animals is just exceptional. They are always on call at no cost to beneficiaries and with no funding organization. The recent venture into cancer detection opens a new option for some of these animals and a life saving possibility for many people. This puts ASDA and UAMS at the frontier in a game changing activity. The accomplishments to date are remarkable but the best is yet to come!
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	185959	5	/users/profile/242932	Anne83,	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	I have learned about this wonderful organization not in person, but through the work of John D Waugh and his handler/owner, Donna Waugh.  As one of this year's American Hero Dogs John  D has brought the Association into the limelight, and folks like me (who live in other states) have been made fully aware of the hard work, dedication, triumphs and resolutions the teams have brought to so many, regardless of where they are located.  One of the most honorable and unselfish things I read lately was that John D went to his award ceremony in Hollywood sporting a new cut over his eye from a search conducted just before he left.  Clearly, his work comes first, and is his passion; nothing was more important than aiding in the search.  I hope I never have to use the services of a search team due to a catastrophe, but if I were in that position, I would want representatives from the AK Search Dog Assoc., Inc in my court!
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186858	2	/users/profile/243866	Bekka W.	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I have had the great privilege of being able to see these amazing dogs in action in general search, but more astonishingly within the confines of a hospital lab.  Thru the ASDA we have been able to utilize these amazing animals in the detection of human cancer in life changing ways; the far reaching repercussions of which we still cannot even dream.  These animals are clearly very well loved and taken care of and that is made evident through their impeccable training and skills.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186853		/users/profile/243860	speedyw5	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I've had several opportunities to see these Search Dogs in active and they are quite impressive.  Both the animals and the handlers are enthusiastic and eager to work.  The bond they share is self evident and most likely attributes to why they are so great at what they do.  I would highly recommend this group,.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186825	1	/users/profile/243831	Verna Higgins	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	What I have to say about this organization is the dogs and handlers are dedicated and serious about what they do. Many people go to their place of employment grudgingly day after day for the money they receive. These volunteers (workers)  for the Arkansas Search Dog Association (American Search Dog Association), give their money and time to the job and drop everything day or night, days to weeks at a time as needed using their own money. Never expecting money in return, to cover their expense for the person or persons they are called to find- dead or live- but are determined to find them.  Special people fill these shoes and I am glad to know them and would love to see more people become aware we should be reimbursing them, putting them on a county or city paycheck to compensate their need. Think of what it would be like without these brave soles and their canine partners who strive to do good for others.  I am not saying take away their nonprofit status, but to reimburse them their itemize cost only. I am an advocate for this organization. 
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	186799	1	/users/profile/243805	Lauren64	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	ASDA is an outstanding non-profit that provides Arkansas and other surrounding states with an invaluable service. Both the members and the dogs involved in this organization have made Arkansas a better place through their hard work and outstanding dedication. I have seen them work first hand and it is truly an incredible experience. Whether it is John D working to detect cancer or his sister Glee tracking a missing person, you will always be left mesmerized by what our canine friends are capable of achieving. The members of this organization are out to save lives, and they will do just that!

John D Waugh with the Arkansas Search Dog Association. Being a survivor of the EF5 tornado that hit our community in Joplin, Missouri I have to say I am so impressed by this dedicated K9 Search Team.  With devastation everywhere and peoples hopes and dreams just gone along with so many memories - there is one memory I will always have.  That memory is watching a team come together and through the thick of the rubble searched for 3 days for survivors and anyone that they could help.  Bringing HOPE to those who had lost everything - yet was encourage by a friendly wag of a tail and a team of highly trained professionals that knew what needed to be done.  From Search and Rescue to detecting human cancers - these dogs are amazing.  These dogs along with their handlers sacrifice so much , and give their all when the call comes.  I've never seen a team come together as I have the Arkansas Search Dog Association - Not only do they support others but are there to support each other. The Arkansas Search Dog Association is a compassionate group - nothing stops them from doing what they know needs to be done.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	185771	2	/users/profile/242738	lillian.alexandra	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	When I first contacted the Arkansas Search Dog Association, I was a writing student needing to partner with a 501c3 for a grant writing course. The ASDA president, Donna Waugh, quickly responded to my inquiries, and provided so much information about the organization that I was both overwhelmed and in love. She clearly had a passion for working with dogs, and embodies public service to a T. Through her leadership, the organization has expanded its scope, and now cross trains dogs in search and rescue and cancer detection. All of the handlers and researchers are volunteer- paying money out of  their own pockets to wade through snake-fested waters and ditches in the hopes of finding missing people. These people are brave, and get little recognition, but they continue to work and train hard every single day. Their dogs are professional, capable and heroic. Writing a grant for them was so easy because talent often speaks for itself. This group is made up of highly-educated, dedicated people, so I was thoroughly pleased when they invited me to join their team in a Communications role. I am inspired by them every day.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	185744	2	/users/profile/242710	Dingsma	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	In my experience with this organization they are willing to go where ever and whenever they are needed.  They don't mind driving for hours only to be told they are not needed, to go back home.  They drive for hours, bringing their own equipment, using their time, skills, money, not asking for pay, or restitution.  They are willing to help others, out of the caring, giving attitudes they bring with them wherever they are.  They are a compassionate group that will help any and everyone they encounter.
Arkansas Search Dog Association Inc	185214	3	/users/profile/242173	aferrando	Client Served	5	10/30/2013	The dogs trained by this organization are outstanding in every way. Not only do they frequently respond to the challenge of search and rescue, but their unique training format has enabled them to transition to the detection of human cancers. Their dogs are now participating in leading-edge research concerning the detection of human cancers in body fluids at the University of Arkansas. Results to this point have been extremely encouraging. The dedication and talent of this group, both the dogs and their handlers, is second to none. 
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	319487		/users/profile/410977	jtvandi	Volunteer	5	11/26/2016	This centre provides the perfect blend of what is needed to assist Oaxacan children to discover who they are, where they want their life journey to lead them and the tools to get there; supportive leaders and volunteers, nutritious meals, school supplies, tutors, activities and fun. Volunteers and visitors are warmly welcomed to see the program in action, changing children's lives, one child at a time. My family sponsors a student and have had the pleasure to meet him and his family. Last week we received a Christmas note with a hand written letter from our 'child', along with his school report. This organization is the answer to those who want to give of themselves, their time or their  monetary donations.

Every time I visit, I see young people learning in the computer lab and doing Spanish-English interchange with short term or long term volunteer adults.  I've volunteered here in the past when I was just a visitor to Oaxaca and I now I've been in to volunteer as a Oaxaca resident.  Visitors can just pop in for the day and spend time on whatever is needed as help on that day.
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	279463		/users/profile/332152	OSCGR	Board Member	5	02/09/2016	With my yearly visits to Oaxaca I am reminded just how important the work of Oaxaca Streetchildren Grassroots  is. In January we visited a family served by the center and the conditions of their current life in poverty reminded me why helping children who seek an education is so important. The center continues to do good work and I look forward to my visit next year. The center continues to fill a significant need in Oaxaca City and the surrounding area and is serving the children who need it most.
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	245054	3	/users/profile/332152	OSCGR	Board Member	5	06/11/2015	I have been involved with Oaxaca Streetchildren Grassroots for nearly 20 years. The transformation in the children we serve is amazing. When  I first went to Oaxaca the street children we seek to reach were shoe less, hungry, malnourished, and often in need of medical attention. Through our grassroots effort in Oaxaca hundreds have attended school and we have gone from zero university graduates at inception to more than 70 today. Through the generosity of people from around the world children who would have never had the opportunity for an education are fulfilling their educational dream and, in turn, having opportunity they never imagined.

I am excited about its future and proud to be a member!
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	269634		/users/profile/358355	John-Groton	Board Member	5	10/30/2015	Oaxaca Grassroots makes a difference in the lives of hundreds of disadvantaged students.  The volunteers, workers, and contributors to the organization help them towards their goal of fulfilling their dream of completing an education through the university level.  Without that support many would lack the opportunity to have a professional career.  The valuable time, resources, and contributors to the organization make an incredible difference in the lives of the children and the future for them and their families.  Among the best rewards for making even the slightest offer of assistance is to see the children's appreciation, their eagerness to learn, and their accomplishments.  It has been a pleasure to work with the children and sponsor a child.  It has encouraged me to return many times to the city.
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	267409		/users/profile/356139	Regina18	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I first volunteered with this organization in 1997, back when fewer than 100 children were involved and there was not yet a physical center to care, feed and nurture the many children who urgently need support to attend school and thrive. The organization's growth over the past 20 years has been remarkable, and I'm proud to continue my support. Its leaders are dedicated to the communities it serves, and work tirelessly to give participants every opportunity possible. I will continue to support Oaxaca Street Children and urge others to do the same.

School is something taken for granted by most--but not within reach of many.  Peter and I have sponsored a child for maybe ten years now...such a rewarding and affordable way to make a difference!  We visited this happy place a while ago and found the atmosphere  to be full of joy and promise.  Check them out and see for yourself.  Do it!  --Kathy in Vermont

I also make frequent trips to the city of Oaxaca and have seen first hand the excellent and important work done to make education available to Oaxaca's poorest children. The huge number of yearly volunteers is one very important aspect to keeping the staffing costs at a minimum. The majority of the funds raised by Oaxaca Streetchildren Grassroots goes to enrich the lives of our 600+ students, from primary school through university studies for those who wish to continue beyond high school. I am constantly heartened by the stories of young lives who have been definitely changed for the better!
Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots, Inc.	267050		/users/profile/355801	W. David S.	Board Member	5	10/25/2015	I first went to Oaxaca City more than 20 years ago. At that time street kids were everywhere downtown begging. These children often had no shoes, were malnourished, sometimes sick, and had no opportunity. The only source of money for their families was to beg. Sincethat time, the situation has changed for the better with the help of Oaxaca StreetchildrenGrassroots. Children that would be out begging are now in school and have a chance for a bright future and a variety of opportunities afforded to them through education. Visit or volunteer at the center in Oaxaca and see for yourself.

It's obvious that the children love being there as the place is filled with excitement and laughter.  I am looking so forward to returning in future years, and I would recommend this experience for anyone interested in improving the life of a child.

Of late we have been supporting the general fund so that program can continue its work with so many children from so many families.

During my frequent trips to Oaxaca, I have been amazed and touched by the positive changes this organization has made in the lives of so many children and young adults from Oaxaca. The staff in Oaxaca, our sponsors, and our many volunteers make it possible for the impoverished youth in our program to attend school, get extra help as needed, attend interesting and valuable workshops, and gain the confidence they need to pursue a career. Lives are definitely enriched and changed by this nonprofit, and I value my association with Oaxaca Street Children Grassroots.

She has been to two meetings with her tutor, but she feels good about herself and hopes she will be able to help her child do better in school than she did. If she couldn't go to tutoring in private I don't think she would have attempted to get help with her reading.

So many are turning to drugs and crime because they can't get jobs to support their family, not realizing that a better education is what is needed to get jobs.

Ouachita Calhoun Counties Literacy Council	42086	6	/users/profile/42831	linda31	Former staff	5	05/30/2010	OCCLC was reestablished in 2009 and it is a solid organization with a strong, outstanding Board of Directors. It receives superb support from the community's college, SAU Tech; SAU Tech's Adult Education program; and many community agencies and organizations that recognize the great need for adult literacy services to exist in the tri-county areas it serves. OCCLC began providing free one-on-one tutoring services and learning material to adults functioning on or below a 6th grade level of education in the areas of reading, writing, math/problem-solving, and English as a Second Language. It has been wonderful watching people get excited about having the additional help and resources they need and that will help them reach their goals. Although OCCLC has done awesome work in its first restart-up year through training 47 tutors, and providing literacy services to 50 adult learners, there is much ahead to do to meet the needs of all adult learners in the three, predominately rural areas in which it serves. OCCLC has the opportunity to change individual lives and the face of each community.
Ouachita Calhoun Counties Literacy Council	41688	1	/users/profile/42484	Bacall	Volunteer	4	05/28/2010	I am just getting started as a tutor for the OCCLC.  I have worked with a student whose first language is Spanish.  At first, the main goal for tutoring was to enhance his basic writing skills.  Eventually, we bagan working on conversational skills.  It was important to him to not only communicate through writing but to also learn the most basic topics to use in casual conversation.  I enjoyed working with this student and helping him accomplish his goals.  OCCLC has a lot to offer ESL students who just want to make a valuable contribution to the community that they have chosen to call home.
Ouachita Calhoun Counties Literacy Council	40736	9	/users/profile/41630	marie4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/26/2010	I have worked for Arkansas Literacy Council for 14 years, 12 as Executive Director.  I cannot recall a time where I have seen amazing results from a new grassroots literacy council in such a short period of time - since July 2009.  The council is supported with inkind rent, utilities/Internet, equipment, and bookkeeping services from Southern Arkansas University-Tech in Camden.  The chancellor wanted to be personally involved because of so many high school graduates coming to college only to discover they do not have the reading and writing skills they need. The OCCLC Board members have come through with their promises to make contacts in their churches, civic organizations, and other contacts where volunteers can be recruited for tutoring - and potential students can be encouraged to come for help. We are concluding our grants process for FY 2011. We require each applicant to send two student or tutor success stories. Three were sent this year from OCCLC.  Three students, all women, all mothers with eight children between them, and two of them single parents. I don't think these women - and many others - would have been reached without the full commitment of the OCCLC organization.

Ouachita Calhoun Counties Literacy Council	39187	5	/users/profile/40138	emeka10	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	I consider education as the bedrock of any prosperous and thriving society and the OCCLC's drive in providing adults with free basic education is simply an act of human resource empowerment and a potent seed of individual and societal wellbeing. If the objectives of OCCLC are met the effects  would be multi-sectoral. For instance, there would be able manpower to attract jobs and investment drives in our counties; more tax dollars would be available in the counties. Social safety/health campaign programs would be more meaningful and better imparted to a society with more educated populace. It is with above views that one is motivated to become a volunteer and i urge all hands to support OCCLC by way of finances, time and logistics to help plant and nurture this seed of education in our communities.

Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	289007		/users/profile/379212	mamundsen	Client Served	5	05/07/2016	We adopted our Brewy, known as Brucey to SSRR, over 2 years ago. Brewy had come from a horrific backgroung--nobody really knew what he had been through--just that he had been confiscated by the Fulton County, GA police, was very malnourished, HW+, and I would assume full of fleas. Brewy was also not socialized at all. He didn't understand that human touch could be a good thing. It took 3-months before he willingly wanted us to touch him. SSRR warned us that he would be a difficult case, and that he would not be a cuddly pet right from the start. Both Bill Lawton and his foster dad, Ian Leemans, made sure that we understood just how much work we might face if we adopted this poor abused dog. We adopted Brewy after going through a thorough background check. Even after more than 2 years, we have new break throughs every day. Sometimes we discover a little more of what we suspect might have been done to him, or maybe he will ask for just a little more love. He still has room for improvement, but he is who he is and we will always love and cherish him. I would not change what Brewy has brought into our lives for anything. Brewy had a sister who was adopted by a couple in a different state. I am facebook friends with her adopted mom as well as Brewy's foster dad. If I could adopt another or foster through SSRR I would, and maybe will someday.
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288794		/users/profile/378993	Melissa306	Client Served	5	05/05/2016	I have always had rotties and I love the breed. when I lost my last one due to kidney failure, I decided then that I was not going to buy from a back yard breeder and rescue one instead.  That was one the best things I ever did!! I have had my Shelby girl now for over 2 years and she came straight out of shelter to me, so she was a trail base considering no one knew much about her.. She is the most lovable dog and loves anything and anyone!!  I also now volunteer with SSRR helping with others trying to adopt from the rescue. The other great thing is some rescues will only take Pure breeds, where SSRR will take mix breeds of rotties, every dog deserves a chance no matter what!!!
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288788	1	/users/profile/378987	Angela152	Client Served	5	05/05/2016	My husband and me were wanting to add another rottweiler to our family, so we completed paper work to start the process of adopting a rescued rottweiler. I was so pleased how thorough their process for checking out a proper home for these babies.They're always available to answer any questions and to help if you have a problem arise. The transport with the wonderful transporters to get your rottie to you safely & pictures all along the way for you to see your precious cargo. If you foster they are top notch with getting your  Rottweiler's medical attention taken care of and they pay for their medical expenses while fostering. I would definitely foster again, but my first time I was a foster failure as you can see in picture Jada when we received her & now with her sisters. Once these rottweilers gain your trust, you'll have a loving companion for life!. Please open your heart and home up to a rottweiler in need, and watch the rottie blossom before your eyes from love. Thank you Southern States Rescued Rottweiler's for a wonderful experience! Hope to help in the future when I get an opening. 
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288745		/users/profile/378941	Tanya32	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	I have worked in several areas of the rescue and I am always willing to do whatever is necessary especially seeing how so much is taken on by so few who are all 100% volunteers. No one gets paid a penny yet most work full time jobs and work almost as much if not more with the organization. We all do it simply for the love of the breed especially with so many areas with breed restrictions as well as insurance restricting breeds as well. This results in them being dumped. They all break my heart in the beginning but provides so much joy seeing these dogs happy for probably the first time in their lives. Some have lived a long and what must have been a miserable life if they can be dumped at a shelter when they are seniors. The look in their eyes and the unconditional love they are finally able to share on both sides is the most rewarding thing anyone can ask for. My only regret is that we are not able to help more. With more volunteers, especially fosters, we would be able to help more dogs. We are not an organization that takes the dogs from one cage to another but they are placed in HOMES of volunteers. In some cases, the first real home they have ever experienced or even being indoors. I am fostering my first one and failing miserably at being able to be separated from him. It's an incredible feeling! there is not doubt of the genuine love and passion we each have for these dogs.  One of my favorite almost happy endings is of our current boy WOLF https://youtu.be/0QdxoYU-MqI Wolf had the owner back over his leg and crushing it and left him to heal on his own. Caliber is another that breaks my heart when he was shot in the head and left for dead. Lastly Hershey and her brother escaped from their "breeder". The breeder came and got the brother but left Hershey because she didn't like her color. Standing there crying  for her brother as they walked out of the shelter leaving her behind. These dogs both have their happy ending! How can you not enjoy experiencing this kind of reward?!
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288555		/users/profile/378748	LillysMum	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	I grew up in a home where both of my parents were afraid of dogs, but not me!  As soon as I moved out on my own I knew I wanted a dog.  A friend had a litter of Rottweilers that the mom hadn't taken to offered me a puppy in exchange for helping care for the litter.  There it started, I was in love! Fast forward to 2014 where in February I lost my sidekick, Moody to osteosarcoma.  This dog had been by my side my entire adult life practically.  Slept under my desk through two degrees, listened to all of my heartbreaks, apartments to my first house!  This left a huge hole in my heart and my life.  My search began for a Rottweiler to rescue.  I came across Southern States Rescued Rottweiler on the internet.  I quickly became impressed at how passionate they were about their work.  Through the approval process I realized they were going above and beyond to ensure these dogs were only going to be placed in homes that were a good fit for each dog.  In November 2014 me and Lilly, a loving and energetic SSRR puppy became a family/pack.  She filled those holes in my life and heart and I think I filled some for her too!Whenever I have the chance to give back to SSRR I help them with transports, home inspections, etc.  To rescue a dog can be such a blessing to both owner and dog that I wanted to help give that opportunity to others. We  SSRR!
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288514		/users/profile/378708	RottnLuv	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I am a foster parent & transporter. This is my first time fostering for SSRR and found they were thorough in their vetting and home visit.  The process went quickly and easily. I have been a foster parent for a year now and work with Rottweilers who have been misused in any number of ways. It is so rewarding helping these dogs who thrive on love and attention. Their adoption protocol is just as thorough and they are diligent in finding the right family for the right dog, wanting the best home possible for these wonderful dogs. Their efforts to save the most in-need dogs are extraordinary and show their dedication to this breed. 
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288511		/users/profile/378705	missjules7777	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I became a foster with SSRR after my fur baby passed away. His sister needed a companion so we reached out to SSRR and fostered Zeus. Great experience, very thorough which is what I wanted to see.  Paperwork required, called references & did a house visit. I really like the process bc I knew the dogs being rescued we're going to good homes. We ended up as a failed foster. We adopted Zeusy.  
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288414		/users/profile/378618	Pam_117	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	We have adopted two SSRR dogs and fostered one.  We first adopted Piper about 4 years ago as a companion for our mixed-breed rescue dog, Louie.   She quickly became a daddy's girl, sleeping with her head on my husband's chest.  Her gentle, calming personality has been a great influence on him, a VN combat veteran.  Her favorite thing is to meet new people at the park and do the signature rottie "butt wiggle."  She is gentle with all people, young and old.We saw a plea from SSRR to foster an older dog, Dazz.  Her photo broke my heart.  She was very thin, and her head was covered with sores from flea bites.  We had Dazz about 4 months.  She put on weight and healed to become a beautiful dog. She found a great home as an only dog where she gets lots of love and attention.We missed Dazz,  and she taught us that we could manage 3 dogs. We began thinking of adopting another dog and decide we would focus on finding a senior.  We found another SSRR dog, Ava.  She is at least 7 years old.  She is full of life and love, and sleeps in the bed, next to her mom!  The volunteers at SSRR are dedicated to providing rescue and homes for rottweilers.  We are thankful for the work they do and support them in their mission.  Photos are Dazz, Ava, Piper.

I foster, transport, donate, and do home visits for SSRR and they truly care about finding the Rotties in their care, wonderful, caring, forever homes. It is amazing to see how these animals respond when rescued, give the love, care and medical attention they need and then delivered to the homes they've always deserved.
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288389	1	/users/profile/378592	Kathy249	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I have worked with two rottweiler rescue groups in the 20 plus years I've lived in Texas - the latest group being Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc.  All the people volunteering with this group are beyond friendly and committed to saving not only purebred rottweilers, but in the past several years have expanded to rescue rottie mixes.  The area served by this group has grown during my volunteer period.  I have yet to meet or speak with an SSRR volunteer who isn't friendly and more than willing to help in whatever manner is needed.I plan on continuing to volunteer with this group as long as I can.I'm more than happy to admit that I'm also a foster failure - my Rosie, a soon to be two year old - came to me April 2015 and I just couldn't bear to part with her.
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288313		/users/profile/378529	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I have worked with SSRR in some capacity for the last 9 years. I have seen many Rottweilers who would otherwise die on the streets or in a shelter get saved due to this organization. The success rate of this rescue group's rescue/adoption rate is higher than any other group that I've worked with. The potential adopter screening process is streamlined, thorough and fair, making sure these rescued babies get into the best homes possible. A HUGE positive for this group is that the length of foster to adopt is astronomically shorter than other groups. The applicant pool has been vast and I have witnessed dogs adopted into amazing homes where they are loved members of the family for the rest of their lives.  My SSRR alumni, Sadie, is living out her golden years getting lots of love as well as quality medical care for arthritis. I could not imagine my life not knowing this beautiful girl. 
Southern States Rescued Rottweilers Inc	288288		/users/profile/378506	Tori7	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I have been volunteering in some capacity for SSRR since 2004. They deeply care about the animals and always put the dogs first. The adoption process is lengthy and specific, but it is all to help protect the dogs and try to ensure that they never have to experience abuse or neglect again. This group has people that volunteer countless hours on top of they paying jobs to help save this wonderful breed. It has been a deeply rewarding experience.

A whole new group was put in charge a couple of years ago.  In that time, over 500 Fur Babies were placed in loving homes.  Now the new group is beginning a Capital Campaign to build a much needed shelter for cats, puppies, the humans who work there etc.  The Shelter went from being a sad run-down space to a place of happy animals and hope!

I know the staff at the kennel and they are the MOST loving, caring people you will find anywhere in the world of rescues.  They go above and beyond what is required to save cats and dogs.  Their books are open to anyone who would like to see them and they have adopted out HUNDREDS of dogs and cats since they took over the mismanagement by the previous administration of the kennel 2 years ago.

I was afraid that I would want to take all of the dogs and cats home, but the staff truly makes it a loving temporary home for them.  I love spending quality time with the animals.  It makes me feel good and I know it makes them feel good.  It's definitely a well run operation!  The shelter is in dire need of funding to get a facility that is not falling down around them while they work!  I have never been around people as dedicated and loyal as this staff is.  They love the animals and do everything they can to provide a better life for them until they get adopted into a fur-ever home.

Garland County Animal Welfare Association Inc d/b/a Humane Society of Garland County	304033	3	/users/profile/395199	Nancysmom	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	It is amazing how far this organization has come in just two years!  It now has the support and involvement of several local veterinarian clinics.  It now partners with other rescue groups locally and in California.  The Humane Society now has a working relationship with Animal Control (the municipal agency) such that AC will call the Humane Society when AC is overcrowded and needs to "make room".  Through the partnership with AC, the Humane Society has saved numerous dogs from AC's "death row".  It's great to go out to the kennel and see the dogs out in the play yards running around and playing instead of all cooped up in their runs.  The community has noticed the change and continues to reach out to support the Humane Society with food drives, fund raisers, and adoption events.  It's a great organization doing some great work in Garland County, Arkansas!
Garland County Animal Welfare Association Inc d/b/a Humane Society of Garland County	303057	2	/users/profile/394220	SLucas1234	Board Member	5	09/09/2016	Between August 1, 2015 and August 19, 2016, The Humane Society of Garland County has adopted out 241 dogs and 57 cats to prescreened homes locally, and they have sent 81 dogs on transport to Friends of Orange County Homeless Pets, a private organization in California, where they were adopted into prescreened homes. They currently have 60 dogs and 30 cats in our care at their kennel.  The organization changed kennel managers and elected a new board of directors in 2014, and, since that time, the organization has grown in its outreach to the community, as well as increasing its success in placing dogs and cats into loving permanent homes.  Volunteers and board members have spoken at local schools and organizations on multiple occasions, and this resulted in increased awareness of responsible pet ownership as well as increasing awareness of our organization.  We are working toward building a new facility at our kennel site, as our current buildings are inadequate and dilapidated.  We have had good support from local donors in the community to raise funds for our capital campaign.  We have had several successful fundraisers as well.  We now have good relationships with Animal WelfareLeague of Hot Springs Village and Paws and Claws Rescue locally.  Overall, this organization is making great strides in animal welfare in the Garland County area. The organization financials are transparent as well.

The 2015-2016 President has stated untruths publically and misleads the community. Their 990 for 2014 states that the first $100,000.00 they receive of donations goes into the pockets of individuals not used toward saving the lives of unwanted pets. Sadly it's the animals that suffer.

Hostile take over in 2014 created inexperienced management and especially BOD. Organization was financially secure until the hostile take over however without financial disclosures to the general public how can one be assured they remain good stewards of the publics money and trust.  There is a shelter with high overhead expenses and a large payroll. Turmoil abounds in this organization.
Garland County Animal Welfare Association Inc d/b/a Humane Society of Garland County	246252	4	/users/profile/333529	mydogs	Donor	1	06/24/2015	JULY 2015  As previously reported, this Humane Society, killed 5 young, healthy dogs that inexperienced kennel management did not know how to work with in Nov, 2014. Their new website, written after this, proudly proclaimed that they are a 'no kill shelter.'  However, in the Spring, 2015 - about 6 months later,  they killed 10 dogs and an unknown number of cats. When asked about this  - they 'sanitize' their rationale. Dead is still dead.They do not go out to rescue animals, nor do they deal with abuse/cruelty cases. They no longer provide medical aid to animals that have been rescued when found. They get the majority of their animals from a kill shelter - only 'highly adoptable' animals that they can quickly 'turnover' by selling them at Petco. They do NO vetting/checking vet references, fenced yards, personal references or landlord permission to adopt out animals prior to sending the animals home with strangers - they just fill out a form. Our community no longer has a Humane Society that answers reports of abuse, neglect or injury. They refer ALL reports/phone calls to the local Animal Control - a kill shelter.  Very sad for the innocent animals of our county - they have no voice. PREVIOUS POST  Very sadly, this organization, under a new board as of 8/2014, is no longer a no-kill shelter(began killing 11/2014) nor does it rescue abused, neglected or injured animals.  Their phone message directs callers/reporters of abuse or concerns  to a kill shelter that does not offer medical assistance, animal abuse/neglect calls and is basically unprepared to rescue and aid neglected, injured or abused animals. When donors have asked for an accounting of funds.... no responses have been given.  The focus now is basically working ONLY with animals that they can readily 'turn over' at  Petco....it is certainly not a concern of animal welfare or the humane treatment of animals. Donors have been alienated and knowledgeable volunteers / animal socializers have been run off. Members are no longer permitted to vote for board members - they are 'appointed.'  The only thing members are permitted to do is give them money....not opinions or voice concerns.Due to their 'new revised policies', their is no refuge or assistance for abused, neglected or injured animals. These animals must remain in situations of abuse / neglect and injured animals are 'left' until the kill animal control shelter is open, and if they have time/manpower, they will retrieve and kill the pet. The new kennel manager had NO experience with abused/neglected animals or kennel management - only as a vet tech in an office. The other 'new board members' had never volunteered or been involved at the kennel yet professed to be experts / knowledgeable enough to 'critique' years of experienced people.Long time donors have left. I no longer donate to them, they have been removed from my will and I no longer will volunteer. Hardly would I consider it a 'humane society' when it ignores the plight of helpless animals.
Garland County Animal Welfare Association Inc d/b/a Humane Society of Garland County	239443	6	/users/profile/325253	jlhsabco	General Member of the Public	1	03/19/2015	The Garland County Animal Welfare Association dba The Humane Society of Garland County was a "No Kill" shelter for 39 years. In 2014 around Christmas they chose to euthanize 5 young, healthy Hound/Beagle mixes that they deemed unadoptable. The dogs lived at the facility for several months and the former Kennel Director had them walking on a leash and on the path to adoption. Seven dogs from the same area were already socialized and adopted into loving homes.  The new Kennel Manager and BOD took over the facility in July 2014 so the question is what happened to these dogs in 5 months that made them unadoptable?  After 39 years as a No Kill shelter it is no longer.

SPSF boards. Since that time each county has grown in commitment to the cause of increasing opportunities for their single parents through education.

I had two young children at the time so this was a real undertaking. Not only did I go to school full time, I also had to work to support my family. I was thrilled to find out scholarships were available to people like me. When you are an adult leaner, there are not many funding options outside of student loans. Receiving the Single Parent Scholarship gave me some much needed funds and also boosted my self-confidence. I graduated in 2001 with a bachelors degree and now am a board member of this wonderful group. Empowering people to help themselves is one of the noblest undertakings I have ever been involved with.

Arkansas Heart Foundation	317163	1	/users/profile/408344	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2016	The Arkansas Heart Foundation does a great job with cholesterol screenings. They get your results to you in 10 minutes and go over the numbers with you so you understand what your numbers need to be and how to get them there. 
Arkansas Heart Foundation	313791		/users/profile/405144	MonicaClare	General Member of the Public	4	10/24/2016	The Arkansas Heart Foundation is extremely involved with the community, and more importantly the underserved communities of Arkansas.  Their willingness to travel to communities and people groups, that may otherwise have no access to the health and educational information the Arkansas Heart Foundation so expertly provides, is a great benefit. From their health assessments and advocating everyone not only knowing what their numbers are but also what their numbers mean. The education that the Heart Foundation provides is easy to understand, easy to remember, and gives tangible lifestyle recommendations that I feel leads to success. To their diabetes workshop that is life changing for diabetics and caregivers alike. The educator goes up and beyond explaining and interacting with those attending the class. In everything that the Arkansas Heart Foundation does there is one common thread. That commonality is that they care for the communities in Arkansas and they connect with the people they meet on such a level that they are remembered long after their event, screening or workshop leaves town.  
Arkansas Heart Foundation	309319		/users/profile/400685	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2016	The Arkansas Heart Foundation is a great community involved, non-profit group that has just recently established itself within the last year or so. I work in the same office building as the ladies that are involved with this program, all of whom are very passionate about the community outreach and screenings that they hold throughout the state educating many Arkansans about heart disease. This passion needs to be witnessed more often and by many others as it is very important to be aware of our risks and how to prevent cardiovascular disease. I gladly support their efforts in educating our neighbors throughout the state and know that what they do will continue to positively effect the health of Arkansans!   
Arkansas Heart Foundation	308737		/users/profile/400111	derrijc1	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2016	This organization focuses its efforts to the treatment and prevention of heart disease in Arkansas. The staff dedicated to this focus are highly professional and dedicated.

The Diabetes Boot Camps scheduled throughout the state have touched the lives of many people and has allowed AFMC to further educate individuals in a six (6) week free DSME workshop. Thank you Arkansas Heart Foundation for serving people with diabetes and providing the resources needed to improve diabetes care and self-management. 
Arkansas Heart Foundation	308265		/users/profile/399655	sdarr	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	I have been honored to work with the Heart Hospital for 10 years or more.  They have provided screenings for our employees (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure), as well as presenting at our employee Lunch and Learns about a variety of heart health topics.  I know I can always count on the Heart Hospital to provide a wealth of information for our employees.  Your staff is amazing.Thank you to the Heart Hospital for your involvement in our community and your giving back attitude.
Arkansas Heart Foundation	308086		/users/profile/399467	jhreves	Volunteer	5	10/05/2016	Thank you to the Arkansas Heart Foundation and all of your support for Mended Hearts of Little Rock!  As a patient, volunteer, and donor, I have experienced all facets of this wonderful non-profit.  The staff of the Arkansas Heart Foundation goes above and beyond to support not only me, but our Mended Hearts members,  and the entire State by offering heart screenings and heart-health educational events.     Your support is invaluable.  
Arkansas Heart Foundation	307996	1	/users/profile/399374	Writer,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2016	Arkansas Heart Foundation offers a variety of programs from prevention to survivorship--heart screenings, patient education, a conference for providers, and a support group for heart disease survivors. They offer their programs throughout Arkansas, rather than just in our larger cities, which I appreciate. The staff is tremendously kind and knowledgeable. I appreciate Arkansas Heart Foundation's work in creating a healthier Arkansas.
Arkansas Heart Foundation	308078		/users/profile/399460	kbrowncityofsherwood.net	Client Served	5	10/05/2016	Arkansas Heart Foundation is a great group to work with.  They came out to one of our Employee Health Fairs and provided health screenings such as blood pressure and blood sugar test.  I believe they may have done a BMI test too.  They provide you with your results and advise you on making healthier lifestyle changes and to follow up with your primary doctor.  All they want is to make sure you are keeping yourself and your heart healthy!
Women & Children First the Center Against Family Violence	180006		/users/profile/236656	Tiffany19	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	Volunteering for Women and Children First has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life! The clients that are served by the shelter work so hard to help themselves that we as volunteers are inspired to work harder to help them get through these tough situations. The services and programming Women and Children First offers its clients and the community are truly invaluable and life-saving. Little Rock is fortunate to have this organization. Until we can put an end to domestic violence, I will continue to support this organization and the amazing work that it does.

It makes me sick to think of people out there suffering and feeling stuck- especially children. It's great that they have a place to go. I'm so proud to be apart of WCF!
Women & Children First the Center Against Family Violence	179363		/users/profile/236009	jessicasorg	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	It is amazing to watch the shelter help families in need of support and rescue! All the volunteers and staff work very hard to build up these women that have been brave enough to leave and begin to regain their lives. WCF touches lives all across the state of AR and has even helped those from out of state find a fresh start. The daily struggles of supporting all the residents needs are met head on with some wonderful people that don't take no for an answer! Constantly finding new ways to raise money and new ways to give hope to the women and children in need! I personally enjoy knowing that all my volunteer work throughout the year are giving these brave people the fresh start they deserve in life. Help break the cycle. Stop the violence! Join WCF to help!!!

I've known several women who arrived in need of help, but are now empowered and using their voices to effect change for those who follow.
Women & Children First the Center Against Family Violence	179023		/users/profile/235656	valvandj	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	This shelter saved my life and the lives of my children. We were clients in 1999 when I fled a violent marriage. WCF helped us put our lives back togather. They gave us each our own advacate to make a life plan and gave us the tools to acheive it. At one point in our lives we all contemplated suicide to escape, we thought it was the only way out. Now we enjoy everyday God has given us and are blessed to give back to others in our same circumstance. My oldest daughter works for a prominant doctor who adors her and she has 2 amazing sons. My middle child who was a shy little girl now has her doctorate in physical therapy and works with children with disabilites and my baby boy has a communications major, was awarded the Mackey Award for the nations top tight end and the Disney Spirit Award for the most inspirational figure in college football and now plays in the NFL. I am now honored to serve on the board of the organization that gave my family our lives back. Thank you WCF!!!

In our economy, domestic violence is overlooked but it is REAL and it is VERY serious. They see this need as the huge need that it is,and want to help. I was amazed when  I went to the first fundraiser after meeting and discussing certain issues with them I would recommend this group to anyone

Women & Children First the Center Against Family Violence	179010		/users/profile/235641	Ashley74	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	WCF does much more than just offer housing and shelter. The staff and board really are trying to end the cylce of abuse. Thru educational programs for youth on healthy relationships to required counseling for the clients. They take a hands on creative approach shown thru the art therapy for the children.  You may think this shelter since its located in AR only serves Pulaski County. Wrong. Due to many situations of domestic violence and so severe that families are unsafe in the current areas they live. They are often requested to go to a shelter that is out of their current home.

Columbia County Animal Protection Society Inc	214645	1	/users/profile/277923	Cammy M.	General Member of the Public	4	09/11/2014	I have adopted 4 kittens from CCAP's. One when I first moved to Arkansas 5 yrs. ago and 3 more this yr. After fostering these kittens and bottle feeding them the family fell in love and decided to keep them. The people at CCAP's are some of the most caring people you will ever meet. They treat these animals as if they are their own. The organization is ran strictly by donations and needs all the help they can get. They try to never turn an animal away, but with limited funds and space sometimes it gets hard. I live in the country and people dump off dogs out here all the time in sad shape. Once they find their way to my house they really look bad. I have taken these dogs to Steve at CCAP's and in no time he has them looking so good and happy; you could not find better a better organization anywhere.
Columbia County Animal Protection Society Inc	214461	1	/users/profile/277734	aarmstrong	General Member of the Public	4	09/10/2014	This is the only shelter in our county to help homeless animals.  They depend on what their "Second Chances CCAPS Store" for support and donations from the public.  They do wonderful work.  I have adopted two fur babies through them.

Although , I have never been to this facility, I have donated. They rely solely on donations from their store, and from the general public, like myself. My daughter just moved into her first apartment, and wants a dog. We will be adopting here. I have never seen such dedication to animals than this group of amazing people. They help out ANY animal. No questions asked! Thank you, CCaps!

Donor	5	09/10/2014	I have never personally visited the Columbia County Animal Protection Society (CCAPS) kennels or grounds.  I have only had contact via Facebook.  I have visited ther postings and read most every post for over a year.  I have never  seen such dedication and caring for animals by one group in my life.  They post daily and share pictures and stories of rescue along with glad tiding of adoption with anyone willing to read.  They accept and care for dogs and cats that would either die on the streets at the mercy of cruel human beings to taking in a beloved pet that for one reason or another must be given up.  Even when overflowing they find the room for that just one more.   They have a very active support network of loving individuals that care for the animals in many varring ways.  They activily try to support their facilities with sales, baked goods sales, animal parades and activities.  I live to many miles away to be of any support other than a few dollars whenever I can, but if closer I would be honored to be associated with and part of their society.  
Columbia County Animal Protection Society Inc	214372	1	/users/profile/277619	jpine	Donor	5	09/09/2014	These people are thoughtful protective staff and volunteers who care deeply for the finest care of animals.   No matter when we have gone there, the same atmosphere prevails and they are additionally helpful to visitors.    I appreciate that they have kept up a website to let us know how things are going and what will be helpful to them as far as their needs and donations.     Thank you for being in Magnolia!
Columbia County Animal Protection Society Inc	214355	1	/users/profile/277603	Becky69	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	I have been volunteering at CCAPS for 6 years.  Some of the animals we take in are just heartbreaking, you cry a lot of days but then when that one you have nurtured back to health gets to go home, WOW what a great feeling!  CCAPS does a tremendous job taking care of all the unwanted, dumped and neglected dogs and cats not only from our city/county but from several counties in our area but we are nonprofit, meaning no county, city, state or federal funds.   All of our support comes from donations and our Second Chances thrift store.   We house around 100 puppies/dogs and 70 kittens/cats at all times while our budget is for 50 dogs and 35-40 cats!

Caring consurned staff and volunteers, the shelter director often covers medical expenses out of his own pocket. They keep the shelter as clean as they can, rotate the dogs through some fenced in areas so they can get some exercise and fresh air. They really go above and beyond!

Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	316181		/users/profile/407446	Writer	Client Served	5	10/28/2016	In April of this year our 23 year old nephew went into the hospital for a hernia repair.  The surgeon opened him up and saw something he had not hopedto see, a tumor.  Biopsies were taken and sent to many educational/medical facilities around the country which all came back as ASPS (Alveolar Soft Parts Sarcoma).  Wewere told how rare this form of cancer is and that in Arkansas there is one place that has Sarcoma Medical Specialists and sent us to them for further care.The Rockefeller Cancer Institute of UAMS in Little Rock was where we were sent and helped!  We were so scared and everything we read on the internet made us even more scared.  One of the surgeons we saw is Dr. Corey Montgomery, Orthopedic Oncology Surgeon and Board Member of a charitableorganization formed in our state in 2015 by a lady that also had had ASPS.  He gave Kristi Rogers information to us and we were quickly talking with herregarding her experience and helpful information that she had learned from her personal experience.  Kristi started Cancer Charity4Life to raise moneyfor research.  This organization does not spend most of its money on Administration, most of the donations go directly to fund research of SarcomaCancers.  After 3 surgeries we hope the next one will be the last.  We would not have had this hope if we had not met all the wonderful people in theCancer Institute and UAMS hospital and most especially, Kristi Rogers and Cancer Charity4Life.  The Ward family
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	315332	2	/users/profile/406657	Kalen E.	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2016	Cancer Charity4 Life has been a major player in NWA cancer research and awareness funding.

Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	314957	2	/users/profile/406300	byrdce	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2016	I became aware of CC4L about a year ago when a friend's son was diagnosed with a soft-cell Sarcoma. He fought so hard but ultimately received his cure in heaven. Currently, one of my former students is battling Sarcoma. I absolutely hate cancer! Whatever I can do to spread the word about cancer research, I want to do it. CC4L is interested in giving patients and caregivers educational, motivational, and nutritional support as well as finding funding for research. To me, this means they care about the WHOLE PERSON, not just cancer. I hope this review helps spread the word about Sarcoma Research and CC4L. I do not have the money to fund research myself, but I do have a voice. I am only one voice, but if you would lift your voice with me, we could be heard around the world. Help me spread the word about CC4L. Celeste Byrd
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	314461	2	/users/profile/405815	sfinley	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	While we know that the majority of us during our lifetime will be affected by cancer in some way whether it be a family member or friend we need hope.  Cancer Charity 4 Life is a non-profit that is passionate about education and connecting families who have been stricken by Sarcoma.  I  plan to help CC4L spread awareness by setting up a 5-10k race in Kansas City.  It is my hope that the money raised will help this organization provide hope, resources and dreams come true to those families afflicted with this rare cancer.
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	313392	2	/users/profile/404763	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2016	In November of 2014, when my step-daughter came out of her Sarcoma surgery, to remove the mass in her leg, and the surgeon explained the the surgery he had performed, I thought I was going to faint.  I began to cry, uncontrollably and had to be alone.  I didn't want my family to see how weak I was or how hopeless I felt.At that moment I knew how important my faith in God was.  I also knew we needed every resource available to help fight this disease called Sarcoma.I began a prayer that I have prayed every night since then.  Even though it's been two years now, every night I pray for research to find a cure for Sarcoma patients so they can hold onto hope.  Hope is a mainstayfor Sarcoma patients as is faith in God.These two beliefs keep us focused on today and the future.  Faith in today with bright hope for tomorrow.Janet Burch
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	313176	2	/users/profile/404544	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	I have watched from a distance as CC4L has grown over the past 16 months. There has been remarkable progress given the effort has been made primarily by a "party of one". Sometimes observers need something to grab their attention. For me, the revised vision statement did just that.The Vision Statement now says:"We see a future where awareness creates hope for those afflicted by sarcoma...in all it's forms. We see a future where our research dollars turn into cures."Hope Is not an abstract concept. If you are faced with sarcoma, hope is part of the road to recovery. But it comes from doing, building an organization that gives knowledge, support, financial resources and necessary networks.So the key word is "doing".As a result of this vision I have offered to help in a small way. Hoping to add another pair of hands and mind to the effort of growing this vital non-profit organization. I hope more join in.Regards,Bill Burch

My husband was diagnosed with a sarcoma in 2012 and was a patient at UAMS. He passed away this past August. I gave to Cancer Charity 4 Life to help fund research for sarcoma. I hope this Charity will win this monetary backing it needs to continue researching for a CURE to end Sarcoma Cancer!
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	286840	2	/users/profile/376911	Scott_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Inspirational Leader of a Cause that is Overshadowed by Breasts! - I frequently give what I can to various charities, typically based on things that I feel our valuable to our society as a whole (like homeless shelter), but also with organizations that have leaders who inspire me to act.  After making my donations, I often wonder, 'how much of my money actually gets used to make a difference.'Well, Kristi Rogers is that sort of leader and she also gives 100% of everything her organization earns right back to research in her home state of Arkansas.  In another words, she works for free, which is not what most leaders of non-profits can claim!Her passion for fighting the dreaded and rare form of cancer called Sarcoma is courageous and relentless.  It is very easy to support someone whose wisdom and kindness comforts so many people in need.  Kristi is cancer free at the moment, but she isn't out of the woods by any means, yet she continues to give and help others.  I hope that her work encourages people to think about the needs of others.  Breast cancer is also dreaded, but it now receives the majority of all donations made to fight cancer.  Please help Kristi and thousands of others with this rare and highly deadly disease!
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	273017	3	/users/profile/362198	chariseldred	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2015	My mom is a fighter. What's even more incredible is that she is a fighter, not only for herself, but for others. After receiving such a devastating diagnosis, many would understandably feel knocked down or ask, "why me?" Instead she pushed back and decided to fuel her energy and unknowns into a nonprofit, wherein all affected by sarcoma will benefit from potential research. I am so proud of her, a board member of charity4life, for wanting to make a genuine difference and for starting the nonprofit from the ground-up. What's so cool about the charity is that 100% of proceeds are being donated to research. 100%!!! Charity4life is purely about funding research for sarcoma because the rarity of the disease limits the research being conducted. Also, the website has some great products (tee-shirts, bracelets, etc)! 
Cancer Charity4 Life Inc.	260891	4	/users/profile/349484	charity4life	Board Member	5	10/01/2015	I was diagnosed with ASPS (alveolar soft part sarcoma) in November 2014. I had surgery at UAMS in Little Rock, where my awesome oncologist, Dr. Corey Montgomery, took a fist size mass out of my right lateralis. I subsequently was able to do my radiation locally with Dr. Hershey Garner at Highlands Oncology in Rogers, AR. Before and after my diagnosis, I had many questions. All I kept hearing was ASPS is very rare, that information on this cancer was hard to find, and there is little or no funding for research, except from those who have been affected. In February 2015, I felt God directing me to use my skill and ability in a different way. So, I resigned my position in the health and fitness industry and set out to raise funding for Sarcoma cancer research. On May 2015, my non-profit charity, Cancer Charity4Life, Inc. was launched. The Mission of the corporation shall be to raise money for cancer research! The Vision of Cancer Charity4Life will be a major catalyst of giving hope to each other by collectively fighting sarcoma cancer through our commitment to funding research and finding a cure.
Ozark Homeward Bound	299255		/users/profile/390166	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	08/04/2016	pLEASNT ELDERLYPleasant elderly women run this but are out-to-lunch about vet care etc. Contradictory about vet care for dog (no preventative for heartworm because she was heartworm NEGATIVE???) I was approved to adopt.  Vet could only confirm that he had seen dog once three years ago. That doesn't mean much when her shots were just being updated. Very mixed reviews from adopters-- no hostility about dogs but running into unexpected problems like serious epilepsy. No intelligent response from "president"/ director when called. I withdrew and did get money back. But I would strongly recommend going with  shelter/rescue more responsible about dogs that they want to place in good adoptive homes. Ozark Homeward Bound is not one of them.
Ozark Homeward Bound	282841		/users/profile/373015	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/19/2016	I fostered two little dogs from Ozark Homeward Bound and I ended up adopting both.  I also adopted a three legged Mama (little terrier) and her two little babies, they are now adults, they are so happy and we are so happy to have our pack! Lynda Daniel is such a kind and caring woman, she lives her life for these poor babies that have no one.  She and her staff are truly amazing.

Ozark Homeward Bound	231321	3	/users/profile/294919	gspbr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2014	I can tell you all - the local humane society - Ozark humane society - is NOT a good organization, the former board director (who is still on the board) is suspected of embezzling money. The animals were treated horribly and they ARE A KILL SHELTER. But they solicit donations as a no kill shelter. THAT my friends is fraud. I worked there for a short time in 2012. They were planning on euthanizing ALL of their cats. I found rescue for 30 of them, then I quit. They euthanized the remaining 20 out of spite for me leaving.  As for Ozark Homeward Bound, I have talked to the ladies a couple of times (I am 'in' rescue) but I don't know them personally. I ran across this page by accident trying to find an email addresss for a spcecific lady in this org.  However, I felt the need to respond as I was a little put off by all of this.  I have talked to their 'cat lady' many times and I can tell you there is no better person out there. She spends countless hours rescuing and rehoming cats. She personally fosters more cats at a time than most people have rescued in their whole life. She also is in charge of Harrison TNR program. Cats are THE HARDEST animal to rescue as so many people let their cats breed, they dump the cats, cats become feral, they interbred, it is an ugly, ugly situation. I do dog rescue but have a soft spot for cats too. I have TWELVE cats at my house, SEVEN of which are fosters and are adults that will be with me forever as people get 'free kittens' then dump them and one kitten becomes 1000 in less than 5 years.  I also have spoken to OHB- one of their fosters - she went to a home across the street who had a chained up dog and talked them into surrendering the dog to her. She is a wonderful person. She goes above and beyond as well.  I have never personally worked with OHB but I have never heard a bad word until this.  Here is the deal: No rescue is perfect, however the 'complaints' I have read on here seem sketchy at best.  #1 - I run a rescue and I NEVER and I do mean NEVER give my phone # out unless someone is approved to adopt or foster and even with adopters it is only if I feel they *need* to have it (If I am helping transfer the dog exc)  #2- Animals get older. We try to keep our rescue's page (I run a breed specific rescue that is state wide but I reside in Harrison) updated but the truth is we - as with Homeward Bound - are VOLUNTEERS. We get $0 for doing this. We all have 'real' full time jobs. I am the only one who updates pictures. I try to make cute pics too to get our dogs seen better but again, I have to do all while I am AT MY REAL JOB, which of course I don't get paid to do rescue during.  We do this because people are irresponsible.  As for them working in Baxter County, that is where their vet is, I do know they help Baxter Co Animal Control when they are able to. I know they help Boone Co A LOT still.  I can tell you from my point of view, I love animals, I really do but I *wish* I didn't have to do rescue. Again I run a breed specific rescue and it happens to be the most overpopulated breed. I have dedicated the last 10 years - 22 - 32 to rescue and I am sure I will dedicate the next 10 years to it as well since no one is willing to take over cause rescue is so depressing..  Rescue isnt easy, it takes a lot out of you. My friends all make fun of me as i cant 'hang out' like a normal 32 year old and when I was 22 I was volunteering at a shelter while everyone else was going out and partying.  Rescue is time consuming and the only 'thanks' we ever get are from the adopters who have happy endings. We get a lot of 'why cant you take this dog' or 'I don't want my dogs cause it is old and has cancer' (true story!), or 'can I get one of them dogs unfixed?'.  So I hope people will cut this group a little slack and take this into consideration.  The Ozark Homeward bound was started BECAUSE the Ozark HS is so corrupt. They worked there and left when it stopped being 'about the animals'.  Again I don't know them super, super well, but I do know how it is to be kicked cause you are unable to save the whole world.  Sorry the potential adopter had a bad experience. I do all the screening for the group I run, sometimes even with approved adopters, you sometimes have to adjust which dog you think might fit with them. Doing it long distance makes it 200x harder. 
Ozark Homeward Bound	210000	3	/users/profile/272733	tammy.tg	Client Served	4	08/10/2014	Our family adopted a beautiful lab mix from this organization and had a very good experience. He is absolutely gorgeous, smart, & very entertaining!  As mentioned on another review, the puppy was older than the information indicated on the internet. However, I was promptly informed that he grown older and they sent updated pictures of him when I contacted them.  I don't know the lady in charge personally, but she had just learned that she was ill when we adopted our puppy. I don't know if that had anything to do with your negative experience. I do know that this organization has found homes for over 500 homeless dogs.  When we returned back to our hometown (3 hrs away), our vet examined our dog and gave him a great bill of health. I'm thankful that this organization gave our dog the opportunity to live. He brings me joy & love every day. 
Ozark Homeward Bound	200332	5	/users/profile/261491	Franciepants	Client Served	5	05/14/2014	We have a small farm here in Harrison arkanss.  We continually get dogs and puppies dumped on us since it seems no one around here spays or neuters their animals.  Every dog that has been dumped here has been taken in by Ozark Homeward Bound.  They take all the dogs to a veterinarian in mountain home who provides services at a discount price for them.  Seems no vets in Harrison are willing to help dumped animals.  All these dogs go into foster homes.  OHB has provided all the worming meds, shots, veterinary care and found wonderful homes for every dog that has been dumped on us.  I have no clue what we would do without them!  They are an amazing, caring, devoted organization.  They CAREFULLY choose potential adopters and will not let a dog go to just anyone.  Some people take advantage of their program by letting them foot the bill for spaying or neutering and then sell the dog out from under them.  The volunteers work tirelessly to provide the best care for every dog that comes into the program.  When you adopt a dog, you pay only for the care invested in the dog.....no one makes any money.....you pay for the spaying, vet care, meds.  They provide food on their own dime.  Without this valuable resource, I can't even begin to imagine how many dogs would get hit by cars or left to starve.  Kudos to OZARK HOMEWARD BOUND!
Ozark Homeward Bound	198802	4	/users/profile/244648	Thetruchisoutthere	Client Served	1	04/24/2014	A little update since kathy7165 wrote about how wonderful Ozark Homeward Bound is. They have changed their tune since I reported them to the BBB for charity fraud and to the Arkansas Attorney General for investigation in 2014. They even have a tacky webpage now after being forced to make one. The sad part is that they still will not give you their phone number nor tell how much the adoption fees are until you contact them via computer only. Sure they have a Facebook page but in 2014, which charity doesn't? Please do not be duped by these people. Their "success stories" are from animals always going to the Northeastern USA from north central Arkansas. Also not on their Facebook page that their "drives" to get animals their shots and what not are for only three counties in north central Arkansas, Boone, Marion, and Baxter counties. My county, Newton County, used to be part of the people they would "help" until enough people woke up around here after being scammed and made them rather unwelcome to this county so now they're limited to scamming only 3 counties. The city they choose for these drives, Diamond City, is a rich folks town along with where their vet comes from, Mountain Home, Arkansas in Baxter County which is where they are operating more and more since more and more people in Boone County to my north are waking up to what they really are. Please use a more legitimate charity such as the Humane Society or other animal related charity that will actually post their phone number on the net. Thank you for your time.    
Ozark Homeward Bound	187618	2	/users/profile/244648	Thetruchisoutthere	Client Served	1	11/02/2013	PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL BEFORE EVEN THINKING OF USING THIS ORGANIZATION! This organization supposedly does all these good deeds by taking your animals in but they are a total fraud. We had hound puppies in February and couldnt afford to keep them so we contacted these people and they were so happy to help. First thing though is that we must hurry and get them fixed. O.K., they did that in Mountain Home, Arkansas, far away from qualified vets in Harrison, Arkansas where they are based which raised some alarm bells. When we brought the pups home one was run over but managed to survive so they brought out an old guinea pen with one very dilapidated dog house for 5 dogs. That really threw up some red flags. We were told to keep the dogs in there until they adopted out. Three and  months went by with nothing and my moms health had gone down to where she had a stroke and had no health insurance so we had to do something so I got a hold of Fayetteville, Arkansass Humane Society and they came and got the dogs. Shortly thereafter we got a bill from Homeward Bound for $430.00 for the services they provided. The only thing they did was get them fixed and gave us the shots to give to them however they didnt pay a dime for feed, water, or any other dog houses so we struggled by until moms health gave out. We spent over $500.00 on dog food alone yet they claimed we were wasting the feed, what kind of animal rescue is that claiming you feed your dogs too much? Reading another persons review in October also confirms that they are not well liked. They operate as an LLC yet claim theyre non-profit and in some states you can not be an LLC and be a non-profit at the same time so I asked for the states they operated in and they would only say 12 states but not the states names. They are extremely rude people who care more about the money and how many dogs theyve adopted out similar to bragging about how many friends one has on network sites (in their e-mail to me they had 2 completely different numbers for how many animals they had adopted out). They also got very confrontational when I found out that the pets they ship out of Arkansas they get an adoption fee between $350-$500. They would not disclose IRS records or anything else when pressed so there is something very wrong with this organization. In my opinion, they should not even be in operation when a person is desperate to find animals a good home then when they fail to live up to their promise and you go to another organization they have a fit and demand a huge amount of money. That is how they get their money, by fixing the animals first then lag around about adopting the animals out until you have to turn elsewhere then they stab you with a huge bill. Their motto should be changed from Til they get a home to Til we get our money.    
Ozark Homeward Bound	197422	1	/users/profile/258086	kathy7165	Client Served	5	04/10/2014	my neighbors moved and abadoned another dog.  upon calling ozark homeward bound they met us and took the poor starving thing in.  we couldn't take care of the dog because we already have 4 dogs of our own and a slew of cats in the shed that these neighbors had abandoned previously.  another dog went to one of our neighbors, and i know they shot a third dog they had.  this organization asked for no money.  i truly appreciate their help in saving a poor baby.
Ozark Homeward Bound	173873	6	/users/profile/230024	Bianca656	Client Served	1	10/04/2013	Do NOT adopt from this organization.  My fianc and I recently decided we wanted to adopt a puppy. I searched on adopt a pet.com in my state and found a puppy named Haus. We fell in love with this puppy and sent in our application. Right away we were approved and put in contact with the foster mom. When speaking to he foster mom I was informed the dog was in fact an adult and much bigger than we were led to believe on the website AND he was located in Arkansas vs Ohio where the organization said the local chapter was. I also noticed although the organization claimed to be a non profit but it had an LLC in their email signature. Even though we really wanted a younger puppy and I thought it was bizarre they were an LLC organization AND he was located in a totally different state, I did still love the dog. We decided to go forward with the adoption as long as the foster mom could send us an updated picture so we knew what we would be getting. When I requested the picture I got about ten different excuses why she wouldn't be able to get us one so I clearly became suspicious.  I stated a simple phone picture would suffice, however although she confirmed she had a camera phone she wouldn't be home all day. The next evening at 930 pm I received a voicemail from the foster mom saying the "board" was asking more questions about where the local dog park was and who would care for my dog during the day. Mind you I had already been approved, answered all of their original questions and was requested to send my adoption fee via credit card over the phone. I spoke with some colleagues who are very involved in shelters and have adopted in the past and they confirmed my thoughts of suspicious activity. Still being the forever optimist I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  However when I called the organization to express my concerns of fraud the contact person completely changed her story and said the dog was an adult, got extremely rude and defensive when I questioned their validity and hung up on me. Obviously I was being lied to and all the organization was concerned with was getting my payment. I only hope that if he dog does exist he is being cared for in a humane manner because the professionalism of this organization is sub par at best.  I'm writing this review to let all hopeful adopters to be forewarned about this organization. This experience In no way changed my opinion of the wonderful legitimate organizations out here that actually do help animals become united with forever homes. I only hope I become connected with one so I to can give an animal a good home.

Stray Central	249365	2	/users/profile/337193	Kady38	Volunteer	5	07/22/2015	I have known of Stray Central for several years. I have fostered kittens for them.  I have also adopted 3 kittens from there. One kitten recently. The director loves animals with all of her heart and soul and would risk her well being to save a cat or kitten.  Her life is those animals she saves and adopts out only after knowing that cat or kitten will have the best home with people that love animals. This is her life each day and night. She lives for this 24/7. I have never met anyone more devoted to these rescues than Lisa Barnett. I would not get a cat or kitten from anyone but her.

Stray Central	245083	1	/users/profile/328653	Jamie Aitchison	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2015	Stray Central makes a tremendously positive difference for cats in their community. Not only do they work hard to find forever homes for adoptable cats, they also provided permenant sanctuary for cats with serious medical, emotional or behavioral problems. They limit the number of intakes so that they can provide the very best care possible for their residents. NAVS has been a proud sponsor of Stray Central through our Sanctuary Fund grant program, by helping animals affected by tornadoes and to fund spay/neuter initiatives.
The William J Clinton Foundation	323031		/users/profile/417178	cpalady	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/11/2017	I am a CPA and work with not-for-profits.  A reviewer "Abales" made an incorrect statement about the 2014 audited expenses of the Foundation.  Total expenses for 2017 were  $91.281 million and direct program expenses were $72.552 million or 80% of all expenses.  This is a very good percentage of an organization of this size. 13% were spent on administrative costs and 7% for fundraising expenses.   Hillary, Bill and Chelsea do not receive any compensation.  
The William J Clinton Foundation	318388	11	/users/profile/409556	Abales	Donor	1	11/06/2016	I was contemplating a donation and checked the 990 which shows clearly in 2014 that the foundation $144.4m and only $68.3m went to program expenses. This is a far cry from the 90% clinton claimed on her last debate. I believe this should receive a lot more scrutiny before choosing to invest in this NP. 
The William J Clinton Foundation	291220	12	/users/profile/381605	lovemesomebillybob	Former staff	5	05/27/2016	Had a fantastic experience working with this foundation.

While attending the Women in Ag conference, I attended a workshop for Quicken.  I am currently setting up my business and I know my record keeping will be much improved.  Also, I was provided a multitude of resources and web sites to further my education.
Arkansas Women In Agriculture Inc	40912	7	/users/profile/41801	jane12	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	My husband first saw a conference notice in the state newspaper several years ago, and encouraged me to get involved.  Since that time I have learned a great deal, and hope that what I have been able to share has helped someone else.  ARWIA has provided support groups, information about where to get the needed help and information.  The feedback on the break-out sessions at our conferences has been very encouraging -- in most instances the ladies leave the sessions 'wanting more'.
Arkansas Women In Agriculture Inc	40731	7	/users/profile/41626	mfp	Board Member	5	05/26/2010	I first became aware of ARWIA in 2007. I am from Atlanta , GA and had moved to Carlisle, AR to marry a rice farmer. I had never been involved with agriculture before, infact I was down right ingorant about it! I need to learn fast! I attended an Annie's Project in Bebee AR in Jan. of 2008 anlong with my step-granddaughter(who was 16). What I learned was amasing and invaulable to me ! Marketing , estate planing, insurance needs, and the oppurtunity to network with other farm women. That March I attendtended my first Arkansas Women in Ag conference, and again learned so much in two days that I was inspired to join the board of directors and help spread the word about this wonderful organization!! I have seen women come to these programs and walk away empowred! What a great thing that is.
Arkansas Women In Agriculture Inc	40687	10	/users/profile/41581	cwcfarm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/26/2010	Arkansas Women in Agriculture gives a unique opportunity for women in Arkansas to develop skills to increase sustainabilty and profitabilty of very diverse agriculture enterprises.  The opportunity to attend information and learning sessions, interact with professionals and insiders, and develop a network of support for ongoing and future information was a very valuable resource for me as a educator and and as a farmer.
Arkansas Women In Agriculture Inc	40668	11	/users/profile/41564	arslp	Board Member	5	05/26/2010	This organization has been a tremendous help to me and my husband by giving us resources and information we can use in our row crop farming operation. I completed Annie's Project which was sponsored by Arkansas Women in Argriculture. After each session, I was able to walk out the door with information I used immediately for our farming operation. I learned how to use accounting software adapted for farming, understand grain marketing, understand crop insurance, read a soil sample,and make informed decisions regarding estate planning. Every woman who is actively engaged in farming, owns a farm, or has roots in farming should be a member of this organization.  It is truly worth your time.  You will learn something!!!
Arkansas Women In Agriculture Inc	40664	8	/users/profile/41560	cowgirl1	Board Member	4	05/26/2010	I knew immediately after attending my first ARWIA conference, I was going to become involved with this organization.  Not only does it give you access to hands on tools, it allows you to become acquainted and involved with those who are looking for someone in the same position, situation, or has gone through an experience that others might be going through or will go through.  It covers almost every aspect of agriculture in ARkansas, and what it has not covered, is in the future conference plans.

I have been a supporter of HI's initiatives for several years and fully support their "teach a man to fish" approach by helping to provide solutions to hunger as well as providing resources to help create sustainable agricultural opportunities that help lead to financial improvement. They are committed to providing agricultural resources that can create sustainable and long term solutions. Some may value a crop over an animal, which is fine, but I find the demonizing of leveraging animals for production (meat, wool, eggs, etc) short sighted and ill informed. HI's goal is admirable and is deserving of support.

Heifer International Foundation	134795	7	/users/profile/67662	Mike S.	Donor	5	11/07/2012	A friend gave me a brochure from Heifer about 10 years ago.  I took it with me on the train ride home to Chicago.  As I read about Heifer and saw the photos of how animals IMPACT and CHANGE LIVES of people all around the world I began to cry.  THIS was the type organization I had been looking to team up with.  When you give an animal to a family, they are required to give it's first offspring to a neighbor, so the gift keeps giving long after the initial gift.  It's an amazing model, and one that I'll always be a part of.  I usually donate goats and llamas.  When I'm able too, I'm going to donate cows as well.  Thank you Heifer for making donating so easy, and so powerful.  Mike
Heifer International Foundation	118143	4	/users/profile/160674	Do_Gooder	Donor	5	07/11/2012	I love Heifer International! I cannot speak highly enough! While many non-profits focus on short-term solutions (i.e. food, bottled water, etc), Heifer focuses on long-term solutions--providing livestock. I give to Heifer several times a year and never question where my money is going. I know it is going to empowering communities to help themselves and make their community sustainable! 
Heifer International Foundation	11944	7	/users/profile/13906	shamira7	Volunteer	5	10/05/2009	Agroecology - In a world where land is overused, community members need to learn how to protect and rejuvenate their land, water and other natural resources. Heifer helps by teaching environmentally sound agricultural techniques. Animal Well-Being - Before any Heifer animal is passed along to a project partner, Heifer trains the new recipient in animal management, using our strictly enforced. Animal Welfare GuidelinesGender Equity - In Heifer's view, gender equity is a social justice and human rights issue that directly leads to ending hunger and poverty. That's why our participants are equal partners in sustainable development projects.HIV-AIDS - Today, we as a world community, confront AIDS, a virus that in the past 25 years has either infected or killed over 64 million people. It is not only a health issue, as it fractures every sector of society, for Heifer, it is a prominent concern in the arena of sustainable development. This is why Heifer is incorporating HIV/AIDS education in our community training groups.   Microenterprise - Heifer provides both "no-interest living loans" in the form of livestock, as well as small monetary loans to help people start and expand businesses that yield big benefits for families.Urban Agriculture - Heifer is reconnecting city-dwellers with their food sources, building strong alliances and instilling an entrepreneurial spirit among adults and youth through our Urban Agriculture projects.Young People's Initiative - Heifer weaves youth-focused programs through all our project work and emphasizes young people's needs.  Through Heifer International people who either have time to volunteer, through information booth that can be set-up during local events to inform the public of all these different avenues that Heifer International does to help people develop sustainable life styles.  Even if a person on a limited budget.  Through their on line gift catalog you can afford for as little as $10 a gift that can help a family gain independence to feed their families, communities, to start a micro-business and to pass on that gift to another family.

Temple Shalom Of Northwest Arkansas	19373	2	/users/profile/20600	Browniefundraiser	Volunteer	5	10/23/2009	Who could imagine a Palestinian general contractor donating his services to build a Jewish temple with two Christian architects?  As the fund raising chair for the new building it has been extremely gratifying to see the support of not only  our community and temple members but people throughout the USA who believe in what we are doing and support our faith-to-faith initiatives.
Temple Shalom Of Northwest Arkansas	19369	2	/users/profile/20596	jrl	Volunteer	5	10/23/2009	Temple Shalom of Northwest Arkansas is an extended family for all of its members.  Like all families, we are diverse, but we love each other even if we don't always agree with each other.  The outpouring of support for our construction project has been an overwhelming experience.  Our congregation has about 60 member families and yet our donor list contains more than 750 names... I find this remarkable, especially in this economy.

Temple Shalom Of Northwest Arkansas	19261	3	/users/profile/20497	BREPUS	Volunteer	5	10/22/2009	This tiny congregation of 60 members in the heart of the Ozarks is building its first ever synagogue with the help of a Palestinian Muslim named Fadil Bayyari and the support of local Christian churches.  Mr. Bayyari offered to build our synagogue at his cost as a way to  bridge all differences between Muslims and Jews and to provide us with a beautiful house of worship.  We have raised over $1.2 million to pay for the synagogue, money that has come from our membership and many community contributions.We worship under the leadership of a part-time rabbi and University of Arkansas Philosophy Professor Jacob Adler.  Our congregation is quite representative of the diversity of our area, with Asian and Hispanic members and lots of folks who want to learn more about Judaism.We have held two "Faith to Faith" dinners at area churches which have raised almost $100,000 towards the remaining costs of completing our synagogue.I love beeing a part of a very small group of Jews who have become my family far from my roots in Boston.  The involvement of Fadil Bayyari in our efforts to build a home for us is a seed of hope for a peaceful, loving future here in the Ozarks and throughout the world.
Good Samaritan Ministries	24329	4	/users/profile/25418	harrywilliams	Board Member	5	12/17/2009	Over the ten years plus that I have been involved with GSM, I have found them to be one of the most effective ministries with which Ihave been associated. Very little of their total gifts goes to administrative cost and they are generally able to increase the fishes and loaves to meet the needs of thos whom they serve. Sarah and Vernon Wells are true servants and are to be commended.
Good Samaritan Ministries	24322	4	/users/profile/25410	pacox20	Board Member	5	12/17/2009	Good Samaritan has always been committed to helping as many people as possible.  Keeping operational cost low to allow for more funding for helping people has been a bench mark that the organization has achieved for years.  I am proud of this organization and the leaders.  Sarah and Vernon are truly committed individuals who focus on changing the lives for the better of individuals in need.  Their love for this community is expressed by the hundreds of individuals they help every year.  This organization is truly a blessing to this community.  The efficiency that this organization provides saves this community tens of thousands of dollars.  The little financial help to prevent individuals in need from homelessness and the educational personal finance training they receive allow for these savings.  I am proud of Good Samaritan and thank God for blessing this organization.
Good Samaritan Ministries	24305	4	/users/profile/25397	hmcschmidt	Volunteer	5	12/17/2009	Good Samaritan Ministries has helped so many people in the past three years that I have been involved with them. I have helped with fund raisers and the back to school program that has touched the lives of school children. The people that work for GSM are caring and truely concerned with the community of Johnson City. The ministry is proof that the Lord still works miracles today.

They treat thier clients with dignity and try to aid when necessary.
Mid-America Science Museum	134203		/users/profile/179986	bmoore357	Client Served	5	11/06/2012	My family and I moved to the area a little over three years ago. We were told by locals that we should bring our children here for a fun family day. I am so thankful we listened! We feel in love and bought memberships. The homeschool classes are so wonderful! My children look for ward to every one and hey come away with so much information that was fun for them to learn. Thumbs up all the way!
Mid-America Science Museum	131057		/users/profile/176590	Cora E.	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2012	My family and I have been visiting the Museum since I was a kid. The place has continued to grow and get better and better every year. I am now 25 and continue to go as an adult. It's a great place where kids and their parents can go to have a fun time. 
Mid-America Science Museum	130993		/users/profile/176523	whs1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	Museums can be, well... stuffy. Nothing about this museum is stuffy. One of the best roles of a museum is engaging the visitor, and this museum excels at that. Learning in an informal, hands on mode is always best. It is fun, it is funky and visitors learn without even knowing. I have had the pleasure of watching this museum operate over the years and have been impressed by its operation and evolution. It is definitely an asset to our community.
Mid-America Science Museum	130915		/users/profile/176432	LauraDL	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2012	MASM is absolutely one of our favorite places to visit.  Both of my children (ages 5 and 12) love the exhibits and the classes.  We bought a membership after they begged regularly to visit and participate in more classes.  As a homeschooling parent, I appreciate how the museum has reached out and asked how they can help us better educate our children in science topics.  Their classes are meaningful, well planned, and packed full of knowledge.   I love how MASM encourages and excites children (and adults) of all ability levels and backgrounds.  What a wonderful treasure Mid America Museum is!
Mid-America Science Museum	130873		/users/profile/176382	Mindyw	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2012	I have a homeschooled 4th and 6th grader that love to attend the museum.  Over the past 5 weeks, my kids have taken part in a homeschool lab focusing on aviation.  They have met once a week for 5 weeks.  They have learned so much about aviation and also built many test models.  They have throughly enjoyed the instructor, subject matter and other children.  Thank you Mid-America Science Museum for partnering with me in educating my children. 
Turpentine Creek Foundation Inc	286942		/users/profile/377014	Nancy_S2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	#MyGivingStory about Turpentine Creek Wildlife RegugeTurpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge  located in Eureka Springs, AR. Turpentine Creek rescues Tigers, Lions, Cougars, Bobcats, Black Bears, a Grizzly and other assorted creatures that come from private homes and facilities that can no longer take care of these beautiful creatures.My husband and I were struggling financially, my husband needed a second job. Scott Smith hired him to drive the tour trolley, he has many skills but was grateful to have this job. This blessing of a job helped us make ends that were far from being met, to being met. About 6 months after my husband started working at TCWR they got a call that turned out to be their biggest rescue ever. A woman in Mountainburg, AR had a very large collection of Tigers in very poor conditions and, as we found out later, very poor health. My husband and I went from being grateful for this income, to having hearts sold out to helping these magnificent creatures. In order to rescue all 28 cats, that were eventually transported to TCWR, homes needed to be built for them. My husband took his vacation from his full time job and helped weld homes for them on Rescue Ridge, the new area for these new residents. We saw some very sick animals come to Turpentine Creek and we wished we could help financially but we were barely getting by. I volunteered time in the office while my husband worked but we wanted to do more. Specially for the ones needing extra healthcare.Today, if one of the animals is sick and they can not be treated on site they need to be anesthsised, transported to the vet (about 40 miles away) kept under anesthsia while being treated and then while being transported back. A very serious situation for the animal, as well as staff. It's always been a dream at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge to build an onsite Vetinary Hospital. Something my husband and I wished we could make happen. Something that seemed totally out of reach but very necessary.In April of 2014 my husband and I were blessed with a very big windfall and one of the first things we did was make a very large donation towards building the Vet Hospital at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. A campaign kicked off and all the money for the building has been raised but what good will the building be with no equipment? So now there is a big need-some $150,000 or so to equip the Vetinary Hospital-I believe about a third has been raised so far. It would be such a blessing to have this project completely funded. Building has begun on the Vetinary Hospital, we feel so blessed to have been able to help build the Hospital, won't you please help fully fund it? BamBam, the Grizzly, Duke, one of the Tigers, Elvis, one of the Bobcats, and all the other 100 or so residents of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge would be so grateful...we humans would be pretty thrilled too!
Turpentine Creek Foundation Inc	256374	1	/users/profile/344777	SKBM	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2015	Small town. Small sanctuary. Staff and interns that are large in heart and effort to provide  lifelong homes for those that have been victims of human ignorance. Animal habitats, diet, veterinary care, etc.  are  overseen by a fantastic group of interns and staff. These animals should not have been bred, BUT, they are now in caring hands for the rest of their lives.  Please donate for their care.
Turpentine Creek Foundation Inc	254008	1	/users/profile/342302	natwater	Client Served	5	08/26/2015	Turpentine Creek rescued three tigers from our small rural community when their owner was no longer able to care for them.  NO QUESTIONS ASKED!  They took these tigers on without questioning their health or history.  Immediately they provided surgery for one of the tigers who was suffering from complications from a bad declawing surgery that had become infected.  They later found out that this tiger had testicular cancer.  Unfortunately, he had to be euthanized.  The other two tigers (three years later) are healthy and well cared for by the staff at TC.  After reviewing their financial information, I am amazed at all the staff are able to provide for over 100 tigers, lions, and bears with very limited funding.  TC can stretch a dollar farther than I thought possible.  They do it by enlisting dedicated interns to help provide care and have negotiated in kind gifts to help provide food sources for the animals.  In addition, they are currently raising money to provide on site veterinarian services to provide more vet care for the animals at a lower cost.  They are affiliated with national groups that endorse their work and provide a high standard  of oversight.  TC is a five star organization doing a 10 star job!  The staff are rock stars that deserve our support and recognition as they provide a much needed service for exotic animals that are victims of human neglect.  
Turpentine Creek Foundation Inc	201241	1	/users/profile/140666	gypsy girl	Donor	5	05/29/2014	I first visited this sanctuary many years ago with a friend and began taking my elderly father there to see the big cats.  He fell in love with them, especially Hercules for his feisty personality.  He decided to donate money to build one of the safari lodges (guests can stay overnight and listen to the roar of the lions), and we made sure it was handicap accessible so that others in wheelchairs (like my father) could enjoy this awesome experience.  We spent many a pleasant evening watching the sun set over the Ozarks while sipping a glass of wine on the porch and listening to the various animal calls throughout the park.  Often deer would visit the meadow nearby, including an unusual white faced doe.  We became annual supporters and have donated money to several of their special projects (Bam Bam's new cage, for example).  I am also impressed with their internship program.  Many graduates go on to serve as curators for zoos, work as vets, or in some cases, become permanent employees of the refuge.  Everyone who works there (interns, employees, volunteers, owners, board members, etc.) cares passionately about the best care for these majestic animals.  They are limited only by the financial resources they have to run this amazing facility.
Turpentine Creek Foundation Inc	101903	1	/users/profile/131622	Jeff25	Donor	4	12/07/2011	My spouse and I visited this rescue facility in Arkansas during summer of 2011. We actually spent parts of 2 consecutive days there since they have a small RV campground adjacent to their fenced area (which makes for a unique camping experience). It seemed to be well run, and the financials on file here indicate that salaries to the key people are quite low. 
Single Parent Scholarship Fund Of Pulaski County	229906	2	/users/profile/293556	parogers	Client Served	5	10/29/2014	So much to be said about the rewards of Single Parent Scholarship Fund it can not be told in this space. It is a life changing program where the recipients walks away with more than a scholarship. They are connected with mentors and dedicated staff members who have nothing but their best interest at heart. With a 90% graduation rate, they are able to walk away with a college degree and change their circumstances from poverty to success for themselves and their children. If you are a single parent trying to go to school, you should check it out. I recommend you support this worthy cause, because when you bring a single mother/father out of poverty, you bring their child out too. I know for a fact, because it did it for me! I shall always be grateful for the support financially and emotionally I received as a recipient of the SPSF. Thank you for all you do for so many! Congratulations SPSF for remaining a constant in our community where struggle single parent students can find help!

Single Parent Scholarship Fund Of Pulaski County	225119	2	/users/profile/288894	Stacy53	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	Since 1991, the Single Parent Scholarship Fund has been a favorite and most admired education program in my community.  The organization has not only awarded over a million dollars to single mothers and fathers in Pulaski County, it has a graduation rate of almost 90 percent, which is unprecedented.  The program and its significant outcomes have addressed some Arkansas most serious issues  higher education, career development, welfare-to-work and economic growth. I have long valued the advancements made and served for six years as a very proud board member.   In 2010-2011, I spent a year in treatment battling cancer.  In July of 2010, the day before surgery, SPSFs executive director delivered to me a pair of pink boxing gloves to take to the hospital, signed with well wishes by my fellow board members. I packed the gloves in my suitcase, and asked family to place them in my hospital room as a reminder of their endearing friendship. While at UAMS, my evening nurse, Dot, asked me about the pink gloves. As I began to tell her about the Single Parent Scholarship Fund, she politely interrupted to tell me her own story.  In the 1990, Dot became a single mother with three young children. Without a degree, she was faced with a serious burdensome journey  the unexpected financial hardship of providing for a family of four without many employment options due to a lack of education. With a desire to attend nursing school, Dot applied to SPSF and became a first-year scholarship recipient. Today, she is a senior-level oncology nurse at UAMS, and has also managed to successfully raise three grown children, all having completed their own college degrees. At SPSF, we have long known that when you help bring a single parent out of poverty, they take their children with them. Dots educational success, and that of her three children, is living proof. My chance encounter with Dot reminds me that we are all one community, and our connections run deep. Dots story embodies what the founders of SPSF had hoped to accomplish. And now, a single mother who was once in great need, has fulfilled her dream of a college education and career, and is now helping others like me during our own time of need. An investment in the Single Parent Scholarship Fund impacts the wellbeing of countless non-traditional students who are able to open up new doors and put their families economically back on track.  
Single Parent Scholarship Fund Of Pulaski County	225088	2	/users/profile/288861	Mary Remmel W.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	The Single Parent Scholarship Fund provides much needed financial assistance to single parents enrolled in two and four year post high school programs. Our success rate for graduations is above 90%, which is far above general graduation rates at these institutions. Our students receive money to help them live sustainably while studying. And our assistance is not only monetary. We offer training in numerous life skills, in healthy living, in financial management, etc. We also offer students, many of whom have been dismissed by family and friends as losers, encouragement and improved self esteem. Our graduates work hard. And through their education, they are able to lift their families out of poverty. 
The Arc for River Valley	256397	1	/users/profile/344798	joni2go	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I have worked with Individuals with disabilities for over 13 years and the ARC has played a major role in their lives.  My first experience with ARC was at Bowling.  To see these Individuals use both competitiveness and team work is very heartwarming.  They look forward each week to get together to bowl and socialize with their friends.  Then there is the dances.  I really enjoy seeing them get on the dance floor and let loose.  The ARC has at least 3 dances a year, Valentines, Halloween and Christmas.  Other activities include fishing derby, walk, swim party, Karaoke, movie night and potlucks.  At the facility itself they have cooking and art classes, computer lab and an activity room.  In the activity room t hey have a TV to watch DVDs , puzzles and board games and books to read.  They also have another TV for WII and X Box.  There is also a Foosball table, a ping pong table and an air hockey table that converts to a pool table.  They recently added a garden to grow vegetables.   Enough about the activities, the people there are the ones that make a difference.  They make you feel right at home, weather it is your first time there or you are there everyday.  You are always greeted with a smile and positive attitude.  I cannot say enough about the ARC.   It is a fun and AWESOME place to be.

They always have fun playing xbox, Wii, pool, ping pong, foosball or just socializing with there friends in a place that they are judged and a place where they feel safe.  We also have computers for them to play games on or sing to their favorite music.  We have concerts daily of members that love to sing along to their favorite songs.    I have a child with special needs, and although he is unable to participate in alot of our activities, he loves to come here and be with others where he can be noisy and laugh a lot just being with them and watching them participate.  Thank you for this opportunity to talk about my favorite place to come.  I have an awesome job just being able to see and talk to our members with all kinds of special needs each day.

Signed up for the critical care funds, and still have yet to hear anything from them. Not to mention  i gave them my eviction notice, and electric bill disconnect notice, still nothing.

WAL-MART ASSOCIATES IN CRITICAL NEED FUND	293161	24	/users/profile/383745	Writer	Client Served	5	06/16/2016	I have received help from the ACNT fund twice. The first time was when I was evicted because my landlord didn't want to bring our (rented) house up to code, and ACNT gave me a deposit for my new place. The second time was when I had lots of medical bills and paying for them made me late on rent & electricity. I don't think the other reviewer got a clear understanding of the guidelines - it's pretty clearly stated that they can't help if your problems are because of lost Walmart hours.

I pay for all of our families expenses and his medical care for his accident that occurred at work. We have six children, 5 of which are disabled and bills have gotten behind. Wal-Marts critical need program has done nothing for my family. Not one electric bill, water bill, no help at all.  I think they have this program, deny everyone in an attempt to make the company look good.. really its a joke
Critter Holler Animal Rescue	48691	1	/users/profile/49849	phyllis5	Volunteer	5	07/25/2010	Since moving to Arkansas back in May of 2010 due to my husband retiring from the Coast Guard. I found that we had plenty of spare time. I have always had the love of animals so I did my research online to find a group to volunteer for. I came across a website that was very interesting to me and that was "NACSPCA" I loved their total outlook on the on their programs. It did not only include the animals, but also included the human side. I was very impressed about the service dog training program as they take shelter dogs and retrain them to be service dogs for mental and physical disabilities. And I know one day that I might need help myself. The other programs they have to offer (ex. the step up program, the internship program) I have never seen anywhere else in my travels across the states.  So one day I decided to take my husband out there to see if we could do some volunteering. And we where welcome with open arms. The program founder is amazing in answering questions that we had asked about the programs. After talking with them we decided to become volunteers. So, far I have recruited my husband which is a veteran training a service dog to become a service dog/companionship for a vet.My 17 year old son now takes care of the cattery which he loves to do. And faithfully does 4 times a week or more depending on when we go over there to do our volunteering. He has also put up a webpage on Facebook and Twitter.So if you get a chance in life and have time to volunteer please check out your local animal shelter and see what they have to offer.

Thank you for caring!

Client Served	5	03/25/2015	Thanks to these guys who quickly stepped up to help the two brothers I rescued from a cat hoarder....Their names are Sir Maverick and Mr Monroe, I was told they were sisters then thought brother & sister which is where a sweet lady named Nancy came into contact with me to help get them spayed/neutered, long story short I dropped off a brother and sister only to pick up two brothers lol, KITTY MONROE was a BOY! !! So now its MR MONROE:) However after surgery, Maverick became super ill and lost weight rapidly from vomiting anything he ate and I knew he wouldn't survive another day but here I am a single mother and money wasn't available to me until a week later but I called Nancy who then contacted Sherry who in return contacted this nonprofit organization and it was literally within one conversation that they blindly jumped to save a face they've yet to even see but I will change that soon and post pictures of the TWO brothers bc they actually saved them both not knowing it bc MR MONROE became ill the next day but was able to get same meds as his bubba and they are back at being partners in crime, all thanks to this wonderful organization!!!!
Hot Springs Village Animal Welfare League Inc	207224		/users/profile/269826	Carole G.	Client Served	5	07/25/2014	We recently adopted a dog from our local HSV Animal Welfare League Shelter and couldn't be happier.  The void left by our previous dogs death was huge and we mourned appropriately.   You don't ever replace, you make more room, so we decided to find another dog for our family.  There are so many dogs in need..  We went to the HSV shelter and adopted a young male mix breed dog who has proven to be one of the wisest and happiest things we have done. He has brightened our lives and is a wonderful new family member.  He's smart and blended in seamlessly.At the shelter we were impressed by the cleanliness and caring staff who all seemed genuinely interested in the future of this wonderful fellow and wanted to make sure his future would be a bright one.  Indeed it has become just that.  Also, everyone seemed to be up to date on every animal's status and history.  We were very impressed and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
Hot Springs Village Animal Welfare League Inc	190810		/users/profile/249089	SarahY	Board Member	5	12/15/2013	I work as the membership chairperson on our board.  I am pretty new compared to many of our volunteers.  I am amazed at the level of caring and concern that the board members have.  The discussions are always thoughtful and straightforward with the animals best welfare as the top priority.   Our board works with our POA to find the best processes and solutions for any issues.   The over all group of volunteers has lots of energy and good humor to keep the animals in our care as happy as we possibly can.   People are always coming up with great ideas for fundraising to keep the animals fully vetted, housed and fed.  Our Adoption Counselors are tireless in their effort to network and find forever loving homes for the animals that are brought to us as strays and surrendered animals.  It seems to be a never ending job.   This group also does education in our schools, as well as low and no cost spay and neuter clinics in our surrounding rural area.  The outreach is just amazing.
Lupus Foundation of  Arkansas , Inc.	307411		/users/profile/398745	mandp2mail	Advisor	5	09/30/2016	The Lupus Foundation Of Arkansas is an organization dedicated to helping solve the questions and problems of Lupus.  Not only is the organization dedicated, but each member is, in some way, directly or indirectly affected by the problems of Lupus.  The members of the board are so dedicated that they devote unreported hours, each in the hundreds, to help spread the knowledge and awareness to the general public, as well as providing comfort and assistance to those with Lupus, and their families.   While I and my family have been blessed with not being affected with the disease, I was so impressed with this organization's dedication that I volunteered to assist in as many ways as I possibly could.Each year, the organization holds several events to assist in raising funds to further the cause of awareness and cure of Lupus.  Over the past several years the word has been spread, and the attendance at these events has grown.  It is an honor to serve for this organization.Michael
Lupus Foundation of  Arkansas , Inc.	38856	5	/users/profile/39747	jamesetta	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	I am a lupus patient who is not supposed to be here.  I believe the Lord spared my life to do this ministry to help other lupus patients and family members cope with this disease.  I work as a volunteer to try and eliminate some of the suffering lupus patients have to endure.  I do not want to see anyone have to go through what I had to go through simply because the doctors did not know anything about lupus.  We send lupus information to anyone requesting information including doctors and other healthcare professionals free of charge.  Education is the key to living well with lupus. We have support group meetings each month at Levi Hospital in the boardroom at 300 Prospect Avenue on the 2nd floor starting at 6:30 p.m.We started from nothing in a guest bedroom October 1993 now we are in an office paying $500.00 per month paying an office clerk for 20 hours per week. We serve the entire state of Arkansas, traveling throughout Arkansas whenever we receive a request and we are physically able to.  We attend funerals or visit lupus patients whenever we can.  Our concern is the LUPUS PATIENT and family members.  Listen to the patient.  Lupus patients let your voice be heard.  Let us do something to help those lupus patients in need of our support and show that we care.  The pain we live with on a daily basis is real and we cannot give up on life.  We have to learn to endure and keep pushing.  Lupus can be mild to severe and it can be life-threatening.  I have had both hips replaced and one knee replaced. Only waiting to have the other knee replaced.  We never know from one day to another how we will feel but we cannot let lupus rule us, we should rule the lupus.  Learn to cope, learn to ask others to help out when you cannot make it.  Change your lifestyle and learn to live with lupus.  The disease is unpredictable, but we can make it through.  Help us spread the word about lupus.  Become involved.  We have fundraisers for the cause of lupus; 3rd Saturday in April - It's for the Cause of Lupus Gospel Concert; 3rd Saturday in May 5K Race & Walk for Lupus Now; Golf tournament - June 5, 2010; Jazz concert- August 14, 2010Our only means of obtaining funds is through membership, contributions, memorials, and fundraising.  All net proceeds received are used to fulfill Our Mission.LUPUS PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WE NEED YOU TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED WITH THE CHAPTER.  SHOW THE PUBLIC THAT YOUR LIFE DOES MATTER AND THAT YOU ARE NOT JUST PRETENDING THAT YOU ARE TIRED AND THAT YOU ARE IN PAIN.  I CANNOT DO THIS ALONE, WE NEED YOUR HELP.  PLEASE, OUR MEMBERSHIP IS STATEWIDE,  EACH MEMBER RECEIVES A LOCAL NEWSLETTER 4 TIMES PER YEAR AND THE LUPUS NOW MAGAZINE 3 TIMES PER YEAR. WE ARE ALSO IN NEED OF BOARD MEMBERS.  HELP US.
Lupus Foundation of  Arkansas , Inc.	5602	11	/users/profile/7420	lupusarkhs	Volunteer	5	06/25/2009	The Lupus Foundation of America, Arkansas Chapter is the only organization within the state of Arkansas under the umbrella of the Lupus Foundation of America in Washington, DC.The organization has been in existence in HotSprings since October 1993 working as volunteers to help lupus patients understand what the disease is and what it can do.  Many lupus patients benefit from the job this Chapter does to improve the quality of life for lupus patients.  Monthly support group meetings and free literature on lupus gives the lupus patients hope after being diagnosed with lupus.  I rate this Chapter as being a 5.
Suzuki Institute For Musical Training, Inc.	62312		/users/profile/68110	christine	Client Served	4	02/01/2011	We have been involved in the Suzuki Association of Central Arkansas since the spring of 2005.  The value of the Suzuki method is immeasurable.  Our teachers have been patient, kind and professional.  We have had great success with the teaching methods through the Suzuki Association of Arkansas.
Suzuki Institute For Musical Training, Inc.	62075		/users/profile/67851	kelita	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	        My family has been involved in the suzuki association of central Arkansas for 5 years.  I have 3 daughters that play 3 different instruments that the organization supports: piano, violin, and guitar.  My oldest daughter plays piano and has attended workshops funded by SACA every year since she first began playing.  She LOVES the workshops and I think that they have really helped her to see the bigger musical picture of why her private instructor (and Mom) are emphasizing certain details in her music that may seem insignificant to her.  Her overall musicality has really blossomed as a result.           My oldest daughter has also participated in a performance funded through SACA involving 5 different pianos with students playing ensemble.  This is exactly the kind of experience that is nearly impossible to  arrange for piano students without the aid of a great organization like SACA!  The experience in ensemble playing that she gained was invaluable.  My daughter was also the recipient of a SACAscholarship which happened to be offered at a time of personal financial strain.  This scholarship made her feel valued and enabled her to continue her music lessons without interruption.         My second daughter has been taking violin lessons for 2 years.  All of her group violin classes are provided through SACA.  She attends 3 group classes each month with a mini-recital at the last group class.  I can not emphasize enough how motivating these group classes have been to her progress as a budding violinist.  She has learned so much from ensemble playing with her peers and the monthly recitals have helped her become very comfortable with performing for others.  She also learned a lot from the violin workshop that she attended last year.           My third daughter takes classical guitar lessons from a suzuki instructor who used to be involved with SACA.  Although not officially a member of SACA,  she has been able to participate in some of the home concerts that have been provided through the organization since both of her sisters are involved, and we pay the family groupfee for involvement.  My youngest daughter has benefited greatly from being allowed to participate in these informal performances.  I have seen how much my two oldest daughters have benefited from SACA events, and I am hopeful that with increased support of this great organization, my daughter's guitar instructor will become involved in SACA once again.         In summation, I think it takes a village to raise well-rounded musical children and SACA has helped to provide that village for my family.  I look forward to seeing this great organization continue to grow and flourish.

As one of their providers for veterinary care, I am always impressed by their attention to detail and support to their foster parents.  My only wish is that they would help us flood Arkansas adopters with already spayed/neutered animals like they do in New England!

Dogs are pulled from various shelters and are put into foster care where they wait until healthy enough to travel to our sister rescue in Boston. No dog is judged based on age, breed, or health.

Donations to this organization actually goes to benefit the animals not employees or shelter up keep.
Stop Animal Cruelty In Hot Spring County Arkansas Inc	245402	4	/users/profile/332557	Adminwoman	Donor	5	06/16/2015	Stop Animal Cruelty in Hot Spring & Garland Counties is an No Kill Animal Welfare-Humane Society group located in both Hot Spring & Garland Counties Arkansas. They are a 501 C-3 nonprofit organization ran solely by volunteers and all pets are kept in foster care. They are a donation funded only society and receive no government funding or financial assistance from any national organization. All donations benefit the animals as there is no expensive shelter with costly overheads and employees with large salaries. SAC was founded in 2008 to promote humane principles, prevent cruelty and alleviate fear, pain and suffering in animals.    They are now the only animal welfare organization in Hot Spring & Garland Counties that investigate reports of animal cruelty and abuse. Unfortunately the local Humane Society no longer assists animals in this way. SAC's certified Humane Investigators respond to an average of three to four reports of abuse or neglect weekly and intervene when necessary by way of education, or if need be prosecution.    SAC rescues pets weekly from the high kill city shelter in Malvern, AR. They re-home as many animals as possible themselves or search for rescue groups from all over the country who are willing to take animals from out of their areas to assist in re-homing.     Since late 2011, no treatable pet has lost its life in the Malvern shelter due to the tireless efforts and amazing dedication of Stop Animal Cruelty volunteers. On a 2 year average SAC rescues or assists in the re-homing of over 500 pets from their communities and provide over 600 people with assistance.     Volunteers sponsor large low-cost Spay & Neuter clinics twice each year in order to help alleviate the pet overpopulation.

When I chose to join the Friendship Community Care team, my first objective was to make a difference in someone else's life. Little did I know 7 years ago, what a difference someone else would make in mine. My consumer shows me the world through his eyes everyday we're together. He finds simple joy just from walking at the park and listening to the birds chirp. He loves to see the smile of laughter on little children's faces. He loves the animals at the shelter he volunteers for. The list goes on and on. My eyes have been opened to a whole new world by knowing my consumer. A world I would never have experienced had I not wanted to make a difference in someone else's life.

Arkansas Community Foundation, Inc.	7691	11	/users/profile/9544	Karole Risker	Board Member	5	07/29/2009	Harmon Field was host to a multitude of events over its 8 decade run. So during the last football game ever to be played on it they had all Paragould High School alumni march past according to their decade. I crossed the field with the "90s" crowd and thought "This should be an endowment!" I wasn't sure how in the world to turn that into one, but in the end we established a fund for the Paragould Band Boosters, an entity that had used the field for decades. We had anyone contribute who had an affiliation with the field-band members, football players, homecoming royalty, track stars, etc. We even had an 80 for 80 for 80--80 people to contribute $80 for the 80 years of Harmon Fields' existence. Today, the endowment is fully funded. It was all possible through ARCF. There is no other outlet like it for bringing people together and for creative giving.

I have witnessed so many misrepresentations and outright lies by the CEO to the board and to sponsors. CEO is abusive, secretive, and highly overpaid (including her husbands consulting fee). 
Champions For Kids	254582	7	/users/profile/342936	TheTexan	Former staff	1	09/01/2015	It is not surprising that this nonprofit does not have an impact report, since most "impact" is estimated or inferred from work that other organizations actually perform. It's shocking that it is even considered a nonprofit, since there is virtually no donor base or traditonal fundraising/stewardship.  Many, like myself, left emotionally battered due to the dysfunctional micromanagement from the CEO. Employees are undermined, lied to, bullied into submission and (at times) yelled at by the CEO. Complaints fall of the COO's deaf ears, and the board is stocked with sycophants who are given guilded, incorrect pictures of operations. Over the last 10 years, more than 25 employees have left due to the CEO's actions, and those brave enough to confront the CEO or COO have been branded "unprofessional" or slandered.  This is a nonprofit in title only.

I offered to volunteer and was given papers to complete, so they could have me on file.  Then nothing.  Months went by with no call, no contact of any kind, until their yard sale.  What a joke.  Mostly junk scattered around a church parking lot for sale.  No organization, no schedule of workers, no customer service, just piles of shoes, dishes, clothes, VCR tapes, books, no shelter from rain or other bad weather, and no prices on anything.  I offered to foster a cat, but again, did not get any communications.  Guess they don't need any help after all.

What followed was a decaying of a beautiful history and culture of the blues, the river, arts, Civil War history and more.  Now its coming back.  Thrive started a successful entrepreneur training center to give business skills to people with ideas, to give them web and logo designs, and help them be ready to get a loan to open.  They are the regional Kiva reps too. Thrive also works to improve the general quality of life locally through Helena Second Saturdays--a street festival for arts and artisans to sell their wares, by providing below-cost design services to clients, and by working with the local community to dream of a better future.  The next phase of Thrive is to set up an office in the 20 poorest counties in the US and replicate the work.  These Thrive leaders could be working anywhere and making money, but they choose to help the least of these and make a difference. They are heroes.

GIVE ME A CHANCE EQUINE RESCUE	103442		/users/profile/137896	dena825	Volunteer	5	01/14/2012	I have been involved with GMACER for approximately five years.  Hundreds of horses have been rescued and placed in new homes during that period.  The current president and vice-president, Tom and Polly Cates, are doing a super-human job with the 30 or so horses they have at the rescue at any given time.  They take on the severe cases of starvation and are also working with the ASPCA in finding good homes for rehabbed horses from a 2011 rescue.  This organization is worthy of our support, whether it be financial or volunteer work.   For the horses ~ Dena Popara

In our 55th anniversary year, we selected the Arkansas Foodbank Network as our primary Take Time to Give program charity for 2009. The organization received a significant financial contribution in addition to pro bono legal services and volunteer participation from the firm throughout the year, which included the annual National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive, Todays THV Summer Cereal Drive: Business Edition, its Golf For Food tournament, and established Mitchell Williams Friends & Family Volunteer Days. The organization was also featured in several of our marketing and client communications throughout the year. Helping our neighbors in need who are struggling made the Arkansas Foodbank Network the obvious choice for our efforts. The staff was extremely easy to work with and provided volunteer opportunities whenever we requested. We were proud to stand alongside them and their hunger relief initiatives as a community partner.
A Home In Haiti Inc	146738	1	/users/profile/193719	JenniferDianne	General Member of the Public	1	12/14/2012	Where is any information or financials on this organization?  It's been 2 years since they've been established and I can't find any public record as to where the money they raise is actually going.  They are currently raising money now for "Families of the Newton Shooting" but they don't list one organization they are supporting.  HopeMob is nothing more than glorified marketing for groups that are doing actual work, so launching a campaign with no listed beneficiary is a major fail.  Coupled with not financials anywhere, makes me think this group is ripe with fraud.  Where is the transparency?

Parents Of Murdered Children	213315	1	/users/profile/276495	Amysimone	Client Served	5	09/04/2014	My daughter was murdered on August 15, 2008 in Jacksonville, Arkansas and my life at that moment was forever altered. I spent  the next 3years numbing my pain, wanting to die, and just spinning out of control. Finally one day my aunt searched for a place for me to get help. She found a place called Parents Of Murdered Children and I began going to their support meetings. It was there that  I found others who felt like me and who we're experiencing the same thoughts and feelings. It's was there that I could speak of my daughter and no one got tired of hearing her name or my stories of her. It's was there that I found a new family full of love and understanding.  A place where there is no judgement, and no one saying "when are you going to get over this?"  Parents Of Murdered Children is a non-profit organization who helped those affected by homicide.  They help with on going emotional support, advocacy, prevention and awareness.  They also send out anniversary notes, accompany survivors to court hearings and parole hearings and they have memorials through out the year to recognize your loved one.  POMC has helped me and many other survivors of homicide.  Unfortunately there is a demanding need for POMC in Central Arkansas due to the doubled homicide rate this year.  My wish is for our community to donate and give to POMC and for anyone who is affected by homicide to come check us out at 916 Garland at 6:30p.m. On the second Tuesday and the forth Thursday of every month or to call our 24 hour hotline if in need of help.  501-375-POMC (7662).

LITERACY COUNCIL OF WHITE COUNTY	153950		/users/profile/204767	Melinda L.	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	I am in my 4th year as the AmeriCorps volunteer working with the Literacy Council of White County.  When I first started, I wasn't sure if I would like it or not.  I quickly found working with my students to be greatly satisfying.  The AmeriCorps term was originally only two years long.  I was thrilled when it was extended to 4 years.  Unfortunately, this is my last year as an AmeriCorps volunteer, however, I have already determined that it will not be my last year as a literacy council volunteer.  There is nothing like seeing the pride on a student's face as they proudly display their citizenship certificate.  There is an immense satisfaction in hearing someone else tell you that their friend, who happens to be your student, is willing to read the Bible in class, or to hear an ESL student tell you that she is no longer afraid to answer the phone at work.  It is truly a worthwhile program.  As most programs like this, we operate on donations and volunteers.  We are making enough of an impact that, mainly through word of mouth from our students, we have a waiting list of potential clients.  Come on out and help!  Not only do we change the lives of our students, be we also affect the lives of their families.

Circle Of Life Hospice Foundation	243831		/users/profile/330668	Bobby13	Client Served	1	05/28/2015	The nurses were wonderful with my Mother Matilda. She passed on May 6th 2015. I greatly have disappointment with this hospice, her last final 2 days. Medication was to be issued for her pain and discomfort. The meds never happened and everyone blams the other about it. JUST PATHETIC. The director of Circle of Life called me and told me that she would look into why the meds came 2 hours after my Mothers death. A lot of good that did!!  Furthermore, she told me she would get back with me within a few days with some answers, NEVER HAPPENED. This outfit should be ashamed of themselves to leave my Wife and I hanging on without answers. What really bothers us as well, is that this so called director gal from Circle of Life seemed upset about what happened, must have been a front and shes a great actress. Just imagine your Mother in her last few days uncomfortable because no one had the common sense to see what was going on. She might have even been able to pass peacefully in her sleep, not looking wide awake but passed as I saw her. I will never forget or forgive this organization for such a neglectful way of taking care of my Mom at the end of her life. The only reason I gave 1 star was the nurses were there for her in the past. Because of this I highly DO NOT recommend this hospice. R.Kaufman

It is located in rural north central Arkansas and is the only shelter in a 50 mile radius.  It is a private 501C-3 organization and takes in abandoned strays from Heber Springs and Cleburne County. After 17 years of keeping their adult dogs on chains outside, a new kennel building was opened in August 2007.  It is beautiful and the dogs seem very happy to have a great home.

In 2012, I attended the Phoenix University of Theology forum and graduation and was quite impressed. As the late founders ,Dr. Ron Hembree and Dr. Richard Drake would say, "To see someone come from so far from the dark side of the equation," such as the market place ministers to chaplaincy, and were given the opportunity to continue ministry while earning a much deserved degree.   Christian broadcasting, missions & church planting, women's ministry etc. were some other degrees offered in recognition for their work without drawing them away from it, but equipping them through the university.   If one could only hear the applause as a market place minister walked down to receive his doctorate this last November, before dozens of cheering and transformed lives through that man's ministry, that  this is clearly a needed unique program for unique ministers.

NAMI-ARKANSAS	91845	1	/users/profile/105181	Audrey	Volunteer	4	06/23/2011	Although NAMI Arkansas seems to have been non active for the past few years,  I 'm sure the potential is there within this state to become a powerful force for good within the Mental Health community.  I'm sure the reason NAMI Arkansas has not grown is due to the fact that they have little to no funding for their organization.Although I have lived in Kansas for over 20 years, I continue to travel to my home state of Arkansas to visit my children and other family members.  My heart will always be with the sufferers of mental illness in Arkansas.  Particularly since 2 of my children died there due to lack of proper mental health treatment.  My son, Marty was 28 years old when he took his life in the Arkansas State Hospital in 2002.  He was supposed to be on suicide watch.  Apparently, staff was not informed of this.My daughter, also diagnosed, took her life in Fayettevile, Arkansas in February, 2008.  She was 26 years old and had previoulsly attended U of A in pre law.  Both my son and daughter wrote poetry, sang, were funny, intelligent, beautiful young adults who had a lot to offer society, had they had the right treatment for their brain disorders.Because my husband and I have taught Family to Family education classes with NAMI Kansas for the past 11 years, we know that my children's illnesses were biological, physiological brain disorders.  They were not "crazy", they were burdened with a brain disorder that very few people understand.  The stigma surrounding their illnesses is  tragic in a modern society that can provide mountains of medical info for you or your child if diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or Lukemia.The education provided through National Alliance on Mental Illness is critical for families going through crises themselves or with a loved one. Education is neccessary to rid family members of two stmblingblocks  related to recovery: stigma and guilt. Arkansas needs NAMI education and support. -Audrey Auernheimer

I referred her to him because he was a very personable person and had provided several examples of how this organization has helped others.  I wish I had never done this.  My friend called him and she was belittled.  This man hurt her feelings with his assumptions and judgements.  I will tell all of my friends to be aware of this non-profit.  There are plenty of companies that I can donate in Paragould to assist that will not belittle and hurt those in need.
El Dorado Boys Club Foundation	135897		/users/profile/55301	shaun-best	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I would like to thank this organization for seeing my disabled status.  I've always viewed my recovery from a three-month coma as beneficial.  Many state & national organizations that promote the abilities of the disabled, do such while using terms that are disrespectful & criminal because they destroy human potential.  I approached Mrs. McBride of the El Dorado Boys & Girls Club & told her I would like to give a demonstration program on the challenges I face, now, as aresult of not wearing a helmet at age 12 in 1977.   The program is entitled "Challenged Conquistadors, Inc." where we do two things: promote a positive/beneficial perspective for those surviving cognitive challenges/brain injuries (which is our nations #1 disability among children) since injury is negatively defined like disabled, retarded, etc., which create a legal disability environment & we strongly promote the benefits of wearing a helmet, since not wearing one cost me the opportunity of my dreams to be in the Olympics & the Air Force.  Mrs. McBride loved the idea, this was in 2010.  As a result of starting here, I've been allowed to do positive presentations regarding the power of a positive perspective regarding self-esteem/self-concept at head starts, boy scouts, civic clubs, churches, schools, colleges, libraries, Wal Marts-bike area, stressing importance of helmets by sharing personal recovery & challenges imposed, etc.  I started this effort in 1978, but due to the image of those with brain injuries, few listened to me.  However, when I joined the Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) team at Southern Arkansas University (SAU) in 1995, Dr. Rankin, Ph.D., believed in my recovery & my competence.  This allowed our team to win regional finalists in 1995 & regional champions in 1996.  Both years my presentations got standing ovations from the corporate judges.  During 1995 while at SAU, my program was recognized as lead presenter for the 1995 Kappa Delta Pi International Honors Society, where H. Gardner of Harvard spoke on our multiple intelligences.  I addressed the linguistic intelligence (word smart).  The SAU Professor Emertius Ida Flemister wrote an article about our (CC & SAU) work and referenced it to H. Gardners book The Unschooled Mind.  I realize this is back ground information, but it shows that from 1997-2009, I or we were not listened too & how many lives could have been saved by wearing a helmet.

Arkansas Regional Organ Recovery Agency Inc	259878	2	/users/profile/348408	WillJustice	Former staff	1	09/27/2015	This agency is a modern-day grave-robbery, very corrupt and only interested in selling people's organs and body parts. Their consent process for organ and tissue donors is very unethical  and puts people's lives in danger. They are also very racist, and have willful discriminated against the black employees that work under the all-white board of the directors and a medical director who hates any persons of color.  They spend very little of their $11 million annual budget on organ donation, except to aggressive promote three or four people who have been helped. 
United Cerebral Palsy of Central Arkansas, Inc.	56305		/users/profile/58720	Mindy P.	Client Served	1	11/02/2010	I tried to find out information on resources in the state of Arkansas for my daughter who was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. I was told that there was nothing this organization could do for me because I did not live in or around the Little Rock area. I have since found the information out on my own through other agencies. I will not refer anyone to or call this organization again. 
National Center For Fathering	6942	1	/users/profile/8809	Jeana	Volunteer	0	07/21/2009	I am so honored you let me be a part of the "What my Father Means to Me" essay contest and celebration. I look forward to this event every year and am always willing to help out. I feel this is one of the worthiest causes I could be a part of. The National Center for Fathering not only has helped my husband grow as a father but it has also helped me grow as a mother and an individual. I am very pleased with the organization and tap in to your website frequently. It was so good to see you again and I definitely look forward to working with you again for next year's event and staying in touch until then. Thank you again for letting me be a part of this worthy cause.

EUREKA KIDS	10121	6	/users/profile/11981	EurekaMom	Client Served	5	09/09/2009	When we first moved to Eureka we lived in a tent. My son went to Eureka Kids every day that summer. He always came back happy. Eureka Kids made sure that we had groceries,money for the laundry and when we had saved enough money for an apt helped get us furniture and get us moved in.No matter what it was we needed or when we needed it, Ms. Barb helped us figure it out. We never could have gotten our first apt or figured out all the rules for ArKids if it were not for them.
Eastern Arkansas Ballet Inc	30092	3	/users/profile/31087	lishaburnett	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	I have been a volunteer for Mid-South Ballet Theatre for three years.  The performances and productions I have seen this company perform are wonderful and GREAT for school age children as well as adults.  I would highly recommend seeing their yearly production of the Nutcracker and Peter and the Wolf!
CASA,Court Appointed Special Advocates of the 2nd Judicial District-Arkansas	127904		/users/profile/173024	Shanna M.	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	I am writing this review to let everyone know what good work CASA does !!!  I have been a volunteer for over three years and have seen and helped so many young ones. With out CASA these kids would not have a voice in court.  CASA Volunteers check up on the kids to make sure they have what they need in Foster Care and in school.  CASA Volunteers make sure that the parents of these children know what to expect from DHS. We visit with the kids to find out what they want to happen in there cases. We make countless trips across the state to ensure that the children we are assigned to are safe. CASA makes a difference !!!! 
GENTLE SOULS PIT BULL RESCUE	231330	1	/users/profile/294919	gspbr	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Gentle Souls is an awesome organization that work their tails off for pits here in AR.  Sadly they are only able to save 15 or so at a time but all of their dogs are fully vetted and matched with the appropriate GOOD adopter.  
Our House Inc	219012	1	/users/profile/282628	jhughley	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	My company introduced me to OUR House and I have been very impressed with them. I would encourage all people that are interested in helping our homeless and nearly homeless population to visit this community and see the amazing work they are doing. The work they are doing with homeless single males and their families is particularly inspiring. 
Omni Center For Peace Justice And Ecology	28098	1	/users/profile/29174	gladys	Board Member	5	02/12/2010	This group has been operating since 2001 and has a great bunch of volunteers who do lots of different things.  One of my favorites is the Peace and Justice Heroes Banquet every summer.  A committee that I work on writes and calls all over the state of Arkansas looking for people who don't know they're working for peace, but they are.  We hold a beautiful banquet and present them an olympic-style medallion. People are working hard to do homeless shelters, food banks, women's shelters, help teens, create peace curriculum, help whistle blowers, and lots of great work; but they think they're just doing what they have to do. They're blown away when somebody recognizes them for creating a culture of peace.I'm always amazed about what people around here are willing to do when they see it has a good impact this struggling society.  Humans are just awesome when they have the chance.
Tender Heart Wildlife Rehabilitation Inc	111041		/users/profile/151127	Sandy25	Client Served	5	04/28/2012	We discovered a young turtle in our yard - that one of our dogs thought would be a nice chew toy.  His (her?) shell was cracked and broken in several places and there was possible internal damage.  After searching the web and calling several local vets - we came across the great folks at Tender Heart Wildlife Rescue.  They just happened to be in our area today and were willing to meet us to take on this little turtle.   We were very impressed with their quick response and even quicker evaluation of the situation - especially since their trip to our area involved the funeral of a loved one.  Thank you folks for your loving care of wildlife and willingness to help us on such a day! 
Arkansas Living History Association	278336		/users/profile/368260	Leita S.	Board Member	5	01/29/2016	I first became acquainted with this organization in 2008 when the museum I worked for assisted with an annual conference. I quickly realized the value of the training and networking opportunities available from long time experts in this field of education. I have paid hundreds of dollars to attend national workshops in this field. I learned more on less than $100 from this association. I have been involved since that first meeting and plan to continue.
Fistula Relief Foundation For Africa	181890	2	/users/profile/238646	frankyduor	General Member of the Public	3	10/24/2013	i learned about fistula when i was desperately looking for an NGO to at-list work as a volunteer because it is part of my hobbies and cant stand to see my brother or sister suffering yet they can get love and assistance from me. Though i have'n't got to join any volunteering team to date but one thing that keeps me up to date is through the emails i frequently receive by Fistula foundation. I have read a lot of touching stories that really moved me but through that it enables me to learn how to appreciate everything God has granted to us. Though i haven't participated in donation i believe my prayers are being heard upon them and that won't stop. It is great news for what Fistula foundation is doing especially for women. Keep the good work.

Lonoke County Animal Education And Rescue Team	322538		/users/profile/416432	Writer	Donor	5	02/02/2017	My family decided for Christmas last year, we wanted to make a donation to somewhere to benefit animals. I knew of this rescue, so I recommended we donate to them. We finally got all of our donations together and submitted it to the rescue through their paypal donation link (which made it super easy!) and the next day, they let us know "Memphis," one of the dogs in their rescue had a vet appointment, that was made possible by our donation. It was great to have an immediate response and know which animal our money was going to help. Great non-profit, great mission!
Alis Angels Foundation Inc	286711		/users/profile/376781	Rachel_T	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	www.facebook.com/angelali07 I would like to nominate Ali's Angels Foundation. Ali's Angels Foundation INC is very near and dear to my heart. You see, one of my dearest friends lost her daughter and hero Ali Vise whom had Battens Disease 1year and 2 months ago on September 16, 2014. Battens disease is a neurological, degenerative disease for which there is no cure or treatment at this time. Battens disease causes children who are normally developing and reaching milestones to loose those abilities they achieved. It takes their ability to walk, talk, see, eat by mouth, they become wheelchair bound and bed bound and left to live in a vegetative state until they die. They develop seizures that increasingly get worse. These children suffer every minute of everyday just as Ali did, but you see Ali fought this monster with grace. She put on her happy face and showed her ' BIG BRAVE', despite what she was going through. She stole the hearts of 135,000 people just from her Facebook page Ali's Angels. Her mommie Donya Catlett has been doing so many wonderful selfless acts if kindness since Ali's passing. She is in the process of getting a special need park built for our Special needs community so they do not have to sit back on the sidelines and feel left out due to a disability. Ali is Donyas hero and Donya is doing her best to keep Ali's memory and legacy alive. I have never met a child her age that could change the hearts of thousands without even speaking a word,as that is one of many skills lost during the regression of Battes Disease. This foundation means a lot to me and my donations and support to Ali's Angels Foundation will continue always. Ali's Angels Foundation is working very hard tirelessly to raise funds to begin building Phase 1 of Ali's Wonderland Park.This will be an all inclusive barrier free park that will serve all disabilities to non disabilities.Anyone will be able to go to Ali's Wonderland Park and play and explore and have fun without having to sit back on the sidelines and feel left out. I my self have a special needs child who requires 100% assistance to perform most activities,so if we are at a park that is not equipped for the disabled or special needs,then we have to sit back on the sidelines and watch as everyone else enjoys that park.Our hometown of Hot Springs Arkansas does not have a special needs park, So winning this contest would very much be a huge blessing to not only Ali and Donya,but to our specil needs/disabled community.Our community needs a speial needs park. Winning this contest would help out tremendously. We are #AliStrong.
Goodwill Industries of Arkansas, Inc.	147907	5	/users/profile/195720	jcully	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/09/2013	I always thought of Goodwill as a place to shop and find good deals.  I must admit that I wondered where the money went.  When a friend needed help finding a new job, we learned about what great services Goodwill offers to help people find jobs.  The staff was personable and very helpful.  They helped with everything from getting her resume together, getting job leads, and inviting her to their job fairs.  Best of all, it was all free!  Later when I needed help finding resources for a young man with disabilities, their staff helped me get connected to community resources.  I could go on and on about all of these things they do that I learned about but the website does a good job and offers free online classes too!
Ozark Natural Science Center Inc	291744		/users/profile/382197	Ozarksss	Donor	5	06/01/2016	Truly a unique non-profit in Arkansas. The educational and life experience it provides the students who attend the program is wonderful.  I can't put into words how grateful I am that ONSC exists.
