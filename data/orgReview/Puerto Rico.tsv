Mata Amritanandamayi Math	89241	2	/users/profile/18279	sharongita	Volunteer	5	05/25/2011	I first met Amma in 1995 and am continually moved by Amma's extraordinarily far reaching huge heart and charitable impact.  She encourages all of us to do volunteer work, stressing that to help others is the best we can do with our lives.To watch Amma give comfort to thousands at each of her 'programs' in the US, Canada, Europe and throughout the world is very inspiring.  She is a well, overflowing with love and compassion.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16525	1	/users/profile/18279	sharongita	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma is a most extraordinary example of Compassion and Love in action.  The impact of Ammas good work, is on a nearly unimaginable scale.  Her many humanitarian projects [including a hospital that provides state of the art free medical care, pensions for widows, construction of homes for widows and disaster victims, aid to farmers, construction of schools and making teachers available to children who would not otherwise receive education, aid to victims of natural disasters (from floods, to the tsunami, to hurricane Katrina)... ] are on a level that I have not before encountered in my nearly 60 years of life.  Amma has an enormous capacity to be both visionary and practical in the work she initiates.  She does not simply promote the giving of 'charity'.  She creates programs that empower large groups of individuals, such as: providing sewing machines to women so that they can productive and self-supporting; offering technical training to young people so that they will be employable; giving swim lessons to children traumatized by the losses they sustained due to the tsunami.  Finally, because Amma has inspired so many by her own loving example, great numbers of people volunteer to carry out the projects, thereby allowing a dollar to go a very long way.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	89119	1	/users/profile/17543	teja	Volunteer	5	05/24/2011	"Amma", "The Hugging Saint" "Mata Amritanandamayi Devi" "Mother" ... whatever your name for Her, She is a force to be respected, revered, and followed.  Her humanitarian work is breathtaking as it is.  From building homes to tsunami victims, erecting orphanages in Kenya and Haiti, providing jobs for women in India who have lost everything - reaching out to the destitute Indian farming families, offering swimming lessons to children who survived the Asian tsunami but had developed an arresting fear of water -- the lengths to which this woman will go to help humankind is staggering.And then, on top of all of that, She takes that moment - that precious, personal moment - with anyone, absolutely anyone, who will come to Her, and gives them a loving embrace.  She is constantly giving Her Darshan, or "Blessing" to the hundreds of thousands that flock to Her.  And to those who cannot come to Her ashram in India, she goes to them, traveling around the world 8 or 9 months out of the year.  Going to Africa, France, Germany, England and other EU countries, Japan, all over India, and the USA and Canada.  Her programs last 3 to 5 days in any given city, and the primary time is devoted to Her Darshan.She will sit in the same seat for hours and hours, never once getting up, never once complaining, never once leaving for Her own comfort.  On a typical Devi Bhava evening She will sit for over 12 hours giving Darshan, and she has been known to sit for even longer than that.  She has embraced over 26 MILLION people in Her lifetime.In Los Angeles, by Her instruction, we hold weekly feedings for the homeless and once a month hold a larger event at the Women's Center in downtown LA.  We pursue environmental efforts and hold classes on how to grow your own food, use sustainable energy and products, and maintain a conscious way of life for the environment and the world around you.  We hold weekly Satsangs where we are able to share in community, music and devotion to God.  Everything that Amma does and instructs others to do is based in the purest intention of: LOVE. I give thanks daily for the opportunity to be a part of this organization. Aum Amma.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15692	4	/users/profile/17543	teja	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The work that this organization does is staggering and inspiring.  I first grew aware of Mata Amritanandamayi Math when attending a local tour of Mata Amritanandamayi Ma herself;  I was there only for her blessing but while waiting for it I noticed all the many booths in the hall dedicated to humanitarian efforts around the world.There were local food drives and weekly soup drives at homeless shelters all around Los Angeles.  There were sock drives to donate socks to needy children in India.  There were innumerable outreach programs to help the impoverished people in India receive schooling, housing, continued education into universities, etc.  The list continued.In addition there was a table dedicated to environmental awareness and recycled objects overflowed  the booth; wallets, shoulder bags, even sandals, made from woven plastic bags! Right next to that booth stood a table with plants and environmentally friendly soaps, pens, pencils, paper, laundry detergent.All these tables and more surrounded me.  And I thought, "Amma takes every one of these efforts all around the world.  She raises people's awareness in hundreds of cities, each city drawing in anywhere from 4,000-7,000 people per tour...she is slowly reaching the whole world with her messages of human, environmental, and emotional awareness! Now THIS is someone special."I believe that the Mata Amritanandamayi Math is one of the single most inspiring and influential non-profits in the world.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	22944	1	/users/profile/23978	Nishamittal21@yahoo.com	Volunteer	5	11/23/2009	Reminiscent of Mother Teresa, Mata Amritanandamayi's divine message of love and compassion has been spread to nearly 35 million people across the globe for which she has been affectionately dubbed by the press as "the hugging saint." Her organization has already built more than 35,000 houses for the homeless in India (100,000 more are scheduled in coming years), provided health care and pensions for thousands of indigent, elderly, and terminally ill persons, and created educational facilities for youths, among other humanitarian services.  She has touched my heart deeply with her love and care.  I now feel life is much more about giving than receiving.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	20229	1	/users/profile/21392	xelagu	Volunteer	5	10/28/2009	After years working with social movements in Latin America and teaching in the slums of Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo, I was amazed to discover Mata Amritanandamayi's work in India.  Combining thorough organization, joy, spirit, creativity, women's rights, deep pedagogical insight, profound ecological awareness and people's empowerment techniques, her work has had a powerful impact on me. I have learned and wish to share her humanitarian ideals of creating schools, crafting innovative higher learning experiences and development opportunities for youth such as ingeneering and novel ways of cultivating and building ecological housing.  An inspiration.  I have witnessed everyone involved working hard, rapid efficient organization skills,  total reduction of waste and funds go directly to the projects.  A lot of work and love that we can all learn and benefit from.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19601	1	/users/profile/20806	bhama	Volunteer	5	10/24/2009	I have known Amma since 1990. Over the years of being able to be in her presence I have witnessed first hand how compassionate, loving and wise she is. She stresses SEVA (selfless service) and is usually the first one to be on the ground either mixing cement, cleaning rice, bringing wood,taking care of the ashram anmals, any number of tasks that the ashram is involved with as an example of seva for us all. Out of compassion for the poor, widowed women,the sick and children with any number of difficulties, she has taken over orphanages, built hospitals and many many homes for widows and recently the tsunami survivors. One of her early projects was taking over a sorely neglected orphange. She Provided them with proper beds, meals and clothing and daily lessons. I visited this orphanage when I was in India in the 90's. The children were so vibrant, healthy and active. They sang for us when we visited. I was touched at how happy they seemed. Recently she has begun another one in Africa. Her charitable activies beyond the ones I mentioned are so numerous I can't begin to list them all. She is a light to the world and an example to us all.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19092	1	/users/profile/20339	JMB	Former staff	5	10/21/2009	Helping to organize the now continued yearly cookie donation to Meals on Wheels for Christmas and Valentine's Day was heart warming. Some of the recipients received as their only Christmas gift, our individually packaged cookies with its own decoration.The recipients kept the unique, hand written note which was included on their package,often reading it over and over during the holidays, and we learned, for years to come. Amma devotees would bake, bring the cookies to the Amma Center in Montreal, and with all sorts of decorations, hot glue which would sometimes burn us, and pens, decorate the little boxes or bags to be delivered the next day.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19053	12	/users/profile/20298	AmmasSivani108	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I met Mata Amritanandamayi at a small convention center in Chicago IL program on July 3, 1995. I came as a skeptical observer and to placate some friends who had talked about this 'Ammachi' lady for years. I stood away from the crowd and tried to be as unbiased a witness to her darsan or hug as possible. Quite frankly I couldn't imagine why these people were waiting in line for so many hours to see her. Quite frankly, I hate crowds and to make matters worse,the air conditioning wasn't working. As I watched her, I was amazed that she could greet each person with the same warmth and energy as she'd done to the last person she'd embraced. Hours passed and she hadn't taken a break or a drink - I had needed hourly breaks because of the terrible heat- and I wondered how this was humanly possible. Needless to say, I was awed and deeply touched by the self sacrifice I saw that unforgetable evening. It was life changing on so many levels, but specifically her example had me question what I had been doing in my own life for others. At the very least, I began to see Amma as an amazing role model for how we should be to other people: attentive to others, embracing their differences without judgement and with a loving and accepting heart. Amma inspired me to open up to things I'd always wanted to do, but been afraid of. Since meeting her I've been inspired to volunteer at hospice, to work with severely disabled children and brain-injured groups, all while finishing my R.N. degree. I can only thank dear Amma for the inspiration and encouragement to make the leap of faith from  a self-centered to an other-centered life.I had the opportunity to travel to Amma's ashram in 2003, and see her charitable activities and institutions for myself. AIMS Hospital in Cochin was amazing - our American health care experts would do well to study how Amma's organizations stretch resources to care for so many poor. Monthly, I saw the poor widows line up at the ashram to get their pension checks. In a country that has no social welfare network, Amma has taken on that role for countless poor families, especially  women and children. I also witnessed Amma's announcement at that time that she would take on the educating of exploited women and girls forced into prostitution - quite a high risk enterprise. This was all pre-tsunami, an event that accelerated Amma's charitable resources beyond what we imagined was possible. With our local ACM group (Amma Center of Michigan), we joined forces with others worldwide who've been moved by Amma's example of selflessness, to raise money in whatever small way we could, to help with this and other disasters. Our family and friends find it an enjoyable Saturday activity to help cook lunch at a local homeless shelter as part of the Mother's Kitchen project. When I look back at almost 15 years since I've met Amma, I've had the privelege to meet and work with so many talented and devoted volunteers from all over the world, it truly amazes me. Amma encourages all of us to fearlessly do our part for each other and for our earth; to treat everything and everybody with respect and gratitude.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19051	10	/users/profile/20296	hariamma	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Six years ago, I didn't know much about Amma or the M.A. Math. After my wife met Amma in 2003 I used to accompany her as it was a long drive from our house. Slowly I started to see Amma's service attitude,  her compassion for all human beings, her perseverance and her relentless pursuit of providing comfort for the needy. She never gets tired of serving the needy, and has instilled the same spirit in a number of her followers. Her organization was one of the first one to pledge support for the Tsunami victims in India. The organization also gave a large sum of money to the victims of Katrina in Louisiana, USA.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19044	5	/users/profile/20291	Padma	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	MA Math has been a great instrument of transformation and awakening to me. Amma's first Darshan and unconditional love kindled the first spark of love and service in me. The dramatic transformation and healing She brings about in all the people around her and away from her is remarkable and inspiring. The love and spirit of service she kindles in each individual spreads like fire across her organization. A good example is the MA math support for the Tsunami victims and the Suicide farmers in India. Inspired by Amma, thousands of people across the world reached out to contribute thier share, some left their jobs to be physically there to help, while others sent in their contributions in cash or kind.  The organization is a role model in commitment to humanitarian activities, while Amma is the inspiration behind it, spreading the message of Love, Compassion, and Self-less service.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19019	5	/users/profile/20271	Aparna Mulberry	Former staff	5	10/21/2009	Amma is the most amazing person in this Universe. She does SOOO much for everyone from hugging millions to building towns for earthquake victims to starting huge hospitals and schools. She's a mother to millions and is so compassionate and loving. YAY MATA AMRITANANDAMAYI!!!!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	19015	4	/users/profile/20268	ppanoop	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	It is great to serve the poor and work for the humanity. Amma's organization are always leaning towards the weaker section of the society and put all effort to uplift them in all ways they can.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18993	4	/users/profile/20250	skamat	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have enjoyed volunteering with the MA math over the last five + years. Amma is a great inspiration to all the activities and Her tireless efforts sets the bar very high for all of us volunteers and staff. The Math is very focused on providing support to the needy and the selection of projects (like Tsunami Relief, etc.) are a reflection of this focus.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18976	4	/users/profile/20233	devidas	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Here in the USA I have helped with many of the Math's activities like planting fruit trees, visiting the sick and elderly,  "Katrina relief" both money as well as clothing and food.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18973	1	/users/profile/20230	josegriego	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Ammaji has brought immeasurable love and compassion into our lives. The charitable work she does for suffering communities in India and the world has had a tremendous impact on assuaging the suffering of the poor and those who have been victims of calamities.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18949	1	/users/profile/20210	amritapriya	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Being with Amma is a blessing in itself. And to get a chance to serve Her is the biggest blessing. Amma always stresses on how nature is not taken care of and insists on doing good to the nature and not harming it. With Ammas go green projects not only did I the chance to become close to nature but also an opportunity to do something for the society!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18936	1	/users/profile/20197	rob108	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2009	Being around Amma and the volunteers who work tirelessly to alleviate suffering wherever possible is one of the most heartening experiences of a lifetime. She and her volunteers are profoundly rare humanitarians. Suffice it to say that if a greater percentage of the world's population emulated this example, then the world would be a far improved place. The commitment to social service comes from a very deep and sacred place at the Math or at the MA Center in the U.S. One can know that any donation given to these charities will not be wasted on administrative expenses. Instead it will be used to buy indispensable materials such as cement, from which volunteers will build something like a house for the homeless, or a free medical clinic in some disaster zone. The list of charitable causes grows all the time. To volunteer personally promises to be a life transforming experience. A+++
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18881	1	/users/profile/20154	Jagadeep	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have participated in many projects for the MA Math humanitarian charities, from regularly cooking for and feeding the homeless, to holding art auctions to raise money for the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and even Katrina.  I just returned from two months at MA Math, where I wrote and directed some educational videos that will be incorporated into a cutting edge software that uses haptics to teach young Malayalam men and women trade skills so they can apprentice with a professional and get a job.  The software is aimed at educating students in fields where the equipment is expensive or hard to come by; the pilot program is vocational plumbing.  Touch-screen training stations are planned for throughout India.  Students watch an instructional video, then learn to operate the tools in virtual space on a computer.  Bench vices, pipe vices, die and die stock, drilling machines, etc. are quite expensive and rare for rural Indians.  The haptics equipment connected to the computer allows the students to manipulate a CGI version of the tools in a manner as close to reality as possible.  So these students then have basic skills they can take to apprentice with a professional and then find a job.  Plumbing is the pilot program, but the applications are endless, and useful wherever the necessary equipment is out of reach of the ordinary rural Indian - aircraft maintenance, for instance, is the next planned vocational module.  Though I only spent two months on this particular project, many more will be necessary to complete the entire program; my part is a tiny part in the whole of a group of dedicated visionaries and programmers and professionals, all of whom lend their skills voluntarily to create a series of educational stations that will help educate rural India and give its people the means to make a living in the global economy.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18856	1	/users/profile/20138	Narayan	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	As someone who has been involved with the above organisation for fifteen years, I never cease to be amazed at the incredible array of charitable activities that Amma oversees through her organisation.The list is amazingly long, and grows dramatically every year.  The other amazing thing is that there is never an active request for money.  All of the activities are possible because countless thousands are moved to help others in need as a result of Amma's personal example.Some examples are:100,000 homes build in India and given away free of charge to the most needy.50,000 pensions given to widows, single parents and those in greatest needAround $60 million dollars in aid was provided when the tsunami struck some years ago$1 million was proved for victimes of Hurricane KatrinaDozens of schools, tertiary institutions, hospitals, hospices, orphanages, etc.A senior official from the United Nations commented on how incredibly effective every dollar of contribution to Amma's charitable activities is, compared with virtually all other non-profit organisations. For all those wanted to help, rest assured that any support you give will be very gratefully received and very effectively used!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18854	1	/users/profile/20135	MA Math Fan	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math is the best non profit I have ever come across in one key way - the impact it has on the cause for every dollar donated. I have an MBA in Finance from the Wharton School of Business where we studied the challenges and the overheads in managing non-profits. The key detail that fascinated me about this organization is that over 95% of the money donated actually goes to the cause with less than 5% overhead while other organizations working toward the same causes have 40-50% overhead! This remarkable achievement by this organization while maintaining the highest quality of execution in a sustainable manner for over a decade is worthy of recognition.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18848	4	/users/profile/20130	shawnbr	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have seen in India the results of much of the Maths work. I have recorded on film and have been touched by the help given to the poorest of the poor receiving food, shelter, medicine, surgery as well as a spiritual uplifting.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18842	3	/users/profile/20126	Grace108	Donor	4	10/21/2009	I have a lot of respect for M.A. Maths humanitarian work. They have a huge variety of projects, and the fact that most of the work is done by volunteers means our donations can make more of a difference for those who most need help. I also appreciate the Maths range of focus from helping to meet basic food, health and shelter needs, to the importance of education, which empowers people to end the cycle of poverty, and even planting trees for the long-term benefit of the country and the planet. I like the fact that I can donate money to a specific campaign, like helping to prevent farmer suicides.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18837	3	/users/profile/20128	maa	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2009	I received mental peace and strength in handling difficult situations in personal life such as during sickness and 4 miscarriages.Also, I got to know the uniquely practical approach to societal problems such as poverty, homelessness, and sickness with love as the basis.Mata Amritanandamayi Math is the best non-profit organization that I've ever been associated with in my lifetime.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18817	3	/users/profile/20115	lulu and paisley	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	AMMAAMMA's compassion and Divine Love emanates from her being, as if she is transparent and one can see clearly her beautiful heart. She is omni present and she is real, a wonderful combination.Not only of my own direct experience, but that which I am privileged to witness, the affect of AMMA in people's lives is amazing - she is the embodiment of a being's personal love transposing in concentrated Universal Love.From there one can actually trace her rivers of love - to her unlimited and perhaps unparallel humanitarism; from the state of the art Hospitals that give free treatment to those that would otherwise be denied, to schools, universities and beyond - AMMA has become something more than a mere being - she has become a vehicle to so many, transporting them from destitute to providing relief when needed. For instance, when the Tsunami hit, where was AMMA? She responds quickly and effectively, supporting emergency crews to go out immediately, without delay, and at the same time has the ability for long-term benefits to the people.Houses were built and donated to those that lost their homes; widows who survived the sad state of suicide when their farming husbands could not provide - AMMA responded with given widows a means in which to take care of themselves and their families, she provided pensions; children that were orphaned from this tragedy were adopted by AMMA and housed in her loving orphanage(s) are taken care of - sent to school to learn not only their own cultural history and customs, but also provides them with a wide scope of learning opportunities - the children are given the experience of education, to learn, thrive and grow from a point where otherwise they might all contract and give up or become impoverished and embittered, instead AMMA and her organizations create 'space' for all to see and be part of the light, to be a contributing faction of their communities and thus when one benefits, we all benefit.AMMA, in my opinion, but not limited to just to myself - IS an INSPIRATION to the rest of the world, she is a global light that illuminates and activates humanity's compassion worldwide.Simply put, AMMA is one of the best embodiments of compassion, with intelligence and ability ever, and the fact that she is living in our time can count our selves blest. AMMA engenders such trust that people are confident to send donations from all over the world - this is something to be remarked upon.AMMA is a sat guru, a present day living saint without boarders. One of many examples or exemplification of AMMAs far reaching charitable actions would be when the tragedy of Katrina hit the US shores - AMMA sent, I believe, a million dollars to the American government to help its own people, as the aid and response in this situation seemed to be slow coming from their own government. AMMA did this out of her desire to help and originates from her true pure heart. Not saying that AMMA is perfect, yet she is certainly something that is to aspire towards. She is in all ways an effective iconic figure that moves beyond words, her actions speak for themselves. She does not ask anyone to change their ways, their religion or anything, she is just present and there for any and all that reach out for her.AMMA is one of my eternal role model, one of my of my favourite force of love, an immeasurable fabric of true compassion - her love is the essence, a golden thread that weaves together and strengthens the goodwill in the fabric of humanity that already exists. AMMA may not be doing anything new, but she doing it well, doing it lovingly and doing it for no merit - she and her organizations and all the people in it are doing all that they do, with consciousness and deliberate acts of loving-kindness. AMMA is not just one person, her whole being has long ago merged with all sentient beings, and you can see this in all of her interactions, even with animals and especially with children, but with all of us.AMMA has allowed all of us to become part of her, connected with her and you can feel that she acknowledges every person for doing their part - it is not a one being show. We all have a unique and special relationship with her - even before my first hug, I knew she was real, in the spiritual sense, that she is of service to one and all and is a direct link to that of all that is right and good in this world. Of course once AMMA hugged me - a deeper, more sacred connection has been forged between us, without ownership of anything, just pure Divine Nectar (AMRIT) of Love that holds and melds all of us together. It is so easy for me to embrace such a being that actually actively embraces all of us, all of the world.Heart felt, in Divine Respect and Friendship, Lulu & Paisley

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18764	3	/users/profile/20090	muthu	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been associated with the organization for almost 15 years. During these 15 years, I have seen the number of humanitarian activities increase by leaps and bounds. The number of activities are too many to list here. To name a few, the organization is one of the first to respond when there is a natural calamity. The organization provides food, clothing, shelter, medical consultation, medicines, etc. Moreover all of the services are provided by volunteers who genuinely love doing the service. Many of them work long hours and do it with joy. I haven't seen any other organization provide this level of service and be so committed to the cause. During other times, the organization is involved in providing food, free housing, medical and eye clinics, etc. The organization is also involved with increasing awareness of the environment by planting trees and motivating others to do so. Other activities include training youth to devote a small part of their time towards social service. I have been involved in many of these activities and have been closely associated with many others who are closely involved with these activities as well.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18627	3	/users/profile/20020	Carl Bruce	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi, the founder and cornerstone for MA Math is truly a living saint. Her foundation is involved with every aspect of humanitarianism needed in India and the World today. She has founded hospitals, schools, orphanages, built homes for the homeless and feeds the hungry every day. She helps widows and other poor women to make a living for themselves and their children. She has also started a program to help the families of farmer-suicide and suicide prevention. They are involved in disaster relief of all kinds, most famously after the Tsunami in Southern India. It is impossible to do justice to this invaluable organization in this short story. I personally have given many hours of my time here the US to sorting donated medical supplies to ship to India for her hospitals and clinics and for disaster relief. Working with them is a wonderful feeling, full of love and devotion to helping our fellow 'man'. Mata Amritanandamyi herself is pure love and it pervades every aspect of the organization. Peace!Carl Bruce
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18513	3	/users/profile/19974	jakutty	Donor	5	10/21/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math (MA Math) is easily one of the most dedicated non-profit organizations that is bringing hope and change to the most unfortunate all over India.  Their humanitarian efforts are extremely diverse - ranging from disaster relief, free medical treatment, schools in rural areas, orphanages, pension for widows, training for the handicapped and much much more. The MA Math has constructed more than 40,000 homes for the poor all over India. The most notable attribute of the MA Math is that it is run entirely by volunteers. Hence most of the 100 paise of every Rupee donated goes directly to the needy.  This is in contrast to a number of other NGOs that have a high overhead.  A key differentiating quality of the MA Math is that it has continued to support the communities affected by disasters (like the 2003 Tsunami in my home state of Kerala) long after other government and NGO organizations have stopped. Through education, vocational training, medical camps, reconstruction work, sponsored weddings, financial aid, the MA Math has help rebuid entire communities. The MA Math continues to be my favorite for any donations I make. I am assured that my donations will be put to the best possible use.

We never went to Amma with any expectation but it seemed that Amma took care of all our needs without being asked. Seeing Amma's humanitarian activities and her dedication towards serving all human beings has motivated us also to engage in selfless service which gives us immense satisfaction and peace of mind.

The homeless are no longer invisible - we see ourselves reflected in them - and we can be change we want to occur in the world in the world one meal at a time. Amma's message is to serve each meal with love. We are a kitchen, we are a community of diverse faiths spanning the generations all called to answer the voice of hunger.

While in India, I served by preparing vegetables for the western canteen which served people, free of charge, who were participating in MA Math activities.  I also transcribe for publication from cassette tapes of satsangs by one of Amma's first and main swamis.  I spent many hours in this service.  The organization is efficient, comprehensive in their scope of services, carefully managed with direct oversight by Amma.  There is a high level of accountability instilled in volunteers.

Amma's compassion has won many hearts, wiped the tears of many people who are suffering. Still i recollect the sounds of tragedy during Tsunami, the efficacy of M.A.Math was undoubtedly proved during that time.I realized the importance of time, hardwork and selflessness after i got more and more involved with the organization. This organization is a living example of the saying 'Hands that help are holier than lips that pray!' . The volunteers in this organization not only pray for the world peace but put them in action by selflessly serving others. I just feel, i am so blessed to be part of this organization and what more..my life is to serve amma and her charitable works.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18464	2	/users/profile/19943	debbybates	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's humanitarian efforts are so far flung I find it a challenge to do them all justice. Amma is my teacher. She has taught me about unconditional love and selfless service to others. Her disaster relief efforts have aided people in the United States (Katrina victims), as well as tsunami victims in India. Her undying support to starving farmers in India who feel that their only resort is suicide is inspirational in how she holds hope out for others who have given up. Her work with poverty stricken children all over the world moves me to tears. Her care homes for children, the orphanages, hospitals, homes and slum renovations truly show her commitment to making a better life for all beings. Her teachings are based in love and respect for all peoples which causes a huge ripple throughout the world.

She encourages everyone of all ages and races to be involved in all kinds of service for the world, being an active role model for everyone through her tours and Embracing the World. She is the epitome of love and expresses it in everything she does. What more is there to say?
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18458	2	/users/profile/19938	5ant0sh1	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I first became aware of Mata Amritananda Math (M.A. Math) and it's founder, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (better known as Amma), in 1988. In the beginning my interest was more of a personal nature. Over the years, as I kept attending Amma's yearly U.S. programs I saw that here was a person who exemplified selflessness and service to others in a way I had never seen demonstrated before. Every year the charitable outreach programs have grown exponentially in a way that I can barely fathom. Amma's ability to reach and inspire thousands of people to imbibe the message of compassion and selfless service and put it into action is incredible and amazing. I have had the privilege to participate in volunteer projects of the M.A. Math, here, in the U.S., and abroad. This has provided many opportunities to witness and experience first hand the far reaching effects of the Math's mission and it's message to the world. One thing that deeply impresses me is that people from vastly differing backgrounds from around the world can come together so harmonisously  and work toward a common goal for the welfare of others. One year I was able to go with the Math to Bhuj, India, where severe earthquakes had devasted entire villages. The Math adopted three of these villages and rebuilt them entirely. There was a group of Japanese students there, who were staying over a number of weeks, to help the rebuilding process. The group I was traveling with was multi-national. Then there were the villagers themselves, who had suffered such great loss. We all pitched in and helped in whatever way we could during the couple of days I was there. Who cares that we didn't all speak the same language! For  some reason we were able to understand each other and get the work done. It was a language of the heart, motivated by a desire to serve in whatever way we could.Here in the U.S. I have helped with inventoring medical supplies to be shipped overseas to the Math's nonprofit super-speciality hospital, AIMS (Amrita Institute of Medical Science). This whole endeavor is done completely by volunteer effort. On any given day you can find  people in the warehouse meticuously going through every inch of supplies and recording it  on lists and packing it carefully in boxes to prepare for shipping. They do this of their own accord, on their own time, when perhaps they could be home doing something else. These are only two small examples. Times it by however many charitable projects the M.A. Math is involved in at any given time, add up the volunteers that help make it happen, and the figures are astounding. The fact that an organization can inspire and motivate people, not only in India, but across the globe, to give of their own time like this and instill in them a desire to serve, is awe-inspiring. On a personal level, my contact with Amma and the M.A. Math over the years has, I feel, changed me as a person, and is continuing to change me. I can no longer think of just myself. I find that on a very practical level I am able to apply this example of compassion and service and bring it in to other aspects of my life, including the workplace. It has made me more aware of the suffering of others and to be kinder and more caring. It has caused me to be more self-aware of how I conduct myself in my daily affairs. And I have learned that although we all may be from different places and speak different languages we are all intrically connected and part of one human family. Compassion and service to others has no boundaries.If I can be affected even in this small way, imagine the magnitude of this message of selfless service and the profound effect it has had on the millions of people that Amma and the M.A. Math have reached. All the M.A. Math's charitable projects are generated and sustained by volunteer efforts, both in time and in money. How is this possible? Only if the message of selfless service is being awakened in these millions of people around the globe. I have never seen an organization do this before on such a massive scale. The M.A. Math's message and mission is truly a universal one and is reflected in the vast breadth and effectiveness of it's endeavors.

It has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my life to engage in supporting the humanitarian activities of the M.A. Math. What attracted me was the total selfless volunteering practiced at the organizations and how the organization in totally volunteer driven thereby reducing overhead costs to a minimum. The message of love, compassion and selfless service exemplified by Mata Amritanandamayi Mayi, the founder of the organization is a great inspiration. It is really a gratifying experience to be part of the many humanitarian projects like free food and medicine to the needy, homes for the homeless, orphanages, scholarships for needy students, health care, disaster relief, environmental preservation etc etc.

I have been deeply touched by the generosity of their work, and by how much they do! The humanitarian efforts of Mata Amritanandamayi Math are helping millions of people worldwide through education, building houses for the poor, building environmental awareness, and cultivating compassion. I have participated in raising money for this charity and have volunteered writing letters to less fortunate and sick people.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18445	10	/users/profile/19933	adarsha108	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Ammas Amazing CharitiesId like to say a few words about Amma or Mata Amritanandamayi in regards to her amazing and totally thorough charitable contributions to this world.  The list of her charities and charitable works is mind boggling.  From hospitals, schools  lower, higher education, trade, technical and tribal schools for those who live in remote villages, orphanages, homes for the homeless, disaster relief help  with medical support, food and shelter, for tsunami, flood and earthquake victims. Amma has pensions for the poor, food and soup kitchens throughout India, Europe, and the United States and elderly care homes in India.  Amma's Circle of Love program is another one of her practical examples of universal compassion. Its whole purpose is to provide a network of compassionate service between those who are in need of assistance and those who would like to help them.   Amma also is very concerned about the preservation of nature she says: One of our priorities should be to preserve nature. We must put an end to the practice of destroying the environment for money, for our selfish short- term needs. Each family should grow trees and plants in their yard.   Thus, there are many environmental projects Amma is sponsoring through the Green Friends network.One project I work on a lot is Ammas housing project.  Every week we have a bake sale to earn money for building the many thousand homes which are so badly needed for those who are homeless and or have lost their homes to some disaster.  It used to take $750 to build a home in India, but with all the disasters Amma wants us to build very sturdy homes and now it takes $2000 to build a home.  We make about $400 per bake sale, so it takes at least 5 bake sales to make one home.  It is so simple to make something for this sale and in doing so we are truly bringing great joy to those who are less fortunate than ourselves.  Probably the most awe inspiring aspect of Amma is her ability to give and give of herself so infinitely to this world and thus she in turn inspires thousands and thousands of us to try and do the same.  She says, "We can never close our eyes to the world in the name of spirituality. As a result an unfathomable amount of charitable contributions are made to this world in the name of Mata Amritanandamayi Math.Most Respectfully,Adarsa Whitney
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18439	6	/users/profile/19923	sara1818	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's organizational preparedness and rapid response in various global disasters, from earthquakes to tsunamis to hurricanes is remarkable. Her endless compassion for ALL people is her sole driving force, and has led to the creation of so many institutions to help humanity. Her lack of politics and bureaucracy enables her organization to get to the heart of the problem and find immediate solutions. So many are devoted to her teachings and work that they will come from all over the world to help with an emergency. Her model should become standard practice for all governments.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18432	4	/users/profile/19920	chembalacnair	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma [Mata Amritanandamayi Devi] is an incarnation of pure love in human form. Each and every being getting an opportunity to have Darshan from Amma will definitely have experiences. So do I. In fact, experiences cannot be expressed as it is. One has to go through it. Me and my wife had very bad time in different occasions and it was Amma saved us both. In January 2000 my wife accidently fell down hitting her back head and went into coma. There was no hope and I was sitting near her bed at the emergency ward crying/calling out Amma. After sometime I fell unconsciously, but later I felt somebody was calling me. When I woke up I see my wife was crying and calling Amma Amma pointing towards bed corner; she said Amma is standing there, but I could not see anyone in the room. She went into sleep again. When she woke up she was in total bliss and told me that she could see Amma in the very room and She was consoling her and chant a mantra in her ears. Doctor came for check up with no hope, but could not believe seeing my wife sitting in the bed having tea. They could not believe their eyes. Only myself and wife know the reason being. She was discharged after routine tests.In the month of July this year I had been admitted in the hospital due to food poison. As I am working in the gulf keeping away from my family there was nobody to take care of me in the hospital. By the time pass by the poison spread all over and I lost my consciousness. Though I was in the unconscious state I could feel Amma's presence and smell Her fragrance; I saw somebody in white saree standing near my bed. I dont remember anything what happened later. I woke up in the morning; there was no problem - complete fit - and discharged very next day. The treating doctor and nurses were in wonder. Later last month I had a big escape from an accident. When one has full faith with the Supreme Doctor why worry.Amma Sharanam

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18427	3	/users/profile/19913	Sreemayi	Donor	5	10/21/2009	Homes & Slum RenovationOne in six people alive today lacks adequate shelter. As a result of poor shelter, polluted water and inadequate sanitation, 50,000 people - mostly women and children - die each day. The problem is disproportionately concentrated in the developing world. In India alone, there are more than 2.3 million homeless - and that figure doesn't include the 170 million slum dwellers. But homeless does not have to mean hopeless. In 1997, Embracing the World launched an initiative to build 25,000 homes for the homeless throughout India. Five years later, the goal was reached. With an average of six people living in each ETW-built house, that meant 125,000 people had moved from the streets or woefully inadequate shelters into the safety and comfort of their very own home. Upon completion of the project, Embracing the World immediately announced a second goal to build an additional 100,000 homes for the homeless throughout India. To date, more than 40,000 homes have been constructed in more than 60 locations across the length and breadth of India. As part of ETW's response to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, homes have also been constructed in Sri Lanka and Andaman Island.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18424	4	/users/profile/19909	tejaswini	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I was just in India and got to see first hand how this organization goes non-stop to creatively and sleflessley help anyone and everyone in need. Thousands of women came one day to receive their small pensions which enable them to live. The children from the orphanage came on another day and danced and smiled. Families with no livlihood have been retrained in sewing, and medical assisting and other skills. I saw schools and so many universities filled with so many students all being provided housing and loving care while in school. The list is practically endless as wherever a need arises they are there to fill it. Thanks to the encouragement of Amma, I was able to start a soup kitchen in the US and with a group of other volunteers feed so many homeless on a regular basis. This is happenning in many cities across the US and other countries too. Houses are bieng built, people are being trained to take care of themselves and their families and, medical care is being provided, many times free and always on a sliding scale, victims of eathquakes and tsunamies etc are being given emergency andlongterm help and homes and most of all are being provided with hope. So many people volunteer, cause they see every penny go to the people in need, and are so proud to donate their time to make our world not only better but more balanced.

At that time I was in Australia. Since then I do not miss a chance to connect with herself and the Math. I volunteered to prepare free meals and clean for children at risk and their tutors in Toronto. I was so inspired by Amma's work that I ended up in India at the head office of the organization where I spent 4 weeks. I was involved in so many diverse tasks: basically, I was kind of on-call for whatever help they needed to better provide support and help to disadvantaged people. that ranged from cleaning, to cooking, to repairing windows, to loading, unloading trucks. You name it. All the heads of the organization are true examples. I was happily surprised that the "Executives", I mean the Swamis share a room and have their bed on the floor... living like poor people, yet managing huge operations in India and around the world. Truly, yes, truly and deeply inspiring. A real example of service to others. Period.

Which i think is a very smart. Also it had developed camps for Kids to distract them from the constant remembrance of their loss. Every year the M.A Math helps in various other ways, providing home to the homeless, pension for the widows to help them get up and face life, help poor girls with their marriage. Then it helps motivate volunteers to conduct food camps for the home less all over the world.

I basically work in the medical sorting area (headed by a full time unpaid volunteer). Donations form various hospitals, are sorted by date etc, and inventoried. These then get sent to AIMS hospital India, Flying doctors etc. AIMS is the super-specialty hospital in India that provide state of the art treatment to the poorest people free (including hear surgery etc).  There are 1000s of more projects that happen  by unpaid volunteers. They have built 25,000 houses for Tsunami victims and more are being built. I personally am not able to participate in these but know that what ever little I can donate will be used 100% with very little overheads. They have recently started an orphanage in Kenya. These are just a few, it would be impossible to enumerate all that is done.

I was very interested in working with a non-profit which shared their donations directly with people in need.  The MA Math provides health care to people in need through a hospital, mobile clinics to people during disaster relief (i.e. big tsunami, earthquakes, hurricanes), as well as supplying food, blankets, housing, education, work training programs, scholarships, etc.  There are a variety of programs which range from planting trees to fighting hunger.   Another program is Circle of Love, where people write letters to the sick or lonely individuals, people in prisons, etc.  I have been VERY IMPRESSED how the organization delivers results and is made up by primarily volunteers around the world.  I feel happy to be able to share some of the knowledge I have gained in the corporate world with a non-profit of this caliber.  The goal is for all human beings to have their basic needs met (food, health, housing, occupation, education, etc).

Amma's organization through the beautiful inspiration from Amma, tirelessly works to uplift the entire world, spreading her message of pure love and compassion. I know no other organization that is as sincere in its efforts to help those in need, those who have been devastated by the complications that life presents. Everything from their Disaster Relief to their soup kitchens, and all their other innumerable service activities, I have not seen anything as such. They personally help everyone, not just by giving money, but by being there in the slums, to helping abused women, to helping families who have lost their homes in natural disasters, the list goes on. I have been personally touched by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, and have been forever changed by them. It has made me appreciate all that I have, and to have a loving and compassionate heart towards everyone and everything.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18332	6	/users/profile/19828	mnecessary	Donor	5	10/21/2009	I have been impressed by the efforts of this group to provide food, housing, medical care, and job training to a vast number of needy persons on a timely and on-going basis. When I visit their public programs annually and see reports of their accomplishments, I feel comfortable knowing that my donations are being maximized by devoted humanitarians.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18329	6	/users/profile/19830	harisudha	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	MA Math is an amazing charitable organization. It unconditionally assists the needy in every aspect of life: housing (it gives away houses that have been specially built), food(it supplies 3 cooked meals a day and gives supplies), clothing(distributes new clothes), vocational training(and will give the recipient free necessary equipment), free medical care, schooling (it runs its own schools held in high esteem),it will give all the necessary for poor couples who want to marry and perform the ceremony.It provides telemedicine to tribal areas  and  is always promptly on the scene when there is a natural disaster. And all this  and more truly delivered with love and respect.During my time as a volunteer I felt that MA Math was rebuilding all of India from the ground up, not just focusing on one aspect of charity  and with the aim of not having charity be the bottom line, but a re-emergence of the glory that once was India, a vision that India can and will lead the world in dharma once again, from the bottom up. And show other nations what can be done to confront any problem head on. When I volunteered, I saw this, and  didn't expect to think like this, but found that I did, again and again.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18323	6	/users/profile/19822	artemis	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been very moved by Amma's example to the world of the transformative effects of self-less service with humanity and nature. ie. providing compassion, love, solace, inspiration and wise counsel to myself and millions of others around the planet. Her dedication and helpful response to natural disasters and the myriad of other kinds of suffering (both for humans and nature ie. greenfriends).
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18322	6	/users/profile/19821	ammaschild	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Its been wonderful with this non profit organization. Not only are they doing wonderfully well serving humanity, every person benifits from sheer peace of mind and calmness from simply being around. One of the main mottos is performing 'seva' or service without an expectation of reward of any kind and the members of the non profit sincerely implement this idea in every walk of their lives. I have greatly benefitted from some selfless acts by individuals who have helped me out tremendously in times of trouble through words, thoughts and actions.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18321	6	/users/profile/19819	MIRACULOUSME	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	For about 20 years now I have been aware of the charitable projects conducted by M.A. Math.  I continue to be inspired by the scope of those many projects, the efficient manner in which their goals are accomplished, and the care to really delivering care and support, education and medicine, housing and food, and on and on, so wisely and with such attention to the whole well-being of each individual touched by these services.  I believe that the charitable projects of M.A. Math actually go farther than any other efforts Ive seen, in really making a difference in wholly affecting individuals and rebuilding communities.  The list of the M.A. Math projects is very long.  Most with whom Ive shared the number, diversity and breadth of these projects  are amazed.  Such intelligence, love, integrity is evident in whats being done!  I believe that others deserve to be inspired, too, and to know about whats possible on this planet in the very best sense.

Amma has touched not only my heart deeply, but also millions all around the world. With all of her charitable activities she has saved millions of lives, building hospitals to schools. She has brought millions of followers together around the world to help and serve selflessly. She is a true mahatma and is full of unconditional love and compassion. I cannot be more thankful to be able to help serve and be a part of MA Math.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18305	6	/users/profile/19803	efreedland	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I met Amma in 2003 and have been impressed with the humanitarian work she does around the world and how she influences ordinary people to join her causes and become increasingly involved in helping others. Her teachings focus on love and compassion and she demonstrates what she teaches everyday of her life.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18304	6	/users/profile/19804	induperuri	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I volunteered for the visit/program of Amma in Hyderabad. I volunteered for three days and I count these as the best days of my life. The public program saw huge crowds trying to get a glimpse of Amma. And when the actual darshan started, people kept pouring in to get their share of time with Amma. As a volunteer and a devotee myself, I experienced great happiness and true human spirit. Amma taught me to be humble, kind, and honest;most importantly respect and love others as yourself. I follow these truly and I see everything automatically changing to good forever. Despite the difficulties I face, I will always believe that love of Amma would be my guiding force and enable me to achieve triumph in the battle called life.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18303	6	/users/profile/19802	gsankaran	Donor	5	10/21/2009	Amma's organization is truly one where any contribution is multiplied by the time the beneficiaries receive help. Monetary donations are used by volunteers to directly help the needy. Whether it's the victims of Hurricane Katrina or the infamous Tsunami, needy people the world over benefit from the efforts of the MA Center and its followers.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18301	6	/users/profile/19799	olgagilmore	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Work of Mata Amritanandamayi Math is life-transforming, extremely important and inspiring. Led by a God-realized saint, Mata Amritanandamayi or Amma, it provides a huge range of services. To name a few: disaster relief,construction of homes for the homeless,top-quality medical care for the poor, pensions for the destitute,college education,orphanage, and many more. Amma travels the world, and brings hope and relief to millions of people. My life focus completely changed after meeting Amma in November 2004 in Michigan. I became actively involved with Amma's Center of Michigan, based in Ann Arbor. I regularly work in Mother's Kitchen where we serve lunches in a homeless center every Saturday. We organize many fundraisers to help Amma in her various charitable projects, and also contribute to local charities. I teach a free weekly yoga class, open to all. This summer, I actively worked on "green" gardening projects where we started a community vegetable garden, planted trees and flowers, and started an apple orchard. Amma leads and guides us every day, by Her own example, to work selflessly and help others in need.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18299	5	/users/profile/19800	Ammaswork	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	My daughter and I just returned from Southern India.  We took a trip to Amrtapuri, while there we witnessed hundres of widow women collecting pension cheques from Mata Amritanandamayi Math widow sponsorship program.  This is one of many programs Amma supports through her humanitarian activies.  I had read about the program but until I saw the numbers with my own eyes, I did not have any concept of how many people (families) Amma*s program affected.  These ladies returned home with the ablitly to feed their children. It is no wonder they had such mlarge smiles.  Amma*s humanitarian work is so great one would ask how does she do it.  LOVE & COMPASSION would be the answer.  Amma doesn*t ask anything more of us.  Her message is always the same.  She teaches by example.  Her work is her life.  Amma says it is better to wear the body out serving the poor than to allow it to rust away.  We should all spend time serving the poor and needy.  AIMS Hosptital in India is testimoney to Amma*s humanitarian effort in this world.  Please help spread Amma*s message of LOVE & COMPASSION today .  Grant her this award as I don*t know anyone moe deserving. Penny Anger CANADA
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18295	6	/users/profile/19797	JayH	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2009	I've been a supporter of the M. A. Math for several years because of the wide range of wonderful work they do. There are very few, if any, organizations that bring help to people in so many different ways. There are the dramatic forms of assistance that get our attention - such as huge efforts of Disaster Relief in response to major catastrophes like the Gujurat earthquake, the Asian Tsumnami, and Hurricane Katrina here in the US. But there are many, many less noticed, less dramatic programs in India that are going on continually:AIMS Hospital which provides state of the art medical care to people who cannot afford it; Mobile Medical Outreach programs that bring medical care to people in rural areas; Home Building programs to provide thousands of homes to people who would not otherwise have them; Free Food programs to feed the poor; Orphanages that give children a wholesome uplifting environment, practiical education, and pride in their culture; Elder Care homes and Hospices for the elderly; Pension programs for destitute women and widows who have no other source of income; Farmer Relief programs to prevent the rise of suicide among farmers whose farms can no longer support their families; Youth Education programs; Technical and Vocational schools; Environmental Awareness and Tree Planting programs - the list goes on and on.These are just some, but not all, of the things M.A. Math is doing.M.A. Math is reaching and helping many, many thousands of people.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18291	6	/users/profile/19793	Hbyrd	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math is truly serving people, touching hearts and changing lives.  I was present in Kochin when 108 couples were married by the Math.  All of the wardrobe, wedding doweries, ceremonial items were provided at no cost.  The joy and overwhelming happiness of those married was apparent.  They would not have been able to afford a wedding without the support of the Math.  This program continues on today on a regular basis.I also know the young man who heads the Prison Outreach program.  His life was transformed while in prison through contact from those in the LMath, and he now orchestrates a large effort to contact current prisoners and uplift their lives while in prison and develop a positive outlook personally and in their reentry into society upon release.  When a person feels human, loved in knowing that someone cares and that there is a reason to live, it changes their lives in unfathomable ways.I have also helped to oraganize IAM meditation classes for Indian communities in the United states that have deeply and profoundly changed the lives of the participants. They find deeper levels of peace within and increased effectiveness in almost every area of their lives.The Math helps volunteers develop an attitude of selfless service and unconditional love for all as they work with others.  People receiving the services with such deep needs are so grateful and experience a warmth in their hearts in knowing that there is hope and the others genuinely care for them.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18290	6	/users/profile/19791	urnottom	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	What can be said about an organization that is headed and inspired by the most compassionate, selfless, aware and enthusiastic woman in the world? This organization provides the opportunity for anyone in the world to help serve the poor and the needy.  Examples of this service include the following: [1] providing full scholarships for free education to 100,000 children (ages 10 to 15) of farmers living below the poverty line, many of the beneficiaries are in fact children who have lost one or both parents to suicide. [2] providing free vocational training to 5,000 different groups of women from impoverished agricultural families. [3] Building 30,000 free homes for the homeless and the destitute. [4] Spending $46 million on Tsunami Relief Work.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18286	6	/users/profile/19788	ksteele	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The MA Math provides a wide array of services to people in India and abroad.  In India, the center provides free legal assistance to indigenous people in tribal areas as well as for low-income people who cannot afford to pay attorney's legal fees.  After the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 earthquake, the MA Math entirely rebuilt several villages in India and provided humanitarian relief in neighboring countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc).  This organization provides free or subsidized state-of-the art medical care, runs orphanages and free schools for the poor and disabled, women's shelters, soup kitchens, several different environmental sustainability projects, microfinance projects and other enterprises aimed at promoting self-sufficiency.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18284	6	/users/profile/20146	mylord	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I was homeless and straving on the street with three children.When I was told about "mothers Kitchen"it is a place where voulnteers from "Amma"come and prepare and serve fresh vegatarian meals to the homeless.From there I was invited to come and meet Amma and to recieve a hug.Voulnteers came and picked us up,and then we got to meet Amma and we all recieved a hug.From that hug,and the love I recieved from Amma,I changed my life.I was able to find houseing and a job,and put my children back into school.Now I also volunteer and I serve food to the homeless.I attend a regular prayer group for the peace of the world every sat. night.Amma's love and selfless service has changed my entire life.I have never known another humanbeing who has given every breath she has ever taken for the sake of all others.She is the first to help in a disaster.She houses the homeless.She has provided medical services for people with out money.She has given hope to the helpless.She is the light in the darkest of times.She is hope it self.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18283	7	/users/profile/19785	D911	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi's Humanitarian work leaves you speechless. I have spent 17 years around her, which began when I was four years old. I have not seen, experienced or even read about anyone who does work like she does. The care, dedication and devotion to caring for the world equals to no other. Mata Amritanandamayi does not just serve children and adults with meals, medical service and homes, but with love. She is personally invovled in all her works. You can search the world over and not find one person that has helped millions upon millions in a number of countries in so many ways, like she has. Educational developments, Housing, Diaster Relief, Healthcare, Nature Restoration. The list goes on and on, and each and every one proceeds with the utmost dedicaton based on real moral values, simple values that we must help our fellow man. I have seen sick children, those crippled by the economy, come to Mata Amritanandamayi and cry on her lap for help. She works immediately, providing them with whatever she can. It literally melts your heart. One my favorite of her humanitarian efforts is Circle of Love. I've seen others write to prisoners in a way to get them to covert to their religion, whatever it may be. Circle of Love is the only Prison writing program Ive seen where they simply give the prisoner a friend, someone to talk to. They encourage the prisoners own faith instead of urging them to change. Its a beautiful thing when those who have commited past serious mistakes can change and become a valueable member of society. Her humanitarian efforts make you want to be a better person, thats is how powerful it is. How many help others just to help them? For nothing in return? Her works fill me with hope and optimism for this world. I help organize her Northwest Ayudh, where we do service in our community. Ive worked in Mothers Ktichen in America. We do our service with love, and we remember how hard Mata Amritnandamayi works, and it reminds us to do our job with just as much dedication. This world is currently filled with violence and lack of moral fiber. Doing humanitarian work is one way to do our part to restore peace.I dont think Id be as inspired to do my part without the knowledge and experience seeing Mata Amritanandamayi's works.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18282	7	/users/profile/19944	hanukid	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Ever since I came into contact with Amma about 17 years ago, I look for guidance for my day to day activities.  I consider Amma to be my spiritual master for all my day today activities.  During my visit to Amritapurni I have observed the utmost devotion of hundreds of students who are enrolled in Amma's school. So many students who are poor and orphans are extremely blessed to be guided under Amma's care in accommodation/schooling.  So many victims of Tsunami have been provided with housing which I could see while driving around Kerala.  Not only in India, throughout world her charity works touch everyone's heart. Like the Katrina that happened in USA when Amma's organization made large monetary donation to the relief fund.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18279	7	/users/profile/19782	Shoba	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	"Embracing the World" is not just a logo but a reality for Amma...one can't fathom how Amma manages to do EVERYTHING She does-she has literally embraced more than 30 million people...day after day, night after night sitting for hours. Amma hears peoples suffering time after time only to give an amazing amount of energy, hope and love. On top of that, the amount and variety of charitable contribution is amazing-hospitals, senior citizen center, women's shelter, schools, rehabilitation, reconstruction. It is all volunteer driven, because of Amma's inspiration 24 hours a day.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18278	6	/users/profile/19783	amud108	Former Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The Mata Amritanadamayi Math organizations humanitarian projects are numerous and diverse.  They range from orphanages and schools, to full blown disaster relief projects.  My personal experiences are about Mother's Kitchen  NYC, one of the many soup kitchens organized by this group.My initial visits several years ago consisted of several hours after work.  By then, the food was cooked, and my efforts were spent cleaning up.  My true appreciation for what Mothers Kitchen entailed came later when I went back to school and had more free time, and therefore was able to spend the entire day volunteering. The food was fresh and delicious, and primarily donated.  Although it took nearly an entire day to prepare and cook a full meal from scratch, it was completely worth it when you heard the appreciation expressed for the warm home-cooked vegetarian meal.  Furthermore, there was no air conditioning (or cooling system of any sort!) back in the kitchen by the stoves.  Yet every month, the cooks would be diligently cooking for up to 6 hours straight.  In my mind, this speaks volumes about the character of the people who volunteer their time and energy for this organization.Mothers Kitchen is a peaceful place created to feed those who are hungry with the same pride and love we take in feeding our own families.  All religions and faiths are welcome, united in the mission to show compassion for one another.  This is what makes Mata Amritanadamayi Math such a great organization.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18272	6	/users/profile/19774	KingCatDaddy	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	While Amma through Mata Amritanandamayi Math oversees many humantarian activites, I can tell you they keep a very close eye on expenditures. When money is spent, it is tracked and accounted for at all levels. I'll give you an example. Once a year Amma visits Dallas, TX as part of her North American tour. The event is open to the public during which many receive a blessing (Darshan) from Amma in the form of a hug. It is during this tour that funds are raised for her charitable activities. I volunteered with two people who were in charge of supplying the kitchen. EVERY purchase to the penny was tracked. Furthermore, the items that were purchased, and were not used, and able to be returned, were brought back for refunds. Even the funds the volunteers spent out of their own pocket was diligently tracked. In my own inadequate voice what I'm hoping to convey is that money donated to Amma is carefully and wisely spent on those in need.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18269	8	/users/profile/19771	fondue108	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I am stunned by the way the MA Math inspires people to mobilize together with positive spirits to do such great humanitarian work on an immense scale. THe efforts of the Math were noticed internationally during the tsunami, as volunteers sacrificed food and sleep, some for 3 days in a row continously, in order to prepare food, and ensure villagers' safety. Thousands were given shelter, food, water in the initial days of the tsunami. Mothers who had lost their children were given opportunities to reverse their tubal ligations to have another child. THe numerous times I hvae visited the Math, I have personally seen thousands tirelessly working without sleep. Some of the "seva" or selfless work that these volunteers perform is cleaning the kitchen, cooking, selling food, folding magazines that have stories and articles with a spiritual focus. These volunteers come from all different walks of life and all are tirelessly working in order to fund all the charitable organizations the math has created. In California, the main branch of the MA Math has now planted hundreds of trees in the spirit of preserving the environment, and has instilled love and awareness of mother nature and our natural surroundings. Although I have to say I am somewhat partial and biased towards this organization since I hvae been a part of it since the age of 12 (I am in my late 20s now), to see an organization blossom, and to see millions of people globally involved in the same cause has been so incredibly inspiring. I have seen these efforts and so many others' efforts bear fruit-a mother's smile when she saw her child post operatively after a crticial heart operation she woudln't have been able to provide to her child otherwise, or an orphan smile because she now has a family who cares about her welfare and happiness. I know a lot of these same statements can be made about many other humanitarian efforts by organizations who are inspiring. However, I truly believe the MA Math stands out from all of these organizations because of the sheer number of people globally committed ot the same cause. People of all walks of life, religions, ethnicities all work together under the same roof, or the same village in harmony, and look at the result! I think it speaks for itself!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18263	11	/users/profile/19767	sunua	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's charitable organization works to empower people so that they can be independent productive members of society.  From educating the poor to providing economic development for unemployed and economically needy women, to disaster relief, Amma's organization serves the needs of coutless people everywhere in the world. My daughter has taken part in a youth group to improve the environment through planting and discussing the needs of farmer-related suicide in India.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18261	8	/users/profile/19766	Lakshmi	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been involved with Mata Amritanandamayi Math for about 20 years.  Members have always been encouraged to get together with others in our areas and create our own projects to serve those in need. Through the Mother's Kitchen project, we have formed a group of 13 families.   Each week we rotate making 75-100 bag lunches for homeless people in the south bay area.  We give the lunches to Catholic Charities or the Day Worker Center to distribute. When it is my turn, I purchase the food and supplies and volunteers come to my house to help make the lunches.  Afterwards we have a potluck dinner. This has been working well for several years now.We also periodically cook dinner at local homeless shelters.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18259	10	/users/profile/19763	Simon	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	To watch Amma and her charitable organizations is truly inspiring.  When I am around Her and her devotees, while they perform countless hours of self-less service, it inpsires me to give more.  It inspires me to "count-my-blessings."  It inspires me to work harder.  And it inspires me to help others.We need more beings, like an Amma, to teach us self-less service, guide us to our true selves, and ease the suffering of humanity.

Amma's tireless devotion and service to the poor and needy has inspired a large number of volunteers to provide medical service, relief during disasters, provide food and housing to the needy among other expressions of compassion. I have been inspired by Amma to provide medical services to those in need in the county jail.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18254	8	/users/profile/19756	om.music39	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The MA Math has done an immense amount of humanitarian work. I went to help with the Tsunami Relief Efforts, with my family a few years ago. We built houses for those who had been severely affected by the tsunami, and my family had brought along 2 suitcases filled with clothing that we donated to the MA Math.

She has institutes which help those who need medical help, educational help, those who in one way or another are destitute.The real miracle however, is the number of people She has inspired to devote time, money and energy into helping with these projects. People, like myself, who without Her inspiration would have just been spectators to the misery of others.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18240	7	/users/profile/19746	Clare Maria	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math has made so many in roads to help the suffering people of India. I have seen footage of the tsunami and the relief efforts and seen the houses that have been built both in Kerala and in gujarat. Amma's example has such a powerful influence that so many people want to help and volunteer their time. I have also visited an orphanage in kerala where the children are learning about their culture asand given the opportunity to learn music and dance as well as receive an education. They seem very happy despite the tragedies that they have suffered. Amma has done so much to provide health care by creating a hospital and cochin and providing quality health care for those who can't afford it as well as providing university education to so many.The Math is truly a wonderful and inspiring place
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18234	6	/users/profile/19741	valsala	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been involved in Amma's charitable projects for many years.  Amma is constantly expanding the charities and the number of lives who are being helped by her mission.  Her unyielding energy and determination to help those who are in unfortunate situations inspires people from all around the world to pick up and become involved.  I have traveled with Amma both in India and outside India and have seen her in action initiating and overseeing charitable projects.  When in America, I am part of her Bay Area organization.  We help with fund raising efforts as well as local projects such as feeding the homeless, clothing and food drives, tree planting, and educational workshops and retreats.  Being in India during the Asian Tsunami showed me how fast Amma was able to respond with temporary housing, medical care, providing food, rebuilding homes, boats, and many many other services so desperately needed by those who were affected.  This is just one example of Amma's amazing ability to deliver help where needed.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18227	7	/users/profile/19733	cheyfaith	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The M.A. Math is a remarkable organization that has touched many lives across the globe.  Its humanitarian activities include feeding the hungry, orphanages, stipends for widows, disaster relief, free care for the poor at hospitals, and numerous other programs to support people in need all over the world. I visited the M.A. Math in India in 2003 and was extremely impressed by the many activities executed faithfully by M.A. Math volunteers.  The mission of the M.A. Math appears to know no boundaries; help is provided wherever it's needed.  The United Nations has conferred NGO status on the M.A. Math for its tsunami-relief efforts.  It is truly a remarkable organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18225	7	/users/profile/19731	Susi	Client Served	5	10/21/2009	I became severely ill, to the point of being unable to care for myself for a couple of years.  The group in Dallas, TX, connected with Mata Amritanadamay Math, adopted me under their Circle of Love program.  They asked to make a list of my needs, and then announced my needs in their regular group meeting.  Several people volunteered to help me.  One woman began to read to me on the phone once a week.  Another woman shopped for me at a specialty grocery store, which I could not go to.  another man offered to shop for me at Walmart and Costco.  He also met me (sometimes driving 20 minutes each way on his lunch break) to put gas in my car once I was able to start driving again.  They poured their support out on me in all kinds of ways, a small group of people each doing a little piece, in order to meet my needs.  This lasted for three and a half years.  As my needs changed, and I got stronger, their involvement with me changed as well in terms of errands that they did for me.  All of it was voluntary, and all of it was free.  I could feel their hearts and compassion in how they treated me and what they did for me.  The woman who began reading to me has become a friend, and we still read together approximately once a week (it's been seven years almost); it has become a prayer between us.  Their help cut through the deep isolation that came with my illness and helped me get back into the world, and gave me the strength to do my rehab, and stick with it.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18218	7	/users/profile/19725	mia	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's life is dedicated to selfless service, and to inspiring others to live by her example. The humanitarian projects she has undertaken and overseen are too numerous to document here - the schools, hospitals, housing, disaster relief etc etc she has created have been able to succeed in the way that they do, because of the way she rallies people together in the spirit of love and service. She's truly a Saint.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18217	7	/users/profile/19730	csummer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	In my experience I feel very happy anytime Mata Anandamayi Devi is involved in humanitarian work BECAUSE  all the work is volunteered (at no cost) by her devotees.This means that every dollar is doubled or tripled  in value.She has inspired the building of hospitals, schools and orphanages.She also inspires people to help when natural diasaters occur, anywhere in the world.How amazing! How wonderful!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18213	7	/users/profile/19720	golden	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Experience with Amma and the goodness that she shares to all humanity is unlimited.  The charities that she has established help to feed the homeless around the world. Her hospitals help to heal the sick. Orphanages help to uplift the lives of thousands of children. The beauty and joy that she brings to so many hearts is priceless.God bless her, and all who come in contact with the good works that she propagates.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18209	7	/users/profile/19716	Avinash	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have volunteered for Mother's Kitchen, a program to feed the poor and hungry for several years. I am generally very busy with work but have found the time I spend preparing and serving meals to the disadvantaged time well spent.  I love the camaraderie amongst the volunteers as together we chop vegetables and fruit, and prepare other food for serving. When the guests return with big smiles and empty plates, and exclaim how great the food is, my heart opens in gratitude for the opportunity to be in service to them. I hope never to find myself in such a place of dire need as our guests, but I pray that if I do, the is a group like Mother's Kitchen to fill my empty stomach.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18208	7	/users/profile/19717	lovingamma108	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	My husband and I have been members of this organization for 13 years.  We know of no other organization which has done so much for people all over the world.  We find it very inspiring and it brings hope to us to know of all this work being done by such dedicated and selfless individuals whose hearts are filled with love.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18207	5	/users/profile/19715	vaishnavi	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Since I came into contact with the MA Math, I have been consistently blown away by the ever-expanding scope of their work. I first visited the headquarters in Kerala, India some months after the ashram. What I really learned is that because they are not limited by needing to be accountable to donors, they can move fast and really get the help to where it is needed. I believe they were the first NGO to hand over keys to new houses to Tsunami victims because of this. Instead of waiting around to plan a course of action, they simply started cooking for thousands on the day of the Tsunami itself and continued feeding those thousands for several months to come. I watched vast pots being loaded onto small boats and rowed to the other side of the backwater and trolleyed to a serving station. Low-tech but essential, practical solutions. Because of the vast volunteer force, each cent donated to this organisation is magnified - none of it goes on administrative costs or publicity - I believe every penny goes to where it is intended - and value is added by the volunteer input. Another example of creativity in looking for win-wins is that a commercial arm, Amrita Technology, have developed some software which not only provides an affordable online educational tool to support students in the US but also funds education for orphans in India.I have volunteered extensively for this organization and continue to do so. My experiences have been rich, rewarding and have taught me so much more than years working for organizations such as the BBC!! there is a very grounded practical intelligence at play here which I feel is missing in so many other organizations. The only drawback of the lack of emphasis on administration and management is that at times there can be a sense of disorganization. Some volunteers have felt frustrated that their input was not being used as constructively as it could. But my overall view is that this is totally compensated for by the extraordinary and miraculous ways in which this organization appears able to meet needs - appropriately and rapidly.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18206	5	/users/profile/19713	radhika kamath	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2009	Amma in Hindi means mother. We are all Ammas children. When one of her children is suffering Amma goes to help them, even though they might be across the world. All of us should  pitch in to help people. This is why Amma has given the world many centers around us so that we can better the world we live in. Even the smallest things might help save a life. All you have to do is look around.There is a program called Institute of Peoples Education which is a place where people go around helping people young and old to get a better education to help them get through the world. Amrita Development Activities in Kerala and Tamil Nadui is a program that stimulates employment and environmental protection in villages. It also has medicinal plant reserves, high-density farming, a plant nursery, and 8 satellite-aided resource centers. Another program is Self-Reliance Employment & Empowerment Program in Kozhikode it helps unemployed people start up their own businesses.  The Seattle satsang group took on a community project of making scarves & hats for the homeless.  Akron Battered Women shelter is a project where devotees volunteer to teach yoga and computer training classes to help battered women in Akron, Ohio relax their lives. Amma's Hands is a New England effort that organizes extensive material support as well as services such as prayer commitments and hospital needs to the disadvantaged in the region. An activity in San Francisco is called the San Francisco shower project with the local high school and the Metropolitan Community church to provide over 200 hot showers as well as food and clothing every weekend to the homeless. This helps those people in need and involves the youth. S.A.V.E. is a non-profit organization based in Northern California. Its mission is to provide alternatives to violence through support services and education, and to assist violence victims and their families to end violence. The SAVE Project has been supported by of Amma  Center for the past nine years, giving help in many ways to a Safe Environment Against Violence. Every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas, Amma Center's makes special offers to the SAVE shelter in Hayward, California. On the last Sunday of every month, Ammas children meet in Carmel, California to give 2,000 pounds of rice to the familys workers and other needy people in the area. Beans and other food items are given, and every winter, warm clothing are collected and distributed as well. Clothes for children and babies, toys, and other things are always welcome. I live in Atlanta and every 3rd Saturday of the month my mom along with other friends cook delicious vegetarian meals like pasta, cookies. We all pitch in at times a little bit. This food is then delivered to an orphanage. Isnt that a nice way to help out. I am sure the kids love our moms food made fresh and with lots of luv. The same luv we get from Amma. After reading all of those heartwarming things, it makes you want to do something to help. You could donate money for these charities, you could volunteer for those programs, or you could even get your own personal idea on how to help. Amma is going around the world right now doing all of these things at once. The least you could do is help out at the center closest to you.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18202	5	/users/profile/19710	raynaamrita	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have personally witnessed the selfless, humanitarian work that the MA Math has been providing for years in India. I have had the opportunity to visit their orphanage and see firsthand the hight quality academic and cultural education the children are receiving.I have also had the chance to work at one of their schools in India and was so impressed with the dedication and care given to the education of the children. Amma herself is a saint who has tirelessly worked to ease the suffering of others for over 20 years. I have witnessed her giving homes and clothing and sewing machines to poor widows and helping families received desperately needed medical care at her AIMS Hospital.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18201	5	/users/profile/19709	jagrati	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have had an amazing experience participating with this non-profit. I am so inspired by Amma who sets such a great example of self-less service....and by all the volunteers who come together on a regular basis to raise money for those less fortunate. I work regularly with a nurse who finds time to organize finances, a doctor who is in charge of PR and a mother of two who helps cook for the organization All these people take time from their busy schedule to contribute with the intention of making the world a better place.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18196	6	/users/profile/19704	Stephen108	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I've have been a contributor to Amma's charities over the last ten years.As one looks to put their charitable dollars into causes, one can't help but to see that Amma's good will and kindness extends far beyond the normal charity.  When one searches for a place to do volunteer work, one could not be in a better organization.She has built a state of the art hospital and called upon well known Indian doctors around the world to come home and care for their fellow countrymen. I've been involved with raising money for the housing project which has built countless homes in India.  Recently one of our fellow volunteers went to a small village to tour recently built homes.  How rewarding it was for this volunteer and the rest of us to know that the project in working.  The people were so grateful. Amma builds schools and orphanages.  She feeds the destitute.  Around the world local chapters have regular homeless feedings.She is giving pensions to widows who are left without a rupee or a home after their husband dies.She is the mother of compassion for the sick and the misfortuned.  I am so fortunate to be part of Amm's solutions around the world.Thank you for considering Amma's Charities for this special recognition.All the best,Stephen HornyakLos Angeles, CA
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18195	5	/users/profile/19703	vidyasagar	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	My experience with Amma is that she is the most selfless, giving person I have ever known. Everything she does is for the sake of other, not her own. She hugs, consoles, and loves people for sometimes 24 hours non-stop. No human being in the world has done that or probably ever will. P
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18192	7	/users/profile/19701	preeti	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	This organization has helped me, and thousands like me, lead a much better and healthy life. Not only did they help improve my personality, they have helped me stand of my feet and be a confident engineer today. Time and again, I have seen that the education in the field of science and in the field of morale values which i received form this Org, has helped me. With the humanitarian projects this organization has taken up, they are not only helping individual people, they are helping raising the society to a whole different level. And that is what the world needs right now.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18191	5	/users/profile/19700	Bhavana	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I was in Kerala immediately after Asian tsunami 2005 and I saw the monks in the ashram work tirelessly. There were streets where  relief trucks could not go in. The monks, male and female would form a human chain pass relief materials. They worked 20 hours a day with little food and rest. This is a great organization. Somehow they know how to make more out of a dollar than in other places I have worked in. It is amazing!!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18190	6	/users/profile/19699	yogendran	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's charitable works are constantly inspiring. During one trip to India i observed her many educational facilities that are training thousands of professionals and lifting these people and their families out of poverty. Her hospital in Kochi is a medical marvel, state of the art, providing unequalled health care to anyone regardless of ability to pay. The days I visited showed how dedicated all the people there are. This dedication is contagious and so thousands around the world are inspired to follow Amma's path of selfless service, by feeding the poor and hungry and providing help where needed. in the US there are groups around the country who weekly provide food to the needy, and a new initiative to provide health screening to homeless.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18189	6	/users/profile/19697	Prasanna Ananth	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been involved in a number of service projects through this non profit organization and cannot say enough about how the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has changed my life. In 2004, following the Southeast Asian tsunami that devastated million of homes and lives, the MA Math helped garner donations from dozens of US hospitals to be used in health care facilities in India. Through this project, I was able to contribute medical supplies and contacts, and thousands of tsunami victims were aided. The MA Math, however, went beyond mere medical care; they constructed hundreds of homes and rebuilt whole communities in both South India and Sri Lanka. The Math provided free tubal ligation reversal surgeries to women who had lost children in the tsunami and were no longer able to conceive due to family planning measures taken prior to the natural disaster. The MA Math went above and beyond in providing care, love and basic needs to these victims. The MA Math does not limit its scope to India. I have participated in "Mother's Kitchen" activities in various soup kitchens around the US, where we prepare and serve delicious, healthy meals to the homeless. The MA Math also has built a free hospital in Kerala, India, to provide both basic and subspecialty medical care to those who need it most. In addition, the Math has donated $1 million to the Clinton Fund to help rehabilitate those Americans devastated by Hurricane Katrina. This is an organization with a phenomenal scope and a magnanimous heart. Moreover, the overhead costs are minimal, since every volunteer works for the Math free of charge. The Math is most deserving of this award.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18183	5	/users/profile/19694	rickarcher	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma inspired my wife and I to organize a fundraiser here in Iowa to benefit New Orleans victims of Hurricane Katrina. The event was very successful and a generous donation was raised and administered frugally by Amma volunteers in the Gulf area.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18182	5	/users/profile/19693	rabbit	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	One of the few organizations that serve many humanitarian needs, hospitals, schools, orphanages, disaster relief-the volunteers do everything for free-no strings attached.  The realization of donated funds towards the target activity is very high, i.e., admin costs are very low.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18181	4	/users/profile/19692	Shivadas	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The Mata AmritanAndamayi Math is the best charity I am aware of.  Amma has dedicated her entire life to charitable work.  Her organization is virtually entirely volunteer. This mean that almost all funds collected go to the work.  I highly recommend this charity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18178	5	/users/profile/19691	thunderwoman	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have been involved in three different Amma's charities. Mother's Kitchen,Circle of Love, and Circle of Love Inside. Mother's Kitchen delivers nutrious meals to a local shelter,I still volunteer in the past two years with Circle of Love Inside I wrote letters to men/women who are incarcerated. At the present time with Circle of Love letters I still continue to write letters to those whom are in need of support. I myself was a recipient of Circle of Love, when I experienced a death of a loved one I received alot of uplifting words in letters/and cards. Everyone whom I recommended to receive cards/letters has expressed nothing but positive thought on being a part of this Seva (service). I have been told by one person that they didn't know that people still care enugh to send a stranger a letter of encouragement & genuine care from the heart.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18176	4	/users/profile/19688	Deepak999	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The performance of Mata Amritandamayi Math (the "Math") has been stellar.  The Math is in the forefront of providing humanitarian services to the most needy people in the society.  It is also one of the very few organizations in the world which provides multiple forms of humanitarian aid.  For instance, the Math has been engaged in (i) providing relief to disaster victims during the Asian Tsunami, the earthquakes in Gujarat and Kashmir, floods in Bihar, and during Hurricane Katrina in the U.S.; (ii) providing pension for widows and elderly; (iii) operating orphanages; (iv) operating schools, colleges and universities; (v) operating senior-care homes, (vi) providing environmental-friendly programs such as replanting trees; (vii) building houses for the poor and victims of natural disasters, and (viii) providing free vocational training for widows.  More than 99% of the work for the Math is performed by volunteers on a no-fee basis.  As a result, the Math has been able to keep its administrative expenses very low which, in turn, has enabled the Math use its savings to reach a wider group of people to render humanitarian aid. The Math is unassuming, very approachable, and truly a people's organization, which makes it a very unique humanitarian organization much worthy of the highest accolade.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18173	4	/users/profile/19255	mishranc	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	MA Math has numerous charitable activities. My personal experience with this organization is that it emphasizes the importance of having the volunteers prepare the food themselves and serve the needy directly. I am in charge of a local shelter where we feed 30 homeless destitute women evry month.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17653	3	/users/profile/19255	mishranc	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My family is drawn toward Amma becausew of her unconditional love and compassion for everybody in this world poor and rich alike.

We contribute regularly to her caritable activities to feel that we do something for less fortunate in this world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18172	4	/users/profile/19685	mrgrogan	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have never heard of an organization that does so much for so many. The MA Math has founded and run orphanages, schools, colleges, and hospitals. They have built thousands of houses in India and elsewhere to help victims of earthquakes and other catastrophes. They provide pensions and training to widows and the destitute. My own direct experience has been with a local chapter of Mother's Kitchen, an international effort of MA Math, to cook and serve food to the homeless. I have participated in the Kansas City chapter, serving meals to homeless men and women in conjunction with a local church.The other remarkable feature of MA Math is that 100% on contributions pay for materials. All of the organization's labor is provided by volunteers. So a donated dollar goes so much farther than with most nonprofits.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18161	4	/users/profile/19678	delroys	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Writing for Amma's Circle of Love seva, this has been an extraordinary Seva over the pass year unconditional love has expanded to Touch many new souls from all walks of life.It brings me face to face with the vastness of the human condition, our suffering or joys and hopes.Its a ways to experience and send the dynamic force of compassion in our lives and in the lives of the people that receive these letters of unconditional love. These letters carry unlimited love, flowing out of our hearts to bring inspiration and hope to those that are suffering. In this experience when I surrender the process the right words are found to reach the depth of the soul. The response from the recipients have been extraordinary, there is great joy in knowing that I have been of help.One lady I wrote was 98 years old, I did not expect to get a letter from her because of her age.But she wrote many months after receiving my letters ... Hi, just a note to thank you for your letters (Circle of love). I am 98 year old, eyes are bad and getting forgetful. This is a wonderful program, wanted to let you know I did appreciate your letters.My first letter was to a young teenager of 16 years, her father was very ill with cancer. I felt her family became are part of me. I even received a wonderful letter from her father that touch my heart, I know that he must have been in a lot of pain but took the time to write. In the we shared compassion and help the family through a difficult transition.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18148	4	/users/profile/19662	donscotti	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have seen some of the charitable work of Mata Amritanandamayi (Amma) on two trips to India. Her help for Tsumami victims is legendary. I've seen the houses she has built and the widows to whom she provides pensions. Most impressive are the number of children who come to her many schools who would not have a chance for further education. Seeing her expample in India, I have been motivated to see God and serve God in all here at home (USA). For over three years, our local group of Amma devotees have cooked and/or served meals for the homeless on a regular basis.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18146	1	/users/profile/19661	niramaya	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	There is no where on earth where I find that my donation to a charity is better placed. Amma's organization is top-rate and her charities excel at putting people's needs first. She donates not only to disaster relief in India but in the States as well. Her response is built on love and the people who helped in the wake of Hurricane Katrina responded out of humantarian need, spending their own money to travel, and sharing their unique services out of pure love. Amma's motto is Love and Serve, and her people represent these ideals. My experience has been in serving the needy at Amma's Kitchen - in the US these are her soup kitchens. My personal experience always made me feel good and I enjoyed the community feeling I always had afterward.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18145	5	/users/profile/19660	heygurl123	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma has given me the joy and love any person would want. She has inspired me a 10 yr. old to volunteer more often. In my opinion the experience I've had with her couldn't ever be  better. Mata Amritanandamayi deserves this prize because she is exactly like a mother she's compassionate,friendly,understanding,comforting,playful,kind, and a miracle maker.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18140	5	/users/profile/19656	baller789	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math is a wonderful organization which helps the poor and needy in whichever way it can. 100% of the donations go to charitable activities. Some of the programs that are in the Math are Green Friends, Circle of Love, and Mother's Kitchen. These programs, plant trees, write letters to the sick and lonely, and cook food for the poor and needy, respectively. There are also numerous orphanages and houses built as tsunami relief. In fact, the Math gave $22 million in tsunami relief and $1 million in Katrina relief. The Mata Amritanandamayi Math is a great organization which deserves many accolades for the work it has done.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18139	5	/users/profile/19655	radha	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have had the best experience participating in the work done by this organization. In 2007, this organization organized a charity event to fund Tsunami relief in Atlanta, GA. Amma has inspired several of us to actively participate in community support such as providing hot food to shelter, donating to local organization and providing value education to develop future citizens of the world. This organization provides extensive community support in the form of education to poor, homes to homeless, free medical care, emergency relief, homes to orphans, job training to poor and jobless etc. Though headquartered in India, this organization supports worldwide community. For example this group donated $1million in support of Katrina in USA. One additional factor is funds donated stretches more than 100% as volunteers regularly donate their time in support of the work. Besides it is very well run organization with centers world-wide.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18127	4	/users/profile/19643	nitya	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma compassion is so vast, she cares not only for the communities she helps but also for the minutia of each individuals life.  An example is that after the Tsunami she not only rebuilt villages but also retrained villages who formerly made a living by fishing and were now scared of the water.  As well as that many of the families that lost children were unable to have more children because they had had tubal ligation surgery, these woman had their reverse surgery paid for so they could start new families.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18118	5	/users/profile/19636	kittee	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math organization does amazing humanitarian work.  After the Tsumani a few years ago, my husband and I wanted to donate but were unsure of who to give to.  When we realized that the Tsunami had affected areas near the Mata Amritanandamayi Ashram in Kerala, we knew we wanted to donate to them, because of the amazing outreach they do in South India.  We already knew about the FREE hospital, schools and orphanages, so knew they would be very proactive about using the money to help the most victims as possible.

Watching her hug and console thousands and thousand of people from every corner of the world has brought tears of compassion to my own eyes.

Following mother's example, many volunteers donate their time and skill to help realize this. It's a wonderful experience where help is provided to those in need directly and we hope to continue this to serve others.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18106	5	/users/profile/19625	Gil_In_New_York	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I was introduced to the organization in 2000 and since have volunteered on an ongoing basis through the years. The best example I have seen of the kind of compassionate, detailed work done by MA Math was when I was working with the org. in South India delivering bags of food and clothing to a village that had been heavily damaged by the tsunami.  A local gentleman said something with passion to the crowd, and there was much reaction. When I asked a friend to translate, he said that they (his peers) don't want the government's promises.  They promise and promise and see very little if anything.  Meanwhile, MA Math promises food and clothing and they are there when they said they would be.  This is extremely important to people in real need.I have seen the organizations home-building projects for the homeless in action.  Tens of thousands of homes have been built.  And have witnessed thousands of women collecting pension checks for widows and displaced women.  I know of the org.'s orphanages and hospitals which treat the poor for free.  So many more activities to mention.  It is mind boggling to see all of the humanitarian activities this organization supplies on an ongoing basis.  And that is the reason I, and many of my closest friends, continue to volunteer for M.A. Math.  I feel honored to be able to serve directly through an organization that attracts so many to work hard and serve those who have so little. Thank you. Gil Polk.

However considering the children's condition this math under the guidance of Mat Amritanandamayi diverted funds from other important projects. I have personally seen video about chidren's condition after take over and also heard very positive about the conditions of Children from people visited the home.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18089	5	/users/profile/19609	susan.dobridge@gmail.com	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I am writing to endorse the work of Amritanadamayi Math as one familiar with the work of Amma, Mother Amritandamayi, for three years now. Amma's charitable organizations run extremely efficiently, because the donation contributions they receive go directly to support the causes at hand; none of the money gets lost in things like marketing or paying workers because it is completely done by volunteers. Housing development, over 1 million dollars donated to Hurrican Katrina relief, and Tsunami flood relief are only a few of the projects to be named as remarkably successful.

With Her help & the help of the MA MATH, She helps us to become between human beings by servings the poors & those in need. You can look by yourself everything the MA MATH did for the world, including the USA for the hurricane Katrina. Many efforts are put together to build a strong society between the races & castes by Mata Amritanandamayi & Her organisation. People need to take a look at the work that have been done already & follow the example. We have a lot to learn from Her.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18084	5	/users/profile/19603	CompassionRules	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The best non-profit I have ever known in the last 20+ years serving people across the globe. A lot of the charitable work is focused on India, but they reach out to several other nations (including the developed nations such as US). This is the most secular organization - cross barriers of nationality and religion. The reason why they are able to do this is that the head of this organization serves by example, and is the ideal role model for the volunteers. Seeing the leader (lovingly addressed as AMMA or Mother) sacrificing so selflessly inspires the volunteers to do likewise. Most of the charitable work without the volunteers taking any remuneration.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18082	5	/users/profile/19669	ammasvaishu	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have always felt selfless service as the way to go from my childhood. When i was young in India i cleaned the public water tap area with my friend and got good scolding from my mom. When 11 years ago i came across M.A. Math i was overjoyed because AMMA the saint who heads the organization is all about SELFLESS SERVICE. The amount of volunteer work the Math does is overwhelming. When AMMA visits U.S., I am privileged to be part of her volunteer team. All the money raised by the Math is spent on poor people. There is no administrative cost absolutely. Every volunteer is smiling and serving always which is very heartening to see. When farmers were committing suicide in India, M.A. math helped their families in a constructive way. All the farmers' children are given money to continue their education. If not for this help they would be forced to do some menial job and help their families. When Tsunami destructed a lot of coastal area in south India, M.A.math helped them by immediately building temporary shelters and providing them food and medical help. The permanent houses were built in record time. M.A.math is one of the very few organizations that finished all the houses that were promised. I am so happy to be part of this organization and do what little i can.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18075	5	/users/profile/19594	girish	Donor	5	10/21/2009	When the majority of India's people earn less than Rs. 80 ($1.66) a day, and the price of a kilo of rice ranges between Rs. 20 and Rs. 80, it is no wonder that nearly 50 percent of India's population suffer from malnourishment. The fight against hunger is far from over. Today, we produce more food than ever, yet more than one in 10 people on earth suffers from hunger.But this war can be won - the United Nations Development Program puts the annual cost of ending hunger at just an additional $13 billion more than what is already being spent by governments and organizations around the world. At present, Embracing the World feeds more than two million people annually throughout India. ETW also distributes uncooked rice, milk and other staples to deeply impoverished communities. In the first six months after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, ETW provided more than six million free meals to disaster victims, as well as more than 185 tons of uncooked rice to help the victims make ends meet.In the United States, one in eight Americans (more than 35 million) don't have dependable, consistent access to food due to limited money and resources, and nearly 60 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 75 fall below the poverty line for at least one year.  Embracing the World is committed to making a difference wherever and whenever possible. At present, ETW volunteers in 40 cities throughout North America prepare and serve 73,000 meals a year for the homeless and hungry.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18073	5	/users/profile/19593	hjaswal	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	The work done by the M.A Math has been a major source of inspiration for me, both professionally and personally. Amma selfless commitment to ease the pain and suffering of the poor is a great example of how one person can change the world. AIMS hospital has provided free medical treatment to those who can't afford it and has given many people a second chance at life. Tremendous disaster relief efforts all around the world, from hurricane katrina to the tsunami have been focused on the relief, recovery and reconstruction of many affected villages. New projects initiated by the MATH focus on increasing the resiliency of many indian communities in the face of disasters. I feel the MATH should be honored for the work it has done and is doing all around the world.

What is being done is once a month, MAM volunteers prepare food for close to 100 men who reside at East valley Men's Center, Mesa, Arizona, U.S. and serve on last Sunday of the month.  The food is highly appreciated as it is freshly prepared and served hot.  This charitable activity provides hope and support to these people who are trying to build there lives back.  The comments from people who get served are very positive as there is element of love, compassion and service in the overall charitable activity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18069	5	/users/profile/19589	Shankar Tucker	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	Amma's organization is the best in the world, hands down. On so many levels! first of all, volunteers feel so personally satisfied and rewarded from helping out around Amma that they return again and again to volunteer their services. They don't even think about contributing to the cause, they simply do it for the personal satisfaction and joy that comes from being with Amma, and believe me, there is plenty. Many people will simply work to raise enough money to travel and work with Amma on one of her tours, then immediately quit and run off to see her. That is how powerful the personal experience of volunteering for her is. More importantly, Amma's charity organizations are the most efficient of any that I know. All the services are completely run by volunteers, so 100 percent of donated money goes to those in need. Amma personally attends to every detail in the running of all her programs in order to streamline them for maximum response and efficiency. Not only that, but by touring and receiving donations in Europe and America, then transferring the money to India where materials are bought, and services rendered, by takes extraordinary advantage of the currency exchange. She can build an earthquake and tsunami-proof house in India for only 750 dollars or something ridiculous. I cannot imagine a humanitarian organization run with the same efficiency, dedication, and joy as Amma's MA Math.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18068	4	/users/profile/19588	bhavani	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have seen many people with physical, emotional, financial and mental challenges come to see Amma when she is on tour.  She always comforts them and in many cases provides practical support.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18058	4	/users/profile/19578	vdvisa	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	If there is something in this world that equals the joy of seeing a new born baby after a strenous delivery I would say it is the joy of seeing a contempt person after a nutritious meal which fills one's heart and stomach. The food that we deliver does not contain meat but it does include all the healthy constituents topped with the ingredients of love and joy and prayers.There are two kinds of sevas that we the volunteers of Mata Amritanadamayi Math do in the South San Francisco bay area. One is to prepare lunch bags each containing a sandwich, fruit,juice and chips and deliver them for the homeless. Presently we are doing this every week. The other seva is preparing one hot meal for the family shelter in the vicinity and serve the food to people in the shelter. At present we are doing it 6 times a year, and are planning to expand it to 12 times a year in coming years as the number of volunteers grow. I am grateful to God for enabling me to participate in both the sevas for several years now. I also pray that God gives us the strength to keep doing these little things all the time and help more people that are in need.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18050	4	/users/profile/19570	happygirl	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experience has been to watch the transformation of a horrible run down orphaniage facility become a shining star in facilities for children's education both academic and artistic. My position has been to create jewelry from raw materials to sell and use the proceeds to improve the orphanage(s) of MA Math. Since M.A. Math took over the run down orphanage, every thing has become clean, managed well, and the children receive both academic and arts education. They have nourishing food and good buildings, and they frequently win competitions in academic and artistic fields. I have been thrilled to work to raise funds for this organization and hear of the amazing results in the children who are now alive and stimulated by their studies. Eyewitness accounts by friends who visit the orphanage frequently have shared seeing this. Where there was no hope for these neglected children from tribal villages, they now have career goals and are accomplished dancers and musicians. This is a direct result of the Math's attention to detail and judicious use of funds raised.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18044	4	/users/profile/19565	sunny	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Being and working with the people from this organization is inspiring because of the nature of people and their attitudes. Their selfless actions and service oriented attitude comes from thinking of helping others rather serving self. All the inspiration for this Math comes from Amma herself who shows constantly the right path of being involved in countless charities and being available wherever help is needed. That is why, this Math is able to provide help to uplift students, farmers, householders, sick, elderly, widows, temporarily disabled etc. There is compassion, unity and enthusiasm in being with Amma and together helping salvation army in US, cook for homeless shelters, raise funds for tsunami/hurricane/disaster victims, feed the elderly, wash/repair cars for charity or help each person we come across as needed. This is being done world wide.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18042	4	/users/profile/19577	skrish5201	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My wife and I have been involved with Mata Amritanandamayi and her Math since 2000.  We have found Mata Amritananda Mayi to be an inspirational leader, both spiritually and as the active CEO of her Math.  The MA Math is involved in a wide variety of charitable and humanitarian activities - food for the poor and homeless,  orphanages, work training and support for widows, free medical care for the indigent, emergency relief for disaster stricken areas. Help is provided regardless of caste, creed or national origin.  MA Math has impressed us not only with their exemplary charitable activities, but by the fact that so much of it is done with volunteer sevaites. We have on several occasions observed volunteers supporting MA Math's charitable efforts, such as building of cottage homes for tsunami victims, and serving food for the needy at homeless shelters in the Washington DC area.  MA Math does indeed provide maximum bang for the proverbial charity dollar.  With our humble pranams to AMMA (Mata)SUbramaniam and Bhanu Krishnan,

She works tirelessly and selflessly to help better the world for others...from eduction to shelter to clean water and  nutritious food. Her charities are aimed not just at providing these things but teaching and giving people the tools to be able to sustain and better their circumstances. She and her several various charities continue to inspire my eleven year old son and I to help make the world a better place. I am continually astounded and amazed at all the projects they have going on and how they just seem so adept at stepping in with ingenious solutions to society's challenges.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18013	4	/users/profile/19536	MAMathVol1	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have had the privilege of volunteering with the Mata Amritanandamayi Math (M.A. Math) on various humanitarian projects since 2001.. The Mathprovides humanitarian aide to thousands of individuals in India and other countries in a broad range of areas of need throughout society:Disaster relief (more than $23 million in relief funds for victims of the 2004 tsunami); construction of homes for the homeless and slum dwellers (30,000 built toward a goal of 100,000); Indian farmer suicideprevention, Indian slum improvement (apartments built for 1,600 slum dwellers); free food (meals for more than 2 million people each year inIndia alone); free legal advice (a network of 1,000 lawyers providing assistance on human rights and environmental issues); orphanages for 500 children in India; pensions for 100,000 destitute women in India as well as physically and mentally challenged individuals in India; care home for the aged in South India; and other projects. Locally in California members of the Math receive donations of medical supplies and equipment from local hospitals such as Alta Bates and Kaiser then we sort the equipment and ship to India.  We run soup kitchens to feed the homeless in Berkeley and San Francisco and conduct annual food drives for the holidays distributing food to needy families.  We have also planted over 500 trees to reforest overgrazed hillsides at our center in San RamonThe founder of the M.A. Math, Mata Amritanandamayi, or Amma as she is known, received the Gandhi-King Award for Non-Violence in October 2002 at the UnitedNations in Geneva.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	18004	4	/users/profile/19526	Sonali	Donor	5	10/20/2009	To me spirituality is helping others. Especially in a country like India where there is so much poverty, very least help is available. More money is spend on building temples with gold tops,marble flooring etc. Amma on the other hand helps converting slums into houses, pensions,vocational help for women. Most importantly it is so easy to help. For $2000 you can help build a house for someone.

Disaster relief, the project to end farmer suicide, housing for the poor, educational and vocational programs, stipends for the physically and mentally handicapped,the AIMs hospital, hospices, all such projects are the compassion in action which is a reflection of Amma's unconditional love and grace showered upon her followers.

She has taught me that we can be of service, No matter what our conditions are in life and that being of service can be from connecting with someones eyes and smiling too spending countless hours and dollars through any organization. I believe that Amma's Humanitarian Services all over the world are not only vital but at a core level are teaching and showing how the only way to elevate our world to Peace for all is through being in service to ALL.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17915	5	/users/profile/19444	Beverly Harlan	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2009	I was one of the extremely fortunate and blessed people who met Amma at the San Francisco Airport when she first set foot on American soil in May 1987. Since then I have seen her most of the times that she comes to the USA, which is twice a year.  I have felt her unbounded and unconditional love for me and have been transformed into a better person as a result.  Her presence is electrifying and radiant; her energy is endless; and her mission to transform all of humanity through unconditional love is her only goal and purpose.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17906	5	/users/profile/19818	ammapv	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been involved with Amma's organization for the past three years. It has been a life changing experience. I have watched Amma selflessly hug thousands of people and make each one of them feel special expecting nothing in return, Her overwhelming love and desire to make people happy and her imperishiable energy and ehthusiasm to help mankind is very contagiuos. Watching Amma itself can make people change for the better and make one think of how they can help spread Amma's message of love and genorosity. Since then I have myself been involved in several volunteer activities focused on helping the less fortunate.

I was then taking training for tax preparer. I had to work for them for some time, for which I was paid $ 500/-. I decided to donate that to M A Math for the Tsunami Relief Housing Project, which helped build 2 houses,where one house was build with only $ 200/ (because all the workers are voluntary).M A Math needed more funds for Tsunami relief projects to help the neighboring countries too, our NJ satsang organised a Fund raiser-Orrisa Dance and it generated $ 12,000/- of which I contributed my services.  I got some garments from my wholesaler uncle and sold the item by doubling the cost and raised $ 585/-

The organizations philanthropic projects are part of a unique global effort to serve society at every level, to every person and family regardless of religion, caste, creed, socio-economic status, age gender or the like. Among these astonishing efforts are: vocational training for Indias tribal villages especailly women, prostitute rehabilitation, building 100,000 homes and communities across the Indian subcontinent that includ clean running drinking water, community buildings, playgrounds and religious places of worship that include all of the local peoples traditions. free meals for the poor, pensions for the elderly, orphanages, eye camps. Disaster relief, medical camps, Her statte of the art Specialized hospital is one of Asia's premier hospitals that treat hundreds of people free of charge every year. "green friends", the Math's initiative to restore natures harmony plants several hundreds of trees all over the world, including a forest of fruit tress planted at the site of the sanramon ashram in Ca. Grade schools, colleges and universities built by the Math offer children of developing areas to attend school free of chage. Their notebooks, uniforms and other essentials are also entirelty paid for by the Math. Included in the curriculum of all the schools is a value based curriculum that stresses the importance of selfless service to society. Most noteworthy however is Amma's deep dedication to serving humanity through her endless mission of hugging and consoling everyone who comes to her all over the globe. Embodying the ideals of universal motherhood, Amma treats each person who comes to her as if it were her own child.  the M.A math is an organization whose remarkable exapmle of selflessness and service to all, without condition or expectation is a beacon of light and hope in a changing and sometimes fearful world.

Every dollar you donate gets multiplied instead of getting depreciated! No wonder, they are recognized by UN as an outstanding non-profit.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17883	5	/users/profile/19415	Nightowl9	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My personal experience has been in the United States, not in India.  I am part of what is known as Mother's Kitchen.  Every Saturday a small group of us goes to a local church and prepares sack lunches for the homeless in the neighborhood.  We give out a little lunch and a little conversation, and try to connect them with other resources when we can.  Amma's teaching is that service is the very meaning of life, and being part of this project has definitely broadened my focus from my own personal problems to much larger issues of social justice.

MA Math Foundation is an ongoing effort for Amma to make a difference in this world.  Ammas program works towards providing scholarships to poor farmers' children and ongoing support to continue their education.  This organization contributed a great deal during the tsunami.  Amma (M.A. Center) donated $1 million to the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund. Humanitarian activities expanded into all areas including social, medical, educational, and environmental.  We are privileged to have Amma on our side when we need emotional and spiritual support.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17874	5	/users/profile/19411	vsgw	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have had the privilege of volunteering with the Mata Amritanandamayi Math (M.A. Math) on various humanitarian projects since 1996. The Math provides humanitarian aide to thousands of individuals in India and other countries in a broad range of areas of need throughout society: Disaster relief (more than $23 million in relief funds for victims of the 2004 tsunami); construction of homes for the homeless and slum dwellers (30,000 built toward a goal of 100,000); Indian farmer suicide prevention, Indian slum improvement (apartments built for 1,600 slum dwellers); free food (meals for more than 2 million people each year in India alone); free legal advice (a network of 1,000 lawyers providing assistance on human rights and environmental issues); orphanages for 500 children in India; pensions for 100,000 destitute women in India as well as physically and mentally challenged individuals in India; care home for the aged in South India; and other projects. The founder of the M.A. Math, Mata Amritanandamayi, or Amma as she is known, received the Gandhi-King Award for Non-Violence in October 2002 at the United Nations in Geneva. The award was given to Amma for her three decades of service to humanity and was presented by Dr. Jane Goodall, the previous year's recipient of the award.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17870	5	/users/profile/19408	ammasmakkal	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experiance will Amma's charitable activities started as a child growing up in Kerala, India. At that time, the ashram was small, but never lacked opportunities for seva or selfless-service. Amma always gave much importance to serving everyone including mother nature. As a young adult, my selfless services started with helping in the kitchen at the ashram, were free food was given to the needy and everyone who visited the ashram. When I grew up and came to the United States of America there were still ample opportunities available through the local Amma satsang (satsang literally means company of good). Ten years back, during on of Amma's programs I came across 'Amrita Kuteeram' project. It was a project Amma inspired to build homes for destitues in India. What caught my eye was the fact that with just Rs.20,000 (i.e. about $500) a family could have a house to live in. That was my first donation for a charitable cause, after I started working. The volunteers in India working on this project, turn these small amounts we donate to a fine home for a homeless family. These houses had a bedroom, kitchen, family room and a prayer alter.Now, beyond constructing houses, ashram tries to build communities - paving roads, providing electricity, drilling bore wells and installing water tanks. For each development, ashram builds a community hall where residents can come together and celebrate cultural festivals. ashram also supports the community by providing tutoring for both adults and children, and helping the adults to find new work opportunities through our economic development programs.Such project have been successfully completed as a part of disaster relief effort by Amma's ashram in areas that were ravaged by natural calamities like the earthquakes, Tsunami etc.Here in US I participate in 'Mother's Kitchen'. These are soup kitchens started all around US that prepare and serve food for the homeless. I'm very thankful to have these opportunities available to give back to the community, that are all initiated by Mata Amritanandamayi Math. Now, I take my son with me to participate in the charitable opportunities MA Math provides. He understands that it is important give back to the society. He is thankful to MA Math for the providing these opportunities. Amma's has inspired us by showing us selfless service, and that makes us feel good.There are numerous other activities MA Math has intiated, here we've only mentioned a small part that we are involved in. MA Math charitable activites are available to a wide range of people. Monetary contributions are only a small part of these activities. Success of MA MAth's charitable activities lies in the volunteers who render their valuable skills and services. We don't have to be disappointed that we cannot make monetary contribution to MA MAth charity, if we are not financially sound, since there are always opportunities were we can render our service, from chopping vegitables to painting amritakuteerams, transporting / filling sand bags, and the list goes on.....
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17867	5	/users/profile/19404	Chad Kymal	Donor	5	10/20/2009	I have been personally involved with the MA Math in two ways.1) We raised $250,000 for the Tsunami from Michigan and I toured S. India and personally saw the work that was being done. I actually took slides and interviewed people and have videos. I came back and showed it to the people who donated the monies.2) I have helped the AIMS hosptial a heavily subsidized hospital in Cochin, India achieve an ISO 9001 quality certificate. I personally saw the work being done there to help and subsidize the poorer sections of the population.I am very impressed with the large amount of volunteer staff they have actually doing the work both in the Tsunami area and also in the hospital.There are a large number of Americans involved including the Medical Director Mr. Ron Gottsegen.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17863	5	/users/profile/19401	paraji	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have to say that there is something very special about volunteering to help with Amma's charitable work.  Amma is a very busy woman, and her level of dedication to service can be overwhelming at first.  How on earth does she give like that?!  Feelings of fear around our still present limitations can sometimes be a painful barrier to participating with the miracle of service and love happening everywhere around Amma.  But Amma welcomes everyone, and working with other "limited" people near her has always been a miracle in discovering how much more service I am capable of than I imagined.  And just in this way, Amma is inspiring millions of people to work together for this world!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17859	5	/users/profile/19397	Jacinthe et  Juan	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Since my husband and I have met Mata Amritanandamyi Devi, Amma, our life took a different turn and we realized the importance of getting more involved in helping people in needs around us. I often got paralyzed by the amount of suffering around me; how much can one person do to help when one has already so much responsabilities as the mother of a family of 3 children, also working as a nurse?Amma's teaching make me undo that knot of thinking, as I know that each drop of water is needed to make a river. I now do what I can although small. My husband who has retired now cooks/serves meals for homeless people 4 to 5 times a year for an organisation in Montreal. We both have contributed to fundraising to help in various ways, as we did on a regular basis for victims of Tsunami, for the Katrina relief, for many organisations in the community. We did also

Believe that it is your dharma, your God-given duty to love and serve the poor."  Ammas charitable projects in India feed millions of people each year. Mothers Kitchen Projects throughout the United Sates allow devotees the opportunity to bring Ammas mission to their communities.     Since 2006 the Portland Mother's Kitchen Team has gleaned, cooked, served, packaged and bussed over 7200 meals to Oregonians experiencing poverty and homelessness.  The project has been a beautiful outpouring of love, service and commitment to nourish the hungry.  The Mothers Kitchen Team served hot, nutritious, organic meals on the last Sunday of the month to the residents of Dignity Village, a camp on the outskirts of town.  The campers relied on the Amma People to bring dinner when their food stamps had run out. The Team also donated warm clothing, propane tanks and building materials.  Team members also volunteer at Sisters Of The Road Caf, Loaves & Fishes - Meals On Wheels, Potluck In The Park, and St. Francis Dinning Hall.  In 2008, the Team began serving dinner at Blanchet House of Hospitality, a recovery program and feeding center in Portlands Old Town neighborhood.  The 10 member Team serves and busses approximately 300 meals in 1 hour.  We work in a safe, clean and sober environment so families and teenagers are encouraged to attend.  The Portland Mothers Kitchen Project is open to everyone. It is a wonderfully humbling experience to see intro the eyes of the homeless, hear their stories and offer a plate of good food.  With Ammas Grace, we continue to pray and serve those in need.With Great Respect,

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17815	5	/users/profile/19374	Harsha_Makhijani	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Since my childhood, I had always wondered what it would be like to actually see God. This desire kept surfacing more and more as I grew up. Then One Blessed day, the Grace of the Divine made this desire come true.In 1993, a Lady clad in a white Sari appeared to me in a dream. I had never seen, heard or even read of Her anywhere. I did not know who She was until a year later when I accompanied some family friends to a bhajan which was being held at a person's house. Over there, for the first time I saw the picture of Amma, who was the same Lady I had seen in my dream. I could not believe that Someone whom I had never seen, heard or even read of would appear in a dream and then in a picture later.I got some information about Her and read Her biography. I was instantly drawn to Her without even have met Her. I finally met Her in February, 1995 at Bombay for the first time and my whole life changed completely after Her Embrace.She has not only been guiding me in my daily life but also millions of people all over the world.  I know She is God on earth and we all are blessed to be with Her, see Her and receive Her Darshan.One remarkable experience I had with Ammaji, was in December 2004 when I was at Her ashram, Amritapuri in Kerala, India. I was there with my family and Ammaji was giving Darshan at that time when the deadly Tsunami struck at 12:45 pm. The entire Ashram was flooded with knee-deep water. Ammaji got up and immediately took full control of the situation without even the slightest trace of panic or tension.All the devotees and Ashram residents were immediately told to leave the Ashram via the backwaters bordering the Ashram to the land on another side where the Ashram's computer institute and Engineering College are located. By Ammaji's Grace there was not a single casualty within the Ashram even though the wave had come with full force, also damaging some property of the Ashram.The confidence and magnitude with which Ammaji handled the situation was incredible and no ordinary person could ever have done so.At such a critical time, She not only sent the people to the other side but also had lunch, which was already cooked in the ashram sent to the Engineering College to calm the people down. In a situation where we had all left with all that we had at that time, lunch was yet made available at the engineering college within an hour of the tragedy.Many people staying near the Ashram who were seriously injured or who had lost their houses, near and dear ones were immediately brought to the Engineering College and given medical aid. A medical van with doctors from the hospital at Amritapuri and even AIMS, the specialty hospital at Coimbatore, located some miles away from the Ashram came fully equipped to treat the patients. There were so many villagers in a state of shock and pain who were taken into care by the renunciates, Ashram residents and Doctors of the M.A. Math. At night, Ammaji even arranged to give clothes to them as they had lost everything. She personally came, listened to their grief and woes assuring them of complete help.It was amazing to see how Ammaji saw to each and every detail of those who were struck by such a dire calamity. I don't think any other person or organization could have acted so promptly in the spur of a moment providing immediate care and aid in less than 3 - 4 hours after the Tsunami took place. Only an Avatar, a Divine incarnation could perform such an awe-inspiring task.Ammaji also arranged temporary shelters for villagers who had no place to go and provided them 3 meals a day for six months, free of cost. Needless to say that Ammaji also pledged a 100 crore rupees for the construction of free houses to villagers who had lost their homes. Ammaji also arranged for them to become independent and earn their livelihood. Many women were taught tailoring and were also given sewing-machines. Orphaned children were given counseling by psychiatrists and counselors as they had been through tremendous shock at such a young age. Many were also provided jobs and absorbed in the Ashram institutions for supporting themselves.This is one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, where we thought we had seen the end of our lives come so close to us and then felt how miraculously Ammaji could bring us all out of disastrous danger. I have finally come to see God in human form in this birth and this incident has verily made me experience Gods bountiful compassion as well as the expansive, unfathomable power of Love.

Among other things we do a monthly "burrito project" where we hand out a great lunch; treats included; to homeless people,as well as other supplies like socks, underwear or rain gear that might be useful. All supplies are privately donated.  The response we have from the homeless is amazing. They thank us, bless us and sometimes tell us their stories. We are inspired by Amma and her international relief efforts, as well as her personal compassion towards us and towards all beings on the planet. It has been such a positive experience for us that I wonder who involved receives the greatest benefit!

The money given for charities have been used for building hospitals, providing health care to millions, providing free food, clothing and homes for the needy, care homes for the elderly, jobs for widows to mention a few. MA center has also donated millions to Katrina relief fund, Asian Tsunami relief in 2004 and other disaster reliefs such as Bihar relief fund in 2008 and Mumbai floods in 2005. They provide education scholarships for kids from low income families. MA Center's humanitarian services are expanding and giving solace to more and more people everyday all over the world. I believe that service to poor is service to God and will continue to contribute regularly to MA center.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17768	3	/users/profile/19330	rk	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been affiliated with this organization for over 16 years. I have never come across an organization ever, that is built so strongly on the principles of love and compassion. There are two kinds of volunteers affiliated with this non profit. One set of people have given up a life of comfort and luxury to live a very simple life, in order to be able to provide a moments  solace for the poor and suffering. They live 24 x 7 with the sole aim of providing such support. The other group of people are people like you and me, who hold full-time jobs in reputed organizations, but still spend a good chunk of time working towards the same goal. Our inspiration is none other than the founder of this organization, Her Holiness Sri Sri Mata Amritanandamyi Devi herself, loving known as Amma, who works tireless Herself for the upliftment of mankind. I have seen this organization grow from a simple spiritual organization to this massive charitable organization as it stands today. Welfare of mankind has been the prime motive behind every institution this organization has ever spawned be it an educational institution, reforestation program, pension schemes, hospices,super speciality hospital, anything for that matter. I fall short of words to clearly communicate what this organization stands for, but you can see for yourself at http://embracingtheworld.org/.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17745	3	/users/profile/19318	Ammashyamala	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experience actually involves a fellow volunteer who I will call Ben.We have volunteered together, worked hard together and have shared our spiritual meetings together, (satsang). Ben has always given of himself completely and walks away from every project with a smile.Last Sunday Ben donated some money to our Mother's Kitchen project and we then began our satsang. As part of the satsang we took turns reading from a spiritual book. Ben reported that during this reading he's somehow began to understand more completely the legacy we are involved in when we volunteer.He told me that he realized it has always been those who volunteer to help others who have bettered the world. He said that he now understood more clearly that this legacy has been handed down to him. It seemed to be a powerful thing for him to realize his place in the world. I chose to relate this experience because it illustrates how volunteering elevates the volunteer. Through Amma's Projects we have helped many people. We get the pleasure of being able to see how valuable it is to people when we share a little bit of love. But, we also get the pleasure of seeing how sharing that love benefits each of us as well.

I was working as a lawyer then and really wanted to give back to society. By doing a little voluntary with the organization it helped me realize what I and others could do.  The organization is looking after poor, homeless, educating, providing homes, medical care and more.  In my experience this has to be one of the best non- profits in the World.

Receiving darshan from her is an experience everyone should allow him/herself to have. There are no word to describe, only to say that each time on recieves a blessing from Amma it is like marking a before and after point in his/her life. Amma's amazing grace, warmth, kindness reaffirms all that is good in the humanity and in the world. She greets each person as if he/she were the only person in the world and she is the most happy to see you. This after hours and hours of seeing people.

The Math has reached out to so many through charitable projects. From the Tsunami of 2004 to the hurricanes in the United States, to the earthquakes and other natural disasters in Asia as well as many other ongoing projects such as widows pensions and farmer suicide relief where scholarships are given to the children so they can have an education to homes for the elderly and providing equipment and training to women so they can work and make a living for themselves as well as numerous other projects the Mata Amritanandamyi Math has shown itself to be exemplary in providing charity and relief to those in need. On top of that, ALL of the people who support the charity work for the Math do it as volunteers.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17612	3	/users/profile/19238	rohdejudith8@aol.com	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Inspired by Amma for the past 18 years, I have helped in several sheltesr for the homeless and have fundraised for tsunami survivors. I currently donate to Amma's orphanages in India on a regular basis because I am certain that this organization if free from waste and fraud. I keep in touch with various members in India via phone, email and in person and am continually impressed with the amount of time and expertise they are willing to donate to help sustain Amma's various charitable activities in such a conscientious manner. Each dollar donated to the MA Math increases many times over by the extensive number of hours of volunteer involvement. As a retired social worker in the child welfare arena, I am especially concerned about the humane, nurturing treatment of children everywhere. I have conducted extensive conversations with volunteers from Amma's orphanages in Inda to insure myself that the environment and staff are kind, caring and educated.While I have not visited India, I remain confident thatthese children receive far more than the basic necessities; their emotional and spiritual needs are considered in all aspects of their daily lives. From the videos and photographs I have seen, they are healthy, clean, thriving and happy children! MA Math Orphanages remain my charity fo choice.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17609	3	/users/profile/19232	Leokomor	Volunteer	1	10/20/2009	I have been an active volunteer for MA Math for eight years.  Every penny goes to suffering people.  I do not know of any other organization that practices this.Hospitals, Orphans, Farmers Relief, Disaster Relief are MA Math concerns.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17602	3	/users/profile/19225	EsseneLight	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I went to Ammachi as a single mother with very little hope over a decade ago. Amma took my children in her arms and showed me that caring for them was the greatest service God could ever give a woman. My life completely changed after that. Instead of feeling like a victim I realized that I was actually blessed. Joy increased inside of me and my children responded favorably to that. They still love going to see Amma and eagerly await her visit to the USA every year. Five years ago I met my current husband who is a very spiritual man and the light of my life. We were engaged to Amma for nine months and then in 2006 she married us. I encourage all people to see Amma, but especially women. She reminds us that we have an important role to play as caretakers and nurturers of each other and this dear earth. Especially during times of crisis and change is is important to come together and support one another.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17598	3	/users/profile/19223	britelite	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	i've had a consistently great experience with this org since my exposure to it in 1999. I'm serving as a treasurer for the past 5 years.I've met many other volunteers and also beneficiaries--whether its a tsunami survivor whose life was rebuilt, or an earthquake survivor whose home was rebuilt and who was a volunteer in the tsunami rebuilding efforts, or a heart surgery survivor who otherwise would not be alive because he's poor, or a kidney transplant patient who's so poor that he's given pension or a widow who is on pension. It is simply endless what this org has and is achieving.

In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami, She has built anescape bidge in the backwaters of Kerlia, India so, that in the event of another such a disaster, thousands could escape the fate of that disaster.  The projects that Amma has created and supported are literally endless. She through Her work has become one of the worlds most philanthropic and humanitarian person of all time.Her support extends to health care institutions run by Embracing the World and have provided more than U.S. $50 million worth of free medical care to those in need and more than 1.2 million patients received completely free treatment.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17586	3	/users/profile/19211	visaladevi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma has changed my life and the lives of my children.  Her work all over the world and her tireless efforts to raise awareness and help those who are suffering are a source of constant inspiration.  Amma welcomes any and every one.  She comes to aid in virtually every natural disaster and is loving and compassionate to also help out individuals who seek her help, even amidst seeing and hugging thousands and thousands of people regularly.  She offers us a way to bring more meaning to life and to remember the importance of service to humanity and the world.  To keep love, compassion and humility in our hearts always.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17585	3	/users/profile/19210	Tamar Schwartz	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math does so much good service, I am sure that I do not know all or even most of it.  I do know that Amma has built hospitals, built housing, and provided food for millions of people.  I certainly think that her work deserves generous support. Mata Amritanandamayi Math does so much good for India and the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17578	3	/users/profile/19204	devidasan	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma's numerous charities are all based on one presiding aspect to serve with love and awareness.Being a volunteer for Amma's charities for a few years now, I have seen that ideal infused into day to day activites of charitable work namely being eco friendly, volunteering with compassion.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17565	3	/users/profile/19195	Amma108	Former Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I coordinated a soup-kitchen for the homeless and the poor people, where we feed about 200 people every other week with a healthy dinner, we gave clothing, personal items, and food to take. Amma's organization is the best one to be involved with, because every effort and every cent goes to the poor. Her example and unconditional love is such an inspiration to me to help the people in need. Not only we help the poor but it gave me the chance to serve others.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17554	3	/users/profile/19182	MPWarner	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	One cannot comprehend the scope of Amma's charities, even by witnessing them first hand as I have.  They are headed by a being that works literally around the clock, never taking a thing for Herself, surrounded by a sea of devotees who work without stop to alleviate suffering in the world.  Whatever is given or done in support of Her work, can be offered with complete confidence that it is being given to those in need with nothing taken to benefit anyone in between.  My life has been changed by Her forever.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17550	3	/users/profile/19185	sunitha	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma....Amma is a divine love coming from the supreme being(God).I felt this divine mother's love when i went to meet har first time in ashram. I did meditation lots of times in ashram and felt the state of peace and good vibrations in the presence of amma.She hugged me and blessed me many times. I felt very happy with the volunteer's good way of behaviour with others and there helping nature.In my words amma is a great divine soul who came on earth to awake,help and give blessings to the world with her simple smile and pure love :)
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17546	3	/users/profile/19176	Tai Uhlmann	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I worked with Amma's housing project in Tamil Nadu after the Tsunami and witnessed 1st hand the positive impact it had on the local families and community.  The thought and care that went into the construction and design of the houses took into consideration what people had been through and made sure everyone had roof access in case it were to happen again.  The houses were built close to the water so the families who's livelihood was fishing could continue to provide for their family.In addition to providing housing there were many other services such as swimming lessons and art projects so families could move through the pain and suffering.  I have also been volunteering at Amma's Kitchen in Manhattan where i live.  Delicious and nutritious food is provided for those in need as well as entertainment, conversation, a place for people to gather, clothes donation, and food to go.  The volunteers take care on every level to be as low impact as possible on the environment by recycling, composting, and reusing containers.

With little overhead and deep compassion, these projects are incredibly inspiring. Includes the tremendous feeding rebuilding effort after the Tsunami and the Earthquake in GujaratEric Nelson
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17534	3	/users/profile/19165	JonCrews	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have never seen one person more involved in charitable activites as Amma is.  Her charitiable foundation, MA Math, funds and orchestrates many schools, hospitals and clinics, orphanages, and pension funds for widows.  It is immediately on-site with mobile hospitals, food, etc., for major catastrophies, such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes.  After the Tsunami hit India and Sri Lanka, Amma and the MA Math fed thousands of people for several months, retrained them for other professions and built many thousands of homes for the victims of that terrible tragedy.   There is no one who is so dedicated to the poor and the unfortunate.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17503	3	/users/profile/19140	many thanks	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma, Sri Mata Amritananda Mayi Devi, is by far the most inspiring humanitarian this world has ever seen.  From her uncanny ability to deliver the right support in the fastest and mosr direct manner in chaotic and disasterous situations , to the individual and loving care she gives to individual children when awarding scholarships, clothing, and homes!  One just has to see some small footage of her helping the children learn to swim after the Tsunami to know in their hearts that Amma knows the unique and best way to help in any given situation.  Her dream is that just for one day, there will be no hunger, violence, or fear in the hearts of any human being! Jai Ma!

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17489	3	/users/profile/18565	Gita Biswas	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandmayi Math is doing humanitarain work specially in the field of health, education , disaster management, medical care, providing homes to homeless and most disadvantaged people and so many other charitable work for the poorest of the poor and orphan. It is not possible to describe the selfless services provided by the Brahmacharis and Sanyasis for weaker section of the society. I have excellent   experiences with AIMS, as we went there last month for treatment of my husband. We were overwhelmed by the services of each and every staff member of AIMS . There is need of so many AIMS for our country where people can  get quality serves by the selfess service providers. Mata Amritananadmayi Math is doing excellent services for the mankind .
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17462	3	/users/profile/19111	johead	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been searching for an organization to give my money and time too, and on my spiritual journey I encountered AMMA.  After spending time in her presence, I researched and became a supporter of her non-profit humanitarian work.  Just one aspect of her many ways she supports those in need is her disaster relief.  She will come to the stricken area with money, helpers and her blessings and emotional support of the many that are effected.  All over the world - without reguard for what the areas political stand or religious inclination, she is just here to serve.  Her are just some of the places she has shown up:2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami,Cyclone - West Bengal, Bihar Floods, Hurricane Katrina, Kashmir Earthquake, Mumbai Floods, Gujarat. A true devoted servant of all people, she parlays her dollars into supplies for those in need and inspires the actions of thousands of volunteers. Just one of the many aspects of the avenues her organization pursues in order to serve.  Now, I volunteer time, and give my charitable dollars to the Embracing the World organization in support of the vision of what our world community would be if the actions of Amma were the blueprint for how to live to give.Mary Jo Lorei

We are one such chapter in Sacramento CA,who does charitable work on behalf of Mata Amrithanandamayi Math.Our work is mostly helping the disadvantaged or homeless.An example is what we did last winter, when we bought over 100 blankets to the older people who live in their  homes with no heat, due to lack of money to heat their homes. We serve the needy or homeless as our funds permit us, each year.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17440	3	/users/profile/19099	amazinggrace11	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have never seen a non-profit build and support so many deeply needed causes as the Mata Amritanandamayi Math.  I have participated with and witnessed the works of this organization both while living in India and in the United States. I was especially moved by the orphanage & school, the college, and the hospital for poor people who cannot afford medical care. Not only is high quality medical care provided but it is given with so much love!  This same organization gave the largest amount I had heard of, both for recovery after the Tsunami in India, and also for victims of Hurricane Katrina here at home.  This is only a tiny fraction of what this organization does.  I have volunteered mostly by cooking for the hundreds of other volunteers while they are in service. Blessings on this organization and all it's efforts for all of  humanity!

I have seen Amma console and comfort all those who come to her at her public programs.  I have watched volunteers come together to serve food, assist the infirm, and leverage resources to be of assistance and respond to their individual needs.The efforts of MA Math are unparalleled, from feeding and clothing the hungry, to consoling inmates, to comforting widows, to providing pensions for the poor, to preventing farmer suicide, to running orphanges, to building homes for those affected by natural disasters, to caring for the sick, to educating children...the list goes on. The scope of the work is awe-inspiring.I will continue to volunteer my time and donate money to M.A. Math to ensure that these programs continue to meet the myriad needs of humanity.

I've been blown away at their responsiveness to natural disasters including Katrina, the Tsunamis, Earthquakes. The only criticism I have is that I would like their websites and communication methods to be more organized and consistent.

Everything from feeding and clothing those in need, to practicing and teaching sustainable living to those around the world, helping women get educated to work and support themselves and family. Where there has been emergency needs, Mata Amritanandamayi Math has been there to rescue those in floods, tsunamis, farmers whom have lost there crops, rebuilt houses and homes for those who have lost them or who never had one.  Mata Amritanandamayi Math has created education programs for all age groups, including colleges.   They have created health programs and hospitals, state of the art approaches and facilities and do not turn anyone away.  Created recycling programs and tree planting programs to help enviroment,  they have created the wonderful Mothers kitchen to help feed those that are hungry and without food.  And those that perform these services do it in service.  It is a complete volunteer organization.  The charitable giving and serving continues to grow and daily and yearly basis.

I had a first hand experience of their activities during the construction of homes for the fishermen of Tamil Nadu after the 2005 tsunami.  The first batch of houses were handed over to the communities during the summer of 2006 by working tirelessly late into midnight shifts. The selfless services of all expert voulnteer workers and managers contributed to such an expedited accomplishment that the district collector used it as an example to other NGOs who were helping in the area. My one month of volunteer work in the construction sites was indeed an eye opener.

MA Math tackles international social issues and provides relief to victims of natural disasters in not only a compassionate manner, but also in a timely and efficient manner.  I am continually amazed at how many different issues are being addressed by this organization that has much of its success is due to the overwhelming committments of volunteers who provide time and resources.  I am proud to be an active participant in helping to world to be a better place through the dedication of MA Math and all of the volunteers, including the inspiration to us all, Mata Amritanandamayi.

It was a rare experience to find the tremendous help done by the volunteers to the local people. Help from all corners was mobilised to restore the life back to normal in a very short period.  The place and people was back to routine life.  I bow to the human touch of Amma and salute the humanatarian work done by the volunteers under the able guidance of Amma.OmNamah Shivaya.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17215	4	/users/profile/18912	sdc	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math (M.A.M.), a charitable organization, based in India, has become like "Red Cross" of India!! Wherever there is an earthquake, or flood, or any other calamity, M.A.M. ambulances, truckloads of foods and supplies, and most of all, the most dedicated  staff and volunteers, reach the scene, probably first, and foremost, even before the government has time to respond!! Examples are too many to site; but few are Tsunami, cyclone in West Bengal, flood in Maharashtra,.....The most remarkable aspects of the relief work are: reaching the remotest rural villages in India, where there are not even roads, at the earliest possible time, providing ALL that the help - from medical treatment to feeding the whole village, clothing, even building family homes, as well as moral support!! The most efficient and extensive relief work, leaves the village,by far in better condition than before the calamity!!! The extent of Care, Compassion and Help, that is the distinguishing characteristics of M.A.M., has to be seen to believe!! It is indescribable and incommunicable!!...and this is only one area of charity, among dozens of others...
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17196	3	/users/profile/18897	Prarthana	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I've had the experience of volunteering at the Mata Amritanandamayi Math twice. I was involved in preparing food for the many thousands of guests that come to the Math and entertaining the children. I have seen the amazing scope of the charitable activities undertaken by the Math, such as feeding more than 150,000 people 3 meals a day for 3 days in Kochi in 2003. I have traveled with Amma where free programs of music and uplifting talks were offered to more than 10,0000 people in Calicut.

The humanitarian activities include: disaster relief (Amma was recognized by President Clinton for her efforts after the tsunami); schools, education and orphanages throughout India, including schools for hearing and sight impaired children, housing efforts (Amma has received recognition from the President of India for the thousands of homes she has built); feeding the hungry (there are "Amma's Kitchens" throughout the world that serve delicious vegetarian food to those in need).  Environmental efforts (Amma works with her volunteers to plant trees all around the world) and so many more.  I have volunteered for many of these efforts and I have always returned home amazed and grateful.  Amma was also awarded the Ghandi-King award for non-violence in 2002.

I am sure that Amma has built and administered more housing for the poor and needy over the last 10 years than Dept of Housing Australia. When you go to one of Mothers program and there is a discourse on the large amount of different organisations and operations Ammma orchestrates it take at least 10 minutes to outline then. Then there are the projects and programs in the making. It is Ammas charitalble and humanitarian works that inspires so many including myself to help and serve others. I dont know of any other charitalble organistions where there is no paid administration. Not one cent of the moneys are spent on administration. That is truely remarkable. Amma definitely deservers accolades for her inspired and love fill enourmous charitable operations.Your SincerlyLesley Berry 36 Gordon St Byron BayAustralia
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17076	4	/users/profile/18787	alefhand	Donor	5	10/20/2009	The scope of Amma's charities is breathtaking. Even when she builds homes in India for those who have lost theirs in earthquakes, she makes sure that tarps are placed on the ground to collect the mortar from the bricks so that none is wasted. Most of the work is volunteer, so all money goes towards the projects.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17071	4	/users/profile/18785	craig	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	i first met Amma in 1998 and became aware of her charitable work at that time - it was quickly evident to me that the Math's work was truly about serving the needs of others- Mother's example guides us in learning about giving selflessly- the orphanage in Kerala is an example of the completeness of Mother's care- the children i saw at Amritapuri were happy, smiling,playful children(some had come to visit the ashram) - when Amma took it over the children were under-fed, fearful and wearing rags -today, many will go to college! this attention to the whole person exemplifies the Math's work in all area's-widowed/deserted Indian woman being given a stipend and a sewing machine that they might work for their own betterment - children of the tsunami getting help to address their fears after the event - all of this is accomplished through the organization, a large one, filled with people who want to serve others and do so with only modest compensation- if that ! These are some of my experiences and feelings having spent months at the ashram in India and seeing Mother during her US tour - i give regular financial donations and know that every dollar is wisely spent - this is the "definition" of a lean organization -
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17066	5	/users/profile/18778	Darsana	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Over the past 20 years I have spent a great deal of time in India.  For the masses of the people, simple people living in rural areas and villages life if very real and clear.  If the husband does not work the family does not eat.  If he becomes permanently disabled, they are thrown into abject poverty.  It is a difficult life where excuses are not allowed.  Yet everyday, husbands do have accidents and do become disabled and the consequences affect the lives of family members for generations.  To mitigate some of the suffering faced by such families, the Mata Amritanandamay Math established a pension plan the provides monthly benefits to 100,000 families.  To me that is taking real action that directly impacts the lives of people.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17063	4	/users/profile/18774	peter	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I've witnessed firsthand the phenomenon of AIMS hospital, the charitable hospital in South India that treats almost a half a million patients a year. One third are treated completely free of charge, and one third are subsidized. The care there is excellent and I received surgery myself. This organization is truly deserving of recognition.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17030	4	/users/profile/18746	healthcommando	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	The non profit activities of Mata Amritanandamayi Math are nothing short of legendary.  From Tsunami relief to housing for widows and orphanages there is none other.  It is probably unique also in that a $1.00 donation sees more than a dollar of service/product delivered largely because the labor portion is enormously subsidized by volunteers!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	17024	4	/users/profile/18741	Steven R. Hamlin	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I saw lines of indigent women in India coming to the Ashram for their monthly charity pension checks. Warms the heart. I love transparency, nobody is hiding anything, everyone is invited to participate, from the ground up all the way to the top. I know the feeling when there is not full honesty in the air. A very familiar feeling that is not present at Amma events or charity activities.I have passed out socks to the homeless on skid row at Christmas time; I have helped raise money by preparing food to sell; so much love and unselfishness in the air, from the volunteers. That spirit cannot go wrong. This is a very specific and personal example; my sense of feeling such thing is quite refined.

The organization led by Amma, Mata Amritanandamayi has reached so many suffering people and have helped them come out of it. Their work ranges from Super specialty hospital in India to Orphanage school in Kenya. We need organization like this to sustain the humanity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16989	4	/users/profile/18709	akhilab1290	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been involved with the MA center for nearly 13 years and can not even begin to describe how much it has affected my life and the lives around me. I don't think 5 stars are enough!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16981	4	/users/profile/18699	carole	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Everything that The Math does is to help those who are in need. There are schools all over India, over 25000 free homes have been given to women and their children, a hospital with state of the art care is available for anyone no matter their lot in life, any disaster in India or anywhere in the world where there is suffering, the Math is the first NGO on the scene and giving the most help. There are scholarships and stipends given to people as well as training to have not only sources of income but enhanced self esteem. The only function of this organization is to give from the heart to those who are in need, no matter what country, what religion, what the reason. I have never come across another organization as far reaching as this one. They have just now gone to AFrica and started an orphanage there as well as given scholarships to 108 students. They are in oner 120 countries with soup kitchens and teams of people being sent whenever there is need. In India during the tsunami and the floods, they dispatched mobile medical units before even the governments had a chance to act. I am awed at the quality of this organization's service.

Amma affects all she touches, and that has been demonstrated by how hard people work to spread that through the charities.

Exponentially inspiring so many to care for each other and our beautiful earth.Amma is always looking out for, finding, and establishing ways to help those in need.Orphans,widows,the hungry,farmers,the homeless,nature regeneration,so many many projects with firm foundations.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16954	4	/users/profile/18673	Nandhi	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2009	Amma is a Mother in the real sense- She is the source to the creation of several non-profits serving humanity in different ways. Amma awakens each of us to serve humanity and it is through her inspiration that Ariven Community, our non-profit's vision was founded- to create global sanctuaries for retired animals and farmlands that shares its produce to feed the hungry- with our debut project Amma Sanctuary.Amma serves and touches far too many- in millions-  in India, the West and nearly everyone whom She embraces with immense love to serve humanity and with this foundation of bring hearts together she has uplifted humanity through schools, colleges, senior homes, hospitals, disaster relief and the list goes on and on.We are grateful beyond words for Amma's inspiration, Amma's own actions that set examples and Amma's organizational work directly and indirectly to serve humanity.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16950	4	/users/profile/18669	jaishyam	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math - The humanitarian work done by this organization cannot be described in words. I am lucky enough to be a volunteer in this organisation and help in what ever possible way I can. This organization does everything from feeding the needy, educational scholarship, Circle of love- Letters to the prisoners, Orphanage schools in India and Kenya, pension for the deserving elderly to Disaster relief - 2004 Tsunami work, katrina relief, Gujarat Earthquake. Not to mention how the founder - Mata Amritanandamayi, personally meets everyone that comes to Her and wipes each and everyones tear and takes the burden off them. She has inspired a lot of people all over the world to carry the words of Love and Compassion. In 2004 Tsunami, the village near the Organisation was devastated . Thousands of people lost their homes, lives and everything near and dear. The Math, Led by Mata Amritanandamyi immediately got into action even before the govt did. They evacuated as many people as possible to a safer location, built temporary shelter, arrangements for medical relief and food were made available to the public. The volunteers from the organisation used to go and build these houses from scratch. It was close to a miracle to see how the mankind comes together for the common good without any differences. It should also be noted that all the houses were built just by different volunteers that came from all over the world.  Most important of all, the affected People saw new hope in their lives. Like said, I can keep writing about Her humanitarian activities, Love and Compassion - it never ends. This comes so effortlessly when we are around Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi). Serving others becomes our nature. The inspiration She has given to all of us is just amazing.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16947	4	/users/profile/18668	Agram	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2009	When you get a teacher who leads by example with her life, you cannot go wrong with it. This has been my experience with Amma's group, where she teaches through her actions. They speak a whole lot louder than words.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16944	4	/users/profile/18665	Ganapath	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I love the way Amma gives herself to the welfare of so many people around the world, regardless of race, country, religion or gender.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16942	5	/users/profile/18663	Manju Ram	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	One of the main goals of M A Math has been to execute Mata Amritandamayi's teachings- Her emphasis has been on treating Mother Nature with respect and to give back to Nature. Across the world, her devotees are implementing this into their daily lives as well as helping their respective communities to preserve Nature. As we all are aware of the growing concern in the global village about Nature, I believe the efforts of AMMA and M A Math may yet help bring the awareness and save our beautiful world

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16927	4	/users/profile/18609	bliss93	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math is a great non-profit organization. The math did a tremendous job, helping people in Kerala, Nagapattinam during tsunami. During Gujarat earthquake, the volunteers and doctors rushed to help the victims. They adopted villages and built houses for the people who lost everything in the quake. The math and its volunteers with the grace of Amma, has helped thousands in Bihar floods, Peru earthquake, Bombay floods. These are a few out of countless projects the Math does.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16924	5	/users/profile/18645	ramgee	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2009	My experience with this organization is a little difficult to explain in words. It has definitely changed my life and my outlook towards life for the better. I am glad I got the opportunity to be involved with Amma's organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16918	4	/users/profile/18642	bbkb	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been closely watching the humanitarian activities of Mata Amritandamayi Math for over ten years now. I have also participated in some of the projects as a volunteer. It is amazing to watch the sincere and dedicated efforts of the volunteers as they engage in these selfless services. The Math is involved in health care and education for the under-privileged, orphanages, old age homes, women welfare etc. One thing that clearly stands out is the timely and effective involvement in disaster relief efforts, with a long term vision, while addressing the immediate issues at hand. The Tsunami relief efforts in 2004 deserves special mention.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16906	5	/users/profile/18630	christelhughes	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I assisted in an event put on by M.A. Math organization where we raised money for the fire victims of Santa Barbara, Ca. It was such a moving experience to go to the homes of the victims and see their faces light up as we planted new saplings on their property to restore their faith in rebuilding their home and their lives.  Each event that I have been a part of supporting has had elements of focus, devotion to the cause and an uncanny sense of unity. Personally I have volunteered in many organizations throughout my life and this one seems to have the most commitment to the cause and purity of mission that I have ever seen, felt and experienced. Also, the inclusion factor of any ethnicity creates a unity consciousness that expands the events and ripples out to the World.M.A. Math stands for Unconditional Love, Acceptance and Unity. They are doing an excellent job at allowing all of those that come into contact with their organization to experience these qualities and much more.Brilliant Blessings,Christel Sree Kripa Hughes
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16903	5	/users/profile/18626	vinod	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experience with Amma teaches me how to perform actions more meaningfully. Through example Amma has brought about a change in my thinking, with a purpose. Amma guides our actions so that we may fulfill our duties not only to one another, but to society as a whole.Amma also teaches to respect Nature, the very core of our existance
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16902	4	/users/profile/18627	prakashini	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi, also known as Amma, is a great saint and spiritual leader.  She was recognized by the U.N. for her many charities and contributions to humanity.  She builds many houses for the poor as well as hospitals, schools, orphanages and feeds thousands of hungry people around the world.One such program is Mother's Kitchen which serves meals to the hungry in many locations.  In spite of being a wealthy country the U.S. has many children and adults who are hungry and struggle to survive well below the poverty line. Mother's Kitchen provides meals to those in need. I volunteer at Mother's Kitchen at the Berkeley Community Church in Berkeley, CA. We prepare and serve hot, nourishing lunches several times a month. It is extremely satisfying and makes sense in a deep and most basic way.The meals are organized, prepared and served by devotees of Amma.  The recipients seem to sense that the food is prepared with care and attention in addition to being delicious. We treat the people we serve with respect and appreciation, as we would wish to be treated.This work is satisfying to me in a profound way and I know I'm doing something worthwhile.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16898	4	/users/profile/18624	ursula luciano	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	It was in May 1999 when my friend at Ananda Village,in Nevada City prepared them selfs to visit Mata Amritanandamai in San Ramon, California. At that time I was in a very down and out at the end of my whits of life.I asked if I could join the carpool. My friend where looking forward to be with Amma. The highlight of the visit was to get an embrace from Mother.It was late in the evening when I finally had my turn.As Amma took me in here arms, my world stoppedexisting with seeming lack and fear. I knew I was save and home at last.I was nurtured like never before in 50 of my years. This is home.I was never the same since.Joy and freedom became part of my life.Amma set an example of love and compation for me that I often recallwhen I do my work as a hospice caregiver or anycare for anyone in need. Since then I moved near the Ashram and spend most of my free time being of service. One summer I helped assorting medical supply that was donated, and being prepared to shipped to India. It was a very large undertaking. About 15 People in 5 weeksworked together harmoniously to accomplish this.I felt Amma's Grace with us all the time.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16886	5	/users/profile/18611	shashihari	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I sat & watched Amma serve hour upon hour, day after day, year after year.  This example of service to humanityis unparalleled in my life.  From this example comes inspiration to help others & a kind of sweet happiness.Here the helping takes the form of empowerment forthose who receive & those who give.  There is volunteerarmy of lovers offering tireless service where it is needed.  I am lucky to have been a volunteer in thisdivine army that has uplifted countless lives.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16884	5	/users/profile/18606	sahajadouglass	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	In 1990, my friend from yoga class invited me to meet an "Indian Saint" at a small gathering in Los Angeles. Dressed in a white sari, and sitting on the floor of a modest stage, was a humble woman who over the next twenty years has become the most inspiring person in my life.  Amma selflessly offers love, compassion, guidance and help to millions of people. Her organization, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, serves people in need throughout the world. In India, Amma has created many charities. She founded a state of the art hospital that gives excellent medical care to people irrespective of their financial status. The MA Math has pensions for widows, schools for children of all ages, vocational and higher education schools. Amma's organization runs an orphanage that provides a nurturing environment for children as well as giving them a good education and cultural and spiritual foundation. Under Amma's watchful eye, the MA Math, has an ayurvedic and acupuncture clinic, and also many centers and programs for spiritual study and practice throughout the world.When the tsunami hit, Amma pledged to raise 23 million dollars to rebuild homes and repair villages. In fact, she raised nearly double that amount. One of the most impressive and amazing characteristics of the MA Math is how frugal they are with the money raised to help others. Each person who serves Amma does so as a volunteer, and under Amma's loving and disciplined guidance, we are all inspired to do the very best work possible.Amma encourages her disciples to serve others, and in the United States, as a volunteer for "Mother's Kitchen, " I have had the opportunity to cook and serve meals for homeless men and women. I have also helped organize food for Amma's staff during her annual World Tour. I have had the privilege of gathering donations of food from farmers at the farmers' market in LA, as well as other organizations, who are so moved by Amma's work that they want to support her in whatever way possible.Amma developed a meditation technique, the Integrated Amrita Meditation, that is taught free of charge to those interested. I learned the technique when it was first offered, at a community house in Topanga, Los Angeles.  This daily practice has helped me immensely. Four years ago, when my daughter died, my daily meditation was a life line. During the weeks after Michaela's death, I had little desire to live. I would begin meditating because it was my habit by then, and by the end of the meditation I felt calmer and less emotionally fragile and volatile.  The meditation helps me to experience greater emotional perspective and my husband notices that I am more organized when I meditate.Amma sets a perfect example for us of someone who never thinks of Her own needs, but ALWAYS puts the needs and comfort of others first. During public programs, Amma sits for 10-24 hours at a time embracing all who come to see her. It is a blessing for me that She is alive at this time and that I have had the great fortune to spend time at her programs and help in the small ways I can. The greatest gift of all is how Amma's love opens the hearts of millions around the world, making the world more peaceful.Amma receives everyone with open arms and demands nothing in return. It is with the example of Amma's pure love, that all of her devotees around the world are inspired to help others and try to make a difference in the world during these times of great need!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16866	4	/users/profile/18589	Shelly108	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I am very impressed with the Mata Amritanandamayi Math organization. They are a role model non-profit running on the efforts of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. They act as an active solution solver. After the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina they were quick to organize and direct volunteers in rebuilding Sri Lanka and donated 1 million dollars to the Clinton-Bush foundation going directly to the situation in Louisiana.It is amazing how many people they take care of around the world offering disaster relief, free food, free medical services, free job training, providing orphanages, education and the services are always evolving based on what people need. They have a free hospital and college in India, run by volunteers with donations for supplies. They have a long standing record of using all donated monies for the causes they support. Donated money is not wasted or lost in ambiguous administration costs. When touring the United States they operate as green as possible and great care is taken not to waste food or resources. I have been involved with this organization since 1996 and I am continually impressed by what they take on and accomplish. I was very pleased to learn they take an active role in supporting women's rights in India and have been recognized by the priminister of India and the UN for their humanitarian activities.  This non-profit has a long history of getting the most use out of donations and volunteers to accomplish great feats in taking care of the world's people.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16863	4	/users/profile/19970	v	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amazing and beyond inspiring. Before my experience with the Mata Amritanadamayi Math I believed that everyone was out for themselves. I was greatly mistaken. The organized, highly motivated members of this organization work tirelessly with no thought of personal reward, praise, or acknowledgement. Incredible. Perhaps there is still in fact hope for humanity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16861	5	/users/profile/18580	Sridevi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	There are no words that can adequately convey what Mata Amritanadamayi has done to ease the suffering of so many people worldwide. Amma's is truly the embodiment of love and compassion and we are all so blessed to have such a shining star to guide us on how raise our standards for how reach out to each other and help the planet. Nearly 14 years ago I was involved in fundraising activties for, what was supposed to be a 700 bed charity hospital in Southern India. Two years ago, my husband and I got to actually visit this amazing place. It is now 1300 beds, not the 700 we though it would be. It is exquisite and the world-class staff was truly impressive. We have never been in a hospital that felt so loving and caring. We had the opportunity to meet a child whose life had been saved by being able to get the surgery he needed. Also, Amma does not tell people what to do, she is a living breathing example of a way of being in every aspect of our lives. Mata Amritanandamayi has inspired homeless feedings throughout the world.A few volunteers put together a feeding program for the homeless in Santa Monica. I was able to come and help them serve food a few times. It was really quite touching to see and experience the gratitude of those less fortunate that ourselves. Her reach is far beyond India.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16860	3	/users/profile/18581	Gavinirmala108	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been associated with the MA Math since 1988.  I have seen how this organization draws so much support from people all over the world because it is about people helping people....orphanages, schools, AIMS(free hospital care for people who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it), food and housing for the poor.  Her projects are mostly in India.  However, there are food kitchens, green projects and other efforts to contribute in the US, Europe and other parts of the world.  The inspiration and head of the Math, Mata Amritanandamayi, is one of the greatest living humanitarians in the world.  Her overall accountability, inspiration, and wisdom inspire everyone who meets her and more and more projects manifest.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16858	5	/users/profile/18578	nectar9	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	To describe what AMMA (MA Math) has done to India and the world, as an NGO, is like trying to fold the sky into our shirt pocket. I have very closely seen and watched how MA Math and MA Centers all over the world have transformed human suffering into bliss and happiness. The list is endless and countless. I do not remember each and every project being done by MA Math but AMMA and Her volunteers always are available and ready to serve in case of any natural calamity or suffering including personal suffering. The classic example was the Tsunami relief projects, homes for the homeless and poor all over India, Education aid to poor students, AIMS hospital...list is endless. The most important aspects of AMMA and Her organization are:1. AMMA proves that She is the LEADER amongst the contemporary humanitarian leaders by attending to the needs of each and every human being who come to Her, by personally wiping their tears and addressing their personal issues UNLIKE other leaders who do not spend the same amount of time with each and every human being.2. 85-90% of AMMA's programs are FREE and not charged even in the United states and Europe. In other words She almost takes nothing but gives BOUNTIFUL to the suffering and unfortuntate beings in this world. Please compare this with other organizations where even each and every small teaching/satsang that is offered, is charged.3. India is still a poor country with a huge population. Imagine this GREAT being (AMMA) attending to each and every human being coming for Her darshan in all Her India programs. This is very unique and has never happened in the history of India. As we can see, AMMA is the ONLY spiritual leader/humanitarian who has met the maximum number of human beings with the GREAT FORCE of Selfless Love. Compare this with other organization where very less individual attention is given to the individual but more emphasis is given to the teaching. Maybe seekers will find answers but the poor masses will find relief and spiritual solace ONLY in AMMA's Lap.4. Finally, AMMA and Her organization will always be the first to reach out in terms of humanitarian aid. The Katrina hurricane was a real example where AMMA proved that it is possible to carry our relief efforts not only within India but also in the US.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16843	4	/users/profile/18566	jkutty108	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I came across this organization in 2003. I was amazed at the humanitarian activities of this Center. During the Katrina Disaster in New Orleans, some of the volunteers in Dallas went to affected areas in New Orleans and provided food, clothing and shelter. Amma Math offered a Million plus dollar to the Katrina Fund. Being inspired by the relentless hours Amma spent serving others, we organized a fund raising event to sponsor homes for people who lost their residence in Sri Lanka. During that time, I learned that, due to reduced overhead costs, this organization is the best non profit organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16823	6	/users/profile/18550	4service	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	A few years back the tsunami hit my father's hometown of Kollam, Kerala. Amma promised to help all those who suffered in many different ways. Many felt that it was not humanly possible to accomplish all that Amma said would be done. Amma proved it possible. Amma's organization provided homes, food, clothing, medical service and most of all emotional support and strength to all those who suffered. While the Government struggled to keep up the promises they made to the tsunami victims in Kerala, Amma's charities  not only helped those in Kerala, but also in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The help that Amma provided in Kerala, which is what I know  the most about, is unbelievable. Although all charities deserve to be supported, Amma's organization is very special in the sense that the help Amma provides, reaches people all over the world, regardless of country,race, color, caste or creed. An organization like Mata Amritanandamayi Math that does such a vast variety of service needs a lot of support to continue their work. Please support Amma's charities.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16819	6	/users/profile/18544	Rita	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma is an embodiment of all the great beings that have ever walked the earth - Jesus, Buddha.  There are others who give and offer help and service, but Amma is exceptional.She gives not only 50% or 80% or 100% but even more than that.  Her every living breathis to offer love to those poor in their heart, to offer homes, healthcare, education, and more to those poor in material resources.  But she not only helps with hospitals, housing, schools, etc, she teaches deep values that have been long lost - love, compassion, kindness, patience, wisdom.Though many have said many beautiful things throughout the times, she has taught notonly by speaking but by being the highest example of all the values that have been lostin a capitalist world.  God is Love and Amma is the embodiment of God.  A true gem in this world.Rita Panahi
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16818	5	/users/profile/18543	Connie	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I belong to a group called Circle of Love where we write letters to people who are having problems such as depresseion, illness,loneliness.  This is a great way to help those in need and it also helps the writer.  By encouraging others, we get the benefits also.I live in Portland, Oregon and there is a group called Mother's Kitchen.  Twice a month a group of us goes to a kitchen where the homeless and less fortunate are fed by Amma's devotees.  Amma is instrumental in so many ways to help humanity.  I feel very fortunate to be able to help in a very small way.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16815	4	/users/profile/18540	Aradhana	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma's charities are nothing short of extraordinary.  I have personally visited one of the organization's orphanages in India and AIMS, the full scale hospital that provides free service to the poor.  I was at the ashram during the tsunami and saw all of the organizations efforts first-hand when people were carefully rescued, evacuated to school buildings (schools run by the organization) and fed and clothed immediately.  I have been back to visit and have seen the huge fishing boats for the villages to help them rebuild their lives.  The Mata Amritanandamayi Math's work is almost infinite, with services ranging from free food for the poor to job training for farmers affected by poor weather and for the people who lost everything in the tsunami.  In other countries, the organization's members participate in feeding the homeless through a program called Mother's Kitchen.  I have been involved with a number of charities but have never seen anything as extraordinary as this organization.  It seems as if each effort is magnified 100 times to ensure maximum benefit for all.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16814	4	/users/profile/18539	Sneha	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experience is with the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), this organization's 1300 bed state-of-the-art hospital for the poor in Kochi, Kerala where day in and day out I am stunned by the number of patients who come and are treated but cannot afford to pay for treatment. There are also five satellite hospitals in rural areas with hundreds of medical camps in even more remote areas. When patients need more specialized care - like cataract surgery, heart surgery, GI surgery, or treatment for diabetes - they are brought to AIMS where they get the care they need. Since 1998, these healthcare institutions have provided more than U.S. $50 million worth of free medical care and more than 1.2 million patients have received completely free treatment. Another impressive aspect is that the care is exceptional.  Hospitals around the world could learn a great deal about how a hospital can keep costs down and still deliver heartfelt state-of-the-art care.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16811	4	/users/profile/18534	pathri	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	The MA Math non profit is unique in its working since it has one of the lowest operational cost. In other words, any donations made to this organization in cash gets converted multiple times in value when it is converted into a service. You would also observe that there are people from all nationalities working together in highly coordinated teams to achieve objectives as varied as flood relief, earth quake relief, providing healthcare to the poor or managing orphanages.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16801	5	/users/profile/18527	essee	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	After learning about Amma's program called Circle of Love Inside, I decided to get involved.  This is a letter writing program designed to provide emotional and spiritual support for prisoners around the country.  I started sending cards and letters to prisoners on the list and was surprised how helpful these letters were for the prisoners.  Amma has provided the inspiration  and guidance for this program to run safely and effectively.  It is a great humanitarian service to impact prisoners and letters writers alike.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16799	5	/users/profile/18525	Susheel	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	In person, Amma comforts a lot of people just by hugging, in absentia also she comforts and answers you prayers.  I met Amma first time in 1992.  Initially I was only one of the millions of persons who would just go and get her darshan once a year when she would come to New York.  However, later when I started going to a Satsang, I got involved in many of her activities, which gave me immense pleasure in working as a volunteer.  The beauty of Amma's organization is that every effort put in towards a cause reaches 100% to the destination.  May it be a physical effort or a monetary donation.  Since there are no overheads at all, and because of the selfless services extended by all the volunteers, everything reaches the 100% to the destination.  I am proud to be a part of such selfless organization which is growing and helping more and more people in need all around the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16798	4	/users/profile/18524	Nirmala	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have volunteered a number of times with Mother's Kitchen in Berkeley.  I have learned a lot.  We serve about 100 people  a hot meal every second week -- and we prepare that meal once a month.  People that come to eat are just like those of us working. Some are picky, some are grateful, some expect better service, some come back for seconds and even thirds, some are families, some alone, some homeless, some  down on their luck.  All are hungry.   Just like you and me -- all just people.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16792	4	/users/profile/18522	Kalisiva8989	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma's charities grow more expansive every year - more houses built for the poor, more schhols for children, more hospitals for the sick, etc. She has inspired me to do full time volunteer work for her largest hospital, the AIMS Hospital in Kerala, India. I have volunteered 14 years and sent 125 ocean going containers filled with donated medical goods. It allows more poor people to be treated free of charge. Many other people are inspired by Amma to do volunteer work.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16789	4	/users/profile/18514	Kaivalya	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been most impressed with the work of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math.  Not only is their quick response to tragedies impressive, but their ongoing support to the affected people should also be commended and recognized.  This is only the tip of the iceberg as the Math's far reaching charitable efforts.  Their work is truly inspiring.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16787	4	/users/profile/18511	Kaivalya	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Greetings,I am so glad to have the opportunity to share my personal experience as a volunteer with this organization.  This experience has been the most deeply gratifying and inspirational experience of my life.  In a meager attempt to follow Mata Amritanandaymayi's example of selfless service to console humanity, I have volunteered as a coordinator for a monthly Mother's Kitchen Project in Wichita, Kansas for nearly five years.  About once a month, on Saturday, we prepare and serve a hot meal in a shelter environment for Inter-Faith Ministries homeless clients and feed anywhere from 50-100 people.  Our community has a "soup kitchen" where an evening meal is served 7 days a week.  There are organizations that serve a noon meal during the week as well.  On Sundays sometimes folks will come to the shelter to pick up residents there for church and supper. On Saturdays however, people often wait all day without having any food.  So the meals that we prepare there are especially appreciated.  We were also asked by residents to come on the LAST Saturday of the month as that is the time when money is all gone and food stamps have run out and the people have very few resources.  Every month it is still a challenge to believe that my neighbors here in this midwestern city in America's heartland are HUNGRY and without enough food, but they are.This service is such a small gesture compared to what is needed but Amma has demonstrated countless times to her followers how even the smallest effort can have a large impact in someone's life.  When we started the Mother's Kitchen, we were the only organization that took the opportunity to cook at the shelter on Saturdays, but now another group also comes regularly once a month on Saturdays and yet another one is interested as well.  My hope is that there will be meals every Saturday there.  I have found that even though we are "serving" the homeless community in Wichita, the benefits to us as individuals from being involved with the community at this level are tangible.  My heart has opened as my awareness has increased of the situation that the people we are serving have found themselves in.  We serve families, mothers and children, elders, disabled and see so many sad plights every time we go.  From the shelter director after last months meal... "Thank you for all you do and all the lives you touch and make a difference."   ShawnOur group also volunteers and sings gospel music monthly at several senior citizen centers for those who can no longer live independently.  Since 2007, I have been honored to teach free of charge Amma's Integrated Amrita Meditation technique to anyone wishing to learn to meditate.I truly believe that it is through God's grace that we are able to provide this service and certainly it is only through Amma's selfless example and inspiration that we are moved to do so much.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16779	4	/users/profile/18505	keerthi	Former Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	My experience with amma is amazing. Amma's love is universal, there is no limit to the amount of affection she showers on everyone. There's so much positive energy generated in her presence, that people come out and feel that they are born to help and serve the societly. The feeling of 'I' goes away...all of us take her as an example to serve the society in whatever way we can. Like she says.."If a person is suffering it's due to his Karma, but it's our dharma to help them".
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16777	4	/users/profile/18506	megha	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been working as a volunteer for Amma helping to organize shipments of medical supplies to her hospital in Cochin, Kerala, India.  That hospital not only is truly uptodate, but they do things like serve a large number of people for free, send out clinics to outlying areas that would not receive such medical care, and train their staff to treat patients with care and compassion.  It is a transformational hospital.  I wish I could do even more to help in her many projects.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16770	4	/users/profile/18498	kripamayi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	all that i have ever prayed for is revealed always through amma's love. witnessing so much of her humanitarian activities is inspiring and motivating and heart opening.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16768	4	/users/profile/18496	navya	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Puja, or work in service of a greater ideal, is a calming and focusing event when done on behalf of Amma.  With 10 others standing at a table in a tent, I have chopped vegies for dinner for several thousand devotees, under a sign that says, "today the vegetables wished to be chopped by someone chanting a mantra".  Working alone, I have made small bracelets/necklaces for dolls which will be sold, the proceeds going to Amma's charities.  Several years ago,working under the direction others, I helped to search lists of those missing in Hurricane Katrina, attempting to help reunite children and parents.  Amma's charities know no boundaries.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16764	4	/users/profile/18499	neil425	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I met Amma in 1991, at first I was just observing and checking Amma out to see if she was a real Saint. I brought my mother who could not walk in 1994 to Amma from South America;my mother was suffering from a broken left foot and excruciating pain from Arthrist in both feet. Amma would touch her knees every time we go to see her which is once a year. It has been 15 years now and my mother is walking and moving around still, I feel so blessed to have met Amma. Amma, there are no words in which I can extend my gratitude for all the wonderful healing work you have been doing around the World, you have brought hope and joy to so many children with your selfless love and charitable activites. You have confirmed so much of what I feel, know, and hear inside my heart and soul.Thanks again,Leila
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16761	4	/users/profile/18492	ammassusthi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	When I first met Amma, I didn't know anything about Her except that She hugs people. When I went to see Her I couldn't believe Her compassion, unconditional love and selfless giving. On Her 50th Birthday, she invited people from around the globe and had each bring some water from their country. To signify the unity all the water was put into one pot.On Her Birthday She gives thousands of dollars to support families of fishermen in a suicide prevention program that gives scholarships to young people so they can get a good job and participate in the community. Amma also gives away sewing machines and teacher former prostitutes how to sew so they do not have to harm themselves anymore to get money to live.One of Amma's great endeavors is free health care to the poor in India Amma has numerous hospitals in India and has mobile hospitals go from community to community providing free medical care. After the tsunami, Amma taught the little children who survived how to swim and She actually got into the water and held them and stayed with them and played with them. After Katrina, Amma gave millions of dollars to the United States. Amma gives and gives and gives.Amma's children whom She embraces and with Her embrace heals our spiritually starving hearts. In turn everyone wants to give back. It is a Pull to return a tiny sliver of all She has given to us. It is phenomenally so incredible to see Her outreach into the world with orphanages for all children and one especially with programs for deaf children. Amma also promotes peace in the environment by providing trees and programs for people to plant to keep the environment healthy. Amma has numerous homes for the elderly and hospices to care for AIDS patience and the dying.Amma is such a positive force in the world. She does not just give to Her country, She gives to the World more than any other human in this lifetime. What a blessing it is to be able to be in Her Presence. My entire life has changed since I met her only 3 years ago.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16760	4	/users/profile/18489	Sherry	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have been around Amma and her charitiable work for four years now, and I have never experienced anything like it.  Everything she takes on (and she takes on SO MUCH!) is done with such efficiency, love and compassion.  Because so much is done by volunteers, and because of her supreme sense of organization and efficiency, each one of Amma's many charitable organizations is a model for helping the maximum number of people in the most direct and effective means.    This organization has no equal, in my opinion.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16750	4	/users/profile/18480	Ammasmon	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi, or Amma, who is the inspiration behind the sprawling activities of the MA Math, lives SOLELY for the world. She has no personal goals or aspirations. Her only wishes are to see the poor and the needy getting to a better station in life. Her modus operandi towards this objective is to use like-minded people to provide service selflessly. Selflessness is the path to our True Self.When a devastating earthquake flattened a large part of Gujarat state in 1993, she boldly announced that she will sponsor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 3 villages at a time when she was already doing significant other charitable activities and that too when funds were not readily available. But slowly She made it a reality and the villagers were overwhelmed by the kindness shown by this divine stranger.Dec 2004 tsunami. story repeats. This time too, She takes on rehabilitation and reconstruction for several villages and delivers. The important difference is that even the Govt of SriLanka (among the worst-affected countries) invited Her to provide consultative and collaborative guidance in the rehab efforts!!!The important aspect of her non-profit is that there is no "salary" involved as the work is done almost entirely by unpaid volunteers. Thus, unlike the other genuine non-profit orgs like Red Cross or United Way, this reduces costs significantly and adds to increased output where it is truly needed.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16749	4	/users/profile/18478	Ganesh 108	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Under the umbrella of this organization, I've gotten to do things I wouldn't normlly have beem able to. I helped run a bookstore, helped organize special events, led programs, helped a paralyzed woman and got to know her life well, served food to the homeless, and driven vans in NYC. In most cases you don't need to be ceritfied in anything in order to help: you just have to be willing. I feel the organization uses resources, both human and material, better than any other organization I've known. It brings out people's potential, both the helped and the helpers. I would recomnmend it as transformative in all respects.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16748	4	/users/profile/18477	stcere	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Excellent charity.  I toured some of their medical facilities in India.  They provide much needed care to the disadvantaged who would otherwise have to go without.I also toured one of the major colleges they run and gave a guest lecture there.  Excellent facility that provides a better future to all who attend.Saw some of the houses they built for sunmi victims.  Very nice.They also run a great orphanage and provide around 2 million free meals to those in need.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16746	4	/users/profile/18476	nirmala	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math to me embodies the principle "think globally, act locally".  Anyone, volunteers like me, who live all over the world, can have a chance to donate money or offer their time to so many of the Math's projects in India: the hospital in Cochin, the orphanage, housing for the needy, tsnuami rehabilitation, pensions for widows and scholarships for needy children. Then there are the local projects.  Here in New York, I've been involved with providing music for weekly meetings, the monthly soup kitchen, outreach and organizations of volunteers for local events, fundraising, donating, environmental projects with Green Friends,  and writing letters and cards to military personnel and children in the Math's Kenya orphanage. The M.A. Math is the most open hearted, hard working and inspiring group I've ever had the chance to be a part of. I consider it a great blessing to be involved.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16744	4	/users/profile/18473	Ammasmol	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Love and selfless service are the hallmarks of this amazing charitable organization. This is the message that the founder of the charity, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (who is also lovingly addressed as Amma), conveys through Her every thought, word and deed. And this is what attracted me to Her and inspired me to get involved in this organization and its charitable activities. I was able to see first hand the significant amount of positive transformation MAM is able to bring into the lives of millions who otherwise have no hope whatsoever. Through its many charitable activities, which span from a super specialty medical hospital, to medical hospices & camps, to disaster relief projects like Tsunami relief and farmers suicide relief, to orphanages, to schools and educational institutions, to old-age homes, MAM is able to reach and help the poorest of the poor and the most affected beings.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16743	5	/users/profile/19743	bhoja	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have known amma since 1995. Love and compassion that amma gives to individual is that what attracted me to our beloved Guru. AMMAs orgranization is Taking so much effort to educate the rural farmers children and giving hope to their future. This they do it by utmost love and compassion, which is the basis of most important teaching that our beloved AMMA gives to all.During Tsunami AMMA & her organization gave shelter, food, medical aid to thousand and thousands of villagers. AMMA not only took care of the people of kerala, she sent her children to take care of people of tamilnadu, and also people of srilanka. When earthquake struck gujrath AMMA was quick to act on them and help them out. Organization also helped people in USA when the horrible katrina struck. This are just the some of the ones, which the Math has taken. The list is too big to explain here.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16740	4	/users/profile/18470	pattimata	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Aum Namah Sivaya,I would like to tell you about Mata Amritanandamayi Math.  Amma's is not only a leader around the world in regards to charitable organizations but also for spreading world peace.  Amma's charities specifically in India support the Suicide Farmers, scholarships for children to attend school, feed the hungry, build housing for the poor, provide over 100,000 lifetime stipends for the mentally challenged adults and children. Amma also sent relief to the areas affected by the floods both in India and around the world. Amma has donated over 45 millian rippes to charities and has been recognized around the world for both her charities and her promotion of world peace. Amma is also a very strong advocate of Nature Care. Amma has sent help to Bihat both food and medicine, Kashmir/Pakistan earthquake, the children afected by the Tamil fires and the victims of the Gujatat earthquake. These are only a few of the efforts of MAM in India, then there are all the charitable help done around the world. Amma's organization has personally affected me and my family and saved my life. Thank you for the opportunity to share my love and admiration for our Amma!At her Lotus Feet,Patti Holmes
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16732	4	/users/profile/18461	Ahava	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I recently joined the volunteers for Mother's Kitchen, a soup kitchen in NYC,setting up and preparing food for a free meal. The energy and devotion of the volunteers is full of love and compassion as Amma has inspired us all to selflessly serve and embrace anyone who needs our help. From the first moment I met Amma, watching her give darshan, I understood how simple and important it is to give and help each other through this life. The example Amma sets for us to do as much as we can for others is the most compassionate human purpose possible, it is the ultimate human experience of life.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16729	3	/users/profile/18472	Terra	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	The humanitarian contributions of this organization are unparalleled. In addition to the schools, hospitals, and orphanages created and supported by the M.A. Math, food and shelter programs have assisted thousands of India's poorer sectors. My favorite to support is the free housing for poor families, widows, and disabled, where tens of thousands of concrete houses were built and offered to the needy.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16724	3	/users/profile/18454	slhumph	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Every Saturday we hand out free vegetarian lunches to the homeless and other people in need as part of Amma's kitchen in Albuquerque.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16723	3	/users/profile/18453	hridayesh	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	It was a real blessing and awakening to what true devotion and selfless service by this organization when I witnessed the impact on local communities. Schools, hospitals, programs for feeding the homeless and needy but a few examples of the scope of their activities. In our home community of Toronto Canada efforts are made to provide food, computers for those in need and companionship and support for the elderly. Love is shared in many beautiful and simple ways of giving. truly inspiring!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16720	3	/users/profile/18450	tlshanti	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma works endlessly alleviating the suffering of poor people all over the globe. She has started schools, financially supports orphanages in India and now also in Kenya. The MA Math has donated money to help people rebuild after the tsunami, after Katrina in the USA, and the list goes on. She helps widows, the children of farm workers that have committed suicide. How can I begin to even come close to what she has done. Currently I help to feed the homeless in my home town of Albuqueque, NM. Amma continues to inspire us to provide selfless service in whatever way we can. Amma is my guide, teacher, leader, and inspiration. We all need to strive to be more like Amma.

Amma does Feed people,build homes, build schools, teach people how to earn money to care for themselves!!  Pensions for the elderly and sick people, build hospitals and give aid where ever it is needed..It sounds like i'm talking about a Saint doesn't it......
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16714	3	/users/profile/18444	Hannah	Client Served	5	10/20/2009	Ammachi has changed my life!!  Just being around the power of her awakened self helps begin to awaken me. .

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16713	3	/users/profile/18448	Prasanna Sreedharan	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	With her holistic vision, Amma works tirelessly to nourish individuals and communities though her spiritual and humanitarian projects. Ever since I met Amma , I was inspired by the various humanitarian activities that the MA Math has undertaken for the upliftment of human life. Since 2001, M.A Math has respond to a number of natural disasters including Tsunami , Cyclone in west Bengal , Bihar floods , Hurricane Katrina , Kashmir Earth quake , Mumbai Floods and most recently the flood relief work in Kurnool Andra Pradesh. I dont have enough words to describe the list of humanitarian activities done by M.A. Math. Additionally I want to emphasize the positive impact on Kids who get a helping hand in the form of scholarship that help them dream and achieve the future without worrying about the financial and social means.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16692	3	/users/profile/18425	paurnami	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Through my involvement with the MA Math, I have learned that no work is insignificant.  Whether it is distributing food and clothing to the poor, running AIMS, Amma's super-specialty hospital, or sweeping the floor or stacking chairs, every job is important and valued.  What stands out about this organization is that Amma lives Her life as an example of selfless love and service, inspiring others to follow and thus spreading love and compassion through the hearts and hands of millions of people.  There are two types of poverty in the world, Amma says, the poverty caused by a lack of material goods and the poverty caused by a lack of love and compassion.  The second type needs to be adressed first, because if we have love and compassion in our hearts we will whole-heartedly strive to serve the poor and needy.  Amma's organization is extra-effective in its charitable works because both of these types of poverty are addressed through a variety of programs.  Another reason why this organization stands above all others in its positive impact on the world is that it is almost entirely run by volunteers.  I used to give a monthly donation to an (unrelated)international child welfare program until I found out that the CEO was making hundreds of millions of dollars a year while the children they were striving to help were starving.  This type of hiprocrisy does not exist in the MA Math.  All the money received through donations goes towards those who are in need, and the sincere effort of the volunteers adds even more to it.  I continue to be amazed and impressed with the work of this organization, and plan to devote as much time as possible volunteering with their efforts.May we all become lamps of love shedding light unto the world; may grace and peace help us to achieve this goal.  Om Amriteswaryai Namah.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16691	3	/users/profile/18424	Great2009	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Inspired by the selfless example and infinite compassion shown by AMMA the 'Hugging Saint' there are thousands of volunteers in India and abroad who take part on a regular basis in several voluntary social service initiatives launched by AMMA. In the US, MA Center volunteers:1. Under 'Mother's Kitchen' cook food for shelters and homeless people.2. Under the 'Circle of Love' initiative write letters to the sick, poor and the under privileged.3. Under the "Green Friends" initiative plant trees, promote Organic farming, reduce non-recyclable waste and preserve nature.In India, the center volunteers have accomplished several massive re-construction work during disasters such as Tsunami, Gujarat Earth quake etc,The Mutt has adopted an Orphanage with 100+ children and built 1000+ homes for the poor all over India.As the ex Prsident of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalaam put it, Amritapuri the HQ of MA Math means one thing 'giving' ..'go on...giving'
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16687	3	/users/profile/18421	vandanabonnie	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I am organizing a group of volunteers in Canada following the guidance and wisdom of Mata Amritanandamayi who says "The beauty and charmof selfless service shold never die away from the face of this earth. The world shold know that a life of dedication is possible; that a life inspired by love and service is possible." Amma lives this message each and every day of her life and inspires others to contribute selflessly. We are developing a program to serve the elderly and follow her example of love.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16686	3	/users/profile/18419	criedel	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma's charities are truly extraordinary and affect the lives of thousands of people worldwide. Almost unlimited in scope, they tackle a myriad of issues - including homelessness, famine, disease, and environmental disasters - as well as promote opportunities for education, greenspace and community building.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16678	3	/users/profile/18413	gokul	Donor	5	10/20/2009	Matha Amritanandamayi Math is a charitable organization headed by the spiritual saint Matha Amritanandamayi.  Although it is headquartered in the southern state of Kerala in India, every nook and corner of the world is touched by its humanitarian activities. It has made stellar contributions to ameliorate various types of suffering in the world.  Specific examples include earthquake disaster in Gujarath, India and Tsunami disaster.  It is worth noting that the organizations pledge of support to  Tsunami victims far exceeded the initial contribution pledged by US federal government! It is an organization with a dedicated volunteer force enabling it to be one with an extremely low over-head cost.  Therefore, most of the contributions end up directly at the place or hands where help is needed the most.  That is one of the main motivating factors to make donations to this organization. Importantly, it dispenses help to anyone in dire need irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. Its leader and director Her Holiness Matha Amrithanandamayi is the embodiment of love, humility, and wisdom.  The loving hug of this "hugging mother" has touched and soothed millions of lives all over the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16677	3	/users/profile/18409	deepthi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have volunteered at the Math during my three visits. My work included cooking and serving meals to the visitors of the Ashram and to the visitors while we are tour with Amma. I also helped with the moving of materials for house building after the tsunami. I was always amazed at the level of integrity and enthusiasm of the volunteers and the supervisors. Amma stresses that we not waste valuable resources. It was quite incredible to see hundreds of sweet, humble houses sprouting like perfect flowers. These homes would be given free-of-charge to the families who lost their homes in the tsunami. However, the Ashram also has supervised the construction of thousands of homes for the homeless through out India. Amma is one of the greatest humanitarians in our time. I pray that she will be recognized by all for all the amazing work she continues to do to uplift humanity and bring joy to those who suffer.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16676	3	/users/profile/18410	AmmasTi	Donor	5	10/20/2009	I am always amazed by the quantity and variety of work that the MA Math accomplishes, from building homes for the poor, giving pensions to elderly widows who have no other way to support themselves, to teaching people how to make a living and helping them get started, to a massive charitable hospital, to helping indigenous tribal people, to helping with tsunami and Hurrican Katrina relief, feeding the poor, the list goes on! I have no doubt that the money that I have given them over the years has been used in the most effective and efficient way humanly possibly, since that is how Amma is.  And so many of the people working with the MA Math are volunteers so the money donated goes even further.  All that in addition to the example that Amma herself provides for us all to serve the poor and needy with an attitude of love, as if we are serving God him/herself.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16671	4	/users/profile/18405	Truth	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I met Amma in 2009 in Toronto where I attended the Amma retreat.  On the second day, while waiting in line waiting for my hug, I was asking Amma to help me release some abandonment issues that I had from losing my father to a heart-attach at age 7. While getting my hug, I didn't really notice anything.  I then sat down on the floor near Amma and I started meditating.  All of a sudden a beautiful song started playing in the room and I experienced an incredibly vivid imagination where I was dancing with my father as a 7-year old girl. I was then dancing with my 7-year old self. Then my father, my 7-year old self and my current self were all holding hands and dancing together in a circle. After that I imagined myself dancing with my father at age 16, 20 etc.  I then told my father that I had to let him go and that I loved him. He told me that he loved me very much. While I was experiencing all of this, I was crying. I really felt that I was experiencing a form of release! After this experience, I went to the back of the room where they were selling Amma's CDs. I wanted to buy one - preferably the one with the "special song" on it. I had no way of knowing what the song was called, so I just picked one of her CD's from the 2009 collection. When I got home and listened to it, the special song was on it!  The story doesn't end here...About 1-2 months later I was taking a long walk by myself in Toronto and I was listening to music on my IPOD. I walked into a store that sold flowers and plants. I was the only person in the store besides the lady behind the counter. She said something to me, so I took one of my ear-phones out of my ear so I could hear her and kept the other ear-phone in the other ear. She suggested for me to go to go to the back room to look at some flowers.  I went into the back room and she followed me. She led me into a beautiful room where she kept all of her fresh cut flowers. The smell was incredible!  She was picking some of the flowers form that room. I then started heading towards the front door when the lady called out "hey, you forgot something". I went back to the counter with curiosity.  She was wrapping 6 roses in clear plastic and she tied them with some kind of straw-like ribbon.  "These are for you" she said.  "You're giving me free flowers?" I said. "Why?" To this she replied "you need these". I didn't know what to say! I just said thank you.  I asked her if she normally gives strangers free roses. When she passed the flowers to me, she said "No, I don't give free flowers to just anyone". While exiting the store, I realized that the song that was playing all that time was my "special song" from Amma. The one ear-phone had been in my ear the entire time I was in that store. The story doesn't end here...When I got home, I put the roses into a glass flower vase and placed it on my coffee table in the living room. The colour of my couch is charcoal grey with accent pillows in yellow and orange. The colour of the roses where also yellow and orange. They matched the colours of my living-room perfectly!  Thank-you Amma!

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16668	3	/users/profile/18404	Marie	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math's Farmer Suicide Relief program and massive Housebuilding program are amazing.The Farmer Suicide Relief program helps widows and children whose husbands/fathers have committed suicide because of failed crops and bad loans.  The MA Math provides scholarships for the children to complete their education, and training for the widows to join word cooperatives, empowering them in their communities to continue to earn a living for their families.  Emotional support is also provided.One of the training programs is for tailoring.  I have attended programs where large numbers of sewing machines have been given to women in these regions. I have personally visited a number of the of free homes for homeless who had previously been living in the open or under make shift thatched shelters, unprotected from the elements. And also some of the communities that were built after the Gujarat earthquake and after the tsunami.  Aside from the homes and nice roads, these communities also have provisions for potable water tanks and community meeting places, trees, etc.The charitable hospital in Kochi is also a wonder.  During one inspection by the Indian Department of Health, the inspector claimed that the hospital was giving more in charity than the government was.

When hurricane Katrina hit U.S, math sent us email on its decision to contribute money towards disaster recovery and we all contributed money for that. Math takes the leadership in arranging fundraiser for various disasters that happens in the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16660	3	/users/profile/18394	amma108	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I met Amma a few years ago, and I've seen myself and a lot of other people get transformed in their lifestyles, thinking, and overall outlook in lives.  She's one of the rare teachers who practices what she preaches.  She has unity in her words, thoughts and deeds, and is a shining example to millions of people around the world. Her charities involve a vast network, including education, meditation, environmental, disaster relief, economic development, homes and slums renovations, foster homes, healthcare, fighting hunger, community outreach, green initatives, research, prevention of farmer's suicides, writing letters and communing with prisoners, to name a few of her programs.  She is one of the rare leaders who serve by being the humblest, and by working the hardest among everybody.  She is someone who has offered her total self for the happiness of the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16655	3	/users/profile/18389	Neworldvisions	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Their work is wonderfully benevolent and caring.  With a pure heart, they give to those in need on many levels.  The only detectable motive is to raise the well being, consciousness, and comfort of all humanity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16650	3	/users/profile/18400	Louise-Tanmayi	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I was at Ammas ashram in India when the 2005 Tsunami struck. I was amazed by how efficiently the Math took care of everyone and helped people in surrounding villages. Supplies were brought in from all over, food was cooked and served, clothing was distributed, and temporary shelters were built. People who were injured were moved to the Maths hospital in Cochin. Amma not only thinks of everything but she thinks of the long term implications of her help. Later on, houses were built for people who had lost their homes. While waiting for government approval of the house plans, ashram residents built boats for the fishermen who had lost theirs. She continued feeding the people from the surrounding villages for months and provided schooling for the youngsters. I can only describe a small part of how Amma helped during that time, and at all times. That special time is just an eloquent symbol of how she works and how she inspires people all over the world.In Montral, we are only a small group but, inspired by Ammas teaching, we cook and serve a vegetarian meal once a month at a local shelter for the homeless. We also bake cookies for Christmas and Valentines Day for homeless kids and elderly people. This year we will be adding the distribution of warm woolen stockings for the kids.A few years ago we also collected trees that a local organisation planted.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16647	3	/users/profile/19256	Shivashankara	Board Member	5	10/20/2009	I had AMMA'S first durshan in Jan 1990 in HER Ashram in Kerala, India and it was a tiny place with only a few huts. After a span of 20 years, the growth is unimaginable - there are at least 4 thousand permanent residents called renunciates and another 2 thousand transients from all over the world staying temporarily to experience Divine Bliss.  The number of Charitable Projects AMMA has undertaken is beyond anybody's comrehension and is still expanding due to urgency that keep cropping up due to natural calamities etc. Although HER work is mainly in India, it has been expanded to USA, Sri Lanka, Kenya, many parts of Europe and Australia. The tremendous impact SHE has made to Humanity cannot be quantified and cannot be described in a few words. However, an attempt is made to highlight a few benefits below.ECONOMIC BENEFITS:  AMMA has been travelling every year to Europe, USA and Australia from 1987 onwards. Purely from the economic point of view, these countries have benefited in terms of business being generated by air travel, car rental, gas consumption, resturant business, grocery supplies, merchandise etc.EDUCATION BENEFITS:  It is due to AMMA'S influence many children both in India and abroad have been inculcated with apptitude to complete their high school education and then have been able to go to College and University studies. They are better equipped for competetive jobs.SPIRITUAL BENEFITS: Children and society in general have been made aware of the importance of being better citizens in that they are taught not to smoke, drink, take drugs which are injurious to health. Children and adults have been taught to exercise daily following AMMA'S IAM (Integrated Amrita Meditation) Technique which will help reduce National Medical bills. IAM technique has been taught in some prisons, Army and in many schools.CONCLUSION: It is due to AMMA'S love,compassion and generosity, millions of people all over the world have benefited in times of dire need due to natural disasters and forced circumstances. Former President of India Dr. Abdul Kalam has sais: " AMMA keeps on giving, more and more."  It is HER Divine mission  to uplift humanity so that there is Peace and Harmony throughout the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16644	3	/users/profile/18380	meow30	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I only met Amma less than a year ago but am amazed at her compassion for other human beings and her seemingly endless energy.  Surely she can only do all that she does in the name of selfless love.  If I could only be a little like her I would be an extraordinary person.  I've watched how she has changed many lives around me, inspired people to volunteer and give selflessly.  Truly amazing.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16643	3	/users/profile/18378	Shyam	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	one of the numerous projects under the umbrella of AIMS is the project to write to prisoners.  it was a heart felt experience to get to know the gentleman I corresponded withbeing a teacher of meditation I had some background in ancient Eastern thought my friend would always comment when he wrote back to me how some of the things I mentioned had really helped him in understanding wide variety of situations confronting his life in prison.   I heard of many succes stories from this project.  I really think a simple act of corresonding with the prisoners help many.  It help me become very symphatetic to their plight.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16642	3	/users/profile/18377	Ammaschild	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	If you go to Amma.org and click on donations there are 28 charities listed that you can choose from to make a donation. Amma has started each of these and continues to keep them running smoothly. Every penny donated goes to the charity. The money given goes farther than expected due to the fact that these charities are run mostly by volunteers that come from all over the world to work for Amma. Amma herself is the inspiration for this selfless service. She spends her life giving to others and has done so since her late teens. She has given blessings in the form of a hug to many millions of people around the world and continues to do so every day. She averages more than 8+ hours a day giving hugs with her greatest session being 23 hours when she hugged 45,000 people without a break on her 50th birthday. Has there ever been a person who continuously gives so tirelessly to so many?
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16639	3	/users/profile/18375	dragonfly4	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Today I listening to a recent BBC radio report and again it came up that when seeing an organization like this, some people misunderstand and are suspicious, they comment that it is like a slick business machine and makes so much money. So to set the record straight. Yes it is slick. It is slick because of all the hundreds of thousands of volunteers all over the world who are so inspired by the founder, Amma's selflessness and compassion in caring and serving the poor, suffering and in need, that they want to give their time, skills and energy to help for nothing in return. Many of these people like myself are professionals.This is unique in today's world, to have an organization on this scale that is run totally by volunteers. So there is no ciphering off of donations to pay wages, in fact donations increase in value as all the volunteers put in their time and skills. So rarely is anything done for good will alone in our society, and that is what makes the Mata Amritanandamayi Math so different and outstanding. It is hard to believe for some, but is proof that it is possible, and that there really is hope for the suffering and something really can be done.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16631	3	/users/profile/18366	Parvati	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	When Amma sets out to do something it is done. Her recent campaign was to help provide scholarships for 100,000 Orphans in India who either have lost one or both parents in the farmer suicide epidemic. When one donates to her they know their money is going directly to the cause.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16626	3	/users/profile/18362	Babaloo	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma is an exceptional humanitarian and spiritual leader who has received a multitude of awards for her hard work in promoting selfless service for the poor and suffering in the world.  I met her in 2003 and she has changed my life.  She taught me the value of selfless service and how to connect with the self in meditation.  In LA, we have many local activities that help the community including feedings and sock drive for the homeless, Green friends (promoting environmental conservation and awareness and organic gardening), Disaster and Emergency preparedness trainings.This is a great organization!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16621	3	/users/profile/18358	Amrita	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	To Whom It May ConcernHi. I'm part of the New York Satsang for Amma and have been for about 10+ years. In this time I have been witness to so much generosity and love an outpouring of giving from Amma's Charitable organizations, too helping farmers get back on there feet and transition in hard times to building homes, communities for the families displaced by the Tsunami. Amma's hospitals, schools for young and old alike are staffed by the most heartfelt professionals giving of their time and care in Amma's service. Here in the United States i have been part of Monther's kitchen preparing and serving the homeless here a delicious meal and sharing in that meal together in Amma's spirit of hope. When Amma comes to New York i volunteer at the Seva desk with other devotees and we help people sign up for volunteer shifts. When Amma comes for retreats and public programs there are alot of jobs to fill. These opportunities of service range from chopping veggies to caring for children, dining hall clean up and we all get a chance to be a part of making it work. People from all different walks of life and cultures who have never met come together in a giving spirit ready to help in any way without any ask in return. Thankyou for giving me the opportunity to speak sincerely of some of my experience. In Amma's serviceAmrita
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16619	3	/users/profile/18357	cabbate1	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I have volunteered for Mother's Kitchen in New York City. The soup kitchen is an integral part of the lives of many homeless and elderly people in New York City. The food is amazing top quality food and musicians from the local schools often come to play while our guests are eating. The soup kitchen is just one small piece of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math's goal to strengthen communities and fight poverty.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16599	3	/users/profile/18341	Susan	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	For three years I have served as an instructor for Amma's Integrated Meditation. Many of the people I've trained have told me how Amma's meditation has helped them attain inner calm and cope with the problems of daily life more effectively. One woman has just successfully weathered helping her husband through stage 4 cancer, organizing medical needs around two pre-school children. He is recovering. She has found the inner peace from meditation indispensible. Another woman called me last week. She was in an auto accident when a truck hit her broadside. She attributes her lack of injury to her meditative calm that helped her respond safely during the impact.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16589	3	/users/profile/18331	Jivani	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi is one of the most compassionate and generous living beings who has ever lived. She has raised millions upon millions of dollars, and continues her fundraising efforts all the time, to donate to people in dire need. From Tsunami & other natural disaster victims to orphans to women & others who may otherwise be hopeless, Amma is constantly providing support and relief to make lives better. She is more than just inspiring to me and all her devotees, she is a life saver for many, and a life line for countless more.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16588	3	/users/profile/18330	VicJr	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I met Amma in the early summer of 2007 and moved into the first Canadian Ashram in the spring of 2008.Since then, we've made an organic vegetable garden, planted fruit trees, started a bee colony, conserved rainwater for the garden, and started Komputerz 4 Kidz, a program that refurbishes old computers and donates them back to families that cannot otherwise afford one for their kids.All of this through the guidance of Amma and the MAM.When she visited us here in Canada this past summer (2009) she asked that we do something to help the elderly, and we are currently starting up Volunteers for Seniors, which will match the elderly with programs that they cannot otherwise afford.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16584	3	/users/profile/18326	jaigosine	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Amma's constant example of life in the service of others is all inspiring. It is truly a privilege to be given the opportunity to participate. Each month my wife, the kids and I attend Amma's Kitchen, where we are allowed to share in preparing a meal for those less fortunate than us.This year Amma gave us a tree to plant and it is our privilege to look after it.In so many ways Amma touches our lives by allowing us to touch others.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16582	3	/users/profile/18324	chetana	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	I am writing in support of the M.A. Math as a great nonprofit. I started donating to the M.A. Math's first charity in 1988 or 89, when they agreed to restore and revitalize an orphanage in Paripally, Kerala, which was in dire straights. I visited the orphanage several years go and was delighted to not only find the children well cared for but also quite happy and loving. The level of education there is so high that parents in nearby communities are clamoring to enroll their children in the day program.The number and diversity of the M.A. Math's charities has multiplied over the years, focusing in India on health, community welfare and education. The Math has also been quick to respond and rebuild in the face of natural disaster such as the Gujarat earthquake, the 2004 tsunami and the recent floods in Andra Pradesh. Amma has inspired many community projects in countries all over the world. I volunteer weekly at a soup kitchen, feeding the poor, and my partner writes to a man in prison, both projects sanctioned by the M.A. Math.I hope you will consider M.A. Math enthusiastically for your Indiya Shine award.Namaste, Chetana Knight
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16571	3	/users/profile/18313	kristen	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Doing service for the Mata Amritanandaymi Math is one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I am so impressed with the MA Math because of the ability to accomplish so much with limited resources.  The service opportunities range from participating in local food distribution programs to planning and organizing Amma's annual visit to one of the US Tour Cities.  Throughout every experience i am touched and in awe by the level of commitment, devotion, compassion and care exemplified by the volunteers in this organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16570	4	/users/profile/18312	sadams	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Since 1997, I have been an active volunteer for MA Math - both in India and here in the United States.  I have experienced first-hand the MATH's ability to respond quickly, efficiently, and with compassion to disasters such as the 2004 Asian Tsunami.  I personally coordinated 100s of volunteers who traveled to the MATH's headquarters in India in response to the Tsunami - helping cook and distribute rice to homeless villagers and government aid workers during the subsequent rebuilding and clean up months, and moving building materials to sites where the MATH was constructing 100s of new homes.  The inspiration that the MATH has given to these volunteers from around the globe is immeasurable.   I have also seen the looks of hope in the eyes of hundreds of underprivileged women who descend upon the MATH each month to receive a monthly stipend, as well as the joy of 1000s of children from all over the country who attend the 40+ education institutions run by the MATH - many who receive education stipends to help ease the burden of families in suicide-ridden farming villages.  The list is endless... Last but not least, MA MATH has inspired dozens of soup kitchens throughout the United States.  While living in New York, I helped coordinate the monthly soup kitchen which still serves well over 200 sumptuous meals to needed people.   Today, I help coordinate activities at MA MATH's US headquarters in San Ramon, California.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16557	4	/users/profile/18302	richards1999	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have seen the Mata Amritanandamayi Math charity services grow exponentially over the last twenty years.  It is one of the only charities that my husband and I have faithfully contributed to on a monthly basis because we know that nearly every cent goes directly to help those who need the help.  The Math is the essence of selfless service, practicality and efficiency.  Nothing is wasted and most of the labor is volunteer so the resources all go to those who need them.  They are the best!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16540	4	/users/profile/18287	Brenna	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritandamayi Math programs impact people in need all over the world, on many levels. whether it's Economic Development, by training poor women job skills to help support their families or making education available to everyone; From disaster relief, community outreach, providing healthcare and nutrition to those in need, no one is forgotten. I have given my time and energy to Amma's charities and also made monitary donations. I never worry that my money isn't going to those who need the most. I am greatful for the integrity of this organization and proud to support them.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16531	4	/users/profile/18281	Shivani	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I helped with and coordinated Mother's Kitchen in Sonoma County. Very rewarding experience. The first couple of years we served dinner once a month at a half way house for women. The next couple of years we served dinner once or twice a month at the emergency women's shelter. These events were the highlight of my month.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16529	3	/users/profile/18280	veit	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I have followed Mata Amritanandamayis work since 1998. In those days I donated towards homes She build and gave to the poor. I employed an engineer from India at the time and he confirmed to me that the houses build by Mata Amritanandamayi Math cost about one third of what they normally would cost. This is because most of the work is done by volunteers. How refreshing to be able to donate where $1.00 becomes $3.00 once it reaches the poor. Normally it is the other way around.Since then I have donated yearly and watched with amazement on what scope Mata Amritanandamayi developed her charitable work. Really, She has to be an extraordinary being. I am in total awe looking at her charitable activities unfold.With best regards,John BastianPresidentVeba-Dev Inc.90 Morgan Rd.Montcalm, QC         JOT 2V0Tel: 819/687-9021 Fax: 819/687-9926john@fermemorgan.com www.fermemorgan.com

Every thing cannot be valued based on the money spent.Apart from Humanatarian work Amma has provided and distributed LOVE to millions and has always expected PEACE which has lot of value but cannot be priced.You can SEE and FEEL that LOVE from AMMA(Mother) as though its coming out from our own mother.If every human has even .00001% of Amma's Love for others, then there will be LOVE and PEACE in this World.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16521	4	/users/profile/18273	MC Voorhees	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The MA Math the charitable foundation of Amma's efforts make positive impacts both locally and global through it's charitable efforts. Locally there are food and clothing for the needy through Mother's Kitchen, environmental restoration and education through Grren Friends. Internationally there schools, orphanages, medical care, tree planting, earthquake, flood and tsunami relief. houses for the homeless and assistance to widows. The list goes on and on.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16517	3	/users/profile/18269	Vidhya	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I knew about Amma about 10 years ago and have been following the Math's activities keenly. Where ever there's a need, they try to fill it. And the need is taken care of with so much love and attention that it makes everyone involved in the whole process happy. For instance, their vidyamritam scholarships, give out scholarships to poor children of farmers and see them through school and college. They recently brought all the children to the Math and conducted camps and gave them a feeling of belonging and happiness. All the children said that they had the happiest time of their lives. That is so touching.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16516	4	/users/profile/18270	6111948	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I came to know about this Non profit some 14 years back through one of my colleague. On my first visit to AMMA's Ashram in Kerala I learnt about what is service (seva) or selfless service . It opened up my eyes and I realised that up to what extent  we can go to do selfless service. My life changed after that and my thinking,my awareness and perspective of seeing things changed. Inspired by the selfless/humanitarian services conducted by the Math, I started helping sunami effected people around the Math,helping the flood effected people in Mumbai,helping poor students,old age people,poor and needy in my area both financially and morally. The organization is doing non profit activities in all fields like education,medical,free food and clothing for poor,hospices, orphanages,old age homes,constructing houses for poor,helping natural disaster victims,pension for widows,farmer relief etc. Each penny raised by donation/income is taken care to see it goes for humanitarian/charitable activities.Many poor and needy people have been benefited by this organization. They also help in creating awareness about nature by encouraging in preserving and protecting the environment, distributing saplings every year to encourage tree planting.The Organization is doing a tremendous job and many people have been inspired by this Nonprofit to do selfless service and I wish more people join this.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16515	3	/users/profile/18267	intheflow999	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	It warms my heart to be able to donate my time to Amma's work in the world.  I have tried in my lifetime to help those in other parts of the world who are in some kind of trouble -- and finally with Amma have found an organization I can trust to put the best interest of those being helped in first place.  Because there are so many donating their time and resources, whatever is donated goes STRAIGHT to the recipients.  And the Amritanandamayi Math meets not only physical needs, but emotional and spiritual as well.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16514	3	/users/profile/18266	nkk	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I was introduced to this organization by my wife and was impressed by the fact that this organization has been doing for the needy people.Tree planting in San Ramon hills to promote soil preservation and provide organic fruits/vegetables.Sorting out medical supplies and packing them to be distributed for the needy people in third world countires like Africa.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16511	4	/users/profile/18265	seolsen	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	What I find most inspiring about Amma's charitable work is that Amma leaves no one out.   She provides for widows and orphans, trains women so that they can earn money by sewing, helps the children of farmers who committed suicide by providing them educational scholarships, builds homes for those made homeless by the tsunami, and provides food for those in need on a daily basis.   And this is only in India.   In addition, there are Mother's kitchens designed to feed the homeless in major cities all over the United States.   Finally, when visiting Kenya last April, Amma found out about the large number of orphans due to civil strife.  She then established an orphanage so that these children can be well cared for.   Surely, these on-going humanitarian and charitable efforts are exceptional.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16502	4	/users/profile/18255	Rashmita	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2009	I became interested in the MA Center and the "Hugging Saint" Amma when I learned about the organization and Amma from a devotee. The experience I had was phenomenal! Amma hugged all who were in attendance and embraced and listened as each person came forward for their hug (myself included). The hug was magical; an experience to be had.The environment at the MA Center in San Ramon is serene, beautiful, vibrant and a real sanctuary. I enjoyed the scenery while my two year old son was delighted with the free open space. I and my baby were happy to be among people who appreciated and tolerated children in a  place of "worship". Accordingly, the food at the MA Center is something of an experience within itself! There were many vegan and vegetarian offerings and the service by the volunteers/devotees could not be matched by any high end restaurant. I recommend attending an event when Amma is in attendance to fully experience the joy of Amma.

I have volunteered with the group in San Ramon, California.  We collect and process donated medical supplies which are then shipped to the AIMS Hospital in Cochin, India.  The hospital was created by Amma's inspiration, and serves people in need with either low cost or free medical care.  It is state-of-the-art, even including open heart surgery.

I think this is unique among charitable organizations and is to be highly commended.  The sheer number of people who continue to be served is staggering alone, but that it's done almost entirely on volunteer effort and these volunteers are serving in a loving and compassionate way is just tremendous.

I went to get Ammas's blessings four years ago in New York City.  It was amazing to watch videos of Amma's charitable work and offering her blessings to people.  Amma transcends all physical boundaries, relegions and ethnic backgrounds of people.After you my visit with Amma, I left every time wwondering why can't world be a peaceful place like this with.

For example, raising $ to help victims of natural disasters like the flood in New Orleans.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16448	4	/users/profile/18205	kristen	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I love working with anything associated with Amma.  I've knitted items using "Plarn" - yarn made from plastic bags, and frequently work in local soup kitchens with a group associated with Amma.  Our local Amma group also picked plums from my orchard, and made them into chutney and jam to sell with proceeds going to her organization.Amma's overhead is very very little, and all when our time used for the purpose of fund raising, we know it goes to those in need, not adminstrative costs.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16434	4	/users/profile/18192	jenniferbluesky	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2009	This organization reaches literally millions of people in multiple countries around the world. It takes every dollar donated and multiplies its affect with services many-fold with volunteer efforts. It is not like other organizations where only a fraction of the proceeds make it to the end user they are intended for. It has very little overhead costs. Its founder still sleeps in a very minimal indian house and that is IF she sleeps at all! It serves in all areas with building schools, hospitals and homes as well as job creation for the poorest of people. It is magnificant and it is an honor to be both a receiver of the great gifts it offers as well as a participant in helping it to grow as to increase its positive effects in the world. I can't recomment this organization enoughJennifer BennettEugene, Oregon
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16429	3	/users/profile/18189	Arun	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	In Eugene, Oregon, the MA Math has had a soup kitchen for several years to serve the homeless people a warm meal each week as well as a couple of other service projects for troubled kids and after the tsunami in Asia, they raised over $10,000 in Eugene (with the help of followers, students and disciples of Amma). Recently, at the First Place Family Shelter, their Mother's Kitchen project served hot meals several weeks. Around Christmas time, they served mentally challenged and homeless clients at the WhiteBird Clinic.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16416	4	/users/profile/18178	AmmasLisa	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	My experience with Amma has been life changing for me.  There are no words to express how she and her organization have changed my life.  I will say that I left a high paying job about 1-1/2 years ago to work for a non-profit that serves the developmentally disabled at a much reduced salary.  I believe that I was led to this job and the opportunity was opened up to me due to Amma.  I work for The Brookwood Community...www.brookwoodcommunity.org.  This is due to Amma's example and her changing me, to realize that there are so many meaningful ways to serve in the world today.  And there is such a huge need, that she gave me the strength to leave "my comfort zone" and set out to work in a humanitarian organization.  I think there is not a single person or organization on the earth today that is doing more that Mata Amritanandamyi Math to serve the world.  This extraordinary example is so moving and inspiring -- that it moves us to be better in our lives and in our own communities around the globe.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16394	4	/users/profile/18165	deerskin2005	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	There is focus on respectiing the environment, minimizing our footprint as consumers and being frugal with organization resources we use so that there is very little overhead, and most of the contributions go to provide the services
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16389	3	/users/profile/18158	BKEPKE	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Over the last 22 years, I have contributed more time and money to M.A. Math's charities than to any others because more of my contributed dollars reach the actual recipients there than in other charities and because their charities are so broad in scope and effective in their results. To give one example, they built 6200 new tsunami-resistant homes in India and Sri Lanka and they were the first NGO to complete tsunami relief homes according to government standards. In addition to homes, they provided emergency shelter, clothing and food, having served 7.5 million meals to tsunami victims and even to the Indian army, which was helping in the relief efforts. Many other services were provided to the tsunami victims, including psychological trauma rehabilitation, education, vocational training and employment opportunities, financial aid, 700 new fishing boats to replace those lost in the tsunami, sponsored weddings, built an escape bridge over the backwaters connecting the peninsula of Alappad Panchayat with mainland Kerala and planted 100,000 trees on the beaches to minimize future tsunami damage & erosion. As a result of all these successful relief projects, the United Nations granted M.A. Math Special Consultative Status, enabling them to have direct collaboration with the U.N. in disaster relief. To find out more about disaster relief and many other charitable programs of M.A. Math, go to http://embracingtheworld.org/.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16387	4	/users/profile/18157	Tejaswini	Donor	5	10/19/2009	The Mata Amritanandamayi Math is one of the most amazing nonprofits functioning on this planet! I am continually astounded by the number of humanitarian aid projects that they are able to take on, especially since no one on the staff is paid! All of their projects in India, including free medical care to the poor, building homes for the poor, free weddings for the poor, an orpanage, an elderly care home, and so many more, are all run under the guidance of Amma, with 100% volunteer work. So amazing!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16386	2	/users/profile/18156	m.e.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The M.A. Math offers a vast diversity of programs: health care to the poor with a world-class hospital & auxialliary services, housing, orphanages, hospice, schools, disaster relief, pensions, and the list goes on. A unique factor of these projects is that many of the services are provided by volunteers - any funds raised go directly to support the intended recipients, not to support a top-heavy bureaucratic organization. In addition, because so much of the implementation is done by volunteers, the reach of a project is amplified immeasurably beyond the actual cost of the project.  And most significantly, the leadership and guidance behind these projects is designed to inspire all of us to serve our fellow man.  After 20 years of watching the growth of this extraordinary organization, my friends and I are now doing regular volunteer work on a local level to feed and clothe our own homeless community.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16375	2	/users/profile/18145	damiamma	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Ever since I met Amma in 2000, I felt a strong desireto help and be a part of her organization. I felt such love for her and what she was doing tirelessly and lovingly day after day...not only to help individualsbut people all over the world.I volunteered my talents to help with her tour publicityand the design of her collateral materials. It seemed like a small thing to offer her, but I feel happy to know that these materials reach thousands and help to bringthem to Amma. Thus helping others on an individuallevel and also a global level, when they too get involved.We all have talents to help and serve and Amma's organization gives everyone the opportunity to be a part, to serve the world selflessly. As Amma says, " The need of the hour is to cultivate a society of good hearted individuals." So I feel that not only am I contributing to society and the world as a whole, I am also growing and strenghtening as an individual, to be that "good hearted' individual the world so needs.I am so very, very blessed to be part of her organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16367	2	/users/profile/18135	thedawn	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have participated in Mother's Kitchen where as a group we prepare and serve lunch to whomever arrives in need of a meal.  In San Francisco there are many homeless individuals and many overall who are in need of a warm meal cooked with love.  The Mother's Kitchen volunteers provide this service and it is a real positive experience to see so many individuals walk through the line each week and receive a meal.  It is my understanding that Mata Amritanandamayi Math does charity work all over India in a diverse array of categories.  The website is entitled, "Embracing the World", and whether it is in India or in communities in the West Amma has inspired an enormous amount of people to do seva by her constant example of compassion and love to all.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16364	2	/users/profile/17878	maala nair	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	My involvement with MATH began in July 2004. This was the first time I had seen and met Amma and was blown away by the tremendous amount of work her organization has done and the unlimited areas it had reached. It finally dawned on me that even I, who has no money could still give to world and help others who are less fortunate than me.  All I needed was the right frame of mind and the desire to help.Amma, which means mother, literally dedicates every day of her life to consoling suffering people all over the world. In India, Amma is considered a living saint and throughout the world she is recognized as The Hugging Saint. Her message and compassion are expressed through a simple act  a loving embrace. She has been known to hug continuously for more than 22 hours and in the past 37 years, she has hugged more than 26 million people. She teaches by the constant example of her own life. The purpose of this body and of Ammas whole life is to serve her children, says Amma. Ammas only wish is that her hands should always be on someones shoulder, consoling and caressing them and wiping their tears away, even while breathing her last. Her teaching of love and selfless service has reached many countries and knows no boundaries. The only religion that Amma professes is the religion of love, by loving one another, we are able to reach out and alleviate the sufferings of others  Ammas devotees have been inspired by her work around the world. Her boundless compassion has taken the form of a growing international mission known as the MA charitable trust. In July 2005, the United Nations officially recognized the trust as a non-governmental organization and commended its efforts to serve the poor and suffering regardless of their ethnicity, social status, or religion. In 2002, The United Nations also honoured Amma with the prestigious Gandhi-King Award for Non-Violence. Other recipients include Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan.In 2004, when Tsunami hit the world, Ammas organization was one of the first to be in the forefront and assist those who were impacted by this tragedy. Amma has done what most governments could not do  she not only visited and consoled the victims personally but also helped them renew and rebuild their lives. From building homes, townships and even creating Tsunami babies; Amma has touched and reformed so many lives.  In 2005 this work continued and volunteers from all over the world were inspired to come and build houses under MATHs direction.In 2005, once again, Amma reached out to help victims of Katherina Hurricane buy donating $1 million dollars towards Katrina Relief to the Bush-Clinton to help rehabilitate the Gulf coast region.  Moved by Ammas compassion, AYUDTH Toronto collected funds to help children born with cleft lips perform surgeries.Ammas love, inspiration and unlimited love has also allowed me to help and contribute towards mankind. In Canada, Ammas imprints are left in the hearts of many charitable organizations such as The Georgetown Bread basket where volunteers cook and serve the needy, Love and Cry  where we donate items such as clothes for the winter to the inmates. We also conduct free mediation classes for inmates of local prisons and we have also planted trees in 3 main areas such as the Glen Rouge Camp Ground, Osprey Marsh and Fleetwood Park. Our youth volunteers also helped clean up the Glen Erin Park.  Amma inspires people of all ages, walk of life and her love and compassion knows no barriers or boundaries. This mothers arms stretches far and wide to bring love, compassion and comfort to all of us in this world. As Amma saysLove is our true essence, Love has no limitations, caste, religion, race or nationality. We are all beads, strung on the same thread of love. To awaken this unity and to spread to others that is our inherent nature  is the true goal of human life.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16303	2	/users/profile/18093	Manorama	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I serve Amma during Her tours of North America (Summer and Fall). My job is to run Amma's raw food store named "Nature's Joy." Amma started this store through us (a team of 4 disciples of Amma) to meet the need of Her devotees who were having trouble eating cooked food. Over the last five years (2004-2009) we have served Amma joyfully amidst back breaking schedules and intense tour work. But there is so much joy and satisfaction in contributing to Her worldwide charities (by raising funds through Nature's Joy) as well as attending to the immediate need of Her children in USA (serving the raw food through Nature's Joy). There have been amazing real life stories of selfless contribution by Nature's Joy team. And they have been inspired by Amma's selfless demonstration of reaching out to all those who come to see Her. Her tireless efforts without caring for Her own needs have motivated many of us to go beyond our comfort zones and put forth our unimagined best. In the process many wonders have come forth.In Amma's organization, most of the work is contributed by volunteers. So when we donate one dollar, it's value increases way beyond one dollar because of the volunteers. Nothing gets deducted from the dollar due to almost negligible overhead and management expenses. Instead, the intense efforts added by each volunteer adds much more to a dollar donated. This is one of the secrets behind so many projects being accomplished by Amma's organization.Amma is a saint beyond comparison who inspires by walking the talk. They way She touches the hearts of Her children, inspires them to give back to the best of their abilities. The result is amazing and unimagineable synchronicity and success in reaching out to those in need :).
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16300	2	/users/profile/18090	Parvati108	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	May everyone in the world have a chance to experience the warmth, breadth and grace of Ammas (Amritanandamayai) unconditional love put to action, through her far reaching charitable activities. Amma not only talks the talk, but walks the talk. Since I first met Her in 1993 in Kerala, while I was traveling in India, I have seen people all over the world touched by Her ability to put the words she teaches into action and inspire us to do the same. She calls all of us to live our greatest potential by filling our hearts with love and expressing it in all we do. Amma is the living example of love in action. Tirelessly and fearlessly, Amma has built an international organization that serves those in need. Through economic development, she empowers women through self reliance education and employment. To date, over 3,000 women's self-help cooperatives have already been established, each one 20 women strong. Ammas programs provide microfinancing, having helped to date 1,500 co-ops expand their businesses, benefiting 30,000 families.Education for everyone is proven to be the most effective means to eliminate poverty. Recently, Amma launched an initiative to identify and sponsor 100,000 talented but economically strapped children belonging to desperately impoverished agricultural communities. Ammas organization offers 75-l00 scholarships to each of the 53 highly competitive Amrita Vidyalayam schools run by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math throughout India.Amma is quick to respond to natural disasters, having provided $46 million tsunami-relief project. Amma has helped heal the damaging effects of cyclones, Bihar floods, Hurricane Katrina, earthquake in Kashmir to name a few.Amma builds homes and renovates slums. To date, more than 40,000 homes have been constructed in more than 60 locations across the length and breadth of India.  She cares for the children in India, in Africa. At present, Ammas organization feeds more than two million people annually throughout India. Ammas volunteers in 40 cities throughout North America prepare and serve 73,000 meals a year for the homeless and hungry. Since 1998, all the healthcare institutions run by Amma have provided more than U.S. $50 million worth of free medical care; more than 1.2 million patients received completely free treatment.In community outreach, Ammas organization provides financial aid for widows and victims of pverty and disability; cares for the elderly; sponsors weddings for the poor; provides hospital visits and meals on wheels; reaches out to those in prison including meditation courses. Since 2001, Ammas organization has planted more than 1 million trees globally. I feel so blessed to be able to interact personally with such a great spiritual and humanitarian leader. I know wherever I may be, she is always with me, showing me the way. It is Gods Grace that Amma is here to teach us the way to truly love.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16279	2	/users/profile/18072	Jayanthi bhaskaran	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma is the greatest humanitarian of our times. This petite lady with her boundless love and selfless service has touched the hearts of millions of people across the globe from all walks of life. She came into my life in the year 2000 and has changed my whole attitude towards all those that are less fortunate than I am. Ammas work speaks for itself. Here is a lady who comes from a small fishing community with very little education that has accomplished more in twenty years than many rich philanthropists and governments with a lot of resources have accomplished in many more years.I personally am involved with the Amrita Kuteeram  -the charity started by Amma for helping provide homes and a livelihood for destitute women. Our Center in San Ramon has bake sales every week, the proceeds of which go towards this cause. Amma is a true living example of this famous quote by Mahatma Gandhi You must be the change you wish to see in the world.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16275	2	/users/profile/18069	marie	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math continues to actively serve others selflessly in all aspects of the community around the world. Ammachi Herself is the living example of the embodiment of selflessness. I have watched Her from 6.30pm to 10.30am the next day sit & give darshan to thousands of people without resting, stretching, taking a bathroom break, eating, or yawning. She looks as fresh at the end of it as in the beginning. She does this around the globe tirelessly offering Her shoulders & embrace for everyone to find comfort in. Her Math has contributed millions & millions of dollars to catastrophes around the world. At Her ashram in Kerala, India & in San Ramon the ashram doors are open to everyone where they are served lovingly & humbly.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16256	2	/users/profile/18049	KS in San Diego	Former Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	M.A. Math has been providing an incredible range of services--some are health, education, housing, meals, counseling, hospice, disaster relief--to all ages and locations for almost 20 years. I have watched as these programs grow each year, incredibly through the efforts of thousands of volunteers and under the constant and loving supervision of Mata Amritanandamayi. I have visited the ashram and several schools in Kerala, and the tertiary care hospital in Cochin, and seen first hand what is being accomplished. Anyone would be greatly moved, inspired and astonished to see how everyone associated with all these projects is so practical, so efficient, and yet so personally caring.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16242	5	/users/profile/18029	Janine Melzer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi) has been the single most influential person in my life. Her efforts to relieve the suffering in the world are non-stop and come from a place of pure love and selfless service.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16238	2	/users/profile/18026	ammayudemakal	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	In 2006 I met Amma in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This meeting changed my life forever. In my lifelong search for God and unconditional Love and light in the world I finally found a person who exemplifies the profound power and Truth of the essence of Love, unequivocally. The effects of this inspiration continue to unfold in my life and it is important for me to continue to see Amma for guidance and support...and to experience that feeling of unconditional love that is so rare in this world now. Besides many enormous financial contributions to many countries worldwide, besides housing initiatives, free marriages, schools, education, besides hospitals, emergency disaster relief (such as 1,000,000.00 for hurricane katrina), besides free food for the homeless (an initiative in which i now also volunteer), besides letters of hope and love to prisoners, besides all of this and more-the m.a.math organization makes it possible for everyone in the world to meet Amma and experience the awesome power of love that we all intensely desire.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16189	2	/users/profile/17984	HariLarry	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I don't know of any other charitable organization that is as wide-raanging as the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, also known in the USA as M.A. Center or Mata Amritanandamayi Center. These are the various charitable organizations started and inspired by Amma Amritanandamayi.The work includes free hospitals for the poor, orpahnages, and schools to educate people from grade school career training in computer technology.   In addtion, Amma has built houses for the victims of the massive Asian Tsunami, fed them, and given clothing and temporary shelter as well. This organization helps victims of earthquakes, floods, fires, etc. as well as supplying spiritual inspiration to millions worldwide.Here in the U.S. when Hurrican Katrina devasteated New Orleans, Amma's charities donated a million dollars and were recognized for their efforts by the Bush/Clinton Katrina fund. Closer to home, I personally have been volunteering in Mother's Kitchen here in New York City, a branch of the M.A. Center charities that helps feed the urban poor with large nutritious dinners every month
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16178	2	/users/profile/17975	ramyavenkat	Donor	5	10/19/2009	It is very difficult to put in words the enormous effort this organization is doing for Human Kind. From infants to adults, to all the poor and the orphaned, they are there for everyone. When the Tsunami hit both in India and in the US, this organization went day and night without rest to get people's life back on it's feet. Provided houses in India and shelter and food until the houses were ready to move into. All of them were trained in new fields to help them start life fresh. Their state of the art Hospitals cater to the poor and the underdog.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16159	2	/users/profile/17963	Karuna	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I met Amma in 1989.  At that time she was just starting her first charitable project, an orphanage near Trivandrum.  Since then her projects have multiplied at a rate that defies belief.  There are so many projects- hospitals, clinics, housing developments, disaster relief, orphanages, colleges, grade schools, technical schools, environmental projects, etc.  When people are near Amma, their hearts open and they are inspired to help.  The result is awe inspiring.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16132	2	/users/profile/17943	blissedout	Board Member	5	10/19/2009	The work experience at this organization has been really pleasant and fruitful. Most of the people in this organization do not sit and talk. They walk the talk. I had the opportunity to serve in a soup kitchen organized by this organization and that's how I got involved. The people were really friendly and got to know them better. I was amazed to find out that this organization took part not only in one particular activity, but many including disaster relief, protection of environment, children's education,women's rights etc. The founder Mata Amritanandamayi, a woman is exceptional. Truly enjoyed working as a volunteer and as a board member.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16127	2	/users/profile/17937	m55r1	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I've been involved with this org since 1996. I had the opportunity to be in India for a year.I came face to face with tsunami victims who were helped by the org.Homes were rebuilt for them and right after the tsunami hit, all the victims were given shelter and food until they were able to move back to their dwellings. I've also seen the Gujarat earth quake survivors. 5 villages were adopted by this org and homes built for them,which even the Gov was finding hard to do. Few of my friends were volunteers in that project.I have had opportunities to  meet and talk with so many people who have been and still are receiving free medical aides from the AIMS, a super specialty hospital in India.And here in Seattle, I'm part of the voluntary group that runs the Mother's Kitchen --feeding the homeless.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16117	2	/users/profile/17929	Bhadra108	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I met Amma in 1995, and after seeing Her in action, have supported Her charitable projects every year.  I feel good about not only volunteering my time to support these projects, but also my money.  Much unlike other organizations, I know exactly where my money goes.  It does not pay for anything other than the necessary supplies for the project.  Amma's devotees donate their time and expertise for each project, so there is no bureaucratic red tape to sort through - hence allowing the money to go directly to the cause.  I very rarely ever donate to any other cause because I know that my money is well spent with Amma.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16116	2	/users/profile/17928	Devanath108	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	During the past 13 years, I have seen what Amma has done with donations to her many causes. Without a doubt, the money I've donated has been put to extremely worthy causes. I'm experienced this on a personal level as well from the various donations I had the priveledge of submitting. I highly encourage everyone to support Amma's efforts. You will gain immensely as will those who receive your contributions!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16109	2	/users/profile/17923	amma'smolu	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I'm personally 150% !!! convinced that every penny of my money donated goes to a good cause without being wasted or filtered for unworthy reasons ,which is very unlikely of other organisations wherein the money is filtered  at different layers before it reaches the bottom level(poor &needy;).         This is because Amma is a living classic example for love and selfless service, inspired by seeing her we can see all her devotees involving at all the levels doing how much ever they can.In the process we can see even  physically handicapped,poor daily wage workers and children(piggy bank money)lending their hands in their own little way to help others. With AMMA's grace and everybody'sselfless service not a single penny is wasted.        In short AMMA has a big crowd around her not because of money,but people coming behind her for LOVE.This is the best logical reason which keeps me inspired to do my money,physical and mental donations everything to AMMA's charitable work.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16095	2	/users/profile/17913	Rasmi	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	In 1994 I went to India to check out Amma's organization and to see first hand what I was contributing my money and time to. I found out that she is the real deal, and continue to give to her organization regularly. Her efforts have multiplied exponentialy since my visit in 1994. There is a lot of info about her and her humanitairan efforts if you are looking for more details. check amma.org. Rasmi
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16079	2	/users/profile/17896	Penina	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Whenever I volunteer for Mata Amritanandamyi Math, I see the difference in the faces ofthose who receive immediately.Whether it be a plate of food, a question answered, or a monetary contribution, I know that it will go for the highest good.Or helping someone who is handicapped who needs a place to sit, any action. Whether it be grand or small
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16075	2	/users/profile/17891	Carolyn Peck	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Chopping vegetables, serving meals while chanting a mantra, to an endless stream of people who have been bathed in love helps me see all people everywhere as equally worthy. Always I am helped by Amm's unending stamina and attention to all of us.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16068	2	/users/profile/17886	vpnair1	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2009	Amma runs a great organization which includes orphanages, schools, colleges, medical colleges, hospitals. She built homes for the poor, rebuilt whole villages when earthquate hit Gujerat. She was in the forefront to help people to move people to safe place when tsunami hit her village in 2004. She built houses for thousands of families hit by tsunami in India and Srlanka. Her charitable organization is the first to reach when floods hit various parts of India. This is in addtion to giving individual consolation to millions of people all around the world. She is amazing. There is no one equal to her in this generation.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16053	2	/users/profile/17874	Bindu	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I enjoy working for this organization, where everyone puts the cause ahead of themselves, following the example that is set by the founder of these charities. In cooking and serving food to the hungry, in helping the needy, in doing community projects, the charity leads the way in serving the people of this planet without any discrimination, without any expectations and without any pre conditions.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	16049	2	/users/profile/17872	jyoti	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	For the last 10 years I have volunteered the Mata Amritandamayi Math during their North American tour. I have traveled all over the country working in the kitchen preparing food for the large number of people (up to 8000) who come to see Amma. Every year I am impressed by the comittment and intensity shown by Amma toward a hugh range of people that are on the edge either physically or emotionally. The integrity of the fund dispersement, the unlimited compassion and the other volunteers committment is heartening. Even when there is not enough money (and there never is to help everyone) Amma still has the unlimited compassion to comfort EVERYONE who comes to her. Phenomenal in todays world. Whether it is a fire in the kitchen, a tsunami in Asia, earthquakes in India, children of farmers who commit suicide or an individual who is having a miscarriage, Amma is always there. It is been the greatest grace to be able to volunteer for the MA Math. Thank you
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15997	2	/users/profile/17824	manasvini	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I met Mata Amritanandamayi in 1990 with my husband.  I have been totally amazed at the extent of Her humanitarian efforts world wide through the Mata Amritandamayi Math (MA Math) especially in India.  The help that the MA Math has provided is endless, and continues to grow.  Our family travels to India each year and has been able to witness, first hand, volunteer efforts.  After the tsunami we helped the MA Math rebuild some of the homes in a small village.  Every day we would carry bricks one at a time to the area where the houses were to be built.  The MA Math did not give up on these people and organized these efforts until the houses were built. We visited an orphanage that was at one time completely falling apart and the MA Math took it over to help the children.  Today this orphanage is thriving with happy children.  In a country where resources are limited, I am amazed at the organization of the MA Math to facilitate the endless humanitarian work.  Whenever there is a disaster, the MA Math is there to help within hours, whenever there is a need, the MA Math is there to help!   Because of Mata Amritanandamayi all of this is has been possible.  The MA Math efforts know no boundaries.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15985	2	/users/profile/17811	g1light	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have been blessed to be in Mata Amritanandamayi's presence for 6 years now. I have personally received more than 60 hugs from Her and have been humbly allowed to do seva in many different locations. All the time I have spent giving my efforts to Amma's cause is amazingly refreshing and illuminating for me. I am a devote follower of Ammachi mostly because I experience all of the goodness that emanates from her and all of her activities. May we be blessed with Her Divine Presence and continued efforts to help humanity for the next 1000 years. Jai Ma!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15982	2	/users/profile/17810	Gati	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The humanitarian work of this foundation is simply astonishing. Because everybody is a volunteer all the donations and money that it is collected through different events fully go to the people in India who need it most. The MAM has a multispeciality hospital in Cochin to provide healthcare to everyone- I was treated there once and I felt so well taken care of-, as well as care homes for children, and programs for house and slums renovations. It also provides free food to millions of people in India and moves fast when a disaster hits sending volunteers and money to the affected areas (its work on the tsunami relief efforts was crucial).I like to work with them because I feel that whatever I may do- even if little- has a huge value and impact in others (and within myself). There is also much joy around the work and that always reminds that every drama or sadness in life can be faced with a smile, and why not?
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15944	2	/users/profile/17772	srikala	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma is an incredible force in this world.  There are no words to truly fulfill who She really is, what She has done and continues to do.  And this is because She is felt through the heart of millions of people.  Amma is someone who brings tears to someone's eyes just by Her mere presence.  Her Love that She exudes is enough to heal the individual.  Her Love is so great, in fact, out of this world (quite literally) that She can continue to embrace every individual for 12 to 16 hours straight almost everyday for the last 30 plus years.  Millions of people have been dramatically changed for the better all over the world.  Great and true leaders of this world change the world quietly and humbly, not causing any commotion or attention.  It's not just the love that Amma distributes, although that is what She does best.  Amma has contributed financial support during disasters, She has built orphanages, hospitals, schools and many other charitable organizations around the world.  She is quite literally SAVING the world.  I have tearful eyes just saying these things and so do millions of people.  She is truly a God in human form who came to help lift our humanity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15923	2	/users/profile/17755	servewell	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I first heard about Mata Amritanandamayi in 1995 and went to see her on the same evening in a hall where she was hugging people. Ever since then I have been devoted to her and have participated in the activities of Amma's Centre and later, her Ashram in Melbourne. My small contribution has been the buying and selling of flowers when Amma comes to Melbourne to donate to the charitable activities of the Amritanandamayi Math. I also started propagating plants and selling them to raise money for Amma's charities.In 1998 I accompanied an Indian lady on a tour of Southern India, On the way from Caimbatore to Cochin we passed the beautiful Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (the Institute of Technology)while leaving Coimbatore and then we passed the site of the AIMS Hospital where construction had aleady started.In 2003 I attended Amma's 50th birthday celebration.Then I had the opportunity to visit the hospital. I am a doctor and I was very impressed with what is being done there for the impoverished members of society in India who would otherwise have no medical help at all. It is a marvel that Amma was able to inspire so much compassion that such a hopital could be built and be fully functional in such a short time when it was funded by charitable donations and the work of so many volunteers.I also delivered to Amma the Melbourne community's gift to her, which was the funding of 207 pensions for her pension scheme for widows and disabled people. I saw many of the pink houses that Amma had built for the homeless. Most of all I was impressed with the gratitude and love for her that was shown by the people living near the ashram in Amritapuri. To me that was convincing proof of Amma's and the ashram's respectful and helpful attitule to those people.Everytime I read about Amma's new charitable initiatives I realize that there probably is no otherh charitable not for profit organization that has a broad agenda as Amma's. Her vision embraces everything from the communication satellite, to an India wide television station aimed at giving a good values education, to environmental concerns, her project for preventing suicide in farmers, disaster relief , education, medical help, upliftment of women and so forth, too numerous to mention here. Amma is also very thrifty and the whole enterprise is likely to be the most cost effective NGO in the world.The disaster relief when the Tsunami struck impressed me not only with it's extent and swiftness of response, but also with the work that was done to help the survivors to regain some acceptance and peace of mind. NOtable here was the fact that Amma started taking children to swin with her in the sea to help them overcome their fear. also, the use of poetry and music therapy to help the people to create moving songs about their experience so s to facilitate emotional agreaction. I am a psychiatrist and Amma's work in this direction really impressed me. I am so glad that I came to know about her and though I donate to several charities, Amma's is always first on my list, as I know that each dollar that I give will go further.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15913	2	/users/profile/17744	arcenabled	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The hard work that people do for Amma is made to feel almost effortless, you are usually surrounded with lots of smiling faces and people full of love and a hunger for helping.I can remember working in the kitchen, specifically in the dishwashing area, hot water steaming up my glasses, lifting huge pots and scrubbing out caked-on lentils, and just having a wonderful time.  Cleaning out the drain full of filthy water felt easier than ever before, because of the support of other workers, and the knowledge that together we were doing our small part to help Amma raise awareness and funding for all of her wonderful charities.  And Amma leads by doing.  She barely sleeps, rarely takes breaks, she works harder than any one of us... we can only imagine where she gets the strength and energy, its a site to behold.  And she is best boss, for she never instills feelings of guilt for not doing enough, just feelings of joy and a yearning to help in any way we can.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15908	2	/users/profile/17740	elizof9	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma's humanitarian work is both global and continuous. Daily, she works tirelessly to ensure that children, poor families, the downtrodden and oppressed find comfort in the practical help that Amma offers. Amma's charitable arm, The Embracing the World project, provides assistance,in India and worldwide, in the following areas:    * Economic Development    * Education for Everyone    * Disaster Relief    * Homes & Slum Renovation    * Care Homes for Children    * Fighting Hunger    * Healthcare & Nutrition    * Community Outreach    * Green Initiatives    * ResearchI remain impressed and humbled to be a witness to Amma's generosity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15901	2	/users/profile/17734	Valentinus	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have participated in Mother's kitchen in Portland, Oregon, USA for several years. We cooked and served a hot meal to a permanent homeless encampment on the outskirts of town for  a couple of years until they became self-sufficient, and now we serve about 300 free dinners twice a month at Blanchet House, a rescue mission downtwon.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15875	2	/users/profile/17715	gianluca	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math organization provides help to the most vulnerable communities in India, including children, women and aids-infected population. Its work is conducted by volunteers all over the world and focuses on 10 main areas of service:  women empowerment, economic development, education, disaster relief, healthcare, environmental preservation, care homes for children, fighting hunger, housing for the poor, helping local communities.My most direct experience as a volunteer has been with regard to the ASHIS- Amritanandamayi School for the Improvement of Speech and Hearing in Trissur, Southern India. I visited the school myself in India: it serves 130 children from poor families, and offers a wonderful program allowing these children to develop the ability to communicate and thus integrate to society. The system used for the teaching is imported from the Netherlands, and consists in the use of hearing aids that allow the children to hear and thus to learn how to speak, listen to music, dance, etc. I was very much touched by the love and dedication that permeat all aspects of the curriculum of ASHIS and the warm rapport between teachers and students. Finally, I was very much impacted by the high level of dedication and commitment of the Principal of the school, who has created a wonderful family environment for ASHIS. I would greatly encourage to support and disseminate the humanitarian work of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math Organization. Many thanks!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15873	2	/users/profile/17710	mscdevi	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I missed the Tsunami in India by a few days. By the time I got there Amma had already mobilized her volunteers to provide, shelter, food, clothing to those who had lost their homes.  Amma herself had waded into the water and had directed people on what to do to help, immediately after the tsunami had subsided.Even more touching were the steady stream of people who had lost a loved one, a father,a husband, a child, coming to Amma for consolation. Amma and the other volunteers were there supporing the families when the mass cremations were performed.Later, to help the young children get over their fear of water, Amma and other volunteers taught swimming lessons to the children.Her ashram was turned into a huge childrens camp to give the children some joy a few weeks after the Tsunami . It is amazing to see the volunteers, inspired by Amma's service, do selfless service for long hours day after day.They receive no compensation except the joy of serving others as they have seen Amma do. I have seen this in India and the USA.The list of her service organizatioons go on and on. Hospitals,orphanges, schools, building houses for the poor and Tsunami and earthquake victims. I have worked along with thousands of volunteers, helping in many ways, when she comes to the USA twice a year, to make sure the people who come to see Her are fed, housed,and that their visit is comfortable. It is always the highlight of my year and I know countless others to be able to serve in whatever way grand or small. Amma's tireless service to others has inspired sooo many others to try to do the same, within the organizaion and in their private lives.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15869	2	/users/profile/17704	Gaurav	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have been fortunate to have been involved with the "Mother's Kitchen" project in Seattle, USA. We serve about two to three hundred homeless people on the streets once a month with a wholesome Sunday morning breakfast. The homeless people who come to our meals are extremely hungry since they have not eaten well for several days together. Seeing them appreciate every small bit of food so much inspires us even more to reach out and help those in need.Our individual spirit of selfless service has steadily grown, and our lives feel enriched on account of being able to help those who are less privileged than we are and have no where to turn to for help or support. It brings tears to our eyes everyday and makes us more human. This is an activity that helps us at least as much if not more than it helps the homeless people we serve.Thank you M. A. Math for making our lives more meaningful!General comments:The MA Math is driven by the hundreds and thousands of volunteers across the globe who feel deeply inspired with every rising sun to contribute to alleviating poverty and suffering in society, and enriching the society we live in, in a multitude of ways.It is a known fact in India that whenever there is any natural calamity or disaster, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math is the first on the scene and remains there the longest when all other humanitarian organizations are long gone. You will hear the victims say things like "We have had cyclones for our whole lives, year after year, but no one has come and shown us so much love as the MA Math folks" (not exactly verbatim).When the Tsunami struck, Gujarat Earthquake victims who had been helped by Amma a few years ago, had gone over to Kerala of their own volition to help the Tsunami relief operations, as a sign of their deep gratitude for being helped during their own times of distress. Students from Japan and volunteers from all over the world have spent thousands upon thousands of free hours building houses under the centers Tsunami initiatives in India, inspired by Ammas towering example. Many more such rare instances of spreading Love and Compassion at a global level are visible through the MA Math's initiatives. The MA Math's dedication in its humanitarian services leaves an indelible impression deep in the minds of those who receive aid and compassion, it leaves the hearts of people touched beyond words.The MA Math is one of a rare breed of organizations in the world today that has inspired people to devote their time, money and energies towards making this world a better places in small ways and big ways, but more importantly in genuine ways that are always much appreciated by those who receive this grace. It has broken across all man made barriers of nation, culture, race, religion and sex. It has built itself upon an edifice of Love and Compassion that is completely all-embracing and universally accepting. No one feels left out, and no one leaves uninspired after getting involved with the MA Math for even a short while.I hope that the MA Math continues its wonderful humanitarian work across the globe and especially in the Indian subcontinent. With Best Wishes,Gaurav Navlakha,Seattle, USA.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15859	2	/users/profile/17695	Joshua Penman	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	MA Math feeds and houses and clothes and educates thousands of people every day.  I have seen the long lines of children receiving scholarships, widows receiving sewing machines, hungry people being given a meal.  MA Math does a lot for the downtrodden of India - they're the real deal.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15857	2	/users/profile/17694	Kam	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Visiting Amma and serving her charities for the past 7 years has given me hope in my spirit where there was once deep sadness, light in my heart which often seemed sad and brillance to my mind which was often my worst enemy.  I have spent months at a time traveling with Amma, watching her serve the needy selflessly. In all the moments of each hour, day and month, she has always given sincere blessings and support to people, expecting nothing in return. Her message of "love and service" is one that she herself is the highest example of always. She is one of the world's greatest fortunes. Kamlesh I Singh, San Diego, CA. USA.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15849	2	/users/profile/17685	apatil	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I have been devotee of Amma since year 2000. I have been really touched by numerous Humanitarian projects run by Mata Amritanandamayi Math. For years the organization has been helping poor, needy, orphans, elderly, widows and so on in India. Her selfless work motivated me to help poor and needy people
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15833	2	/users/profile/17671	atindra	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	My experience with Amma's work has been a great blessing in a number of ways, just to witness.  Amma is not shy of doing hard work and labor herself, stepping in and doing the physical work that many cannot or shy from doing, the dirty work.  Amma is the watchful eyes for many needy people throughout the world, giving aid to earthquake victims (Katrina) of both substance and human help through volunteers.  Amma continues to help the Tsunami victims in the same way with food, clothing, housing and work.  Amma has created organizations to work with destitute farmers in India to prevent suicides.  Amma has created many orphanages in different parts of India to help the children who have been cast away or have lost their parents and  families to disease, draught and unemployment.  Amma started "Mothers Kitchen" here in many places in the U.S. to help feed the homeless/poor.  There is no end to Amma's unending love and compassion for the whole world.  We are all Her children, and she is teaching us how to help each other, in every corner of the globe.  Is ther something Amma has not done?   Amma has saved a friend of mine from certain death, healing them of malignant cancer instantly, although, She takes no credit.  I hear these stories regularly, so much so, that it is "second nature" to hear of another miracle that Amma is orchestrating somewhere this planet earth.  May I continue to be a small splinter of the help Amma is around the world, by Creator's Grace.Sincerely,Atindra Gibbs,
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15832	2	/users/profile/17670	Arpana	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	MA Math was the main - possibly the ONLY - nonprofit organization providing direct relief to those in southern India affected by the 2004 tsunami.More recently, they are providing direct relief to the families of Indian farmers who have committed suicide due to their dire financial conditions, and they are working hard on education and prevention of suicides.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15829	2	/users/profile/17667	anupama0	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	When the earthquake struck Gujarat in 2001, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math immediately traveled to the area, not only sending mobile medical units but also undertaking the task of rebuilding two villages that had been leveled by the earthquake. I participated in some of the rebuilding efforts. This is just one of many, MANY charitable projects undertaken by the Math, under the direction of Amma. Eight years later, Amma's humanitarian activities are still growing and growing. I know of no other person alive today who does so much good in the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15827	2	/users/profile/17665	Connie	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi exemplifies service through her innumerable charities in India and abroad - hospitals, hospices, pensions for widows, orphanages, schools, universities, planting trees... the list goes on.  She has inspired many around the world to operate soup kitchens and other charities in their local areas, too.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15814	2	/users/profile/17652	CAgirl	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	The most remarkable thing about this organization is the work,selfless example and innovation of the leader, Amma.  She sleeps only a couple hours a night (if that much) and the rest of her time is dedicated to serving others through many different humanitarian projects (homes for the poor, disaster relief,schools, hospitals, widow's pensions, etc.).  I was at the ashram during the Tsunami.  I was amazed at how the ashram fed the villagers three meals a day for several months, provided clothing, rebuilt houses and boats, provided job training for men and women, and much more.  And the ashram was able to provide so much more than the Indian government was capable of delivering.  In the time it took the government to build one temporary building, the ashram was able to build ten.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15803	2	/users/profile/17644	Rajeshwari	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	There is sooo much to tell, where to start... Every week we sort thru boxes and pallets full of medical supplies that hospitals would otherwise have thrown to the dump. But thru Amma's Grace we pick them up from the hospitals, sort them, repack them and ship them in big container ships to hospitals in India and other countries to folks that need them.  What seva! It's awesome!  Then there is Mother's Kitchen which feeds the homeless in Berkeley.  I have had the good fortune to be able to serve meals to the many hungry people who line up for food.  When Amma is here, tens of thousands of people crowd in to see Her. I am blessed to me able to clean the bathrooms for Amma's many devotees. The Bliss I get from all of these sevas words cannot capture.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15793	2	/users/profile/17634	Sucheta	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have learned the deep value of compassion  from Mata Amritanandamayi (Amma).  Through Her example we all try to work tirelessly for the organization.  Every rupee was saved and used wisely for the good of the people.  After the tsunami Amma worked very hard and gave up many comforts (as did others) for the ones impacted by it.  There are many stories of Her efforts and here is one that shows her frugality  and conscientiousness.  There were many wet calendars that couldn't be sold.  Someone wanted to throw them away.  Amma Herself spread them each individually out to dry and the pictures were sold and the money was given to the poor.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15786	2	/users/profile/17628	Theobalti	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritanandamyi Math is involved in humanitarian service all over the world. I find the scope of the work and dedication & energy of volunteers amazing. The Math has free lunch programs all over the country and I have volunteered with the local one. I've also participated in the ongoing program of collecting medical supplies from various donors and sending them to hospitals in India where they are needed.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15781	2	/users/profile/17622	Joumana	Donor	5	10/19/2009	I have followed the works of the M.A. Math for about 10 years now and am still discovering new and amazing ways that this organization is serving directly the poorest of the poor. I just visited the mountains of Wyanat where an M.A.Math tribal hospital gives free health care to the farmers and their families.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15779	2	/users/profile/17620	AYC	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	My experience with the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has been truly positive.  This organization has done more for humanity than any other organization or governments that I have observed.  Case in point, the rehabilitation effort during the tsunami that hit South India was beyond anyone's expections.  The Math went beyond the boundaries of their state and country.  In addition their own town and state, they helped rebuild the neighboring state of Tamilnadu and went and helped the people in Sri Lanka.  This organizatons motivates its members to work within their own neighborhoods.  Here in the US we are inspired to feed the homeless on a regular basis.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15777	2	/users/profile/17618	madhu717	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	AMMA's non-profit organization is exceptional. I have been a supporter for over 6yrs now. Each year I am amazed at her ability to reach so many of the world's children. She has charitable hospitals, hospices, orphanages, and a University. She has generously given aid to those affected by natural disasters such as the Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and Earthquakes. She provides medical care, education, food, and homes for those in need. AMMA's organization is making a difference in the world. She is helping women, children, and those in poverty. AMMA inspires all of us to be more compassionate and loving. She encourages selfless service, volunteerism, and caring for our planet as well as, each other. With a vision like that and the marked success of her organization, it's no wonder that AMMA is a world leader!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15773	1	/users/profile/17614	anavekar	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math has been the best inspiration for me and has changed my life immensely. I am very touched by the strong influence of Amma that is instrumental for motivating so many people to engage in numerous humanitarian projects. Amma has set greatest example and this Math gives us platform to offer our whatever little services we can and show love the mother nature and people around us. The Math is currently planting hundreds of fruit trees; provides free food and medical services to so many people everyday. It has given me many opportunities to experience the amazing satisfaction of Giving! and Loving! in unique ways.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15770	2	/users/profile/17612	pyarelal	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have been serving the Mata Amritanandamayi Center since 1991. I have been involved in Humanitarian and Disaster relief work in India and here in U.S. Amma's encouragement and example of selfless service has expanded my life and heart. She is always finding more opportunities for us to serve. Watching others find joy in learning to serve from Her example has been a great gift to me.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15768	2	/users/profile/17610	Manikandan	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I normally visit NY and Detroit in the US when Amma visits these places. As part of that I have got several opputunities to do SEVA ( selfless service) by serving the devotees who come for Amma's darshan. I am not able to put into words the feeling of completeness and relief when I do such seva. All the donations and profits made are diverted to support the different charities and humanitarian activities around the world !
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15767	2	/users/profile/17609	heymaqua	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have visited the M.A. Math in Kerala, India a number of times. Each time I find the experience invaluable. It is truly a service orientated organization. On my last visit I helped tend the tulsi (holy basil) gardens, a part of the ayurvedic farm which is in conjunction with the ayurvedic college where many students are receiving a free education. The sense of unity that comes from harmonious work shared by people from many different cultures is unforgettable.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15765	2	/users/profile/17607	Tizzle44	Donor	5	10/19/2009	This is a wonderful organization.  I have read about all the charities in India and listened to Amma's words that we all should be doing selfless service. I was particularly inspired hearing about the Indian orphanage projects over the years.  This inspired me to start a foundation to start a girl's home in Tijuana recently (with Mexican partners).  I never would have thought about doing this and making the sacrifice and effort without seeing the example of Mata Amritanandamayi Math. So not only are children in India helped but it is spreading to other countries.

Also every month we conduct satsang meeting in our house and about 100 people from the local community show up to learn more about Amma's charitable activities throughout the world and ways of participating inn some of them. I have never heard or learned about a charitable organization which does so much without any selfish motivation. I am very happy to be a part of it.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15762	2	/users/profile/17604	vimala	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I love Mother's Kitchen! We could burritos for approx. 80 men who reside in a Men's shelter.I get so much from the experience because I put myself in their shoes which makes me a better person. I love interacting with residents. Some share their stories and othersask about "Mother" and how the group came to be. I see how are are all connected and how fortunate we are.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15760	2	/users/profile/17603	irene	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Amma's orphanage in Paripally, Kerala, India in Jauary of 2009.  The bright faces of the children, the activities available to them and their record of excellence both in academics and cultural achievements are very impressive.  At one time, before Amma took over this orphanage, this institution did not care for the children properly.  They were neglected both in their physical needs as well as their educational and social needs.  It was lovely to spend time with both children and educators in Amma's orphanage in Parpipally.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15757	3	/users/profile/17601	sitason50	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	This is a place where millions of people have gone to seek for help over last 23 years!

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15756	2	/users/profile/17600	davelewis	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Fantastic charity aiding many in India and abroad.  Monetary donations are amplified by much volunteer labor.  This is one highly effective NGO empowering many who were hopeless and saving many who were helpless.  Widows, orphans, those needing medical aid and food and housing,  After any natural disaster such as a tsunami or earthquake, they do better work than any government agency.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15747	2	/users/profile/17589	HappyLane	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I helped families and infirmed people find seating, wait through long periods of time and to receive kind treatment during the many programs that Amma conducts in North America. This kind of "waiting" on others really expanded my heart and capacity to have compassion for others as well as myself. The experience has caused me to scale back my work obligations and continue volunteering for many causes.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15744	2	/users/profile/17587	Diva Designed	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	One does not appreciate the true scope and breadth of Amma's Humanitarian projects until one visits India and sees just some of them in action.It is mind boggling.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15743	2	/users/profile/17586	Blessyou	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Extraordinary opportunity to contribute to valuable charitable work that Amma has launched... such as Farmers Suicide Relief Fund, Tsunami Relief, Katrina Relief, AIMS, Orphanages.It is truly wonderful to be able to contribute beneficially with time, resources and funds.  And to be sure that the proceeds go to the worthwhile charity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15738	2	/users/profile/17580	belden27	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I met Amma in 1996 for the first time, and knew immediately she was not an ordinary woman.  I had heard of her healing hugs, but didnt realize then the extent of her dedication to helping the poor.  Over the years I have seen her humanitarian work grow incessantly. From orphanages, to schools, hospitals, pension plans, hospices, homes for the elderly and many more.  In 2005, I was able to attend her 50th birthday celebrations in Cochin, during which more new social programs for the poor were inaugurated by Amma, such as legal aid and group weddings.  The Mata Amritanandamayi Maths effective relief work during disasters is outstanding, so much so it is now recognized by the UN.To be around Amma and to see how she is constantly finding ways to improve peoples lives not only on a spiritual level, but also on a very physical and practical level is such an inspiration. Being around Amma has also changed my life. It motivates me to be there for others even in small ways  a short visit or a phone call to an elderly person, listen to a young mothers worries, encouraging words to a coworker; and to participate in fundraising activities whenever possible.

No one person has such a broad scope of institutions and programs that help the people of India ranging from orphanages, soup kitchens, colleges, widow's pensions, job training programs, home building.  The  help after the tsunami in 2004 was immediate, massive and effective, ranging from medical services, shelters for the homeless, counselling, to feeding the homeless and rebuilding homes and fishing boats.  All of this done only with volunteer workers.

I have worked as volunteer in the organization. I got motivation to work as a volunteer after seeing Amma's humanitarian activities and the selfless service for the poor and needy. It is great source of inspiration to see many volunteers who work harmoniously with utmost dedication.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15708	2	/users/profile/17557	rajagursahani	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have seen Amma many times and have participated in her organizational events.  In that time, I have become quite close to her as of a result of my devotion to her.  She is an incredible woman who is making great strides in helping humanity heal itself from the pains of its existence, etc.  She has personally helped me with gaining momentum to my own healing and dealing with past scars that have affected me as a result of being brought in a bi-cultural environment.  I hope that Amma can continue her work and that she can be a driving force to bridge different humanitarian efforts so that humanity can function better for the future.

It provided me oppurtunities & platform to put my dream of helping the needy. MA Math definitely lives up to the ideal set up its founder "Mata Amritandamayi"  through selfless services & compassion. I have been inspired by all the workers who tirelessly work to put the universal ideals of love, compassion & selflessness into action. I am praying that this organization be able to more people & also inspire more people especially youth to understand the true meaning of selflessness & compassion
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15698	2	/users/profile/17551	Amma's Helper	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	My experience is preparing a monthly meal for the homeless sponsored by Mata Amritananda's charity Mother's Kitchen.  The people are so grateful.  We get donations from grocery stores and other businesses.  Everything is done by volunteers.  Picking up the donations, home-style cooking for 4 hours, transporting the meals to shelters and serving and cleaning up.  The energy of the service and the respect given to the homeless is touching, as is the outpouring of gratitude.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15695	2	/users/profile/17546	ammaskutti	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	AMMAs love and serve all teaching is followed by all of us. This is the only NGO I trust and know that it will definitely use every penny and every moment to serve those in needy. AMMAs teaching serve nature and to care nature and not to waste anything is very well observed with MATH. Whatever they do is nature friendly and filled with Love. Examples: Dish washing in their kitchens, making compost out of waste, Use only nature friendly items everywhere.Every purchase made at MATH directly SUPPORTS all the CHARITIY works done by MATH.I am a volunteer and I volunteered in dish washing, serving food, kitchen seva, medical supplies sorting, with AMMAs grace once in a while for there software projects.AMMA's organization has no area uncovered they always come up with creative, innovative projects which in turn help people in need and nature. Like Mothers kitchen, Circle of love, Green friends, tsunami relief projects providing free housing, feeding the poor, providing free medical needs, they have well equipped tele medicine bus that reaches places that got affected by floods, quakes and rural places where people cannot afford to see a dcotor. AIMS hospital in INDIA is the best example of for this. They even support orphanages, elderly homes, legal cell and disaster relief. AMRUTA schools are imbibed with spiritual values, human values and LOVE. MA MATH sponsors many children from low income families through VIDYAMRUTAM project. It has many charitable hospitals. It also helps prostitutes rehabilitation. MA MATH provides homes for poor and provides free medicines.   All the deeds they do help common people, poor, needy and they are the one among many who readily step forward without expecting any rewards and do it selflessly and with LOVE. Proceeds from this organization directly support all the charities it is involved. Even it lends its hand to help during hurricanes for instance during KATRINA.    AMMA herself is an organization who is embodiment of LOVE, HUMILITY, PEACE, SELFLESS SEVITE, PATIENCE, DEDICATED and KNOWLEDGE. She lives what she says and does what she says. Her DARSHAN itself is very clear example how she stays at one place for LONG HOURS and hugs everyone who has come to see her with same undeterring love, smile and energy and never ever judges anyone who comes to see her. Whoever comes across AMMA come out with peace and love and not to forget a smile.   We feel blessed to be part of this organization and thanks to AMMA for this.LOVE ALL SERVE ALL.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15687	1	/users/profile/17539	melitxu	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Through sheer love and inspiration, Amma and those at her ashram give food, shelter, education, health care and support to anyone who needs and/or seeks it.The ashram is exemplary in recycling and resource management.  Amma's direct and profound teachings of respect and love for the earth, one another and oneself changed my life and many of those I encountered in her presence.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15684	2	/users/profile/17538	cbonning	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	This amazing organization has helped out the needy worldwide by providing immediate help in times of crisis.  They did more than any other non-government organization following the tsumami in India, they contributed a million dollars to the Hurrican Katrina funds, they helps thousands of widows, orphans, and disabled/ill persons every year.  Led by Amma, a living saint, in my opinion, this group leads with love for all and really embodies the belief and practice of selfless service.  It is an honor and priviledge to assist this group.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15680	3	/users/profile/17534	n2amma	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I am a letter writer for M.A. Center for the Circle of Love Inside. There are countless humanitarian programs with the M.A. Math but this is the one that I am involved in. We write to those who are incarcerated in prisons and provide spiritually uplifting letters. For many of these prisoners, we are their only contact with the outside world. Most have been abandoned by friends and family having no one to visit them or console them. Our group send birthday cards-and we continue to write to those who write back providing pictures and cards so that they can feel connected to people. This is the first catalyst to change. Many write back in amazement that we thought of them at all and took time to write them. Most suffer greatly from depression and loneliness. This program helps to uplift them and provide a catalyst to change from within. For many prisoners, their perspective of life and the world changes just due to this small act of writing. Imagine if we wrote to all prisoners in prison-how much change there might be in the prison population. Please endorse the Mata Amritanandamayi Math for this award. Their work to uplift others in this and multiple programs from helping Tsunami victims and Americans suffering from hunger is nothing short of amazing.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15677	3	/users/profile/17532	barefootlotuss	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I have been involved with Amma's organization for over ten years.  I have pesonally experienced the power of her work with widows in India who she gives aid to on a periodic basis in the form of money for them to subsist on. . .these are women who are destitute having been turned out by their families for various reasons.  I recall being at the Ashram in 2000 and being moved to see hundreds and hundreds of women showing up at the Ashram to receive their assistance.  It was very moving.  At the wake of the Tsunami, Amma's organization jumped right in and began offering solace to survivors and her staff worked tirelessly rebuilding homes for people to live in.  After the earthquake in northeastern India it was Amma's organization who went in and began rebuilding.  And it was Amma again who pledged millions in aid for relief in the wake of the New Orleans Katrina tragedy delivering a check to Bill Clinton for the purpose.  Amma's NGO is unprecedented in it's use of unpaid, volunteer help to decrease costs and apply most of the funds directly to help others with no waste or use of funds for salaries.  She continues to expand her outreach around the globe, and to issues in India that span from Farmer's suicides, prostitution and homelessness.  She has many orphanages and schools and hospitals that are changing the future of Indian people.  MOst importantly, when Amma offers aid in times and to issues of need, she offers love. . not just resources. .. her love inspires the same spirit In those who work for her to serve her charities.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15676	3	/users/profile/17531	anthony.stropoli@gmail.com	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Hi,Thank you for this great opportunity to write in.  I have seen so many hands on activities provided by M.A. Math over the years.  The real concerns of the various groups assisted are addressed.  An example would be the Farmer's Fund for the families left by the suicide epidemic in South India.  M.A. Math provided sewing machines and well monitored scholarships to the children.  This approach offers long term solutions to these people in need.  Money is not offered in a one time way as most of the time organizations ask for donations, the money never reaches those it is intended for.  Solutions for the Tsunami Relief were the same.  M.A. Math provided immediate assistance with food and clothing and shelter and bathrooms for those affected.  Long term housing was then focused on and the community rebuilt.  M.A. Math is the only organization I donate most money to.  I believe and respect in the choices and way they carry out the various missions.  I am humbled and constantly in awe.  I hope this award is given to them for sure.  Thank you,Anthony Stropoli
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15674	2	/users/profile/17528	Lakshmi Lotus	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma has an exhaustive array of humanitarian projects to help the needy around the world. While India is her main focus, her volunteers also help other communities in need around the world.Amma has provided 10,000+ houses for those displaced by the Asian Tsunami, along with clothing, food and education so that victims can find work. Her focus on ensuring women are treated equally is remarkable. She has projects that train women to work in practical vocations that will help to financially support their families.Amma's hospital AIMS is a relatively new hospital, but has become one of the premier hospitals, research centre's and teaching universities throughout India and Asia. Her approach to free or subsidised health care for the poor has revolutionised health care in Kerala and Southern India. Due to the number of volunteers that work in Amma's charities, each dollar donated, is worth more like $1.50. The United Nations have credited Amma with being able to mobilise a large, well organised group of people to help with international disasters. Amma's charities are growing by the day, and will continue to offer emotional support, health care, food, clothing and basic necessities to the needy all over the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15672	2	/users/profile/17526	Jessilina	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Serving the homeless through providing a delicious cooked meal has been a valuable experience. The joy that we have experienced as a group and as individuals in acutalizing service to others has been wonderful. It is alot of work and yet it is very satisfying to help other people to meet a basic need such as a meal. This is a time honored tradition amongst the world's religions to help society through charity and service.

There are no paid positions and everyone is a volunteer.The Math has started the first pension fund for widowed women in India, where women now have dignity and a monthly check rather than being on the street.I was at the math during the tsunami 5 years ago.....almost immediately the  help began by setting up medical camps, shelters and food distribution for the homeless and bereaved.Emotional counseling as well as rebuilding villages and lives.ALL VOULUNTEERS!!! I have never seen anything like it!Ammachi Herself is the most amazing person.Every penny donated is goes to work for others.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15666	2	/users/profile/17521	anandadevi	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	How could an uneducated woman from a poor fishing village in south India ever show the world what has grown up around her...it is very amazing. It is from pure love.From the newly built orphanage in Kenya to the many Mother's Kitchen projects feeding the poor all over the world, to the orphanages, schools, clinics and the AIMS hospital in India, the projects go on and on. All provided by a total volunteer army of helpers following the example of selfless service to those in need, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, affectionaltely known as Mother as their example, Having visited India and the MA Math headquarters at Amritapuri, you would never guess the multitudes of humans who have suffered who have been helped. This organization has been building homes, training skills to those uneducated, providing higher education and medical assistance along with pensions for the elderly and infirmed very quietly for some time. The AIMS hospital in Cochin was built totally by donation and volunteers. It provides care to all who walk in the doors, trains nurses and doctors on the premesis and rivals any western medical facility. As an RN I was most impressed by the level of care and the attention to every detai.Having always been a sceptic and realistic when it comes to humans, I am pleased to say that after being around this organization for over 13 years I have never been disappointed. None of the monies raised go to administrators in fancy offices. Everyone volunteers and does it with great enthusiasm. All of the funds are distributed to those in need in many different projects form pensions to education. How many would think that thousands whould come to the facilities and donate hours and hours of time to serve others on their vacations...Well it happens at all of the MA Math projects wolrldwide.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15664	2	/users/profile/17519	RenaG	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	This is an amazing organization whose charitable contributions stretch around the globe.  I am personally involved with our local soup kitchen (Mother's Kitchen).  We serve a nutritionally balanced, vegetarian meal 1x a month to those are hungry.  We obtain food donations from some of the finest food establishments in the city.  The number of guests we serve is steadily rising due, I think, to the economic downturn.  We also provide food for guests to take home and gently used clothing.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15662	2	/users/profile/17517	divasjl	Donor	5	10/19/2009	In this organization, literally thousands of volunteers give of their time, their resources, and skills to make a difference throughout the world. Those in administration are unpaid devotees, who will give up their own food, even their bed, to help those who come to them for assistance.  It is one of the most amazing organizations I have ever known. Amma, the spiritual leader, spends time every day making bricks to help build homes, rather than meeting with famous people, even though she has been honored by many of them. I willing donate to them every month, because I know it goes directly to those in need.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15659	2	/users/profile/17516	Suzzanne8	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	Amma embraces the world.  She opened my heart and has helped me to reach out in literally every part of my life whether it is a thought, prayer, blessing or material necessity others might need.  She made the world make sense to me.  Amma has opened my heart to understanding that we are truly one.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15652	2	/users/profile/17508	ammasnishtha	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I was in India at teh Tie of the South asian tsunami, and I was staying in the Amritapur Ashram which is te headquarters of Embracing he World. Immediately within an hour) after the tsunami, volunteers went out to rescue victims of the tsunami, carrying the wounded and trmatized to Amritapuri and across the backwaters to safety and medical care. By evening, everyone was housed, fed, and receiving medical care if needed.s food came in, vlunteers prpared it to fee the refugees.\. As clothig donations came in , volunteers sorted and distributed it. By the time I left to return t work in America,3 weeks after the tsunami,temporary housing had already been built for the villagers left homeless. Children orphaned by the tsunami were fostered by residents, measured and fitted for school uniforms, and relatives were searched for. If there were no family members left alive, they were lovingly welcomed into the orphanage at Paripully. Throughout the trauma of the tsunami in this area, because of MA Math, no one  missed a meal.Everyone had safe shelter, clothing, new articles of clothing and home wares, and the presence of a caring community.Although shaken by being in the center of an international tragedy, I was awed by the speed, efficiency, and yet sincere care and concern with which MA MATH sprung into action to relieve the suffered of the tsunami victims.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15622	2	/users/profile/17483	rem108	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	The M.A. Math is a humanitarian organization that touches human life at the grassroots level. What impresses me about the organization is how Amma, the spiritual and organizational head, has inspired an army of people from all walks of life to follow her example of selfless service. Doctors, engineers, and professionals of high caliber form part of this organization and work as volunteers in a spirit of service and charity. As a result, numerous hospitals, educational institutions, homes for the poor, scholarships, pension schemes and so much more have come into existence, helping the underprivileged in society. The Math's giving hand has reached beyond the borders of its country and serves the poor and homeless in countries like the United States in the form of 'Mother's Kitchen', something of a soup-kitchen service. The Math was also a major contributor during the 2005 disaster relief for Hurricane Katrina. All this starting from an uneducated woman from a small backward village in a forgotten corner of India, teaching the relatively simple principle of 'Love Thy Neighbor'- very impressive indeed!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15619	2	/users/profile/17480	shivani	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	Words can describe events, experiences on a very physical level. What one experiences out of giving, working and volunteering at MA Math's programs and acitivities often exceed beyond the physical realm. I have met hundreds and hundreds of people from far and near, east and west, all colors and races spring to fold into unison to do seva- the feeling, the sight of this seems more utopian, the joy of returns is multi-fold, one has to hear, feel and see it by one's own heart to describe it...If anyone one out there has an opportunity to do seva/volunteer time, effort, thoughts or materials or oneself, come feel your own heart beat to Amma's call !
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15618	2	/users/profile/17478	ammaslovein action	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	Amma says compassion to the poor is our duty to god. for the last 12 years i have had the best time of each month be a soup kitchen where i along withg 30 or so other volunteers (mostly devotees of Amma) serve fresh, all veg, prepared from scratch, healthy and delicious food to 200- 300 of the needy here in new york, through mother's kitchen, our local Amma oriented soup kitchen.the food and service is a labor of love- with the quality of the foor being incomparable better than almost any other soup kitchen in nyc. this is all due to Amma's love,teachings and inspiration.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15617	2	/users/profile/17479	mahendra	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	Last year I travelled to India from the US and personally experienced the effect of Amma's charities on the people of India. Schools, hospitals, orphanages and emergency relief work are just a few examples of the far reaching arm of Amma's charitable activities. Amma personally oversees this enormous scope of work, and still finds time to personally meet, advise and console thousands of people, almost daily. I can think of no one person, in modern or historical times, who has selflessly given their life to the world, as much as Amma. Amma's life is an example that any person can grow from.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15614	2	/users/profile/17476	Todd Chambers	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I first encountered the Mata Amritanandamayi Math while staying in India in 1997.I have repeatedly been very impressed with the social service and charitable projects of this organization and its leadership.After the devastation wrought by the south asian tsunami in 1994, the Math did tremendous service to victims of the disaster.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15608	2	/users/profile/17470	Aquarius61	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2009	I had the privilege of finding out about Amma and her humanitarian work earlier this year.  I was so inspired by all she does that is has changed the way I view life and my role in it.  Thank you Amma for all you do!!!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15605	2	/users/profile/17469	amma33	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	Through the Mata Amritanandamayi Math we have had the opportunity to learn the IAM meditation technique free of charge to us. Meditation has imporved our qualitity of life in numerous ways. It has helped us to reduce the stress in our lives, and to feel more in control of the events that effect us. The calm center of meditation is a foundation of peace and faith that enables us to be more productive in our work and more content with our day to day life. We also have been able to attend Amma's public programs for free over the years which has inspired us and taught us so many valuable lessons of faith and giving of ourselves to others. We started a satsang under Amma's encouragement and blessings that meets on a regular basis. This satsang has undertaken public improvement projects to protect the environment. None of this would have happened without the support of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, to whom we are extremely grateful.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15604	2	/users/profile/19590	ariana4	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I have worked with, and observed this organization for several years. I have helped in various food programs that the MA Math runs both here in the U.S. as well as India. But what I am most impressed with is the great amount and tremendous variety of work that I've seen accomplished in so short a time because there are many focused volunteers.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15601	2	/users/profile/17464	GoDodgers88	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	Taking care of our Earth is so very important. Working, cultivating and conserving it not only has benefits for the land itself, but for humans as well. Under the umbrella and guidance of the M.A. Center, I joined a group of about half a dozen volunteers to create and maintain a community garden. Many of us did not know anything about gardening, but our willingness to learn, dedication to the task, and of course the miraculous work of sun, water and soil produced a plush backyard garden full of tomatoes, squash, carrots, lettuce and radishes. We considered the first year an experiment and after much success, I believe we will do it again next year. Some of us have hope that the garden will grow into an avenue for providing food for those in need, or into a business in which the proceeds can fund charitable work.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15596	2	/users/profile/17459	amritapadam	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2009	Humanitarian and charitable activities of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math have addressed every aspect of societal crisis across the globe. The impact of timely service rendered by the Math during major catastrophes, such as the Tsunami in 2004, Gujarat earthquake of 2001, hurricane Katrina of 2005, to name a few have been very profound. Personally, it has touched me to see that scriptural teachings have come to life in the works of the Math. People in need have been able to rely on the Math without having to deal with beauracracy or delay. The Math's slogan "Tyaganaike Amritatvamanushuhu", meaning only through self-less service can we gain immortality, has been exemplified by the charitable activities of the Math and all its volunteers.

The list goes on and on.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15571	2	/users/profile/17436	Super Nova	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I have worked with many non-profits and non even comes close to the work of M.A. Math, which has all the ingredients to make a great organization that can truly serve those in need. Compassion, love, dedication, common sense, practical wisdom plus the hands-on leadership of a divine spiritual master like Amma who does not just talk or write books about the importance of humanitarian work but rather spends ever moment of her life living it.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15570	2	/users/profile/17434	JJW	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I have found this organization to be exceptionally welcoming of everyone.  It is amazing in this day & time that Amma travels the world and welcomes everyone at absolutely no cost to the participant.  My life has been greatly enriched as a result!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15566	2	/users/profile/17429	Tasha	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	My experience with Amma, and Mata Amritanandamayi Math, is that by being in Amma's presence, and seeing Amma's own work, Her own self sacrifice, and Her constant striving to comfort others, has inspired me to do my own volunteer work within the community that I live in.  What I do is to collect the day old bread from an area grocer and take it to a distribution place for area shelters to come and collect the bread.  The organization is Everybody Ate Today (E.A.T.).  The bread is collected early in the morning, before the store opens.  I do this almost every weekend on one day.  Before I met Amma I was not involved in the community at this level.  Since then I have found within me a desire to help those around me without the want of something in return.  I just feel as though this is what I should do - and I wasn't told to do this.  It has been through Her constant, selfless example that I am inspired to do a small bit.  I have been involved with E.A.T. for about two and a half years.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15562	3	/users/profile/17426	speechpathologist	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I have been visiting Amma's gatherings one or two times a year for five years.  Every year when I return, there are more and more organized charitable endeavors within Amma's organization such as Hospitals, a University, orphanages, Kitchens feeding the hungry and on and on.  Her nonprofit is feeding, educating, healing people all over the world.  And, all the while as she runs these organizations, she is traveling the world hugging thousands of people one-on-one!

My experience has been very positive.  This is a genuinely excellent organization doing a lot of good for society, having initiated schools, colleges, hospitals, and various other units to care for the poor and helpless, as well as provide vocational training and self-help programs.I am very happy to provide a strong endorsement of the M.A. Math for the InDiya award.

Amma's love and selfless service shines through all the humanitarian projects that MA Math has undertaken/is currently undertaking.  All the staff and volunteers of MA need to be commended for their selfless efforts on so many humantarian projects.MA Math relief effors for Tsunami, Katrina, Orphanages has touched me the most.  Amma shows by her example that the more you give, the more you get.  I am inspired by the work of Amma's organization to do more in my everyday life.

This  includes free food and clothing programs, charitable hospitals, hospices, disaster relief programs, free homes for the poor and the needy, medical camps, orphanage, schools, educational institutions, widows' pension scheme, free legal advice, preservation of nature and so on. The list is long and growing everyday.Since I have met Amma, I also develop a strong and profound desire to do more volunteer works in joining various charitable organizations in my community .I became a much happier person in following Amma's path .Selfless work had given me the opportunity to grow and mature spiritually.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15330	2	/users/profile/17226	Kathy	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I have been aware of this organization for over two decades and I'm overwhelmed with its ability to inspire people to help others.  I and other volunteers are so inspired by the love and compassion of Mata Amritanandamayi behind this group that we probably work harder and with more love at this than at any other work we do. I've been involved in the soup kitchen in New York City for over ten years. The cooks turn out wonderful food and we strive to welcome and treat the guests with love.  I've been involved in planting trees (in New York and New Jersey)  I've contributed to fund raisers for projects such as farmer suicide in India.  I've watched the charitable works grow exponentially from the original orphanage in India to the tremendous outpouring of help to people: medical, educational, psychological, job training, disaster relief, and basic necessities of life for the very poor.  I feel so enriched to be able to help as a volunteer and supporter.  It's a win-win situation all around.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15169	2	/users/profile/17067	marlenyf1	Donor	5	10/18/2009	I traveled to India a few times over the last nine years and each time I am so moved to see how much progress has been made with the money that is donated.  The first time I went I wanted to see what was being done with money I had personally donated. I wanted to make sure there was no waste. I was so impressed to see the multiple schools, orphanages and colleges.  I expected so much less and instead it was truly amazing to see the magnitude of the number of schools - 17 at that time (2000).  I was equally impressed to see the commitment of the volunteers, workers, staff and everyone who was involved in making sure the schools were running smoothly.  I even traveled on my own to some of the locations to see how they would look if Amma was not present.  The students and staff were really great, the children at the orphanage were happy as can be!  I became a true believer.It made me more committed to giving and to do volunteer work. I feel like I wish I could do more each time I go.  The last time a few of us went on our own to visit the houses that were built after the tsunami.  They were small by American standards but totally complete and efficient.  Better than an efficiency apartment.  I realized how much we have and don't need.  Most important was the giving that I saw with no expectations from the families.  The best was the joy of the children and how they were being educated, clothed, and fed.  Can we have more organizations like this around the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15137	2	/users/profile/17036	paolo	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	I met Amma when she first came to the U.S. in a Quaker church in Madison Wisconsin and have lived in her Ashram in Kerala and have seen her and traveled with her through many cities and have seen many people go through many altering changes for me just recently I was in an accident and went to see Amma shortly after and I know that with her darshans and her compassion she has been a great influence on my and manyof my friends lives. Amma has given me the strength and peace in my life and has brought me such serenity that I feel is vital in our lives in these times especially now. One incident that I recall was at the Parliament of World Religeons in Chicago I guess you could say every religious leader attended even some tribes of American Indians and the noted Dahli Llama. Just like most conferences of patriarchy there was some kind of heated discussion that went on for awhile until it reached Amma's attention, and she began to order them to stop these proceduresand began to give Darshan right there and it changed the vibrations and the conference was a great success!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15129	4	/users/profile/17027	ammasdeepa	Volunteer	5	10/18/2009	This charity helps and supports thousands of people a year around the world.  Seeing the selflessness of the volunteers, and seeing the very people who were helped, turn around to offer their time and effort for others has been a miracle to observe.  I think this organization is a model for any other volunteer, non-profit organization, especially in disaster relief.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	15008	5	/users/profile/16917	Pradeep	Volunteer	5	10/17/2009	Ther are many organizations that one can contribute to. How many you can trust to use the money in a way that a greater amount goes to helping others is another. The M.A. Math is the only Organization that uses the greatest amount of money for the good of others while the labor is all volunteer supported. This means that more money goes to rebuilding a Village after a Tsunami, or goes to feeding, clothing, sheltering and educating children in orphanges, or offering medical services to those who cannot afford it. Sri Sri Mata Amritananda Mayi (AKA: Amma) is helping people worldwide in so many areas, but here are just a few that have impacted our society: When recently Visiting Africa in 2009, Amma felt the Orhans needed help right away and pledged a 180 bed orphanage in Kenya. When the Tsunami hit in  India Her Devotees immediately stepped forward to assist those in Need. Amma tirelessly worked day and night to assist so many. Temporary shelters were created immediately for those who were left Homeless. Amma said don't worry, we will help and did in so many ways. When Katrina huricane Leveled New orleans, Amma directed devotees to assist others in need. Devotees immediately went to work assiting as Volunteers and also raised over 2 million Dollars, which was raised and donated to the Katrina Fund. Amma has assisted in bringing about peace in Sri Lanka between the two warring parties. Amma has directed Devotees in the Us to assit the Poor, homeless, and hungry and has given directives to create ways to feed those less fortunate through the Numerous Mothers kitchens now throughout the USA. One could go on and On about the wonderful things this small woman from india has done for so many throughout the world. She has touched so many. to learn more go to www.amma.org

Therefore, I am truly able to move closer to Peace here on Earth.Amma is not seeking anything in return for her Love only to try and become more like her by selflessly serving others rather than self.Thank You, Amma

Between now and then I have seen AMMA almost anually to study, learn, volunteer and experience the depth of her teachings and presence. I have learned how to meditate, how to be patient, kind, focused. The organized, detailed and precise nature with which her organization is run is stunning.  The amount of people she serves is almost overwhelming.  I recently helped to sort medical supplies, donated by Stanford, in the Northern California center to be sent to India to AMMA's AIM'S hospital.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14924	5	/users/profile/16842	muktismom	Donor	5	10/16/2009	I receive requests from many charities and give to quite a few of them. However, Mata Amritanandamayi Math is the only one that I feel really confident uses almost every dollar to meet the needs of the sick and the poor.  MAM is run by volunteers under the guidance of Mata Amritanandamayi, who keeps nothing for herself.  Her only mission is one of love and compassion for everyone.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14888	5	/users/profile/16805	Carol	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Having been to India to see the work that Amma and her volunteers have done it is overwhelming and impressive. That so much can be done to help others with their basic needs. While most of the work of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math is in India and the surrounding counties, her message of helping others is world wide. As is demonstrated by the number of U.S. programs that work in partnership with local charities help to feed the homeless (Amma Kitchen). In the more than nine years I have been involved with MA Math, I continue to be amazed at the work that is accomplished.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14887	4	/users/profile/16804	Ammaslaura	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math has completely changed my life! Amma, the founder, has taught me by example to serve selflessly. Amma tirelessly travels all over the world to send messages of the importance of compassion and service. She encourages us all to go out into the world and serve each other with all our hearts. In society today, people always want to be compensated for any work that they do. Whether it be money, praise, reputation, etc. Amma's life is dedicated to showing the world that we should not act with the intention to reap the benefits. We should always act with love and an attitude of compassion and empathy. We should learn to view ourselves in others. In addition to serving humanity, Amma stresses the importance of service to Nature. She encourages us all to live from the Earth, cut down on waste, recycle and reuse, plant trees, have back yard gardens to grow food, and to take as little of the Earth's precious natural resources as possible. For so long, I was somewhat afraid of the outdoors. I grew up a city girl and knew nothing more than concrete. I was deathly afraid of bugs, wouldn't sit on the grass, and God forbid get my hands dirty! Since I have known Amma, she has slowly taught me to love Mother Nature. Bit by bit, I started to appreciate it, admire it, look at it, smell it, sit on it, and BE in it! This year, I finally decided to bring Amma's teachings to life, when I started a back yard garden. I knew nothing about gardening, but I set out on a journey that greatly impacted my life. As I reflect on the process it took to develop the garden, I am awestruck that anything actually grew! I was a brand new gardener, and I had little to no faith. Who would have ever thought that a tiny seed could hold the bounty of life and creation itself? Who would have ever believed in the miraculous combination of natural sunlight, water, and photosynthesis? Its not just 7th grade science! It does exist! Over the past 6-7 months, Mother Nature has begun to teach me how to grow life sustaining food. I grew tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, carrots, lettuce, radishes and onions. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but will know for next time dont wait until tomatoes plants are big to try to get them into cages, trust the seed package and thin the radishes, otherwise they wont have any room to develop undergroundand, and dont forget to wear sun screen! She has also been teaching me important lessons in surrender, patience, and conservation. This land that we inhabit is so precious. She provides everything that we could ever possibly need to survive. If we nourish and love Her, She will return the favor.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14803	4	/users/profile/16717	Kathleen	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Greetings! I am so excited to be writing about My Most Beloved Teacher in every sense of the word. Mata Amritanandamayi Math was inspired by the self-less service of her Divine presence Ammachi! Math as I call it comes with a three fold blessings as a humanitarian organization giving complete and total care to all those that it helps. You have an organization completely devoted to every aspect of the healing of those it helps... Math operates on all levels... Giving physical healing in so ways like homeless food spots, housing, free doctor care, clothing and then no less important is the emotional care of those individuals, Math made sure that it provided for that as well. Like for all those affected by the tsunami.. Little children where given counseling and swimming lessons to help with the emotional healing... I also know that they all try to support the community with family traditional religious support... Math paying for traditional weddings for those whom would not have been able to have it... I am not Indian but I know from talking to others how SO important this is for the well being of the community and each family individually....  The thing is Math doesn't stop there either, When Katrina hit they offered the citizens of the US a donation as well, so the healing they offer isn't limited by any means... But Math/Ammachi doesn't stop there, Pensions to destitute women, training so woman can be educated, Schools, and orphanages to name a few of the projects mother inspires people to undertake and support by example... Building homes fro the outside in.I believe they want to offer healing in everyway to everyone... I stand by this and ask that Mata Amritanandamayi Math be given the highest support we can give them. No less though I also want to honor EVERY organization out there doing the work. YA US!!Kathleen Rouleau
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14796	4	/users/profile/16711	Haveaheart	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	The Mata Amritandamayi Math is a unique organization with a very wide global outreach, drawing volunteers from several countries and serving people all over the world. It provides an amazing spectrum of services: it responds to disasters, provides ongoing care through hospitals, hospices and orphanages, and engages in laying the foundation for peoples lives whether in the form of housing, education or livelihood. The Maths all-embracing outlook includes every segment of society  from prostitutes and the homeless to the incarcerated as well as villagers in need of microfinancing. It is also in the forefront of efforts to restore the worlds environmental balance through reforestation, sustainable farming and spreading other green initiatives in more than 25 countries.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14735	3	/users/profile/16653	theresam	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Amma, through her own selfless service to humanity, inspires people to serve the poor and unfortunate in myriad ways, and to raise money for her countless charities.  I personally have been involved in many ways in the organization, since 2003, as have the other four members of our family.  I have raised money for the numerous M.A. Math charities through several garage sales, I have cooked food for fundraising dinners, I have helped show a film about Amma at our local yoga cummunity center, I have organized bake sales, and we even hosted a concert at our house where my husband and children performed music.  One year my husband had a birthday party and in leiu of gifts he asked for donations for Amma's charities.  I helped write a book  about Amma and am now working on another one.  In the first book I interviewed children and parents from around the world about their experiences with Amma.  The second book is about all of the various seva (selfless service) projects that people around the world are doing for Amma's charities.  The profits from books written about Amma go directly to the numerous charities.  The books were a joy to work on.  I never enjoyed work as much as I did writing and editing the books.  During Amma's U.S. programs I have helped prepare food - chopping vegetables and making chai tea, greeted newcomers, helped in the free childcare facilities,and washed dishes.  Our three children love Amma so much that they freely choose to give some of their own money to her every time they see her.  Every year they lovingly create "charity boxes," decorating them with stickers and drawings.  They leave the boxes in their rooms, slowly filling them with coins and dollars.  Then when we visit Amma, they take the boxes to her.  My newest project is growing tulsi (holy basil) plants from seeds that I will sell to people in my community.  Last year I did this and sold about 20 plants.  My goal this year is to sell 100 plants.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14655	4	/users/profile/16573	riverrun	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2009	This charity has an epic scope--its massive relief work in India has changed millions of lives, and the entire organization is built on love.  They actually relocated over 1600 families from terrible slums into brand new apartment blocks!!  This is an organization with absolutely angelic intentions.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14626	4	/users/profile/16550	birdacious9	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Last year, I spent 6 months in India traveling around with, and doing what I can for the charities of, Mata Amritanandamayi, or Amma, as she is commonly called.  I've honestly never experienced or even heard of a charitable organization like hers, the scope of which is so immense and covers so many areas in need of help, it's hard to remember them all.  I can only comment on a couple, which I personally witnessed during Amma's programs.The first charity that I recall of the MA Math has to do with the farmer suicides in parts of India.  I understand that Amma pledged something like $46 million to aid in this tragic situation, but it really hit home with me when I saw dozens of children - children whose fathers had committed suicide - walk across the stage to be embraced and comforted by Amma, as well as recieve checks to help them in life and education.  It was giving a second chance, hope, and love to innocent children who tragically lost a parent.At several programs, I saw women walk across the stage to recieve brand new sewing machines, and widows receiving pensions, offerning respectable means of livelihood and sustenance.   Amma, herself, personally embraces and comforts literally thousands of people every day and night.  Seeing this made the biggest impression on me, and yet still all of these other charites continue to go on behind-the-scenes.  The MA Math definitely has my vote for best-all-around non-profit charitable organization.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14603	4	/users/profile/16529	ammus	Volunteer	5	10/16/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math is one of the best philanthrophic non-profit organization I have seen. One of the main things that struck me was the focus on diverting maximum effort and funds to the causes they have supported. Even though this organization is based in India, it has supported world-wide philanthrophic effort like feeding the homeless, Katrina flood relief, Tsunami/Earthquake victims support etc. In India the charities they support are wide and varied and include Housing for the poor, Orphanages, Women self-help training, Scholarships for poor students, Sewing machines to enable impoverished to be self-employed, Free medical care for the poor. Most of the money donated to this organization is directed to the charities with very minimum overhead costs. This is because all the volunteers use their time, skill and efforts to offload administrative and other overhead expenses. For e.g. for the towns/cities affected by the Tsunami in India and Sri Lanka, the housing was planned, built and executed by volunteers alone! In Bihar and Andhra Pradesh a team of doctors and other volunteers provided free medical aid and food and clothing to the affected villages for as long as it took to bring the place to a sense of normalcy. Even the Government or other organizations in India has been unable to plan and execute to the level of efficiency of this organization in these situations. M.A. Math is a shining light among all the non-profit philanthropic organizations that makes a difference in the lives of the impoverished. Every time I have volunteered or donated any amount to this organization, I have come away satisfied and secure that my time and money was well utilized.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14584	4	/users/profile/16701	Peace	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	The MA Math is a living example of the power of love and selfless giving. Thousands of people in need benefit from the Math each day in the forms of free homes, food, health care and/or education. At the same time, thousands of people who willingly give their time, effort and/or money to support the Maths service work, feel the joy of giving and sharing. When one dollar or rupee of donation is used by the Math, the value delivered is more than one dollar or rupee. There is no depletion to pay salaries or other overhead. On the contrary, the labor that is added by the Math to deliver the value is provided by volunteers, thus the value of donated funds actually gets enhanced. I have personally helped transport and deliver bricks, sand etc. to the sites where the Math was building homes for tsunami survivors in Kerala. I have witnessed the high quality of materials and workmanship, the great speed and efficiency of the work, and the frugality of the activities, all done by volunteers from different parts of the world.The same value-addition, high quality and efficiency, and frugality can be seen in all the service work of the Math, e.g., the three entire villages rebuilt for free in Gujarat after the 2001 earthquake, over 30,000 free homes built throughout India for widows and destitute people, and free food, clothing and medical treatment provided to hundreds of flood victims in Bihar and tsunami victims in Tamil Nadu.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14564	4	/users/profile/16492	purna	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	Amma's organization supports an incredible number of charitible activities and programs.  I have had the fortune to be able to volunteer for a few of them.  For the last three years I have been corresponding with a prisoner through the COLI(Circle of Love Inside) program. This program is bringing spiritual support and encouragement to these beings.  At times it has been challenging but hopefully an opportunity to grow and learn for both of us.  It breaks down the barriers and allows for healing and compassion.  The other program I participate in on a regular basis is Mother's Kitchen.  Our Satsang group comes together and once a month different group members offer their time to prepare and serve dinner at our local homeless shelter for families.  It bonds our Satsang members in this gift of giving and connects us with these community members going through difficult times.  It is very rewarding and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be involved in this seva.  The others in my group inspire me to be  more giving and empathetic to others.  Even making monetary donations on a regular basis is a gift to share with others and giving to the Mata Amritanandamayi Math I know all of my gift will be used for the needs of those suffering and not for some administrative overhead.  I have never observed or can imagine an organizations so selfless and with such completely devoted volunteers.  It is an honor to volunteer and be involved in these programs.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14513	4	/users/profile/17514	twarrior	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	I have been involved with this institution for the past 10 years. I've watched this growing from a small to a huge organization which has truly been amazing. Most of the work is done by volunteers. I've had the incredible opportunity to interact and meet so many like minded people who have become more like a family to me. To be specific this organization has taught me to be more giving and caring.Through different opprtunities it helps us to find happiness in giving rather than recieving. i've been to one of the soup kitchens in NJ which was a very humbing experience. the fact is that we could very well be standing in that line instead of serving food. Also helps us realize how lucky we are with what we have. I've also contributed to the orphanage in India. It has also encouraged me to sponsor a child who has developed into this wonderful teenager. Last time i met her i felt so proud to see how she has developed. In todays world where there is so much hatred all over, this institution is uniting people together no matter what the color of your skin is or what religion you believe in. We have had so many opportunities to see the goodness in people and are indebted to this organization for helping us in our personal journeys.During katrina which hit the US i was able to volunteer to get the families and children together.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14496	3	/users/profile/16430	inspired	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	M.A. Math has been involved in a long list of charitable projects helping people in great need. Several times I have been inspired to contribute to various programmes because of the effectiveness and high level of the organization. What has inspired me most is the level of dedication shown by the volunteers and the fact that Amritananda Mayi (Amma) constantly devotes almost her entire energy into finding ways of helping those most in need.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14491	2	/users/profile/16421	lalitha	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math is different from any other organization doing charitable work.  First of all what impressed me most is that 100% of any donation goes completely to help the needy.  There is no overhead at all!!  The second aspect that struck me as different from any others out there is that the 100% donation goes quickly and effeciently to solve the problem of the needy.  Thirdly, the humanitarian work has very significant goals and at the same time achievable goals in a very timely manner.  Fourth aspect is that there are several humanitarian projects ongoing that will appeal to one and all who goes to help. Last but not at all the least, we as the general public who try to do what little we can through this humanitarian organization see immediate return on our invested time or money in terms of the needy being helped.  For me, this experience has been extremely fulfilling that I want to give more and more.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14434	2	/users/profile/16377	ncm	Donor	5	10/15/2009	For more than ten years I have had the privilege to be associated with the MA Math both as a donor and volunteer. The breadth of their work is inspiring. Providing health care in tribal villages, building thousands of homes for both slum dwellers and tsunami victims, planting hundreds of thousands of trees, enabling economic independence for women through self help groups that include micro-financing plans, educating children by establishing special needs schools as well as giving scholarships to children is just a sampling of the initiatives that are fueled by a broad base of dedicated, selfless volunteers.    Thank you.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14371	4	/users/profile/16317	kalpataru	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	The tsunami that struck in December 2004 in southern India and Srilanka had a huge toll on humanity.  As a volunteer of Mata Amritanandayamayi Math, I participated in some of the relief work in Kollam, south India. It was amazing to see how the MAM switched into relief work so quickly by providing the basic necessities like food, clothing, shelters, medical care, counselling etc. In the coming months, the MAM built and provided free houses to the people whose homes were destroyed, provided free education to children who were affected, employment to family members, built and repaired boats and distributed to the fisherman so that they can earn their living. It was very impressive to be part of MAM and see Mata Amritanandayamayi Math providing relief measures to the suffering humanity.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14309	2	/users/profile/16265	santhosh_s_nair	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	I was really moved by Mata Amritanandamayi Math's tsunami relief efforts. What touched me was not just the huge amount of money the organization donated to tsunami relief but the wholistic approach it took to serve the survivors of that devastating natural disaster. For example, M A Math gave training to children of families who were affected by tsunami. Witnessing the mad waves snatching away their parents and siblings children who survived tsunami became afraid of water. M A Math recognized this phobia in those children and gave them swimming classes. This is in addition to feeding and clothing the tsunami survivors for several weeks continuously after the devastating attack of the waves. Another service that M A Math offers that deeply touches me is orphanages. I personally have visited the orphanage in Parippally near Kolam, (Kerala, India).  The care givers of that orphanage have hearts overflowing with love.  The children in that orphanage are not just given food, clothing and shelter but they are given education that imparts value. The academic and non-academic achievements the students of that school are many and exemplary.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14274	2	/users/profile/16235	Tulasi	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	All I can say is Amma's is work its absolutely amazing and I'm at a loss for words to describe it. Amma and her organization are able to focus on those most in need - and offer the supremely practical services that ensure that people are able to meet their basic necessities.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14261	2	/users/profile/16224	angelakd	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	I've never been more impressed by a single organization. Amma and all her millions of volunteers seem to work around the clock helping those in need. Thank God for the Amrita Math!!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14240	4	/users/profile/16205	xkwisitlady	Volunteer	5	10/15/2009	The amazing thing to me about this work is that so often people build a charity around their pet interest. But here, the only interest is to help people who are in need - no matter the need. The scope of operations is completely staggering - from high tech hospitals, to monthly stipends for widows. From re-building houses after natural disasters around the world, to providing the means for couples in India to marry. There isn't a single facet of human need or experience that isn't touched by this Math in some way. But what is even more amazing is that this humanitarian "empire" is all inspired by the example given by one woman. Which is probably why this organization has volunteers at all levels - because everyone can clearly see the difference that just one person can make.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14188	3	/users/profile/16159	thegateway	Client Served	5	10/14/2009	I cannot put words to the worthwhile nature of Amma's work. In 2003, having studied with many healers and spiritual masters, I found Amma. For 5 summers in a row, I crossed the United States with her group, receiving incredible assistance from Amma and the group of swamis around her.   By assisting my spiritual journey, I am able to turn and help others in my city. Not only that but I have found peace at last.  I really have no criticism because I was treated so well compared to my earlier experiences studying with spiritual teachers.   I truly believe that Amma models and expresses a level of love that the world so needs at this time, if we are to survive.     (I am a university graduate, a former journalist and teacher and mother of two grown up sons.)
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	14002	3	/users/profile/15975	praveen	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	Its really amazing to see the commitment and dedication of the volunteers of this organization. Both the scale of operations as well as spectrum of activities is huge - and the most impressive fact is that majority of the work is done purely by volunteers ... so 100% of the benefit is passed on to the beneficiaries !!!
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13996	4	/users/profile/15959	upasana	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	The noise coming from the open area of the Math on the day of the distribution of the widows and orphans pension scheme was deafening.  Having newly arrived in India, I went downstairs to see what was happening.  There I was greeted by thousands of women and children waiting in line to receive a monthly stipend.  Their stories moved me to tears - husband killed in an accident, leaving them with children and no means of support. Amma is taking care of them.  They came from all over, from all different walks of life, different religions, different languages, yet a common bond together.  Hence the noise.  These women love to talk and in particular about how wonderful the M.A. Math has been to help them in their lives and the lives of their children. In addition to this, I have been privileged to see how the Math has helped build houses for the poor and tsunami victims.  Sand seva and building bricks makes the hands hard, but the heart soft.  The volunteers, like me, come from all countries.  The work gets done and the keys are passed to the residents for no cost to them.  A house, when one never had a place to call one's own, can be quite an experience.Then there are the hundreds of orphans that the Math takes care of.  I have watched those children blossom from being on the wild side to young people of extraordinary love and talent.  They are now well fed and educated in skills to help them in the world.M.A. Math has also helped us in the U.S.  I remember Amma telling me to tell the US that the Math was going to donate one million dollars to the victims of Huricane Katrina.  Amma's generousity also extends to the many soup kitchens in the U.S..  There is one in Dover NJ where we help feed over a hundred people on a Saturday.The Math is a place where anybody can come and stay for awhile.  Food is provided and so is shelter.  There are people who have come with no money and have stayed for years.  People who have come troubled in heart and soul, have been given a place to live and now they are productive members of the Math, helping others as they have been helped.The Math, under Amma's guidance, has started schools and education programs for the young people.  Tribal children are now being educated.  Poor children are being afforded the money to buy supplies and uniforms.  Children are encouraged to learn the traditions of India and practice them, while at the same time being given the skills to work in the modern world.  I have seen thousands of children come to the ashram for training sessions in how to swim, read, meditate.  They are a boisterous lot, bursting with energy and enthusiasm.  They are helped overcome fears of the water after the tsunami and some proudly display their new swimming skills with much splashing and broad smiles.  Those smiles were not always there.  Sadness and dispair have been replaced with healing and joy.  This is all accomplished by the devoted voluntters of the Math.One of my favorite stories is seeing someone donate gold bangles to Amma.  A few minutes later Amma was giving these same bangles to a woman who was in tears about not having the dowry to marry her daughter.   This type of unselfishness is what Amma and the M.A. Math is all about.  It is about giving to others.The entire M.A.Math is run by volunteers.  The ashram runs like a giant machine with many parts - the ashram and its branches, the schools, hospitals, teaching facilities, roving medical facilities for treating the poor in remote regions, the orphanage, the building of houses in India and abroad, etc.  This machine runs on love and is overseen by Mata Amritananda Mayi who makes sure that all the gears run smoothly.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13975	4	/users/profile/15948	Aiswarya	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	I know of no other organization that has the resources to feed and help house 5000 people the day of the tsunami, like MA Math did in India.  MA Math motivates selfless service from it's members, inspiring us to help all in need, striving to improve conditions for all. Money donated goes to providing supplies, financial help, education, homes and housing to the homeless, orphans, farmers.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13940	4	/users/profile/15916	sahaja	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	I am honored to write about my experiences with Mata Amritanandamayi Math. I have been familiar with this organization and with Amritanandamayi since 1996. Since that time I have been impressed by the quality and quantity of humanitarian projects that this organization has sponsored. Seeing the impact of such worthwhile action as feeding meals to hungry people around the world, building homes for the homeless and raising the awareness of the need for environmental action such as planting trees and using discarded materials such as plastic to make useful items has inspired me to be a better person and contribute to this world in positive ways. I have volunteered my time to this organization offering meals to hungry people in the Los Angeles area as well as helping distribute socks and warm clothes to them and I feel very blessed to have had this opportunity. Because of this organization I was allowed to experience the warm feeling of gratitude coming from those who received the meals and clothes. I feel so grateful to Amritanandamayi and this organization for showing me the importance of compassion for others and for being an example to me of great service in this world. I learned from these events of service that it is truly those who serve who are the most blessed. On those days when I helped to offer food to others, I felt like I was walking on a cloud of light and love.I am a visual artist and a poet and I was allowed to contribute one of my photographs to a fundraiser that this organization sponsored to help raise the needed funds for tsunami victims. This organization has done so much charitable work on behalf of those devastated by the recent tsunami that impacted India and Sri Lanka. Because of this fundraiser I was able to contribute my talent and my energy to helping others who had experienced suffering and loss from this catastrophic event.I am also very interested in helping our environment. I have been inspired by the efforts of Mata Amritanandamayi Math to give back to nature and to sponsor action which contributes to reducing the harmful effects of global warming in India and around the world. The work this organization does through its Green Friends projects is inspiring and invaluable to well-being of this planet. I have been motivated by their efforts to donate funds to plant trees and have even been involved with groups that have planted trees all over the Los Angeles area.Another wonderful opportunity that I was given by this organization was to contribute to those who are homeless in India. When Amritanandamayi visits North America she makes it possible for people like me to offer donations that go to help build homes for the homeless. I was allowed to donate funds to help build houses in India on more than one occasion at the events sponsored by this organization. Because this organization oversees the funds that are donated to it with such integrity, those funds go a long way to helping make a big difference in the lives of the less fortunate. I would never have been able to help build a home in America for the same amount of money that I donated to this organization. I was both honored and excited to be part of such an inspiring cause.I have been greatly benefited by my association with Mata Amritanandamayi Math. I feel that I have become a more caring, compassionate person and I have been able to contribute to helping those who are truly in need both in the United States and in India. I will be forever in debt to this organization and to Amritanandamayi for not only being my example but for creating ways that I can follow that example, leading a life of honor and walking on a path of positive action and compassionate service.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13895	4	/users/profile/15873	Trupti	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Ma, also known as the hugging saint is a walking miracle.  Her compassion can be felt through a crowded room and her smile makes your heart want to sing.  Among her many charitable projects is her orphanage.  Daily she feeds, clothes, and educates children that would otherwise would be living homeless on the streets.  She not only has takes care of needy children in India, but she has recently adopted children who have lost their parents in Africa and is providing for them.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13890	4	/users/profile/15869	amma'sdaughter	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	I am truly humbled by Amma's example of compassionate service to those in need.  Through her own acts of loving kindness, Amma strives to inspire us to likewise serve -- in our own communities, whenever, wherever there is a need.  Inspired by her own example, "Mother's Kitchen" projects have sprung up throughout the U.S.  In many cities these take the form of soup kitchens serving America's homeless.  In our city it takes the form of making, serving and sharing meals and fellowship with men who are recovering from alcohol and drug addiction.  Throughout the U.S. Amma's example is evident in Circle of Love letters that are exchanged with incarcerated men and women or with individuals who are lonely or ailing in some way.  In our own city her example is evident in backpacks filled with school supplies for low income children who, like everyone else, deserve a positive start to the school year; in ongoing donations to local food  banks; in bag lunches made for a local homeless shelter; and in holiday gifts to seniors and low income children at Christmas time. Beyond the many, many Amma-inspired service projects that can be observed in cities throughout the U.S., perhaps the ultimate demonstration of the impact that Amma's example has inspired is the desire by thousands, by millions worldwide, to live, as Amma does, as a beacon of loving kindness and concern -- day-to-day, moment-to-moment -- in everything we do.  Amma is truly a living saint and a great humanitarian.  She humbles and inspires us to strive to be, in some small way, a reflection of her teachings and beautiful example.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13885	4	/users/profile/15864	Deeps90	Donor	5	10/14/2009	I met AMMA(Mata Amritanandamayi Devi) in 2008 and I have been attending her programs regularly from then on.AMMA is a saint,spiritual leader and a great Humanitarian.After volunteering for various tasks during her retrats and other programs I got a good picture of how her non profit organizations like Mata Amritanandamayi Math work.The volunteers and staff are very dedicated,service minded,work as a team and have total faith in AMMA.Under AMMA's guidance MA Math has accomplished a lot of humanitarian tasks likeIndian Ocean Tsunami Relief work,flood relief works in Bihar,Mumbai& Andra Pradesh states,Earthquake relief operations in Kashmir,cyclone relief in west bengal,Old age homes,care homes for children,Slum renovation,Green initiatives like planting trees to name a few.What I like the most about this organization is the simlicity, honesty and transperency.When I donate money to this organization I am very sure that not single penney is mismanaged or wasted.I feel proud to be a part of such organisation under such a great leader like Amma.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13869	4	/users/profile/15849	onlydaughter	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2009	As an observer, the service activities of this organisation is mind blowing to me !  How much relief and solace it can provide to the recipients of the various projects, is beyond any measure. The organisation teaches us, that it is possible to do such philanthrophic activities, if only men had the right conviction and the heart to help. The activities are truely beyond comprehension and complimentation !
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13844	4	/users/profile/15827	mira	Volunteer	5	10/14/2009	Amma has changed the lives of so many people throughout India and throughout the world!  She is an example of tireless self-sacrifice and giving.  Our local satsang group is raising money to support injured wildlife in our area.  Many of us are planting organic gardens and offering free yoga and meditation classes for the community.  Amma has dedicated this year as "Green Year" and is inspiring us to plant trees, recycle and take care of the Earth.  Her Green Friends organization is planting trees all over the world.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13829	4	/users/profile/15809	suchindra	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	We have been to Gujarat, India after the devastating earthquake and over 2,000 homes were given to the victims by M.A. Math. We have also personally experienced the amazing charitable schools and hospitals which serve much of India. We were present when $1million dollars was given to former President Clinton for the Bush Clinton Katrina fund
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13826	4	/users/profile/15806	Dr Rose	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	I have been attending Ammachi's spiritual retreats in the US for the past 7 years. I have found her spiritual teachings, leadership, and practices to be an essential part of my life and my work. It's an extraordinary blessing for India and the world to have access to a fully realized soul who so ardently devotes her life to humanitarian efforts. Her web site and newsletters chronicle the many achievements of her organization in education, health care, and disaster relief. This devotion to humble service is clearly evident in all her retreats where costs are kept affordable through volunteers who tirelessly and joyfully wash dishes, cook, and tend to every aspect of the retreat. In addition, I find Ammachi's teachings to promote universal spiritual values such as love, acceptance, and inclusiveness rather than a particular faith. For example, I am consistently awe struck by her willingness and capacity to hug each person who is in line for darshan, sometimes for up to 8 or 10 hours without a break!  The act of hugging a person may not  seem noteworthy at first but I have seen people of different faiths, advanced educational levels, and cultural backgrounds spontaneously fall into deep contemplation and profound spiritual understanding by observing this extraordinary act of human kindness. In this time of cultural diversity and technological advances, we especially need to be reminded of our interconnectedness and wholeness.  Even though Amma has had numerous recognitions such as the 2002 Gandhi-King Award for Non-Violence awarded at the UN General Assembly Hall in Geneva, she is relatively unknown in the US except for some media exposure describing her as the "hugging saint from India." As a consultant working with non-profit agencies, governmental departments, and foundations, I would like to see her leadership accomplishments more prominently reviewed by senior policy makers and organizational leaders as a living example of how spirituality can play a vital role in our society and its institutions.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13816	4	/users/profile/15796	varenya	Donor	5	10/13/2009	While with most charity, or non-profit organizations in general a big part of the donations goes into the pay-checks of their president, organizers and workers;in contrast to that, what I observed visiting the head-quarters of Mata Amritanandamayi Math was the utmost economic efficiently and simplicity of the living-conditioned of their staff and volunteers. Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Ma herself, lives the example of utmost simplicity, correcting immediately anytime that her followers are trying to spend a little extra on her.I feel that all of my donations is spend to uplift the most poor and destitute people they can reach.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13815	3	/users/profile/15794	joyousmama	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	My experience is one of true wonder.I see a shining star of compassion and action.Her mission is to comfort and relieve suffering in this world and she does so on a daily basis.Her reach encompassehospices the world as she provided funds to the Katrina fund,helped in massive relief work in Asia to tsunami victims.( this is still on going) She has inspired Mothers Kitchen thru out the U.S. an organization to provide food to the homeless.She has inspired Green Friends which plants trees as well as provides education on creating a healthy  environment world wide. In her home,India she has created hospitals,hospices,schools and programs that provide widows with pensions.She is a strong supporter of women and has helped to create small cottage industries by providing education,and sewing machines to create independence.It is my honor to be able to speak on her behalf. Thank you, Elyse Segura
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13794	4	/users/profile/15776	ach	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	I have watched this organization for years. I have seen Amma and the MA Math rise to the occasion to help with not only physical aid to help the destitute, but mental/emotional as well.  Often times they are on the front lines before government organizations can offer assistance.  They are my top choice for donating money to, as I know they put it to good use.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13789	4	/users/profile/15774	sahadev108	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Hello, I am a Civil Engineer with many years of experience in Public Works design and construction. I have had the honor of working on some of the many projects initiated by Mata Amritanandamayi (Amma), and carried out by the MA Math.  After the Asian Tsunami struck, many thousands of people were homeless. I became involved in helping with the massive task of serving 20.000 meals a day from the MA Math kitchens.  I also used my engineering experience to help with the construction of some of the new homes the Math was building for the  families left homeless by the disaster.  Over the last 10 years I have personally observed and experienced Amma's work in the areas of medicine, health care, education, job training and vocational rehabilitation.   I believe that Amma is possibly the greatest humanitarian alive today. I also believe that She is the greatest spiritual leader this planet has seen for a long time.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13786	3	/users/profile/15770	rguntha	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Mata Amritanandamayi Math (MA Math) is run by Sri Mata Amritanadamayi Devi. We call her Amma (Mother). Amma is world renowned spiritual master from India. She is also called hugging saint. She spreads the message of love to people all over the world irrespective of their race, religion, nationality etc.Even though I learnt my first software languages at Amma's computer institue (AICT-Chennai) in 1997, I did not get a chance to meet Amma till 2005 in USA. Since then I started going to see Amma at every opportunity and slowly started involving in Amma's humanitarian projects.MA Math's humanitarian projects are in the areas of Education, Hospitals, Free homes, Orphanages, Pensions, Vocational job training, Environmental and the list goes on. They focus on all the human aspects. I was amazed by both the breadth and depth of these projects. Each of these projects are being done so perfectly and hugely successful. Majority of the effort on these projects is put on by volunteers who joined Amma's cause for years. All the volunteers I met are so kind, humble and loving and beyond that they are very much dedicated to MA Math's projects. They work continuously with full of enthusiasm. They just inspire me to do more and more. Since most of the work is done by Volunteers, the value of the services delivered to the needy is many more times to the money raised thru donations and other means. For example, when they build a Housing complex for the poor, they get the land from the local Government for free, and the work is done for free by volunteers, so these houses cost far less than regular houses. So literally, the money donated to MA Math becomes many more times by the time it reaches the recipients.I have listed a sample of MA Math's projects below. I have categorized them into Disaster Relief, Social, Medical, Educational, Nature care and Spiritual.Disaster relief: MA Math is usually the first to arrive and last to leave after a disaster strikes an area.1. Recently MA Math donated $46 million USD (2 billion Indian rupees) to Tsunami relief efforts. MA Center built 6000 homes in India & Sri Lanka.2. MA Math gave 1 million USD for Katrina relief efforts.3. Gujarat Earth quake relief. 1000 homes are built. 4. MA Math also was first to arrive after the recent floods in Bihar and WestBengal and setup medical camps and helped the victims.  Some projects in Social area:1. M.A.Math pledges $46 million (2 billion Indian rupees) USD worth projects to relieve distressed farmers and their families in India.2. Monthly Pension for more than 50,000 poor women3. Orphanage and Youth Hostel: In Kerala India, serve more than 500 children from the most disadvantaged sections of society. They are provided with free food, accommodations, schooling, and vocational and cultural training. There are lot more Orphanages. Recently MA Math started one Orphanage in Kenya as well.4. Mother's Kitchen - USA: Is active in 38 cities, feeding the poor and homeless. Organized and supported entirely by Amma volunteers, meals are being served in 23 U. S. states and 2 in Canada. Some projects in Medical area:1.Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences: This 800-bed world-class, high-tech hospital offers sophisticated medical care, specialized services and procedures not generally available at routine hospitals. Over 50% of treatments are charitable. During the calendar year 2002, free in-patient treatments and major financial concessions or subsidies were extended to 16884 patients amongst various specialties2.Amrita Kripasagar:Amrita Kripasagar Hospice consists of a main building with accommodations for 50 patients, medical facilities to relieve pain and lessen the suffering, kitchen, meditation and prayer hall, residential quarters for in-house medical and nursing staff, mortuary and crematory.A hospice is an institution where specialized care for the terminally ill is provided in an atmosphere of love and compassion.3. Medical Outreach Programs: In order to benefit the real needy in remote areas that can't get to city hospitals, AIMS and several other M. A. Maths across the country do mobile clinics and conduct camps at these locations on a frequent basis Some projects in Educational area:1. Amrita University: Ammas Amrita Institutions, consisting of the Amrita Institute of Technology and Science (AITEC), the Amrita Institute of Management (AIM) at Ettimadai, and the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) with its Medical College, Pharmacy College and Nursing School in Cochin, together constitute Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (Amrita University).2. Amrita Institute of Advanced Computing3. Amrita Institute of Computer Technology4. Amrita Software Training Center5. M. A. M. T. Industrial Training Center6. Amrita College of Pharmaceutical Sciences (ACPS)7. Amrita College of Nursing In Nature area:Green Friends: GreenFriends is Ammas initiative to bring greenery back to earth. Green friends promote planting trees, organic farming, developing fertile lands, growing vegetables in personal gardens or locally. Amma suggests that each person plant 1 tree per month to nutralize the effects of global warming. In Spiritual area1. Brahmasthanams:Brahmasthanam Temples were created by Amma as one way to reduce the effects of these negative influences in our lives. Through faith and devotion and certain spiritual practices, it has been found that many bad effects can be erased by good actions. At the Brahmasthanam temples a special form of worship, called a puja, is performed to enable the individual to reduce life's potential negative influences2. Amrita Vedanta Vidyalayam: At the Amritapuri Ashram, a Vedanta Vidyalayam has been established. Vidyalayam is the sanskrit word for school, and Vedanta is a Hindu non-dualist philosophy that embraces the concept of one all-pervading reality (Brahman). Thus, the school teaches the goal of life to be reunion with this divine consciousness.Thanks for reading. Ramesh Guntha. USA
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13785	4	/users/profile/15768	Mohan Kumar	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	My greatest experience was when devastating earthquake hit Gujarat when whole country was celeberating Republic Day on January 26th 2001, where hundreds of thousands of people died. I landed Vadodara, one of the city in Gujarat on the same day morning around 7 AM to enjoy the semester vacation with friends, but all enjoyable mood turned into very sad when devastating earthquake hit the Gujarat, I was on phone with my friend when earthquake was happening, I realised only when my friends father asked me to ran out of the house. We didn't hear much soon after that, so we went out to see one of the spiritual master who was visiting Vadodara, when we returned back, tears was flowing from my friends father eyes, thats when we came to know how much eathquake had affected the Gujarat. Within hours Mata Amritanadamayi Math dispatched a disaster-relief team of 15 doctors,who landed in Gujarat from Kerala. Along with some volunters and doctors from M.A Math we reached worst hit area the same day evening.  Immediately doctors started treating the patients, we all were assisting the doctors. Two days later two ambulances with fully loaded medicine came and we were doing lot of surgery in the ambulance and treating patients non stop day and night. 1) M.A. Math provided emergency shelter, food, and clothing to thousands of victims. 2)Medical assistance was provided for more than 6 months 3)M.A. Math adopted three entire villages that had stood near the earthquake's epicenter by rebuilding 1,200 homes, as well as medical clinics, water tanks, schools, community halls, temples and mosques. Roads, electricity, and sewage systems were also provided in this three villages   This was unforgettable event in my life also I never experienced such show of compassion and humanity in my entire life which was shown by M.A Math.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13772	4	/users/profile/15755	ammasmolu	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	I  met The Holy Mother Mata Amritanandamayi for the first time in 1992. I was greatly impressed by her compassion and her great work. She is known as the hugging saint and to date have hugged more than 23 million people!In 1997 Ammachi as she is known launched a project to build 25,000 homes for the homelessand the 5 year goal was reached with 6 people per home giving shelter to 125,000 people.Later greater than 40,000 homes were built in 60 locations in India. Ammachi have promised to make 100,000 homes.Later when the Indian Ocean Tsunami hit, Ammachi also built homes in Srilanka and Andaman and Nicobar islands.Ammachi's organisation is feeding greater than 2 million people in India.Uncooked rice, milk and other staples are provided to the deeply malnourished population. After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, Mata Amritanandamayi Math provided 6 million free meals to those affected which is greater than 185 tons of uncooked rice.In the united states Ammachi's followers provide cooked meals amounting to 73,000/ year for homeless and the starving in 40 cities.These are some of the projects. In the field of education, Mata Amritanandamayi Math is providing 100,000 scholarships for the students whose parents commited suicide due to failing crops. Farmer's suicide was like an epidemic in Northern India and sure enough Ammachi came to their help.When a major earthquake hit Gujarat, India, Ammachi adopted 3 villages and built houses, schools, hospital and temples. Ammachi pledged the highest amount for both the tsunami and the hurricane katrina relief work.These are some of her charitable works.These work of compassion impressed me the great.Hence a group of us in Minneapolis are working together to help 500 orphan children in one of the orphanages near Ammachi's ashram in India. Ammachi gave her permission and blessings for the same in June 2009.In Her ServiceHer humble devoteeRadha Menon
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13761	4	/users/profile/15745	Santhosh Kumar	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	My greatest experience was in the wake of Tsunami that hit many Asian countries in Asia, where hundreds of thousands of people died.I happened to be in India two days after Tsunami had struck. There was not much in the news since the whole nation was in shock and the reports were only emerging from different corners of India.I went to Mata Amritanadamayi Math as there were rumors of the Math being affected. When I reached the Math, I was amazed to see that the relief work had already started. Math was the first organization to react to this disaster, even before the Government reacted. 1) helping the local villagers bury the family they lost.2) Distributing food to the affected family. For the first few days, Math served almost 20,000 cooked gourmet meals three times every day. Later as the people started leaving the camps, around 10,000 meals were still being served for almost four months. In India there are no instant meals or microwaves. All the meals were cooked in gourmet style. I was part of the food distribution for few weeks where we would transport the food in trucks through places where road once existed. We would serve meals for almost 3 hours only to come back and return to distributing food in couple of hours.3) Build temporary shelter to house the evacuees. 4) Provide them with clothing. These were not used clothes. The clothes were brand new clothes.5) Medical campsThen came the long term relief efforts. Math committed $23 Million USD towards relief efforts. Long term relief efforts included likea) Build permanent housingb) Trauma care for children.c) Education and re-employment programd) provided fishing boats to the fishermenThe list was pretty exhaustive. What amazed me the most was that all these were done by 100% volunteer work. I donated $1000 and several others too contributed. Not a single $ of these went towards staffing costs. All the staffs were 100% volunteers. Later Math was invited by Govt of Sri Lanka to help the victims there. Math promptly extended the help to Sri Lanka too.I have never experienced such show of compassion and humanity in my entire life. I hope anyone who reads this gets an idea of the immense machinery that went to the help of people severely affected by force of nature like the Tsunami
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13759	4	/users/profile/15740	Saussi	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Amma's humanitarian efforts in the world at large are enormously impressive. She has developed hospitals, universities, rebuilt villages, donated millions of dollars to relief efforts, including Hurricane Katrina relief and relief from both the 12/26/04 tsunami and the most recent one. Amma's humanitarian work has inspired selfless service activities in countries all around the world. In fact, because of Amma's efforts, I have myself been inspired to start a program to feed the homeless in my home city.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13744	4	/users/profile/15724	KKBF	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Amma and all Her programs have personally touched my family's life in so many ways!As She sits before us we glimpse unconditional love, which is the Universal Truth. You see there is no other explanation for Her tireless hugging (she has embraced over 26 million people around the world), singing, consoling, praying and seva day in and day out, hour after hour. When there is love there is no effort!Recently our world has experienced many disasters some natural, some man-made, regardless of the situation, Amma's hummanitarian effort is there, not as just a showing up, but as a full force presence! She contributes monetarily and spiritually to causes like the Indian cotton farmers and thousands of their widows and orphans. Her programs actively rehabilitate hearts, homes, jobs and community well being after tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and floods. Her hospitals and University open their doors to thousands whose lives will never be the same again. All these millions of people too are glimpsing the Divine! I dare to dream with so many others, that perhaps a tiny spark of pure love will live in their hearts, like it does in mine, and that from there it can only grow out into the web that connects us all in our tiny global village. And after witnessing true selfless service to humanity, we will embrace those less fortunate and then the world, no, the Universe will never be the same again!Please see Her website at www.amma.org
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13727	6	/users/profile/15708	Cynthia	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Amma helps so many in need and quantifies the successes. One charity builds homes for people who are never dry due to living in rainy places without shelter. Another helps the extremely poor with medical and education. She also contributes to cutting edge medical research. There are so many pressing needs today. I feel good about contributing as funds are directed into so many good projects.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13725	6	/users/profile/15706	Ranjith Jim Box	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	My local Satsang group, Arcata Satsang, meets weekly to sort and organize clothing donations for the homeless. It entails collecting donations from a variety of sources. Sorting them into men's, women's, and children's. Occasionally we assist in serving meals to the local homeless population.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13713	6	/users/profile/15695	gabriela	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	The MA Math does an incredible job of organizing themselves and utilizing their resources. I am impressed with all of their endeavors - orphanages, schools, hospital, etc. - but mostly with their response to natural disasters.  Their efforts during the 2005 tsunami were simply astounding.  The ability to mobilize quickly and efficiently, and to draw on volunteers and donors around the globe for support, ranks very high for me. As far as possible they utilize volunteers, so I always know that all the funds I donate will go directly to those in need.  Further, I can always specify exactly where I want those dollars to go using their user-friendly online form. I am grateful for the work they do, and the opportunity to support it.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13604	6	/users/profile/15586	Amma900	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	I am actively involved in fund raising for Mata Amritanandamayi Math and als donate to it. The work of Mata Amritanandamayi Math is varied and far-reaching. One example - the Math provides monthly pensions for 100,000 impoverished men, women and children in India. The pensions are maintained over the recipient's lifetime. The continued support and expansion of this program and along with the many other Math initiatives will help to alleviate suffering immensely.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13575	7	/users/profile/15558	jflower7	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	This organization is working hard to save people from unnecessary death, disease, and poverty.  This is done through love and compassion which leads to programs that educate people to organic farming, to make textiles, to reuse plastic into something creative, and to provide and teach basic medical care so no one dies of treatable illnesses.  The success of this group in teaching others to survive and to be happy in this world is truly remarkable.  They also build thousands of homes for the impoverished and have built a bridge that at least 15,000 people can use to flee and be saved should another tsunami occur in that region.  The saying goes, "give the man a fish and he'll eat for a day...teach the man to fish and he'll eat every day".  This is a wonderful organization who should be rewarded for their constant and earnest efforts to create a better world for those who suffer.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13562	6	/users/profile/15544	cdconvisser	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	The M.A. Math is the purest voluntary and charitable organization that I have ever encountered in my life.  I cannot think of anything negative (or "constructive") to say about the Math.  I lived at its headquarters residential community in Amritapuri, Kerala for two months and was lucky then to travel for a third month observing and participating in the Math's far-flung programs throughout India.  The Math strives and succeeds in being genuine, selfless and down-to-earth in everything it does.  Thus, it has extraordinarily low overhead costs and it is able to enlist the cooperation and enthusiastic contributions of all kinds of people from around the world and in the Indian communities it touches.  Led by the example and teachings of the guru Amma, open-hearted people are drawn to the Math's programs and activities and lend to their service to others a vital passion.  In its educational programs stretching from the elementary schools all the way through graduate programs in the sciences, engineering, medicine, and education, the Math blends respect for the enduring truths of traditional ways with the most contemporary methods, techniques and knowledge.  The Math's health care services emphasize both a renaissance in ayurveda, which is centered at Amritapuri, and the most advanced procedures found in allopathic medicine at the AIMS Medical Center in Cochin, which attracts leading practitioners from Western countries, as well as India.  The Math's Greenfriends grass-roots environmental program brings the latest in permaculture teachings and common-sense environmental protection to India and in turn disseminates lessons gathered in India around the world.  The Math has a particular link to the poorest and most downtrodden.  Its orphanages provide love and resources that turn lost, young lives into well-adjusted and productive ones.  Following its comprehensive home-building project that gave beautiful and practical homes to thousands who lost theirs in the 2004 tsunami, the Math has turned its attention to helping farmers beset by debt and the children of the indebted farmers who have have unfortunately committed suicide as a result.  Counseling and scholarships give these children a boost from the tragedy that befell their fathers.  Thousands of people from around the world travel to India each year to partake in the Math's good works.  They take to their respective homes a sense of the unity and diversity that makes Indian society so remarkable and vibrant, enveloping our world in a spiritual fabric whose strings are the multitude of selfless acts the Math coordinates.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13548	6	/users/profile/15532	Ellena	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	I have spent about 2 months at the Amritapuri Ashram in Kerla, India over the past two years.  I went as a volunteer and partcipated in various Ashram activities such as food service and education.  While there I was personally able to witness the extraordinary results of the many faceted efforts of M.A. Math.  For example I was able to visit an orphanage in Kerala which is totally supported by M.A. Math.  The children there seemed very happy.  They are receiving an excellent education and are well trained in the fine arts such as dance and music.  I also observed students at an engineering college near the Ashram which is totally supported by M.A. Math.  In talking to some students I was very impressed by the fact that the percentage of female engineering students is nearly the same as the percentage of male students!  This is only one of many colleges, high schools and elementary schools in India built and supported by M.A. Math.  In the area near the ashram I observed numerous new homes built by M.A. Math following the tsunami.  M.A. Math built a total of 6,200 homes for tsunami victims in India, Sri Lanka and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.  M.A. Math has much experience in providing housing to the needy because they have built over 25,000 homes in India for the homeless and plan to build at least 75,000 more.  Another project prompted by the tsumani was the construction of the Armita Setu Bride inaurgurated by the President of India on  Dec. 26th, 2006.  This bridge connects the peninsula of Alappad Panchayat with the mainland of Kerala.  If there is another natural disaster in that area the bride will provide a centralized escape route that did not exist at the time of the tsunami.  I I marveled at the beauty and technolocy of this bridge each time I walked across it during my two months visit. There are many many more projects of M.A. Math.  I have only mentioned a few of them because those were the ones I had the most direct contact with.  I hope the work of M.A. Math will be recognized by InDiya Awards.
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13530	5	/users/profile/15514	KarmaLekyi	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Om Namah Shivaya,  Amma has been a guiding light in my life. Sometimes my eyes have been closed but She has always been there. She is the embodiment of Love.At Her Feet,L
Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13526	1	/users/profile/15510	mbnair	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	India is a country of billions. I grew up in India in a beautiful state called Kerala. I lived there until the 1980 when I got married and emigrated to the USA.Living in India, I have always wondered about the vast divide between people in the same country, same city and even the same town. Although Gandhi tried his best to bring all castes together, Indians, esp the high caste Indians, refused to assimilate. They always saw themselves as God's children while the rest of us were "ignored by God". The conditions in which women lived were even more disastrous. The lower caste women were the "lowest of the untouchables". No one helped them and they were abused by the Brahmins as well as the rest of the castes.In 2004 I heard about the work of MAM and was inspired enough to make a visit there. I was thrilled to see people working in her organization regardless of nationality, caste or religion! I soon learned that she had started schools for poor children (regardsless of caste, which is something new to India), even girls were given attention (WOW) and in addition to that, she used all the collections to create good hospitals for the poor. In India, men have all the power and women have nothing. So when men become alcoholics or men die, the women usually have to beg for food. Amma also found ways to help the women learn to sustain themselves! She gifted them brand new sewing machines and also taught them to sew! Now many of them have their own businesses! wow! During the Tsunami, Amma showed her benevolence by providing houses for people! She cajoled, begged and borrowed to make simple but sufficient houses for those who were living in huts! In a way, the people were better off after the Tsunami!! She is really an AMMA (Mother) to everyone regardless of caste or religion! WOW. I am sure she has changed the negative attitude of a lot of people in India into a positive one and also shown others by example what "looking out for each other" means. It has certainly changed my perspective on giving. When Hurricane Katrina came lashing through three states in the US, Amma gave a donation to President Clinton who was in charge of the organization which was collecting the donations. I have NEVER heard of any Indian organization giving to the USA or any other country in need! That was an eye-opener for me as well as for all of India, I am sure :)India has a lot of rich people, but they are more interested in giving lavish weddings to their daughters and spending millions to impress others. I am not kidding!It is refreshing and totally inspiring that a person who lived about 50 miles from my home in Kerala has made a mark (like Gandhi did) not only in her own home, but outside the country too!I wish there were many more Ammas like her in every country!Thanks for listening!Maya NairAlpharetta, GA.

Mata Amritanandamayi Math	13506	7	/users/profile/15492	sonnonfamily	Volunteer	5	10/13/2009	Amma changed my life and my business. Her counsel, leadership and insight has led us to greater prosperity, centeredness and filial strength... allowing us to be of greater service to our community. In one case, she advised us on how to complete a specific project for our company with which we were experiencing difficulties due to not knowing how to manage the people involved. Her insights she offered allowed us to facilitate solidarity with the project team and allowed us to surpass our intended goals!

Not only have i witnessed Amma personally console millions of people and express an interest in the lives of countless individuals, but i have also seen hospitals, orphanages, houses, clinics, tsunami relief and more blossom as a result of Her vision.  It is without doubt that Amma's work should be recognized and given the highest of accolades, even though Amma Herself has no desire for awards or recognition.

Significant economic development work is being done on so many different levels simultaneously, by volunteers from every walk of life!

Trying to find homes for kittens in Rincon is like selling water by the river but Defense is doing so much to help us get the word out and also to cover the costs of having the mother spayed.Hopefully she can now have a break in life and not have to keep having babies all the time.Thank you Defensa Animal De Rincon!

Defensa Animal De Rincon	310215		/users/profile/401567	scoochie9	Client Served	5	10/12/2016	I visited Rincon, Puerto Rico 3 years ago on vacation, where I met an extremely fearful, skinny, apparently nursing young dog mother. My sister and I tamed and fed her for the week we were there, having several conversations  with Cynthia from DAR, who encouraged us to take her with us when we left because that would be the best fate for her. Neither my sister nor I thought this could be possible, so we had to leave her behind. The next day another DAR volunteer found this sweet, scared dog, and was able to get her in the car to take her home and foster her, along with her many other foster dogs.When I got back home, I sent DAR a bunch of pictures of this doggy so they could put her up for adoption on their website. The next day, I saw her picture up there, and realized I needed to have her with me. So the DAR folks organized everything (these are all volunteers, mind you) from her health certificate to a ride to the airport at midnight for her journey to Boston.My sweet Pupito (I know it should be Pupita--forget about it!) is living on Cape Cod now, fat and happy, thanks to the infinitely kind and generous folks of DAR.  
Defensa Animal De Rincon	306987		/users/profile/398304	CarolynPig	Volunteer	5	09/29/2016	Defensa has been an integral part to assisting me in the foster and ultimate adoption out of 5 different animals. Animals that were doomed for a life on the street. One pair that sticks with me in particular were Rex and Rollo. Both dogs were on the beach, completely emaciated, Rex in particular with oozing wounds and near death. Defensa answered the call and found a way to leverage financial assistance as well as find an organization that was ready to place them both on their adoption list. Both dogs now reside with families in the United States and are healthy and loved. This is a group that always finds ways to say "Yes" instead of no and works to better the lives of many animals here in Puerto Rico 
Defensa Animal De Rincon	306599		/users/profile/397870	Alowellha	Client Served	5	09/26/2016	I have been involved with DAR for a few  years for different regards. There were very professional and extremely helpful in taking care of what often seems like an out-of-control stray dog situation in our area of Puerto Rico.

Defensa Animal De Rincon	297788		/users/profile/388600	ForCC	Volunteer	5	07/23/2016	I have been working on a volunteer basis with Defensa Animal de Rincon (DAR) for a number of years now. CC, the VEEP for DAR, this wonderful animal rescue group, is really great to work with. She and her organization are very committed to the rescue, fostering, and placement of countless numbers of animals into forever homes. This commitment is for dogs, and cats, and horses. CC and DAR have started a group in our town for horses, in which she and others work with local youth, giving group lessons and tutorials on how horses need to be treated and handled.  There are so many animals that have been placed into great forever homes through DAR, after having been abandoned and/or abused--it is a great pleasure to be associated with this important organization in our community.

Defensa Animal De Rincon	295980		/users/profile/386748	Tim_81	Client Served	5	07/12/2016	Defensa Animal De Rincon  came to the rescue.... I moved to Puerto Rico to start a new chapter in my life. I took in 3 kittens and named them Meowlyn Monroe, Miss McGillikitty, and Gata Gabor. During an emergency, Defensa Animal De Rincon  came to the rescue and assisted in finding a home and when the three female kitties were ready to go to that new home, there was no guarantee that they wouldn't have a whole bunch more kitties by getting pregnant. There was no way I could afford to have them fixed. Defensa Animal De Rincon  provided the services and saved a WHOLE BUNCH of trouble. BUT, THE MOST COMFORTING part of Defensa Animal De Rincon  is that there is sure and obvious accountability. There are simple, but required, forms to complete. I believe, after having to ask Defensa Animal De Rincon for help, when I never imagined needing it, that this is a nonprofit that really uses the donations wisely. I got to go visit Meowlyn Monroe, Miss McGillikitty, and Gata Gabor in the new home they have, all together. It was amazing and made me cry. Much better than any other alternate path.  Thanks Defensa Animal De Rincon

Defensa Animal De Rincon	285209	1	/users/profile/375195	sarajwright	Volunteer	5	04/07/2016	Defensa Rincon has made so many wonderful possibilities for us! We were fresh on the island when we heard of free horse classes, such a blessing. We instantly fell in love with the rescue horses used in the class and were so grateful as horse lessons were just not in the budget. As a lesson of stewardship we volunteered to tend to two new rescue horses in December who were in terrible shape. The mare had never been handled and was untouchable, both came with severe rain rot, hoofs in terrible health and they were emaciated. Over the next few weeks of nursing them back to health a bond was formed. We were able to begin fostering our special friends and gained a love for them that is so wonderful. They are now up to weight, growing manes, hoofs looking good after lots of time, love and work plus a few other appreciated volunteer hands. They have taught us so much about perseverance and breaking barriers. It is so rewarding to be able to see a transformation so incredible. We are blessed to be able to adopt Pancho and Lefty and will be moving them to our own home very soon. Thanks to the gracious efforts of Defensa for the opportunities and services provided. Rescue an animal, its good for the soul :)

The dedication and love for all animals should not go unnoticed.  The passion for these animals and to literally turn your own personal home into an animal rescue takes everything one has to its limits.  I personally have one of Adri's rescues and have fostered numerous dogs from her facility.  I'd like to give her much more than five stars.  Anyone that can help and support this organization please do....I encourage everyone to give whatever they can spare to allow Adri to continue to save soooo many animals.
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	287166	3	/users/profile/377249	Susan454	Board Member	5	04/24/2016	I have worked with the president and founder of this organization for many years.  Adri Galler has paved the way for many non profit animal rescue groups in Puerto Rico.  She runs her own shelter, moving thousands of animals off the streets of Puerto Rico onto the US mainland, depending solely on donations from private citizens.  She has algo organized many spay and neuter events in poor neighborhoods and began bringing an Animal Control Officer and Cruelty Investigator program to Puerto Rico several years ago.  Thanks to her efforts, there are now almost 300 ACO/CI's on the island working hand  in hand with police officers to deal with the problem of animal cruelty and abandonment cases on the island.  She's one of the pioneers in Puerto Rico and I urge you to support her continuing efforts to put an end to this problem on the island.
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286416	1	/users/profile/376540	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/22/2016	Amigos de los Animales in Puerto Rico is such a great organization, I don't know where to start writing this review. The problem of stray dogs on the island is shocking and saddening. Amigos de los Animales (ADLA) is swimming upstream with new and sad cases every day, but they do everything they can to help every single dog. Even though sometimes it looks like there is no hope, ADLA will make sure that doggy survives or at least has known love in its life! I cannot imagine how it must be to take care of all those dogs day in, day out 24/7, so I can only say that I have a lot of respect for every single part of the team.
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286384	1	/users/profile/376502	Writer	Donor	5	04/21/2016	I know the great need that unwanted animals have in Puerto Rico, and because of the incredibly large number of homeless animals on the streets, they have literally become "invisible", because they are everywhere and you're expected to see them. Everyday. More than one. It only becomes a "problem" when they're on your way. Then they're a nuisance.That's when animal sanctuaries such as "Amigos De Los Animales" get involved and try to rescue as many as they possibly can. The work is hard, never ending, resource exhausting, and incredibly demanding, but most of all, as they themselves would tell you, exceedingly rewarding. They deserve our help.

I'll attach a photo of the book I've written about her rescue and her work as a certified therapy dog. Bella was saved from this dangerous and terrible place, fostered by a local woman, then sent to the shelter in Puerto Rico and flown to Newark, NJ to St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center. My husband and I adopted Bella at about four months old. Without Amigos de los Animales Bella wouldn't have made it. I can't recommend this group strongly enough and they really need your support.

Last year, I found Amigos de los Animales while searching how to adopt a sato.  I immediately fell in love with a picture of an adoptable dog, Alysha, who looked like a corgi mixed with a fox.  I called Adri and spoke w/ her at length about our family (twin girls, 2 cats, an old Jack Russell terrier) and how she thought Alysha would do.  Adri assured me that Alysha was "good w/ kids, good w/ other dogs, and not sure about cats, but will probably be fine because she'll want to please you.  She loves to go on car rides and would make a good agility dog because she loves to jump"  I'll never forget picking Alysha up at the airport w/ my daughters.  Adri was honest and so dedicated.  Alysha is the perfect fit for our family!  Satos make great pets and Amigos de los Animales is a great organization!
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286286	2	/users/profile/376383	Writer	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	This nonprofit is INCREDIBLE.  My husband found it when we were on a cruise which had departed from San Juan.  We fell in love with a stray dog in the mountains and decided that if we could find him again, we would do anything in our power to take him home.   When my husband called the number for Amigos de los Animales (which he found through searching the web), we immediately connected with Adri -- and history was made!  She helped us find "Coqui," got him the proper vet treatment, and shipped him back to NY for us once he was strong enough to fly.  He is my soul-mate pup and a VIP family member.  A year later Adri sent us "Dimas," Coqui's brother-from-another-mother (haha) -- who immediately connected with my infant daughter (and they've been inseparable ever since).  Adri is so deeply committed to the dogs (and to the people!) that she rescues - and it was amazing how she came to know us and know Coqui enough to pick out the perfect new addition to the family.  I have known her now for many years and am inspired by the love and devotion she feels for the animals and the many sacrifices she has made to keep the nonprofit running.  Please support this great organization.   You can see from the photo how much joy these pups have brought to our lives, all thanks to Amigos for rescuing them.

Adri, the founder, truly cares for and goes above and beyond for the abandoned animals in Puerto Rico.  She runs her shelter from her own house-taking care of, feeding, bathing, vaccinating--and most important sterilizing all the animals she rescues.  Due to the poor economic situation of the island, I really admire Adri's commitment, spark and drive to continue on and look to and work for a brighter future for the animals!  Donations go 100% towards the care and rehabilitation of the animals.
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286264	3	/users/profile/376355	TraerS	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2016	Amigos is a grassroots, totally hands-on rescue that is literally on the front lines every day in Puerto Rico helping the endless tide of abused and abandoned animals there. I have worked with them personally and know that every dollar donated goes directly to the care of these animals in need. Funds are always low because of the huge vet bills incurred from treating and sterilizing the animals and there are simply not enough homes for them but founder Adri continues to devote her life to caring for the dozens of animals that are housed in her home turned shelter.
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286250	3	/users/profile/376338	Jennifer531	Volunteer	5	04/20/2016	I do not have enough wonderful things to say about Amigos De Los Animales (ADLA)! ADLA provides a very difficult service to the island of Puerto Rico due to the horrific problem of animal over population and general lack of education on animal care and welfare. ADLA does their best to take in dogs off the street that are abused, neglected, and often very ill. They get the animals vet care, socialize them, and then help find new homes in the US main land when possible. They are also very active on the island in neuter/ spay programs and education. They are a hard working and dedicated group that have a very difficult mission.  Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession for over a decade now and with more troubled economic times in the foreseeable future, many people are moving to the US mainland. With the large numbers of people leaving, ADLA are seeing an even bigger influx of abandoned animals on the street. The dog overpopulation crisis in PR has always been a problem, but in light of the local economic crisis, it has become increasingly difficult for local animal organizations to find funding and assistance.In spite of the economic hardships, and the shelters bursting at the seams with dogs, these amazing heroes keep at it every day for the sake of the animals. They are selfless, hardworking people who live everyday with a passion for the animals, and who stand up for what is right. They do not let discouraging situations keep them from tending to the animals that rely on them.This is a top notch organization worthy of praise and admiration.

I came to learn about Amigos over a year ago from my son, who chose to volunteer there on weekends for his school.  Then, last month, I witnessed a horrible accident where a beautiful yellow labrador-mix ran out into traffic and was hit by a Mack truck.  I was able to rescue the dog and take him to a local vet, who was able to treat him for his injuries.   I decided to adopt this beautiful dog, but I don't live on the island and had nowhere to leave him until he was well enough to fly.  Thanks to Amigos, they offered to keep him safe and even took him to follow-up doctors visits related to complications from the accident.  For Adri, it was just one more rescue out of the hundreds of lives that she has saved.  Please support the work of Amigos.  They offer a special place where so many helpless animals have found shelter, food and love.  Now all they need are families to adopt them.

Amigos also offers school children (and their families) with the opportunity for community service hours which many schools now require (thankfully). The children and adults that come to volunteer at Amigos are changed forever by the experience.  Well done Amigos!!
Amigos De Los Animales Inc	286215	4	/users/profile/376301	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/19/2016	I have been volunteering and colaborating with the president of Amigos de los Animales (ADLA) since 2009 and have been amazed by how much the organization has grown and developed. The shelter rehabilitates and homes over 100 dogs each year and finds loving homes for them in Puerto Rico and the U.S. They also work with local vets to neuter and vaccinate as many dogs as possible to help solve the overpopulation problem at its root cause. I created the current ADLA logo on the t-shirts and assisted the organization in its sale and distribution of the shirts, marketing campaign, video creation and social media presence. I have raised over $800 through fundraisers at the University of Richmond where I have spread awareness of the organization to Alpha Phi Omega, a volunteer fraternity of over 100 members who plans to support ADLA in the future. I do all of this as a volunteer because of the love I have for their mission and the visible work that they do. My family has now adopted 3 adorable dogs from this shelter and plans to continue this relationship in the future. Due to the devastating economic situation in Puerto Rico, families have been abandoning their animals in larger numbers and dogs who are already homeless are not being taken in. ADLA needs all the help they can get right now so if you are looking for a loving companion or can make any donation amount, please help this wonderful non-profit.

Humane Society Of Puerto Rico Inc	105629		/users/profile/141946	HPower	Donor	5	02/02/2012	My story began when my group of 10grade students of Colegio Radians came to donate special equipement to the organization. We also helped them by watching and taking care of the mistreated animals that were in this organization. We realized the importance it is to have and protect your pet from diseases. I had an amazing experience in this society and I know my partners did, too.

Advanced Bilingual School Inc	296125	3	/users/profile/386897	pepitalaloca	Volunteer	5	07/13/2016	To those who are writing bad things about this school, too bad you are not brave enough to show your names, and I must say I am a parent of two children that studied in this school for 6 years,which are already professionals. People have different experiences according to the way they conduct themselves or their children. I personally never had a situation at this school, of course my children had good manners, good grades, and were well behaved. As a matter of fact, one of my kids had a situation with a teacher, and I called the office, made an appointment and the situation was solved. There is a teacher that has been working for years at that school, I forgot her last name because it isn't common, she is an excellent professional, always willing to help the students and parents, she is a sweet, understanding and great teacher. My son was highly influenced by her, she motivated him to study, and she became his roll model. The experience,facilities,curriculum, professionals,makes this a great school.The Director has to be strict,otherwise students wont respect, she influenced  my smallest son and he was able to enter the army. Don't listen to what people write, visit the school, talk to parents that have their children there, and have your own opinion.People use this tool to harm others reputation because of their own frustration. 
Advanced Bilingual School Inc	267111	1	/users/profile/355860	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	10/25/2015	If you are going to put your child in this school DON'T DO IT this school has so  many bad things you will be surprised so I'm going to list a few by the way me and my friends used to be a student and some still are so weve had first hand experiences. 1The school has favorites what do I mean by this is that the director has a few students as her favorites so they never get in trouble and always get good grades why do I know this I saw a students teststudents and it said 76%and when they put the grade it said 100% now you must be thinking they probably reevaluated but that's not the case because according to the school they can't reevaluate a single student it needs to be a large group whic wasn't the case.2 the school never gets mantainance why? Because there are 2 bathroom stalls in the boys  bathroom and none of them work and it's been a year since they haven't fixed them said my trusted friend that stills studies there and there is never soap in the bathroom or paper towels. Also when I was there they never painted the school and they still haven't honestly for me the director just takes the money for herself. 3 Some students report not having a homeroom techer 4 same food in the lunchroom 5 You can't speak up your mind because you will get in trouble 6 lame rules example:If you have your phone in you pockets we will take it away or No girlfriends or boyfrieda if u have any we will ban u from this school for a week 7 NO SECURITY IN THE CLASSROOMS people have gotten a hold of this advantage and started stealing  and the school just says we  will find the person and they never  did plus with the phone in your pocket rule u are forced to put your phone in the backpack and run the risk of it getting stolen . THOSE ARE some of  the resons why thisb.school is bad
Advanced Bilingual School Inc	194345	3	/users/profile/253946	Anon4	Volunteer	1	02/15/2014	I was a studenr for Advanced Bilingual School and to say it was a nightmare it is an understatement. This school promotes the ideals of tyranny. She has no respect for anyone and DOES NOT USE THE COMPUTER LAB OR MAKES SPORTS TEAM! I hace to say that since I hace encountered people who have been used that lie on. The school has a team of POWER GIRLS which they are hearing and seeing everything you do to run and tell the director. And what they say GOES. She controls the school in every aspect. You have no say and you can't voice your opinions. They indirectly enforce you their religion by making you by a Bible for homeroom (Catholic Bible). The Director is what ruins the school! She even makes teachers comfront the parejts when it is her duty to do as so. As a teacher you are oprresed under her commands. And you have to go by the plans, as a student even by breathing they make you pay! The director has no ability of communicating since she yells at everyone! She also does not tolerate seeing kids running in their LUNCH BREAK!  This school is great if you want to be yelled at, can't voice out your opinion and have kids of second or third tattletaling nonsense and LIES to her. This school needs a NEW DIRECTOR TO PROSPER!
Advanced Bilingual School Inc	58663	3	/users/profile/62664	Anonymous	Volunteer	1	12/10/2010	Anyone looking to register their childern in Advanced Bilingual School (ABS) plesae DO NOT.This is one of the worst administered schools I have seen. The director owns the school and whatever she says go. She has her family emplpyeed and they do whatever they want and do not allow parents to voice their opinions. The director intimidates the teachers into saying and doing what she wants. I was forewarned by other parents before regisering my little one. After a year I see they were correct. The teachers, her family and herself falsely accuse the childern and parents of behaviors they did not commit and as a parent you are not allowed to dispute it. What she says goes and since she has the authority there she can expel your child without you having chance to discuss the situation.Her son was a simiing teacher and most girls felt uncomfortable the way he would look at them. When a parent confronted him and his mother (the irector) they denied it happened and they accussed the paren tof harrassement. This school is a nightmare....do your research and talk to the other parents before putting your kids and yourself throught this horrible experience. I sincerely regret regisering my children in this school.

Estancia Corazon Inc	129402	4	/users/profile/174771	Daniel Pimentel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2012	An Oasis in the desert. This metaphor can give you an image of how important Estancia Corazon is in the west coast of Puerto Rico. Most of the money (grants, federal agencies and state agencies) for health services go to the north part of the island (Metro Area) forgetting most of the time the struggle for services in the west. Here is were Estancia is a saving Oasis for those in need even in this desert of lack of resources. They will take care of your health needs if is in their hands, they will guide you hand in hand to find the agency that can give you the health care needed. All of this no matters the money is available or not. I have the honor to work for them in the past... I have the privilege now to be a volunteer.
Estancia Corazon Inc	128835	1	/users/profile/174100	Rosemary Rodriguez	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	This organization has provided for the last 19 years services to HIV patients and homeless people in the west part of Puerto Rico.  First of all they provided meals to 100 persons daily where also the counselors bring some coaching in order to rehabilite their situation and increase life of quality.  Also they bring temporary home for some of them where they received life coach, individual re-integration process to society and re adaptation to community life activity. Actually of Estancia Corazon participant are part of PR workforce and even some of them get their college diploma. Eventhough some of our participants have passed away, that's not a reason to abdicate our mission or to close our programs. We need everyone to be part of this mission in order to get a more healthy society where everyone should be instrumental in the benefits of Puerto Rico.

Programa De Educacion Comunal De Entrega Y Servicio Inc	214424		/users/profile/277686	lisamariezayas	Volunteer	5	09/10/2014	Over the past three decades, P.E.C.E.S. has done a great job to develop the community of Humacao, a small coastal town in Puerto Rico.

Juan Domingo En Accion Inc	93786		/users/profile/108114	ras200	Board Member	5	07/12/2011	I met the director of the program at an economic conference in Puerto Rico; where the speakers discussed about the socioeconomic deterioration of the island's conditions and the short-term myopic policies that were doing little to soothe concerns about our pressing challenges. I chatted with Ana (the director) about life as a recent grad and transition coming back home. She understood my interests and took down my contact info and about a month later I heard back from her, inviting me to join an economic committee for a project she was running at her public school. The first meeting we had was in a children's classroom at the public school she ran (Juan Domingo) where I met the other committee members. These were not volunteers looking to polish their resumes or individuals with their own private agendas in mind, but rather, individuals with established careers who dedicated short-space of time to devote to the cause of Juan Domingo, in other words, to safeguard and preserve the high-quality public school education in Puerto Rico. This proved overwhelming for me, since I barely had the experience of my peers, but it also provided an opportunity to break from the impetus of apathy and become more active in social justice. Ana inspired confidence not just among the committee members, but among the teachers and students who attend the school. It has created a sense of optimism in the community and inspired others in the ability to achieve change in areas that have far been too neglected. 
VolNepal	36642	8	/users/profile/37427	johngrant	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	My time in Nepal has been one of a kind. Although I have traveled a lot in my lifetime this trip has been inspirational as well as eye opening in ways I had never imagined. Coming here, I knew that the Kanti Children hospital was not cutting edge. However, after my first day I realized that while doing what they can the doctors and nurses have little to no means to up the standard of care and comfort for the children. I cannot imagine any other place that would introduce me to the real basic principles of medicine as well as here. Volunteering at Kanti has successfully shocked me in ot my profession, a priceless experience.Being placed in a host family was also a valuable experince. The Dahal family has given me a saste of Nepal that no guest house or hostel could have provided. However, the Nepalese mentality is very protective of its women in thaqt they are to be home by a certain time and wear certain things. While this was an interesting experince, I decided to live in a guest house for the last two days to spend more time with other volunteers, I had met and not feel bad about being home for dinner. I will however, never forget the great hospitality of my host family and will continue to stay in contact.The trips to pokhara and Nagarkot proved to be great fun. I felt very sage at all times and I got to see some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever encountered.All in all, I can ony say that I am already planning my next trip to Nepal.

Taller Salud Inc	234708		/users/profile/302660	Eval-123	Advisor	3	11/30/2014	Organizacion que dice promover el bienestar de la mujer puertorriquena y sin embargo se ve que re-cae en el amiguismo caracteristico de ONGs del pais. Personalmente me contrataron para cumplir con sus numeros para sus financiadores, luego ni la opcion de ser consultora y/o voluntaria, etc. Su alcance al lado oeste de la isla es gesta que aplaudo, mas sin embargo podrian expandir mas su trabajo, traer mas voluntariado, hacer un compromiso mas directo con su comunidad. Quiza esto ayudaria a construir un poder de autofinanciamiento que evite pagarle tarde a sus empleados. Creo que el fervor politico y ciego de algunos de sus empleados opaca la calidad verdadera del trabajo cultural y educativo que hacen. En la panaderia del lado te tratan mejor que el equipo de las que te reciven cuando vas a buscar condones a la oficina de TS.  Es importante reconocer que entre el equipo de trabajo se nota las ganas de meter mano en esa comunidad donde estan y se denota con el trabajo anti violencia que hacen; esa es una verdadera coneccion comunitaria. Ese modelo debe ser implementado en otras partes de la isla en conjunto con las propuestas del programa de Zualetemba Peace Makers del licenciado Daniel Ninna.

Friends Of Culebra Animals Inc	278233		/users/profile/342598	SydVA	Donor	5	01/28/2016	We visited Culebra this past December and were able to see the things they are doing on this small island to help the animals there.  A small very dedicated group of folks have  made a big impact on the tiny island by involving the citizens and tourists alike.  They have a wonderful feral cat colony feeding program at several beaches.  They have built structures on posts to give the kitties access to fresh food and water and keep other animals out.  (There are a LOT of wild chickens/roosters on the island that eat the cat food!)   They have a Vet come to the island once a month for spaying, shots and medical check ups. They sell t-shirts/bags and other items to raise awareness and funds for  these group and what it does.  It also recently won a $1,000 grant through a contest  recently to help the animals.  They have fund raisers and help the general population with their animals when they can.  I was very impressed with all they do on a tiny island to make lives better for the animals.
