Lingap Childrens Foundation	320121		/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	12/14/2016	I can't let 2016 go by without encouraging everyone to vote for the Lingap Childrens Foundation.  They have not only rescued these children from the street, but have educated them; hence, their lives will be forever changed.  Please go to their website and read of this incredible endeavor.  More importantly please consider their "Place At the Table" program.  For a mere $300 a year they are able to house, feed and educate a child.  This is truly a wonderful program.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	242190	3	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	05/05/2015	Once again I would like to encourage EVERYONE to donate to this incredible children's foundation.  Lingap has not only saved children's lives but also educated and gave them the tools to literally turn their lives around.  Without a doubt it is my absolute FAVORITE charity.  The founder, John Drake, is truly an AMAZING individual.  He and his Board of Directors personally pay for all administrative costs, hence, donors have the assurance that every cent they donate is used for the children.  I know of no better return on my investment.  Mr. Drake also regularly keeps all donors advised of current events.  I feel blessed having interacted with him -- I think he's a living saint.  Please check out their website (www.lingapcenter.org)  and read the lovely and beautiful story of Lingap.  I promise you, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  Then please consider donating to their  "Place At The Table Program" -- for a mere $300 a year they can house and educate a child.  That's less than we spend everyday on coffee.  Please think seriously about it, you won't be sorry!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	236707	4	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	01/12/2015	Lingap Childrens Foundation is my VERY FAVORITE charity. It's unbelievable what John Drake has accomplished.  Every penny donated is used for the children and not for any administrative costs, as Mr. Drake and his Board of Directors personally pay for all administrative expenses.  These children who once lived on the street are now in school and attend Church.  They anticipate that 21 children will be enrolled in college next year.  Since education is the best defense against poverty, their lives will be totally changed.  I love knowing that my mere $300 per year for Lingap's  "Place At The Table" Program will feed, house and educate a child.  What a fantastic return on such a small investment.  Thank you, John for all you've done for these children and for the wonderful feeling I experience with each quarterly $75 donation.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	197071	4	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	04/04/2014	The Lingap Children's Foundation is my FAVORITE charity.  Hopefully, this year will be the 3rd year that they've won top honors with "Great Nonprofits".  They deserve it.  I know of no other charity that is run so well, or made such a difference in the lives of countless homeless children.  Please support them.   Any amount will be helpful.  As a donor in their "Place At The Table Program" I can't tell you how wonderful  I feel knowing that my little $300 per year will make such a difference in the life of a child.  Because John Drake and the Board of Directors pay all administrative costs, every penny donated truly goes to the children.  For such a little amount, Lingap is able to house, feed and educate a child.  Quite a fantastic return on investment, wouldn't you say?  If you can't help them financially, please remember them in your prayers.  Thank you :)
Lingap Childrens Foundation	152233	3	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	04/05/2013	Everyone -- Please know:  Every cent contributed is used on the children.  Absolutely no money is spent for administration expenses.  Mr. Drake you're surely loved by each of the children who reside in the Lingap home, whose lives are forever changed as a result of this foundation.  Thank you for giving me an opportunity to feel as if I'm really able to help in this wonderful endeavor by participating in the Lingap "Place At The Table" program -- for a mere $300 a year, Lingap is able to feed, clothe and educate a child.  Surely the best return on any investment I could ever possibly make.  Hugs and love to you, Mrs. Drake and all of the children! Jean Barber
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134765	4	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	11/07/2012	I first learned of the Lingap Children's Foundation several years ago while reading a large (2 or 3-page) article in the Sunday edition of the Detroit Free Press.  The Lingap Children's Foundation is an AWESOME organization.  It was started by Mr. John Drake from Jackson, Michigan, in a very, very poor city named Toledo City, in the Philipines  -- a country literally on the other side of our World.  John was a business executive on what was going to be one of his last trips to the Philipines before his retirement I believe, but God had other plans for John!  I strongly encourage you to visit Lingap's website (www.lingapcenter.org) and read this incredible, miraculous story -- it will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  Lingap's first home had previously been a slaughter house for pigs.  From that humble beginning, they have built a wonderful safe home for the children.  John and his Board members pay for all administration costs.  Every single penny donated to the Lingap Foundation goes for the children.  I personally chose to participate in their "Place At The Table Program".  For a mere $300 a year they are able to house, feed and educate a child.  Truly, I can't tell you how good I feel when my quarterly payment of $75 is sent..................Just knowing that for such a small amount of money I'm helping in my own little way for a child to be provided with not only shelter, safety, and an education, but also LOVE.  They even have tutors to help the children excel in their school work.  They had several of their children graduate from college this year -- what an accomplishment.  In addition to approximately 100 children who live at Lingap year round, they teach and feed literally hundreds of other street children.  John stays in touch with all donors on a very regular basis by sending updated news letters.  This organization is truly one of my absolute favorites.  Please check out their website and perhaps help in any way that you can.  Kindest regards.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	104941	3	/users/profile/140839	megrandmomjean	Donor	5	01/30/2012	What John Drake from Jackson, Michigan, has done for more than 100-children in the Philippines is TRULY incredible!  I read a 3-page article in the Detroit Free Press several years ago and was moved enough to become a member of this group's "Place At the Table".....For only $300.00 a year they are able to house, clothe and educate a child for the entire year!  John Drake and members of their Board pay ALL administrative costs, so every single penny donated goes to the children.  PLEASE read his 45-page document on this website named "I Heard God's Call, But How Will I Answer", maybe it will move you as it has me.................This program is so successful.  I'm thrilled each March when I make my donation, knowing that there is one child being cared for and given a chance in life due to that little amount of money.  If you are unable to donate, please remember this wonderful organization in your prayers and spread the word among your friends.....It is an AWESOME charity.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	301360	2	/users/profile/392277	jchanley	Donor	5	08/23/2016	I've been donating to the Center since 2006 and have been to the Center 5 times. It has been the best experience of my life. John took us to visit the schools and homes the children came from. He has saved these children from deplorable conditions and given them a great chance at a new life. The Center and staff are the best. The children love having us there and we love showering with our love. I'm planning on going again this year, and can't wait to see them all again. Please keep donating to this great Charity.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	299523	6	/users/profile/378027	John Ryan B	Client Served	5	08/07/2016	I'm John Ryan and I am one of the Lingap kids. I was admitted at the Center when I was 6 years old back in the April of 2004 at the old Lingap Center, which was literally a converted pig-slaughterhouse. Life before I came to the Lingap Center was pretty hard. I lost my mother because of pneumonia and my father was jobless. He hardly could not provide all the basic needs of our family of 9 children. I cannot eat 3 meals a day or most of the time, eat nothing at all. I was very sickly all those years brought by malnutrition. That is why, I am very thankful and happy for this enormous blessing and all the people behind this project especially to Tito John and his family for they wholistically changed me. I am now very healthy and am studying at a prestigious school outside of Cebu. This would not have happened if not for the Lingap Center who gave me another chance to have a life and an education. Thank you very much!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	292640	4	/users/profile/383182	borqueb	Donor	5	06/10/2016	I was blessed enough to visit the Lingap Center for a week in late May/early June and the experience exceeded my expectations. John Drake spoke at our church 3 years ago and my wife and I have been Place at the Table contributors since then. We were so impressed with the approach to operating the Center, but most of all, the success that the Center has had with children who really had no hope at all. Seeing the squatter villages where several of the children used to live and the Center itself first hand gave me a great appreciation for the truly miraculous efforts of the Lingap manager and staff and the far reaching impact that the Lingap Center has on the surrounding community, especially the schools and a few of the children's families that the Lingap staff provided a small bag of food to, gave me a great appreciation for what is being accomplished. As John likes to quote, "Let my heart be broken with the things that break the heart of God." In this instance though, while I saw many things in the squatter villages that must break the heart of God, what I was most touched by is that my heart is rejoicing at the Lingap Center and it's kids for God's heart must also be rejoicing.  We will continue to be strong supporters of the Lingap Childrens Foundation and have already started encouraging others to join us.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	288180	7	/users/profile/378392	Mr.Dorschnr	Donor	5	05/04/2016	Hi this is Dave in Tucson Arizona. I am extremely blessed to be married to an alumni of Lingap Children's Foundation. I met Aileen Bantolinao when she was completing an internship as part of her college degree from University of San Carlos. Aileen was working at  the  Marriott Hotel in Cebu and I was very impressed with her demeanor and personality  and realized very quickly that there was something very special that set her apart from the other employees. After her internship was completed we started dating  and I took the time to find out that she was raised from age 8 at the Lingap Children's Center and was now completing her college degree in Tourism Management.  This climate of success was created by the Lingap Children's Center under the guidance of John Drake.  It is an age old axiom that the values a child learns at an early age are what sets their life time agenda. In Aileen's case it is obvious that the values instilled by her Mother before her passing and the real world, work ethic and personal traits of human respect and pride in self and accomplishment from the Lingap Center are the heart of what sets her apart and makes her a joy to be around. She is appreciated by all who know her.  Aileen enjoys life and is obviously, very appreciative of her opportunities and takes every opportunity to help others in subtle ways..  always giving  a "hand up" and not a hand out. From the beginning of our relationship and constantly reinforced,  is my understanding of just how irreplaceable the upbringing at Lingap is to Aileen and hundreds of other young people who would NEVER have the opportunity  to achieve without the Lingap Children's Center.  I am very proud to start our continuing donations to Lingap tonight and will continue to do so in the years to come.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	288177	5	/users/profile/378391	Mrs.Dorschnr	Client Served	5	05/04/2016	Greetings to everyone! This is Aileen Bantolinao, a former Lingap ward for almost 12  years. I am now happily married with my wonderful husband Dave and we are now residing in Tucson, Arizona.  I spent my elementary and high school years while at Lingap. The Lingap Children's  Foundation financed my further education where I attended at the University of San Carlos and completed  my Bachelor's Degree in Tourism Management in Cebu City, Philippines. Following my degree completion, I was offered a yearlong internship at the  Baltimore Country Club - one of the most Prestigious Clubs in the world. I am very fortunate. All of these wonderful things that I have received would not have been possible without the help and guidance of  Tito John Drake, the Founder of the Lingap Children's Foundation who is not just a provider but stands as a great Father figure when our own could not. The guidance, life skills training and values provided by the Lingap Children's Foundation are with me everyday. It is truly an honor to have completed my degree and everyday of my working life will be influenced by my upbringing at Lingap. Now that I am an alumni to the Lingap Children's Foundation, its my honor to help and give back.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	288167	4	/users/profile/178912	kasszette	Former staff	5	05/03/2016	I am a former staff of the Lingap Center ,I miss the kids when they sing "God help the outcast "and one of the favorite songs of JFD ."What a wonderful world", the accommodating and very friendly staff.The thought of was being part of the institution makes me proud  since I have seen all the successful Lingap kids like Aileen Bantolinao, Rhocsan Baron, Morin Jade Lacay, Mark Jay Tabo and his salutatorian sister Rosemae and others , I felt so bless to know these kids grow and succeeded and these good things happened in the Philippines will not be possible without the help and efforts of an American guy John F. Drake. He is also helping or extending help through community outreach, in schools also like West Bay Learning Center, Toledo Science National School as far as I know since the school principals told me since I am now having my  teaching career. I also miss the conversation with the US visitors were we laugh our indifferences, especially Jane and Tita Judy also. You need not to be the president of the Philippines just to help those who are in need . To all US supporters, in behalf of all Toledanos\ Filipinos we owe you all a lot .
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133206	3	/users/profile/178912	kasszette	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/04/2012	I am very grateful to be part of the Lingap Center since 2007, I would take this opportunity to thank my boss  Sir John Drake, for accepting my imperfections and willing to accept me for who I am. Being a Filipino it is very hard for me to cope up, but you try to understand me as well as  the other staff. i am also thankful to Tita Judy of course, to the travellers keep coming and spread the GOOD NEWS and to all the Lingap Supporters, in behalf of the kids and staff, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	287894	9	/users/profile/378020	marleneuy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/01/2016	I joined the Lingap Children's Foundation as a social worker since 2013.  I have been working to several residential cares for disadvantaged children but I find the big difference because at Lingap we work as a real family. The staff considered the children as their own.  We showed our genuine love and care where these kids are being deprived of such.  We inculcate in them the good moral values, empowered to stand and protect their rights and you can see them being transformed dramatically. Children whose knowledge is only to beg and just lived on the streets, hopeless and no education but once they arrived at Lingap the transformation began.  As a social worker, I find my greatest achievement seeing the kids changed and I salute the founder, Mr. John Drake for making difference of the lives our less privileged children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	280652	7	/users/profile/370583	Teah D.	Donor	5	02/21/2016	After hearing John Drake speak, our family was immediately touched by this charity and the children's situations. After hearing more about the Lingap Center we decided to help with donations, and we are very glad that we have. This charity is a not only saving children from the poor streets of the Philippines, but staging them for a successful life by not only looking after their needs to be feed and clothed, but the Lingap center is amazingly focused on their educational and mental well being of all the children. The team there has also been apart of so many miracles it would be to hard to list them all. If anyone would like to read more about John Drake and the wonderful miracles, he offers his story in a free ebook:  http://www.lingapcenter.org/pdf/GodsCall.pdf . This is a real life story of the Lingap Center and the children. It is a story that will touch your heart to what a true miracle that the Lingap Center is.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	278210	6	/users/profile/368125	Writer	Donor	5	01/28/2016	John Drake spoke at a mission in my parish several years ago and was inspirational.  I made a one-time donation but decided two years ago to donate monthly.  I know the foundation is saving and improving the lives of many children and am happy that all of my donation goes directly to support the children.  I have talked with John personally and his letters are very informative.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	277884	6	/users/profile/367730	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/24/2016	In 2009 I volunteered at the Lingap Center. Today, I am  still in touch with some of the young people I met during my life changing experience.  They are going to college, becoming successful adults, and becoming worthwhile citizens. When one came to the U.S. two summers ago I  took her around one of the area universities. Her soul mission, to give back and help others. I continually hear from these young adults; the Lingap Center made the difference. Where would they be today without the Center?  We are now donors and active supporters of Lingap. The university where I teach, I always share about the work at the Lingap Center. Poor children are capable, poor children have potential, and poor children do not chose to be poor.  This center is living testimony of quality work in our world.  This first hand testimony to college students is always motivating to them.  They always discuss their desire to do more with the poor in the U.S. and around the world. Lingap is a living legacy that needs to replicated throughout the world.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	277542	6	/users/profile/367356	Writer	Donor	5	01/21/2016	What a beautiful project - helping children who would otherwise be hopeless in a hostile environment for little children.  Best of all,  100% of donations go directly to the benefit of these little children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	277288	3	/users/profile/367082	kkweeks	Donor	5	01/20/2016	If I only could choose one charity organization to contribute to, The Lingap Center would be it!  What this group does is truly a miracle.  The Lingap Center is an amazing agent of change in the Philippines!  The best part ... 100% of your donation goes directly to the children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	273659	4	/users/profile/362926	Christopher70	Volunteer	5	12/03/2015	This is one of the most worthy causes that could be imagined, what they are doing in there small area of the world is truly, truly a Miracle! They are not only teaching ones to fish but they are teaching that it is important to teach others to fish! They are not just putting these children in a better place, they are making the world a better place, and their goodness will ripple through the world noticed and unnoticed but we will all find it a better for all of us! God Bless all that contribute small and large, and bless all the hope and smiles it brings to those innocent children!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	261671	9	/users/profile/350293	Lee_54	Donor	5	10/05/2015	I came across the Lingap Center more than four years ago when I was looking for a good organization to volunteer for.  Over time, I have gotten to know John Drake and his story; it is truly inspirational.  I am Filipino, but was born in Canada in the early seventies. I used to watch the Care International commercials that would run on TV as a young child. I told myself that when I am able that I wanted to give to children in poverty.  I decided to volunteer for the Lingap Center because of John Drake, his principles, and wise use of the money donated. Today, I am now at a point financially that I can become a "Place at the Table" monthly sponsor. So glad I am finally able to do this.  It truly is a little girl's dream come true.  Lee Muller 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	245885	5	/users/profile/333111	fidelexconde	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Through a mutual friend from Michigan, I learned of John Drake and the Lingap Foundation last year.   I was moved by what I learned from my friends and John himself that I joined immediately as a sponsor.  My granddaughter read a Lingap flyer on my desk and pledged her Confirmation Mitzbah to Lingap.  She, too was touched by the Lingap narrative.  Three weeks ago, I visited Lingap with my grandson and son along with my sister.  Like those who have reported on their visit to the center, we were moved and overwhelmed. My sister and I were born and raised in the Philippines and have settled in the US.  We have been exposed to poverty and its consequences especially to innocent children. To see these children beaming with joy, contentment, appreciation and happiness at meeting us, total strangers, was too much to take in the instant we were in the courtyard.  The children came up and hugged each of us and brought us indoors. From this chaos of welcoming gleeful souls, a little boy of 3 or 4 years of age, clung to my leg and would not let go until I picked him up. He wrapped his little arms around my neck and cuddled his little head on my shoulder. All the others seemed like they wanted to do the same.  I could not tell whether he claimed me, or, I claimed him.  But, we were one for a long time... !  A counselor then whispered to me that they had just taken him in a couple of weeks back. His parents are both in jail.  He was a severely abused child !  Now, all he knew was to seek love and give love !What I saw in the eyes of all of these souls, and felt in each of their embraces, is the one singularly most important gift Mr. John Drake gave them.  And that is the gift of HOPE !  For the first time in their lives these once abandoned, abused and neglected children have hope !   Hope  that they will see the dawn of another day.  An even better day, full of promise and a limitless horizon that has been gifted to them by John and Lingap.There is no doubt in my mind about this !  The Alumni/Alumnae of this magnificent program are proof of this magnificent work.  Lingap needs our support.  They need funds and not goods.  Well meaning folks have donated instruments, books, equipment that often lie dormant and preserved in closets.  These are of no immediate use to the children and the center.  What they need are funds, dollars, recurring donations that can be relied upon to enable reliable long term budgeting and planning.  I have upped my sponsorship and have encouraged friends and relations to support this tremendous undertaking. I will also include Lingap in my will.It is the very least I can do.  I can no longer travel back to the Philippines readily.    I am 76 and aging each day.My visit to Lingap will bolster my spirits through my remaining years.  Those children need our love and dedication.  God bless you, Mr. John Drake !  God has a special place for folks like you !Fidel Exconde MD
Lingap Childrens Foundation	243726	4	/users/profile/330552	bdrummond	Donor	5	05/27/2015	I just returned from a trip with John and Judy Drake to visit the Lingap Center.  I was amazed at how clean and well kept the facility was.  The staff, serving the children, were compassionate and caring.  The educational opportunities available to the kids were miraculous.  Most importantly, the children were loving, happy and thankful.  They understood the significance of God's love, shown to them by the miracle of strangers, who without knowing them, offer them the opportunity of hope and a future.  Please realize that due to the generosity of many and great sacrifice by a few, 100% of donations benefit the children directly. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	243245	4	/users/profile/329938	ajw90	Volunteer	5	05/19/2015	I volunteered with the Lingap Center from 2008 through 2010, and I can say that it is simply amazing how far the donations to the Center go.  The board of directors and employees of the center do everything they can to efficiently put all donations to the best use possible.  I visited multiple orphanages in the Philippines, and the Lingap Center was by far the best.  John Drake, the board of directors, and the employees at the Lingap Center all strive to give the best possible care to the orphaned and impoverished child of Toledo City.  To put it simply, the Lingap Center saves lives, and gives opportunities to children that they may never have dreamed possible.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	242613	3	/users/profile/164151	f-greatnonprofits	General Member of the Public	4	05/08/2015	 Lingap saves lives as well as educating. Thanks for your service.!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	241816	3	/users/profile/186816	Eva R.	Donor	5	04/28/2015	Lingap is a great organization founded and headed by John Drake.  He gives of himself --his time, energy, and money to make this organization possible.  All donations go to help the kids -- none is used for administration costs.  His organization has made a difference in the lives of children that otherwise would be street children.  I highly recommend this organization.  When you follow Lingap on their website, you can see what your money is doing.  We support this cause and hope you will also.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140617	3	/users/profile/186816	Eva R.	Donor	5	11/16/2012	We have known John Drake long before he founded Lingap Childrens Foundation.  Having been in the Philippines on business for the company he worked for before his retirement, God laid it on his heart to do something for the children there.  He has given his time, talent, and money to establish this foundation and continues to direct it making many trips each year to Toledo City, Cebu, Philippines.  The children love him and he loves them.  He updates us on the children just as if they were his own flesh and blood.  He has made a difference and continues to make a difference in the lives of children.  We are blessed to know John Drake and to support his work with the Lingap Foundation.  Don & Eva Richardson
Lingap Childrens Foundation	241803	3	/users/profile/328462	keirabutton	Donor	5	04/28/2015	I first heard of Lingap when John Drake spoke at my parish.  This is a life giving foundation that does miraculous work.  The children benefit 100% from all donations.  I have a few special groups that I cherish and try to help when I can, Lingap is #1.  All donations are appreciated. Thank you, John, and God bless you and everyone associated with Lingap.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	240567	4	/users/profile/178807	Lisa161	Donor	5	04/06/2015	My family has supported this group for several years.  They do a fantastic job of supporting those children that wouldn't otherwise have a chance in life.  They teach them basic life skills as well as ready them for college.  They support their college students with internships in the U.S. to help them be successful in their chosen careers.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133110	4	/users/profile/178807	Lisa161	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Children's Center isamazing!  I first heard about them through my church in Marietta, Georgia. We have taken this foundation on as a church-wide mission and have many members who contribute regularly. The administrators pay all expenses out of their own pocket so 100 percent of donations go directly to the children who live there or to support the other programs they have in the community  I have been a done for the past two years and have seen some amazing success stories come from children who live there. These children were abused and severely neglected. The Lingap Center educates them, houses them, and teaches them life skills. They recently celebrated their first college graduate!  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	240104	4	/users/profile/326159	Reinap	Volunteer	5	03/28/2015	Lingap Children's Foundation not only provides the basic needs of the abandoned, abused and neglected children, founder John Drake's passion in ensuring the children's well being far extends his personal relationship with EACH and EVERY child and Lingap staff.  John Drake knows every single Lingap child by name, by personal history, and by their respective academic achievements because he personally sits down with each child and looks them straight in the eye to let them know the importance of education.  Tito John as he is fondly called instills empowerment in every child for them to thrive from survival to potential and self sustainability.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	240074	5	/users/profile/59575	dave1534	Donor	5	03/27/2015	I've been associated with LinGap a long time. It is THE MOST OUTSTANDING organization of it's kind.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	207913	4	/users/profile/59575	dave1534	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I have been a donor and promotor of Lingap since it's founding. Unlike most donors I have had the pleasure of visiting the Center in both it's old location and the fantastic new one, over the last 8 years.I know the staff, children, and founder John Drake. I strongly urge all to support this effort to improve the lives of the street children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	129558	4	/users/profile/59575	dave1534	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2012	I'm a long time supporter of this charity, and personally familiar with it's work in Toledo City, RP. I have visited the center every year since 2007. The children are smiling, happy, and hard working. Several of the wards have completed college with the assistance of Lingap. Currently 13 students are enrolled in college. ALL of the wards attend school. One is currently enrolled in special needs programs.The center itself is clean, neat, and an outstanding example for others. I am PROUD to be a supporter of it's work.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	100604	4	/users/profile/59575	dave1534	Volunteer	5	11/13/2011	I visited Lingap again this year with my wife and daughter. I found the center to be immaculate (the kids clean it), and it is in excellent repair. The children have made great strides in their education. This time, I visited the schools attended by the children, and talked to the principal.  I was also present when 23 of the wards were confirmed at the cathedral on fiesta day.  We were impressed.  I am personally familiar with the center, and it's staff . I am familiar with Toledo city, and maintain a residence there. I can recommend it most highly.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	56855	4	/users/profile/59575	dave1534	Donor	5	11/12/2010	I am a retired CPA. I have been involved with Lingap for 4 years. I have visited the center three times in the last 4 years. It is located only a short distance from my wife's home there in Toledo. She was a teacher in Toledo for 15 years.  The center is a miracle. The children there are well cared for. The center is beautiful,  well maintained, and staffed with highly qualified people.  Education of the children is one of their highest priorities. The children are clean and courteous. Some of them comprise the choir of the local Catholic cathedral. It is very hard to believe the terrible circumstances of abuse and exploitation that have brought them to Lingap. The children are selected by the local department of social welfare. The center is greatly respected in the local community. It is  indeed a model for such establishments. I have never seen a better one. Lingap attends the needs of up to 100 children. The organization is small. Neither John Drake nor any of the other board members receives any salary at all. Every dollar contributed goes to the welfare of the children.John Drake is a hero, and a real christian.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	240068	3	/users/profile/326099	atlantaboudreaux	Donor	5	03/27/2015	A charity that puts 100% of donations towards helping children of need always gets my vote of approval
Lingap Childrens Foundation	240066	3	/users/profile/326096	Denise114	Donor	5	03/27/2015	For years our Church sponsored a school in Haiti, only to find out that the funds were being misappropriated. Our pastor then looked to find a charitable organization that truly cared about the welfare of others that could be trusted with our stewardship. John Drake came to our Church and gave a talk on how the Holy Spirit called to him in the Philippines. This man unselfishly gave of himself to help the forgotten children there. Every dime that you donate to this organization goes to help the children have a home, get  nourishment and get an education. The children he has helped have spoken at my Church to say how the Lingap Center saved their life. I admire John Drake and the work he does at the Lingap Center and I love the children there. For the price of a fast food dinner for your family you can sponsor a Place at the Table for a child and you can know that every dime ($25 a month) is spent on the child-- not some CEO.  God Bless  John Drake and the children of the Lingap Center.

I too was in your shoes and looking for charity organizations that were making a difference in the world, but were doing so without high administrative costs or by making the creators and management wealthy.  Lingap was created by John Drake, one for most selfless men I have met and he has created a miracle for these children by giving 100% of donations directly to the organization.  I am very proud of my time, efforts and donations to help the Lingap Children's Foundation as I know they are very appreciated and is being managed by the best steward I know - John Drake! My hope is that you will give generously, but give WISELY, in your quest to share your good fortune. Tina S. Walther - 734-395-8212
Lingap Childrens Foundation	162426	3	/users/profile/215589	Tina Walther	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	If you have not met John Drake and heard about The Lingap Center you have missed an unbelievable miracle!  He has created growth and beauty from a desperate situation.  I didn't think I could add another thing to my plate, but found it is so easy when I realized what John has and is accomplishing.  His presentation that details the the struggles they have endured and the successes they have had should be shown at every organization - especially ones that kids are involved in.I am thrilled to have met John and his cause and feel blessed every time I contribute or have any interaction with such a noble cause!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	236941	2	/users/profile/257169	kathrynbell1449	Donor	5	01/16/2015	John Drake keeps every Lingap child in his heart and and in our minds. I thank him for allowing others to help support those who serve as God's hands and feet on this important mission. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	196756	3	/users/profile/257169	kathrynbell1449	Donor	5	03/30/2014	John has brought the story of the Lingap Children's Foundation to the First Presbyterian Church of Hillsdale, Michigan on several occasions. We are moved by how the Lord has worked through John and the Lingap family. Our Ladies' Society and our whole church mission support Lingap with conviction that this foundation is doing as Christ instructed--minister to the poor and needy.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	236785	1	/users/profile/320870	Paonessa	Donor	5	01/13/2015	A charity that utilizes 100% of what you donate to the cause is one in a million and that is exactly what the Lingap Children's Foundation is. This is our #1 charity now and for years to come. John Drake is exactly the kind of person you want to support and trust. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	236697		/users/profile/250934	cityschultz	Donor	5	01/12/2015	John Drake spoke at our church and we have been donors ever since - giving monthly.  100% of the overhead is handled by the Board, so every penny you donate goes to the children.  John was asked to help and God has worked through his generous hands to help these children - in a personal way - and to bless the donors, with the knowledge they can be part of this blessing. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	192201	1	/users/profile/250934	cityschultz	Donor	5	01/07/2014	I heard John speak at a mission week at our church.  His devotion and passion to these children moved us to become monthly donors.  His personal contact with us throughout the year is remarkable.  the earthquake and typhoon were a personal experience to us, as we learned of the children's generosity towards others.  Beauty blossoms where God's love exists...it has unfolded to include not only those children that have grown and shared as they do..but it had enriched us as well.  It should be noted that 100% of your donation goes to the children, the Board absorbs the expenses.

As a result of their consistent great work, I am now both a volunteer and regular donor.  John Drake and this group are committed, passionate professionals with a wildly successful program, that should be copied by other organizations.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133393		/users/profile/179105	Nancy78	Donor	5	11/04/2012	John Drake is tireless in telling people the good news of the many successes of the Lingap Center.  He has visited our church several times and is generous with his time, answering questions, showing photos, and telling stories.   The children who find food, shelter, and education through Lingap are thriving, and several are now in college.  (One has graduated college!)  The Lingap Foundation is truly working miracles!  My family donates to a program called "A Place at the Table" that helps the Center buy food for the kids.  We consider this money very well invested!  They also have a talented choir, and they sound like angels!

I spent all my life hearing and listening to him of how important education is and that proves it as I was able to graduate and have college degree and got an internship here at Baltimore Country Club. I am so lucky and very blessed. Thank you Tito John and to the people who has been there supporting the Lingap Children's Foundation. I owe you a lot. God will bless you.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232871		/users/profile/296484	Maureen45	Donor	5	11/04/2014	I had the great good fortune to spend a weekend at the Lingap Center in 2010 as a guest of John Drake, the Founder, and had an amazing experience.  This opportunity came about because I was working in Cebu, Philippines at the time and happened to be a member of Transfiguration Catholic Church in Atlanta, Ga.  Transfiguration was launching a partnership with Lingap and I offered to go to the center and write a report for my Pastor.  In short, Lingap Center is an extraordinary place and the work that has been done so far to give the children not just a chance to survive but an opportunity to thrive and share their God-given talents with the world puts Lingap in a class of its own.  In my view and from my observations and experience, the Lingap Center is a reflection of the Holy Spirit working through mortal men and women here on earth.  The Lingap Center is indeed divinely inspired and is a model for others to follow.  God Bless the continued work of John and his team at the Lingap Center.  Maureen Kennedy Shanahan
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232844	1	/users/profile/296450	Mindoro	Donor	5	11/04/2014	Having a Filipino father and always being interested in helping Filipino children to lead a better life than their parents, I was very impressed after learning about John Drake's efforts for the Lingap Children's Foundation.  Since then, my husband Gene and I have contributed to Drake's efforts to provide these children with a "hand up" rather than a "hand out" approach, which is what my father would have done without hesitation.  We are amazed at what this man has achieved since devoting the rest of his life for the benefit of these Filipino children. Frances & Gene Schayer
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232720		/users/profile/296290	GinnyKulesa1952	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	My involvement in joining such a dedicated group as the Lingap Children's Foundation has truly opened my eyes to the needs of the children.  You need only to see the growth in the children to realize the foundation is non stop in creating new avenues for the children to learn, have proper nutrition, community involvement and the necessary medical care.  The program A Place at the Table really makes me feel like an extended family member to the children and now  many young adults.The joy in knowing a child who was found in dire need is currently part of an apprenticeship in the USA makes my commitment one that will be life long. I am on the committee formed within our church.I am impressed with the founders who came to us seeking support and have continued to be with us at meetings and socials. They heard their calling and embraced it. God Bless them all who have made this foundation part of their stewardship. Ginny KulesaTransfiguration Catholic Church
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232646		/users/profile/296199	bulletinboard	Volunteer	5	11/02/2014	I have worked with the Lingap ministry in my church for the last few years.  Never have I seen an organization more focused on the children and their success than with Lingap.  I've seen the lives saved by the personal intervention of one of board members who happened to be making house visits during his stay in Lingap.  I've seen kids go from being banned from entering the church building to being a valued member of the choir.  I've seen kids learning how to cook well enough to earn money using these skills.  I've seen children discovered who have incredible scientific minds.  I've seen children able to succeed in elementary and high school, and now they are proceeding on to college and tech schools.  They are becoming productive citizens in a country where they were given little or no chance.  Lingap should be a model for centers that focus on the success of children who, otherwise, would have no chance in the world.  Please support Lingap in any way you can.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232641	1	/users/profile/296195	Laurie69	Volunteer	5	11/02/2014	I am amazed at the progress they have made in the Lingap organization. I have met some of the children that have come over they are simple amazing. They have defiantly put the money to good use. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	232640	1	/users/profile/296194	Caroline123	Volunteer	5	11/02/2014	I am a member of our church ministry who supports the Lingap Center and my husband and I support A Place at the Table.  We have had the privilege to meet John Drake and also a few of the children from the Lingap center.  They are all truly amazing.  The story of how John started the center is heartwarming.  I encourage everyone to look at the website and read the stories and look at the pictures and videos.  This is truly what life is about.  Caring and supporting those in need. The fact that 100 percent of our donations go directly to the Lingap Center speaks volumes.  Last year our 24 year old son gave us the most perfect Christmas gift.  He made a donation to the Lingap Center in our name.  He was so moved by what he saw on the website and realized that making a donation was the perfect gift.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	231239	1	/users/profile/294842	rickwh	Donor	5	10/31/2014	If you want to make a difference, then Lingap is an organization where you can have significant impact.  My wife and I support a number of organizations in both education and child welfare, and I can say with certainty this is the one where I know our support is completely focused on those whom the mission serves. We are each made in the image and likeness of Christ, unique and never to be repeated.  John Drake and the Lingap center trustees understand this at their core, and I have profound respect for their tireless servant leadership.  Rick H 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	201826	2	/users/profile/178882	kervball	Donor	5	06/03/2014	I corresponded with John Drake last night on the internet, and asked him why he couldn't just take a break from his tireless work for the Lingap Center, and his answer amazed me.  He said "Keep in mind that I really do love what I do.."  That was all I needed to hear to know that this has to be the best charity in the world.  John is so committed and every dime goes to some of the most needy kids in the world.  Please consider supporting this very worthwhile charity.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133179	1	/users/profile/178882	kervball	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	I have been a donor to the Lingap Center since its inception, and this is one of the best causes I have ever been associated with.  The children who are helped by the Lingap Center are some of the most fortunate children on the planet.  These children started with much less than nothing, and the Lingap Center gives them hope, food, shelter and a new life.  What I like best is that all donations go directly to the kids.  The overhead and administration is covered by the generous people who started the center, so you know that all your money will help feed and clothe kids directly.  I personally have known John for 30 years, and his honesty and integrity in starting the Lingap Center is unparalleled.  This is one of the best charities around. I will support it as long as I have the resources to do so.  The kids deserve a chance in life.  This charity gives them one.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	197427	1	/users/profile/258091	tomt1800	Donor	5	04/11/2014	When people are thinking about a charity, one thing that they may wonder about is how much of the money that is donated is used for running the charity i.e. administration, and what percentage actually goes to the beneficiaries of the charity.  In the case of the Lingap Children's Foundation, 100% of the donations go directly to the kids. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	196751	2	/users/profile/257165	jim12345	Donor	5	03/30/2014	I have known John Drake for many years and am in awe of his work for the Lingap center.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	196193	1	/users/profile/256492	Reina P.	Volunteer	5	03/22/2014	Lingap Childrens Foundation is HOPE for a brighter future, a PROMISE for lost, abandoned, abused, forgotten and some nearly dead children providing food, shelter, education and a safe haven.  It offers opportunity for the forsaken innocent children.  Founder John Drake works passionately and tirelessly for such a worthwhile cause.  Tito John as he is fondly called by the children and staff of Lingap, answered Gods call and is a living witness to Mother Teresas words Never worry about numbers. Help one person at a time and always start with the person nearest you.  Tito John went BEYOND helping the one nearest him commuting from Michigan, USA keeping his promise in support of Lingap.  Know that your financial support help RESCUE innocent neglected lives and serve as a LIFELINE making a difference for a lifetime. 100% of donations go to Lingap Childrens Foundation.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	195231	1	/users/profile/255181	Nathali	General Member of the Public	5	03/05/2014	For me, it started with a school Project (I am 28 years old, lives in Sweden and take some classes on the side of my job). I reached out to get information and help to try and understand why so many children are abandoned in the Philippines. I was privileged enough to made contact with Mr John Drake himself, the founder of The Lingap Center, and the stories he shared with me have made me speechless. Some of those stories will hunt me for life, and I dont think I will ever be quit the same person again. To read his story (availed on the website) truly made me understand which huge difference one single person actually can make. We can all find excuses not to help, and think that we have done our fair share and given help to the world, but the thing is, there are even better arguments to help for every single excuse not to. I feel certain that every single penny will make a difference for these children, and I know that every single penny will go to the children directly. Not to stamps, papers or transport for the staff, but for the children directly.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	195104		/users/profile/255020	Sandy.Miller.Chambers	Board Member	5	03/03/2014	The most awesome opportunity to invest time and resources in an organization focused on human capabilitiy.

We have been donors for several years because,we have met some of the children, as well as receiving updates by our Pastor and some of our parishioners that have visited  the center. It is a well run organization that puts 100% of the donations into the needs of the children.   Honest and trustworthy. Please help!

Lingap Childrens Foundation	192287	1	/users/profile/251052	ProfMary	Volunteer	5	01/08/2014	I had the opportunity to help assess the area education offered to the Lingap children a few years ago while visiting the Lingap Center. The experience was life changing. The children now attend private schools and are flourishing. They did attend schools where it was not unusual to have 50-60 students in a very small classroom. They had to copy from a blackboard everything. They had no textbooks. The difference the staff have seen  with their educational growth today and what took place then has been astounding. These children are always so appreciative, prayful, and loving. I am still in touch with some of the children and they continue to move forward despite their past hardships. I witnessed firsthand how all our donations are used. Wow...every cent is used for a good purpose.  The Street Program is a living testimony of "greatness in action".  The entire Lingap Center is a gift to the world in so many ways. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	192237		/users/profile/250992	Carl88	Donor	5	01/08/2014	I have known John for 40 years in our mutual business careers and I can say, without reservation, that his founding of Lingap has truly been a calling from God. This calling and his passion for his kids at Lingap have changed him as remarkably as the Center has changed the lives of the children to whom he's committed. His personal commitment of time, treasure and talent is unparalleled in my 45 years of experience serving in board positions on 30+ nonprofit organizations. Without question, a financial contribution to the Lingap Children's Foundation is, indeed, a wise investment in children, as the record of performance at the Center is transparent and well-communicated by John and his board of directors. Add to that the fact that all contributions, in total, go for the benefit of the children, due to John and his board covering all administrative expenses, and you can feel very confident that your contribution is money  very well spent. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	188303		/users/profile/245659	Dorothy W.	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	"We are the hands and feet of Christ."  This applies without limit to John and Judy and all those who are responsible for the Miracle that is ongoing at the Lingap Center everyday.   I have seen this miracle first hand and it has changed my life's goal.  We have giants of LOVE in our midst.  Even in the tragedy of this typhoon John's arms want to embrace ALL the people who need help.  Let's make an effort to help in our own little way by supporting John's efforts to bring love and care to this wonderful mission of Lingap Childrens Foundation.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	131983	1	/users/profile/177582	Gr8Volunt33r	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	My wife and I have helped volunteer at Lingap Children's Foundation fundraisers, and I can honestly say that the time and effort that John and Judy put forth at all times is simply amazing. I think that many of us don't realize the true impact we can have on a child's life halfway around the world, just by simply donating our time and money to this wonderful cause. Getting to meet some of the children from the Lingap Center at these events has given me an even greater appreciation for the work that John and Judy do. They are truly wonderful people, and I can only hope to be that giving in my future years.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	161359		/users/profile/53992	francy11	Volunteer	5	06/24/2013	As a volunteer for the Lingap Children's Foundation, I have had frequent contact with President and founder of the organization, John Drake, as well as his wife, Judy. Both John and Judy have made it their life mission to serve the needy children of The Lingap Center by making their lives incredibly better with love, support, encouragement, healing, schooling (in addition to food, housing and medical care). Not only have they changed the lives of the children at the center for the better, but they have reached out even further to educate street children and provide food to those needy people in the area. The impact the Lingap Children's Foundation has made in so many lives is indescribable. The most recent great accomplishment they have seen includes children that grew up at the center and are now college graduates. It is an honor to volunteer for such an honest and downright incredible organization.

Mr. John Drake loves all of the Lingap kids like his own, and always keeps their interests at the center of his goals. Every cent of every donation is used to directly benefit the lives of these kids whom Mr. Drake ensures their success. There is no better place to donate if you want your money to truly make the world a better place.

We know John here in Jackson, MI.   When he goes to the Center, he always pays for his own flight.  His testimony here in our churches has brought much interest in his project causing dedicated people to give financially and some to even travel there to take part in hands on helping.  It's a highly respected organization helping many to have hope.   Jim & Judy Campbell
Lingap Childrens Foundation	143579		/users/profile/190037	Jay58	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	I initially met John and Judy Drake at our church two years ago and found their story incredibly inspiring. Shortly after we met, I made my first trip to the Philippines and witnessed the miracle of the Lingap Center. Children, who were broken, abandoned, unloved and unwanted, are now both cared for and loved. They are given faith, hope, love and a future. This is truly a well-run, organized, and extremely efficient top notch organization. 100% of all donations go to the care of the children (The Board of Directors pay all overhead expenses). The Lingap Center is changing the lives of thousands of the Philippines poorest children!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	142732		/users/profile/189180	Dave43	Donor	5	11/26/2012	John Drake is my hero. His compassion and selfless love is a perfect example of how Jesus must have modeled that love for us. My wife and I have shared many annual events with John and his family, hearing about the great stories and journeys his obedience has brought. Way to go John, board, staff and Lingap kids. We love you and are proud to be part of something bigger than ourselves. Rich blessings!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	142275		/users/profile/188727	Juan Pablo	Donor	5	11/24/2012	Learned of the Lingap Center through our church where John Drake was also a member and soon after became a supporter. Am proud of the work he does and the success of the children. The documentary says it all. It brings tears of joy to my eyes to see where these children came from and where they are now, in their lives. JohnD
Lingap Childrens Foundation	141761		/users/profile/188142	Judybj	Donor	5	11/20/2012	What John Drake is doing for the Lingap Center is truly remarkable. He, his family and his staff are the most dedicated individuals collectively that I have every met. Their mission is overwhelming, but everything they do is done with such love and attention to detail, that I am sure these children will grow up to be dynamic men and women who will impact the world with wisdom and grace. John has spoken at our church several times and corresponds with us regularly with hewsletters, e-mails and even telephone calls on the rare occasion. I love being a donor and only wish I could contribute more financially. It is a well-deserving charity that continues God's work daily. They are always in my prayers .
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140848		/users/profile/187071	lyndafromfiddlers	Donor	5	11/17/2012	John Drake spoke at our church recently.  His message of love and forgiveness was a real testimony to God's work in action.  And that was all before he made a pitch for support.  We enjoy our relationship with this organization and will continue to support it with money when possible and prayers always.  Keep up the good work!!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140535		/users/profile/186729	biv203	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	Several years ago, I discovered John Drake and the Lingap Foundation and what they were doing for needy children of the Philippines. Over several months of interacting with him and the group, I was inspired by John's unquenchable drive and passion to sincerely help so many young people who needed help. To this day I hope to find even a fraction of John's devotion to Lingap's mission. I still regularly read the letters and updates he and his staff send without fail to those interested in the organization's developments, and have been truly impressed to watch its steady growth and real impact on the lives of children in the Philippines. I do not doubt that that country is a better place because of John and the staff of the Lingap Foundation.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140420		/users/profile/186598	Janice18	Donor	5	11/16/2012	Three years ago, our daughter Morgan, who at the time was 11 years old, had the opportunity to meet John Drake and learn about the wonderful things that the Lingap Foundation was doing for children in the Philippines. Without hesitation, my daughter decided she wanted to help and began donating. This organization is one of best foundations in our country. It truly commits 100% of the proceeds  to be used towards the good of the children. We have great pride and respect for John Drake and his volunteers and know that without their committment and support, these children would have had a very different outcome in life. Thank you John Drake for making a HUGE difference in the life of so many children. Your organization is AMAZING.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140222		/users/profile/186391	Dan_27	Donor	5	11/15/2012	My wife met John 8 years ago and heard his story about working professionally in the Phillipines and seeing children living in the street with no one to care for them.  Unlike most of us, John didn't turn his back on these kids - he did something about the situation.  We are proud to have supported Lingap these past 8 years - in increasing amounts - because we have seen the difference that Lingap has made in the lives of these innocent children.  The fact that John and the Board pay all of the overhead expense of the foundation is also a testament to the quality of this charity.  If there were more John Drakes in the world, there would be a lot less suffering.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140114		/users/profile/186281	ME12	Donor	5	11/15/2012	John Drake is truly following the call of the Lord,  He has affected more lives than he will ever know either through direct help to the neglected children or by his example of humility and dedication.  His wife, Judy, is also very involved in this project.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140050		/users/profile/186207	local friend	Donor	5	11/15/2012	When I learned about John Drake and the Lingap Center, I immediately thought of Mahatma Gandhi's famous quote:  "Be the Change you want to see."  I know he is living his faith, but his efforts say more than "I am a Catholic" or "I am a Christian" (or name another of the world's major denominations).  John is a humanist and a world changer, and by his efforts and example he is changing lives in Toledo City, that country, and here in the U.S.  Everyone of us that contemplates what he does at Lingap and in that community have the opportunity to measure ourselves and be motivated to take another step toward being better and more caring people. Let us support the Lingap Center, but let us all redouble our efforts to improve our world and care for those who have less.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	140045		/users/profile/186201	liznumbr1	Donor	5	11/15/2012	Lingap is dedicated to helping the forgotten and vulnerable children of the Philippine society.  While providing physical assistance, they also give the greater gift of hope and a path to success.  It warms my heart when I read the success stories.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	139965		/users/profile/186116	twheik	Donor	5	11/15/2012	I met John many years ago at Concumers Power and saw the way he treated people and how he approached his work.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	139948		/users/profile/186097	Marc and Rosemarie	Donor	5	11/15/2012	My wife and I have personally visited the Lingap Center in Toledo City, Cebu and seen the direct result of the donations and efforts of staff to rescue these children.  One will never understand true poverty until you see the eyes of children who were once abandoned like trash but now have hope and love surrounding them.  Conditions in the Philippines are beyond description, and Lingap Center is one of the few bright rays of hope in this community.  Every child in this program is involved in education; one of the tenets of this charity is that education provides a pathway out of poverty.  100% of every dollar donated goes direct to the care and support of the children, and even small donations make a huge difference there.  I do not give to many charities because I'm unsure where the money ends up, but with Lingap I know from my own eyes and spending 48 hours with the children that this is a cause worth supporting.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	139925		/users/profile/186070	frose	Advisor	5	11/15/2012	I have been associated with the Lingap Children's Foundation since 2007, and was named the Chaplain this past year. While I am involved with a number of foreign ministry and outreach, the Lingap Center is priority #1! John Drake's vision and effort to help these children, and the communities they come from is second to none. John's business experience in human resources, was the ideal training for this important work. Is there a greater "human resource" that we need to serve, than orphans?
Lingap Childrens Foundation	139706		/users/profile/185836	iangraz	Donor	5	11/15/2012	Of the charitable organizations to which I contribute LINGAP is at the top of the list. John Drake took what was less than a run down place and made a living center for children the like of which is hard to compare. The outreach programs spun off from this touch the lives of hundreds more with a message of love and caring in the spirit of the Gospel. It was a wonderful day when I came to know Lingap.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	137048		/users/profile/183003	PDHopper	Donor	5	11/11/2012	John and Judy Drake have established an organization which sets the gold standard for charitable giving with the Lingap Center.  When ever have you been able to donate money towards the benefit of children (shelter, food, education, clothing and most important safety) knowing that 100% of your contribution goes directly to the needy?  Kudos and blessings to this group.  Our world is a little kinder today because of your efforts.  Bravo!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	136974		/users/profile/182925	Alan Patty	Donor	5	11/11/2012	The Lingap Childrens Foundation is located in an area of severe poverty, it is more than an orphanage to 100 abandoned 'throw away' kids and street beggars.  The children have nothing.  These children are totally dependent.  We are their one source for daily existence.  The Lingap Center is vital and dynamic to the children and people in the surrounding area.  John Drake arranged for water to the orphanage and made it available to the village.  John is educating the Lingap kids and initiated a Community Education Out Reach to the community children, John created a nuturing, safe and secure facility and initiated a 'Place at the Table' for the community. The Lingap Center is a true Beacon of Hope to the entire community.  The Lingap Orphanage is so much more than John Drake.  He has created a dynamic children's foundation with Board of Directors and a management team, AND all organizational costs are gratis; free and clear of the Lingap Center, with 100% of your donation going directly to food and clothing and education of children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	136967		/users/profile/182918	Ann Rice	Donor	5	11/11/2012	I have known John and Judy Drake for many years, being members of Queen of the Miraculous Medal Church. I know them both to be honest, humble, loving Christians who truly care about the children in Lingap Center. They consider it an privilege and honor to serve the poorest, most neglected in Toledo City, in the Philippines. All donations to Lingap go directly to serve the children. I can only imagine how much money the Drakes have spent from their own pockets on their many trips to the Center alone. There are so many reasons I can think of to support their efforts but the biggest one I can think of is knowing that there is NO overhead, all donations go to the Lingap Center. John takes the time (and expense) to send out newsletters to contributors to keep us updated on the strides being made so we can see where our money is being used. I feel the love exuding from these newsletters and consider myself to be, not only a supporter of Lingap, but a member of the Lingap family.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	135467		/users/profile/53914	rsanders54	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	John Drake and I rode the school bus together over 50 years ago.  When he came to my Rotary club when Lingap was in the planning phrase, he captured our spirit, our hearts and our imagination.  His plan was simple and it did not involve millions of dollars.  I think he needed $300,000 to get Lingap center converted.  That struck me as a goal that was reachable and one that our club's contribution could really amount to something. Thank you John for enriching our lives, by being apart of the tremendous success of the Lingap Center. Praise be to God.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	52883		/users/profile/53914	rsanders54	Donor	5	09/20/2010	Our Rotary Club has followed and given financial support to the Lingap Foundation, since it's creation.  We got excited about this organization because we are a small club and we were able to make meaningful contrbution to a wonderful project that has literlly saved the lives of so many children.  I have know the John Drake since high school, and I can verify his integrity, talent and commitment toward Lingap. He makes every dollar go so fall toward making the school so successful.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	135450		/users/profile/181311	Preston Abernathy	Donor	5	11/08/2012	My husband and i learned of The Lingap Center about 4 years ago when my husband was in the American Chamber of Cebu, Philippines. Mr. Drake came and told the story of The Lingap Center and how it came about. We decided to visit the center and see the work that was being done for the children. We were so impressed with the center and how adjusted and happy the children were. You could see that something special was happining in The Lingap Center. Preston and I have made it a point to visit with the children and staff two to three time a year. We enjoy the children sharing what they have been doing since our last visit. They enjoy singing for us, showing us their flower and vegatable garden and sharing what they are doing in school. For most of these children their life story will have a very happy ending I would hate to think what that life story would be like without The Lingap Center.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	134646		/users/profile/180516	BMC429	Donor	5	11/07/2012	The Lingap Center is an exceptional organization.  As a donor I am able to see the direct impact received by the kids and their community.  I have been a supporter for many years now and have seen the progress made at the Center.  It is encouraging to know my donations are making a difference in the lives of the less fortunate.  The real "hands on" benefit comes from meeting some of the kids that have been helped by the Lingap Center.  It is refreshing to see these kids that not only have daily meals and education but also hope for their future.

Then came my third visit, my life changing experience. I have worked  with wonderful hearts to help my less fortunate brothers and sisters in the Philippines. I am with you Tito John and Tita Judy.....  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134581		/users/profile/180427	4677	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Lingap Childrens Foundation is the most legitimate charitable organization that we have ever known. We personally know John and Judy Drake who founded the orphanage. 100% of donations goes to the children of Lingap. They have devoted their life (heart and soul) to the welfare of at least 100 children that are housed,fed,clothe and most of all educated. They have instilled moral as well as spiritual being of each child. Lately, they have extended their programs to the other street kids in the Community of Toledo City in Cebu, Philippines. Please consider helping unfortunate children in Cebu.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134548		/users/profile/180389	tsheltn	Donor	5	11/06/2012	The Lingap Childrens Foundation in the Philippines is not an orphanage, but a center that attempts to take children off of the streets and provide them with a stable and caring environment.  They are educated, fed, and provided care. The Lingap staff, led by John Drake, works diligently to ensure that these children succeed on not just an educational level (I believe that they now have 16 students in college and 2 graduates.), but on a life skills level which enables them to prosper in the world.  In addition, the foundation performs outreach into the shanty villages offering assistance with both food, faith, and daily tutoring to other street children.  Having met both Mr. Drake and members of his board of directors, I am confident that no money donated to this charity is wasted.  I highly recommend this nonprofit as a shining example of the triumph of one man's vision.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134442		/users/profile/180280	Jim Legault	Donor	5	11/06/2012	The story of the Lingap Center and the kids it supports is simply amazing.  John Drake and his team have done an incredible job developing the facility and programs that so wonderfully care for the needs  of under-priviliged Kids.  It is truly a story of perservance and dedication that can not help but warm the hearts of all of all who hear it.  Children destined to a life of poverty, or worse, are now given hope for a better future.  May God Bless everyone involved in anyway with the Lingap Center and its work.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134354		/users/profile/180179	david.richmond	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	I have been with the foundation since the year of its inception, sitting on the board for almost as long.  I visit the cneter twice a year so I can personally witness the incredible work being done and continue provide governance of our mission.  This foundation saves lives, instills hope, and provides opportunity for those without opportunity or hope.  The foundation is run with the utmost professionalism, having financial audits no fewer than ever 3 years, our last being a clean audit and without any recommendations for changes.  We have had other organizations give testimonials to our efficiency and effectiveness in adhering to our mission such as the United State Peace Corp among others.  Finally, 100% of donor money goes to fund programs of the foundation, the board of directors personally funds the expenses of  the foundaiton.  This along with other policy and  procedures provides the governance structure to allow the mission to be carried out with effectiveness and efficiency.  This standard of operation ensures  every donor dollar goes to the benefit of the children.  I have seen with my own eyes, children born literally in the gutter go on to graduate college.  We have children who have won  study abraod scholarships and yet we provide shelter to the abused, abandoned and neglected children of society.  We provide not only safety and security but hope and opportunity.  We are breaking the cycle of poverty that has lasted for generations in these families, hopefully forever changing the direction of their family, their future families, and their community.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	134251		/users/profile/180039	pdunayczan	Donor	5	11/06/2012	John Drake is an example of what an incredible impact one person can have when he gets it in his head to do something to help AND DOES IT.  I have watched the Foundation grow from a little sheltering place to a large sheltering place as well as a school, community outreach, higher ed opps, etc.  John and his foundation take not one penny of our contributions--it all goes to the kids.  Just visit the website to see for yourself that miracles can and do happen.   I encourage you to open your hearts and your pocketbooks!

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133616		/users/profile/179356	MillerLite	Donor	5	11/05/2012	The Lingap Children's Foundation is an incredible nonprofit that provides a home and education for some 100 Philippine children who have been neglected, abused and abandoned. The stories of each of these children is heartbreaking -- until they find a true home at the Lingap Center where they are loved, cared for and given hope for the future. Several of the Lingap children have graduated from college and entered successful careers because of the Lingap Center and the Lingap Children's Foundation. Plus, the nonprofit offers an education program for street children who for various reasons do not attend school. It also provides an outreach program to the street children's families and extended families, who are among the poorest of the poor. The Lingap Children's Foundation, which was founded on love and compassion, not only has changed lives but has saved lives.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133602		/users/profile/179340	Connie N.	Donor	5	11/05/2012	John Drake spoke at our Lions Club, and our members heard the story of the Lingap Children's Foundation.  We were immediately struck by John's selflessness and how much his life has been changed since he began this journey.  Our Board of Directors voted at our next meeting to make a donation, and we have continued to do so every year.  Many of us support Lingap individually as well.  We have since had the pleasure of hearing some of the children tell their stories, and it has solidified our support for Lingap.  The children are fed physically, mentally and spiritually.  They are given new life through love and education.  Lingap is a current day miracle!   
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133592		/users/profile/179325	LINGAP Donor	Donor	5	11/05/2012	Thank God John Drake answered the call.  The LINGAP Center has afforded us an opportunity  to help those less fortunate.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133580		/users/profile/179318	lingap	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I have had the privilege on several occasions of having John Drake (and his wife, Judy), founder of the Lingap Center, visit and speak to my parish.  On one occasion children from the center came to speak to us as well.  The gratitude and love absolutely radiated from them.  The history of the center, the work it does, and the stories I have been told about the children are truly amazing and touch my heart profoundly.  The children, who now live at the Lingap Center, were the "poorest of the poor," homeless, seemingly in hopeless circumstances with no real hope for a future.  Because of this nonprofit center, the children now have a place to live, food to eat (some of which comes from the garden they grow), an education, love, and nourishment for their precious souls.  Also, because of the generosity of John and Judy and other directors, every donation to the center goes directly to the children, as the overhead/administrative costs are paid for by these devoted donors.  Truly the Lingap Center is God's hand at work in this world!  Ben and Tina Accurso
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133564		/users/profile/179299	Brian42	Donor	5	11/05/2012	Such a worthy charity.  They truly are doing God's work and changing so many lives.  I can't think of a better organization to support for missions.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133558		/users/profile/179292	DonnaMark	Donor	5	11/05/2012	This is such a wothy cause.  I have been a monthly donator to the Lingap Center for a couple of years.  100% of all donations go directly to the kids. This is possible because John Drake and the Lingap Board of Directors pay all administrative overhead expenses. So my donation has the greatest possible impact on the children. I have travelled to the Philippines for work and am so saddened to see the terrible poverty in the countryside.  Donating to the Lingap center lets me do my part to try to help.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133545		/users/profile/179280	Kathie V.	Donor	5	11/05/2012	God speaks to us in many different ways.  The founder of the Lingap Center listened and responded.  It is nothing short of a miracle to see how the children have been helped.  This organization holds a very special place in my heart.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133539		/users/profile/179272	bon54	Donor	5	11/05/2012	The Lingap Center does not only shelter and feed the body and soul of the street kids but also give them hope through education. It also goes beyond by extending its arms to the most depressed areas by spreading the Word of God to the poorest of the poor.  Recently it has raised the bar for similar foundations  when the US Peace Corps in the country  wrote to its President, John Drake that it is  the best managed for its kind in the Philippines.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133535		/users/profile/179270	George Veach	Donor	5	11/05/2012	This is truly a gress roots miracle.  One man can make a difference!  The Lingap Center was founded several years ago by an American business executive, who saw a desperate new and responded.  Thousands of Philli[pine children, many of them orphans, have been impacted by this man's cause.  Food , shelter, and, most importantly, education are being provided where these children have nothing.  Because of this man's efforts, street children are in school, including several now in college.   100% of donations accepted go to the children.  The Foundation is administred completely by volunteers.  You can be sure that your donations to  the Lingap Childrens Foundation are for a worthy cause.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133524		/users/profile/179261	Rebecca51	Donor	5	11/05/2012	What a testimony to the power of one!  It all began years ago when an American business man was troubled by the neglet and abuse he witnessed of street children in the Philippines.   As he will tell in his story, he tried to ignore the call, thinking, "what can I, one man, do?"   Fast forward several years and now hundreds of children have been raised from the grasp of poverty and dispair and given food, shelter, education and hope.  I have met some of the beautiful children....how smart, loving and grateful they are.  They are the living example of what can come by simply heeding the call.   Are you being called to help someone, maybe the Lingap center, today?   
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133519		/users/profile/179254	YJDave	Donor	5	11/05/2012	 The Lingap Center is very well run and helps so many children.  Children are given food, shelter, education and so much more.  I have reviewed many charity organizations over the years and want to make sure my donations are being put to the best use.  I know of no other place where my donation will make as much of a positive impact on the lives of children who desperately need it as the Lingap Childrens Foundation.  John Drake and the Lingap Center are doing  great work.  I have known John for over 30 years and  have been donating to the Lingap Center since it was started and continue to be impressed with the work that John Drake and the Lingap Center do to help the children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133515		/users/profile/179248	helgerd6	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2012	Long ago it was said that arranging the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer was impossible. "The best winter games ever" said Mr Samaranch, and President of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee could say, they said it was impossible, but we did it.My first encounter with Lingap was in an abandoned slaughterhouse in Tubod. It was a miserable place and we did what we could to improve conditions for residents there. Then someone told me that an American, Mr John Drake, had plans to build a new center for 100 children and teenagers. Many were skeptical, but I think that the word impossible is not in John's vocabulary. Now he can say, we did it. He, his wife and all his able assistants.The new Lingap Center is equally well adapted to the purpose, all structures to the Olympic Games in Lillehammer. The best.PS. I live in Lillehammer, Norway. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133500	1	/users/profile/179231	nay elay	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I have been working at the Lingap Center for almost 12 years, since before. It was under the management of the DSWSD, and it was privatized last 2008. A lot of children were being saved because of the Lingap Center, especially  with John Drake, he give all the needs of the children and in the community. He's touching the lives of the Filipino kids,  and especially to all Toledanos,due to the programs that we have, the 3rd Saturday Program, the Education of the children,aside from safety and security of the children. He gave the children a shelter,and everything that life has to offer he gave everything for the kids and most especially the unconditional love.He is a heaven sent from above.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133495		/users/profile/179222	diasy	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2012	I am happy for the Lingap Children that they have somebody like John Drake who really extended an amazing effort to help these children. He is one of a kind, I would say thank you for giving your heart to the Toledanos...Because of you John, these children are assured of their future.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133438		/users/profile/179156	rghymel2	Donor	5	11/04/2012	100% of the donated money goes to the kids.  Need I say more?
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133430	1	/users/profile/179146	Ronniecremers	Donor	5	11/04/2012	We leave been donors for more than two years, the fact that every penny goes to the children is amazing. There are no overhead costs in running the charity. When they heard that I was being treated for cancer, I received a beautiful letter telling me of their concern and that they would be praying for ME! The letter was signed by each child and staff member, this is what a caring society Lingap  is  creating. Our money is well spent.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133416	1	/users/profile/179127	DeaconJack	Donor	5	11/04/2012	Beside the fact that 100% of our donation goes direct to the children of the LindGap Center, it is even more impressive the dedication of director John Drake and his staff have to the children. Their dedication is  also evident in the continual up dates we receive concerning the childrens progress as they journey to becoming self supporting, and caring christian  adults. Deacon Jack kowalski.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133401		/users/profile/179113	msmacrellis	Donor	5	11/04/2012	If you can help the neediest of the needy and know that 100% of your donation is going to do just that, what more can you ask. The Lingap Center does wonderful work. The impact has been extremely positive. We love to hear John's stories about the children and families touched by the center. What is more, the people are so appreciative. We are happy to be a small part of this project.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133397		/users/profile/179109	DBTB	Donor	5	11/04/2012	The Lingap Center has touched my heart sine I first learned of it several years ago.  John Drake's personal involvement and  commitment to the Center is unlike anyone I've ever seen.  It is obvious that he is loved and respected at Lingap by the reactions of the children to him when he visits. That doesn't come by someone just sending money.  I am happy to be able to sponsor 2 children at the Center--only wish I could do more.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133350		/users/profile/179061	PAJK	Donor	5	11/04/2012	John Drake personally came to our church with a moving story about the people served by the Lingap Center. He left his career behind and put these kids first and changed their lives. After a small donation he sent a personal thank you to my wife and I. We are sent frequent updates and plan to continue to help Lingap in the future. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133245		/users/profile/178951	Gary K.	Donor	5	11/04/2012	As donors, we are impressed with the John Drake's and his colleagues' continued  commitment to the Filipino children in their school.  We appreciate the frequent updates on progress and challenges. The Lingap Childrens;' Foundation website is quite helpful sharing information with us.  We value that our entire annual contribution goes directly to the children.  We value the children sharing their experiences with us. More recently, I was pleased to learn that John and his board have well thought out leadership contingency plans for the future.  We wish the students the very best, with their health and education, going forward. Gary and Pat Kaiser
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133215		/users/profile/178920	bud m	Donor	5	11/04/2012	I have known John Drake for many years,  first as a fellow Rotarian in Manila,  and later when I learned of his work with the Lingap Children's Foundation.  Our close mutual Rotarian friend Mau Blardony visited the Foundation and told me of the amazing work that they are doing for the very poorest of the poor and the abused.  I am particularly impressed as all donations are used directly  for the children--no administrative expenses to eat up donations.  It is hear-rending and beautiful to see and hear of the many children the Foundation has helped to achieve a life with a future,  and giving them  dignity and self-respect which I strongly feel is so import6ant when helping the less fortunate.  From John Melvin Manila
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133177		/users/profile/99340	Lenore L.	Donor	5	11/03/2012	I am a sponsor of 3 children of the Lingap Center's "a place at the table". For years now I have  watched John and Judy Drake and their families tirelessly continue to spread the love and dedication to these, abandoned, abused, and forgotten children. It is awe inspiring to me, I don't think I would have the strength to continue to beg, plead and preach in any church, or organization that will have them, to just get enough to cover their cost's for the year. John takes not one penny, but instead gives, and gives and then gives some more. He travels, at his own expense 4 or 5 times a year to personally oversee that all is going as planned.  100% of every dollar donated goes directly to the Lingap Center, to see that they have food, education, and especially the knowledge that someone, even as far away as the us, care about them.  You may ask, but why not here instead of overseas, and I say.  They are children of the universe,  and we are part of that universe, so we who have much, owe them  at least the bare necessities of life.....The Drakes Rock...and just maybe I can slip into heaven on Johns shirt tails.....

I DON'T ADVOCATE NOT SHARING OUR WEALTH IN OUR OWN COUNTRIES, BUT WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND CAN DO MORE. ALL CHILDREN OF ALL RACES AND COLORS DESERVE TO EAT, PLAY, LOVE, GOOD HEALTH, NOT TO BE ABUSED.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133150		/users/profile/99607	Larry and Patty	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Center has brought hope and love to so many children of the Phillipines!  The children are cared for, fed, clothed and educated.  Some of the children are now attending college and this in a country where previously "street children" were simply ignored and not even treated as people!  John Drake, who founded the Lingap Center, is truly inspirational. 100% of our donations go to the children directly;  there are no "administrative" percentages taken from the donations!!  John Drake visits the Center personally often and invites any donors and volunteers to visit also!  The children are also cared for spiritually which is also a very important aspect of the Lingap Center.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88467		/users/profile/99607	Larry and Patty	Donor	5	05/07/2011	My husband and I first heard about the Lingap center from the founder, John Drake, himself when he spoke at our church.   We were struck by the love and absolute self-giving of John to these orphans in the Philippines.  He is truly a devoted servant of God who felt challenged to make a difference in the lives of these poor children of the Philippines.  It is amazing to see what he has accomplished and how many lives of children there have been improved by the Lingap center.  We are impressed that 100% of our donations go directly to the children and that John is always available personally to answer our questions about the Center.  While we haven't been able to visit the Lingap Center personally yet, we hope to go one day!!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133145		/users/profile/178845	wbark50	Donor	5	11/03/2012	Wbark50: I have personally visited the Lingap Center to see the great work that is happening there and the children whose lives are literally being saved because of Lingap and the people associated with this effort. 100% of all donations go toward the care and education of the clildren. Having visited and worked in the Philippines over the last 20 years I know first hand that the need is much greater than Lingap can provide. But their efforts are makeing the lives of children better one child at a time.  I Pray God's continued Blessings.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133135		/users/profile/178836	wbrianas	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Center is making a huge difference in the lives of so many children.  Thank you for all you do!  I'm proud to support their efforts and blessed to be able to touch the lives of these beautiful kids.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133120		/users/profile/178821	Elizamc	Donor	5	11/03/2012	We know that 100 % of our donations go directly to the Lingap Center and that the Lingap Childrens Foundation works so diligently to get the absolute most for every dollar.  It is amazing to hear the stories of just how much has been accomplished.  If you haven't gone to the website, I highly recommend it for an incredibly inspirational journey.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133087		/users/profile/178785	Monica25	Donor	5	11/03/2012	I first heard about the Lingap Childrens Foundation through an article in the Detroit Free Press.  They are doing wonderful work with the 'street' children they take care of.  I enjoy receiving the updates John Drake sends every so often.  I also like that all of the donations go to the children and that all costs associated with running the charity are paid for by the board.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133079	1	/users/profile/178776	kzinger	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2012	This article tells you why the Lingap center is so vital to the children and to the people in the surrounding villages. People who have nothing give all thay they have to the Lingap center. The actions of those so less fortunate than us speak volumes of what the Lingap center is all about.This article will tug at your heart. Read this  and you be the judge of the importance of the Lingap Center. This update letter is going to be a bit different from previous editions. As you will recall, Itypically try to tell you how the Lingap children are doing and I am very pleased to announcethat all are doing just fine. The school year is moving along and all have survived the firstmarking period. Our 15 college students are doing remarkably well and our two collegegraduates have landed jobs with the Marriott Hotel in Cebu City!!, jIn this edition, I would like to focus on one of our other important outreach activities. In August,Fr. Geoff Rose, OSFS, the Lingap Chaplain, went with me to visit the Lingap Center (his fifthvisit). Along with the Lingap staff and LonnieCooper, our Peace Corps volunteer, we tookthe opportunity to celebrate Mass at several ofthe squatter villages in the area. The followingweekend, Fr. Geoff conducted a community-wide retreat at St. John de Sahagun CatholicChurch in Toledo City. We used an interpreterwhich was a unique but tremendous and funexperience for all of us!The squatter villages providethe roots for some of theLingap children and many stillhave families living there. It is at these locations that we hold our StreetChildren's Education programs five days a week. Fr. Geoff and I, however,wanted to reach out to the street children's families and extended families in adifferent manner. It was the first time that many of the villagers had ever been toa formal church service and we did it in their own little communities (outside). Itwas really a touching and unbelievably rewarding moment. One thing that struckme especially, was when they took up a collection afterward -- for us!! In onelocation, they donated the equivalent of $1.61 and at a second location, approximately $0.83.Clearly we were not expecting donations, but they wanted to give back for all that has been donefor them! The donations came directly from their hearts and they were given to us with a senseof amazing pride and joy.In one village, a lady prepared a feast for us after Mass consisting of rice, roasted chicken and(warm) Coke. I seriously doubt that her family had ever had a meal like the one she hadprepared in our honor. It was her way of expressing gratitude to us for taking the time to visitand especially for celebrating Mass together with them. They were so honored to have a priest and me visit their homes that our hostess did everything she could for us. She was crying as we Celebrated Mass in Larap Village--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 2 She served us because it was such an unbelievable honor for her family. She refused to join us since it was her privilege to serve us. We had to eat it of course, but we left as much as we could soshe would have food for her children. These villagers have nothing - nothing at all and live inthe worst possible poverty - yet they took up a collection during Mass and then later fed us!! Itsimply demonstrates that those who have nothing are the most generous of all. I am reminded once again of one of my favorite quotes from Bob Pierce who said: "Let my heart be broken by the things that break the heart of God." My heart was certainly broken, yet filled with joy - it isreally difficult to describe my feelings in this situation. But I will freely admit that I absolutelylove the work that we do.As mentioned, the villagers seldom, if ever, had attended a formal church service. The church istoo far away for most of them and travel is difficult at best. Further, they are not particularlywelcome or at least they don't feel that they are. On the following Saturday evening, as we weredoing the community-wide retreat at the church, to our amazement, many of the villagers cameand filled in the front pews! I knew they were there because I could see them through my tears.Fr. Geoff added: "What an honor and a privilege it was to bring the Mass to these villagers.They were powerful experiences of the Body of Christ. To see many of those same faces come tothe retreat, told me that we had definitely accomplished our goals for this week!"This is just one of many examples in which the Lingap Center is empowering those who are lessfortunate. While our focus is always on the children, we are concerned about their communitiesand families as well. All of you, our supporters and Place at the Table sponsors, have made thispossible. It would not have happened without you. I can only thank you all so much for makingit possible. Together, all of us really are making a very big difference in many lives, both youngand old.As I remember those moments in the squatter villages, I am reminded of a quote from Jonas Salkin which he said:"I feel that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133077		/users/profile/178774	JoeG	Donor	5	11/03/2012	We, the flower children of the 60s, were going to change the world. A few of us have. John Drake is one. John lived a comfortable life as a senior executive of a Michigan company. He has a happy married life in a great town with two kids to be proud of. But John had a memory.  It was that of his Vietnam  era navy service in the Philipines. He saw a lot of poverty and suffering particulalarly among the street children. He never forgot but more importantly he did something about it. This one man in faraway  America began, built and continues to support a facility for poor and abused children. It is an amazing act of love for which I am happy to be an ongoing contributor.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133073		/users/profile/178770	Linda137	Donor	5	11/03/2012	My wife and I first heard the Lingap Foundation story presented by John Drake while attending church. John's story touched our hearts so deeply that we immediately felt the need to help these homeless children by contributing financially.   We decided to sponsor a child "At the Table", knowing that 100% of our donation supports the child for one full year. The second year, we supported two chilren "At the Table".  It is heartfelt to us knowing that several of the Lingap children are now in college.  Just imagime, because of what Lingap provides,  homeless children are now in college and have a chance to become positive contributors, not only taking care of themselves, but also helping others.  We are thankful to be able to help children and John Drake, along with the dedicated staff of The Lingap Foundation. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133070		/users/profile/178768	ludvigson	Donor	5	11/03/2012	John Drake and the Lingap Center are the ultimate, highly-leveraged, grass roots organization.   Why is it highly leveraged?  Because John and his board members pay all administrative costs for fund raising.  Every dollar collected goes to the Center in Toledo City, Phillipines.  Why is it the ultimate grass roots program?  Because it's private donations that fund the Center.  There's no government involvement, other than the placement of Peace Corps volunteers.  Yes, John was solicited by the Peace Corps to see whether he'd accept a volunteer.  Usually, it's the other way around.  But, Lingap Center has a reputation in the international community as a game-changing, terrifically effective program.  John Drake is a tremendous force for good, and is truly a visionary. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133067		/users/profile/178765	sueo	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Center uses all its donations to aid the children at their center in the Phillipines. I like knowing that all I contribute goes to support the center. I especially like the fact that my donation is not used to send requests to me further donations. John has a great program set up to make donating convenient.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133064		/users/profile/178763	Anonymoud	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap center has served as a beacon of hope for the neglected and abused children in the Philippines. It has become the standard by which other charity institutions are modeled.  I thank John D, for his generous and and unrelenting commitment to improve the lot of these children. He inspires all of us.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133061		/users/profile/178760	Carol76	Donor	5	11/03/2012	I think it is fabulous that John is making a difference in so many children's lives.  He started to help before he retired and now that he is retired he still continues to help those less fortunate.  I can only imagine what would have happened to the many children John helps today if he was not dedicated to this cause.  May god bless him for his work.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133057		/users/profile/178756	jepanergo	Donor	5	11/03/2012	My family support The Lingap Children's Foundation since this foundation started. It make us happy to see amazing results.      
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133055		/users/profile/178754	Candy M.	Donor	5	11/03/2012	Several years ago I became aware of the Lingap Center and we have supported it ever since. John D. is an amazing man who is an inspiration to us all. Even though the part I play in supporting the Lingap Center is small, I am very proud to support it and especially knowing that 100% of what I give goes towards the center to help children in great need. Now that my own children are a bit older and can understand what the Lingap Center does - we have made it a Christmas tradition to give money to the center as part of our Christmas gifts. My children enjoy seeing pictures of the Lingap children and reading the Stories of how the center has helped them.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133054		/users/profile/178753	Julianne B.	Donor	5	11/03/2012	When we first became aquainted with the Lingap Children's Foundation and John Drake, we was awed by the opportunities they were providing to the children of the Phillipines.  They were not just offering these children food and a chance to be educated; they were saving lives!  Not only was this organization making a monumental difference to children, John Drake was doing all this as a volunteer, determined that all funds coming in to the foundation go to help the children.  All of this was more than enough to convince my husband and I that we wanted to be a part of Lingap's mission.  When I had the opportunity last year to hear two children who were beneficiaries of Lingap talk at the school I teach at, I saw first hand the tremendous work this foundation is doing to make a difference for children who would otherwise never have the chance to learn, much less survive in many instances!  God bless Lingap Foundation, all the children and volunteers, and John Drake!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133046		/users/profile/178746	bethdecker	Donor	5	11/03/2012	My husband and I have supported The Lingap Childrens Foundation for a few years now and we believe it a superior organization helping children that really need it.  My favorite thing is that the money goes directly to the children.  The volunteers are just that and are not paid!  Thank you John Drake for a wonderful children's organization.  I feel honored to be a part of this foundation.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133044		/users/profile/178744	macunn	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	We got involved with the Lingap Childrens Foundation after hear John Drakes story and seeing how he was touched by the children.  We have been involved for several years and he is doing a fantastic job with saving children from abuse and neglect in the Phillipines. They  have an opportunity at an education , health care and a loving home as well as religious guidance.  We have helped him raise money to build the center and give each month to help maintain it.  Now the children are having a chance to make a difference in their community.  The street program is helping all children in the area not just the ones at the Lingap Center.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133041		/users/profile/178741	nancysunday	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Foundation headed up by John Drake has helped so many needed children at the orphanage.  He works endlessly to help them and has built them a school where they can be educated and live safely. He is a very generous person with his time and money as no administrative costs are taken from any donations to the foundation.  We will continue to suppport him in any way that we can.

I will continue to support the organizations efforts for as long as I can.  To all the supporters involved, I say keep up the good work and may God bless you.  Glenn C
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133037		/users/profile/178737	C.Chan	Donor	5	11/03/2012	I have seen LIngap Children's Foundation help children in the Philippines to realize their dreams through better education opportunities, improved living conditions, and most importantly the teaching of core values that promote love and peace for mankind.  100% of all funds raised go to the children.  Nothing goes to support the administration of the Foundation.  This means that my donation and that of many others all go to support the children.  Can't ask more than that!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133032		/users/profile/178732	KSR1012	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2012	This is a dynamic organization one with the sole mission of helping kids.  John Drake is  dedicated to this mission of helpingt these kids (the throw away kids of this region) to make a live for themselves, which without this Center, they would be illiterate and street beggers.    I call John Drake Saint John because of his dedication and caring and his motivation to help these kids.  John seeks every avenue of support for this caring and life changing mission.  The Lingap Center deserves ever donation that they receive.     Karen Randall
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133031	1	/users/profile/178730	Brian _P	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The organization is incredible! I was looking to become a donor/volunteer and found the LinGap center and it was also the next town over from where my daughter is in the Philippines. I have visited the center and seen all the children and is was an uplifting experience. The whole staff does wonderful work there and the children as so well mannered and happy to see you. I happen to be from an area that has snow during the winter time and was showing the kids there the pictures and they were amazed. I later returned to the USA and sent out a BalikBayon box with art & school supplies in it and my fiencee gave it to them and you would think that got a brnd new game system. It was a wonderful experience to go there and see the children so please know that this foundation is making a difference in these childrens lives!! They are the only foundation that I found that 100% of your donation goes to the kids. Keep up the wonderful work you are doing there!!!
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133029	1	/users/profile/178728	JohnZ	Donor	5	11/03/2012	There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most charitable and caring organizations in the world.Why? 1.) 100% of the donations received go to help the Lingap children. No other organization does that. 2.) total commitment to help saving childrens lives and at the same time caring, educating, and loving these children 3.) a founder, John Drake, who donates so much of his time and finances to the Lingap center 4.) a commitment to contine to help other abused, neglected, and drying children Visit the Lingap center website and learn for yourself more about this FANTASTIC ORGANIZATION. May God continue to bless all of the Lingap children, the volunteers, and those who reach out to the Lingap Center.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133018		/users/profile/140949	nancycbrown47	Donor	5	11/03/2012	We started giving to Lingap a few years ago. John keeps us up to date on the happenings in that part of the world, and we know that every dollar we give goes directly to the kids and families in need. We do an automatic "Place at the Table" donation each month and know that by pledging like this, John can depend on our monthly gift, and make the best use of the money he can. We feel good giving to Lingap.  Mike and Nancy Brown
Lingap Childrens Foundation	105008	1	/users/profile/140949	nancycbrown47	Donor	5	01/30/2012	I think the most important thing to know about this charity is that 100% of your donation goes directly to helping kids live better lives.  We heard John speak at our parish and were moved to help out. I know for certain that our money is put to excellent use and that helps us feel great about giving regularly.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133015		/users/profile/178713	johlt	Donor	5	11/03/2012	In the two years that our parish has worked with John Drake and the Lingap Center, he has done amazing things. Children who were society's discards now have a place where they can eat and get an education, and it all started on a shoestring. John is a straightforward and honest man, and I know that the money that I give them is put to tremendous use. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133012		/users/profile/63456	Monse	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2012	This is such a worthy charity. Street children and orphans  are put in a caring home and sent to school to be productive and model members of society.  Truly changing their future for the best.  You can go to their website and see the joy in these children's faces.  All donations are applied 100% for the benefit of the children. A foundation truly founded on LOVE. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	103986		/users/profile/63456	Monse	General Member of the Public	5	01/20/2012	The Lingap Children's Foundation is  outstanding, if you are looking for an exceptional charity.  The donations are 100% applied for the benefit of  the orphans and the operation of the orphanage .   My  daughter and her husband went to visit this facility and were so impressed on how  the children are  so well-mannered, cheerful , and  healthy.  They have a family-like environment, with the older ones  caring  for the younger ones.  They have well-rounded personalities and go to the schools in their locality.   They are being taught self-sufficiency and trained to be future contributing members of society.  Some of them are going to college and high school . Do go to their website and see for yourself.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	59031		/users/profile/63456	Monse	Donor	5	12/22/2010	This is a very well run orphanage in the Philippines.  Donations are always receipted and all all of the monies are spent to run the orphanage.  The orphans are sent to good schools and are trained to be responsible individuals, learning how to work and helping the younger ones.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133011		/users/profile/178710	Linda136	Donor	5	11/03/2012	John and Judy and Lingap demonstrate everything that you always wish a nonprofit organization could be.  100% of donations goes to help children.  I am proud to donate to Lingap, and never hesitate to recommend it to friends and family when they are looking for a cause to support.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133010		/users/profile/178709	Jill R.	Donor	5	11/03/2012	After hearing John Drake speak at our church about the work he does at the Lingap center with the poorest of the poor, my children wanted to help.  They did a fundraiser at school and when it was time to donate they were fortunate enough to have Mr. Drake and a few of his kids from Lingap, who were in town visiting, come and receive their donation.  They shared their heart wrenching stories and Mr. Drake shared all that he's been able to do to help so many.  When parents heard that 100% of the donations would go to the kids many were encouraged to become regular donors.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133004		/users/profile/178700	Pat A	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	Lingap is an organization that gives 100% of my donation to the kids and facility in the Philippines.  John and Judy Drake give their time totally free of any monetary benefits.  How many of us can claim that amazing attribute. The work that is being done for the 90 plus children is amazing.  Education is of the highest priority and John has all of the kids going to private schools so they can get an excellent education and a path to success.  All I can say is Wow!!!   
Lingap Childrens Foundation	133002		/users/profile/178698	gardra	Donor	5	11/03/2012	Our experience is that this organization is devoted to only one intrest, to benefit needy children.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	133001		/users/profile/178697	ali.clover	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Center is an incredible foundation that saves children from unimaginable conditions in the Phillipines. It offers them a safe home and education, and allows them to grow and help others in turn. In addition to caring for the children in the orphanage, the foundation also educates and feeds as many other children as possible. John and Judy Drake are very passionate about their foundation, and are continually finding new ways to better the lives of these children. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	132998		/users/profile/178694	nsherardfreeman	Donor	5	11/03/2012	I donate to the work of the Lingap Center because John's letters help me see that my donations have impact.  His updates invite me to look at the Center through the eyes of the children.  By sharing milestones of the Lingap community, and weaving everyday details into the story, I feel like more that just a donor...through Lingap, I can see that I'm a partner in work that deeply matters in the world.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	132965		/users/profile/178655	Denise33	Donor	5	11/03/2012	The Lingap Center is an amazing orphanage in the Philippines, created and run by our Uncle John. He has done an incredible job and touched SO many lives. Many, many children are alive, educated, and happy with a safe place to live because of his vision and hard work.....with a little help from Aunt Judy, of course. :-)  Please support this wonderful foundation any way you can. It is truly a gift of life to many abused & abandoned children.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	132623		/users/profile/53712	jmrgb1	Donor	5	11/02/2012	The Lingap Children's Foundation, the Lingap Center and John's personal conversion story are real-world examples of God's love for His children.  God needed someone to hep the chldren of the delapitated Lingap Center, and called an unexpecting fortune 500 exectutive.  Reluctant at first, John (and his incredible wife Judy) answered the call and watched as seemingly insurmountable obstacles dissolved, one after another.  The Lingap Center is now considered THE model to emulate in the Philippine Islands.  They've provided for the basic necessities of life (food, clothing, shelter) while also incorporating hygiene, education and religion as well.  To appreciate this, you need to understand that orphan children in the Philippines have NO status - and are left on their own in the streets.  They were not allowed in school or church.  The Lingap Center, and their various programs, have begun changing a culture.  Praise God for John and Judy, and the Lingap board, staff and volunteers who are a manifestation of HOPE for these children - and an inspiration for the rest of us.  
Lingap Childrens Foundation	52733		/users/profile/53712	jmrgb1	Donor	5	09/17/2010	The orphaned or abused children in the U.S., while not having the best of circumstances, at least have a fighting chance.  In the Philippines, children in this plight are societal outcasts.  They are not allowed in schools, being forced to beg or scavange for food, or worse, to sell themselves.  They aren't even allowed in church.  But the Lingap Center has changed that - providing meals, shelter, education, church and most of all -- hope!  From a small town in southern Michigan, John Drake was God's answer to neglected children half way around the world.  God called - he answered - and the results have been miraculous.  The children now have a safe, positive environment to call home.  While shelter, meals and clothes provide immediate improvement in quality of life, it is the loving atmosphere and hope where Lingap really shines.  The children are able to attend school now, with several having gone onto college. This opens up job opportunities.  The children now are welcomed at church so their spiritual lives can thrive.  In fact, the Lingap children's choir has become the official church choir. Lingap has estblished a street education program where they educate street children on hygiene and basic academic skills, while most importantly, providing a sack lunch - the only meal some of those kids will receive.  Their 3rd Saturday Outreach program has brought in excess of 500 kids to Lingap where all experience a caring, family-like setting...and are fed.Also, under their current administrative setup, 100% of ALL donations go to the kids.  These are just some of the wonderful things Lingap has done...and that is why I am proud to support their efforts.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	108329		/users/profile/147445	Judy24	Donor	5	03/26/2012	Mother Teresas work is being carried on in the world by individuals like John Drake.  Johns organization, The Lingap Center/Foundation, is transforming lives for children who would otherwise be forgotten in Philippines. Through his efforts, other organizations that have previously turned their backs on this forgotten, downtrodden population are now being accountable and have become positive partners in this tremendous endeavor. Johns personal sacrifice is tremendous; it must be noted that 100% of donations go directly to the children.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	107745		/users/profile/146296	martaportillo06	Donor	5	03/09/2012	Expressing with only a few words how grateful I am for "the Lingap Center" is impossible... I have discovered in the past years a place of hope, dreams, thankfulness and most importantly, happiness. The vision of John Drake, his hard work, his love and trust for the homeless kids of Toledo is truly an example that we should all admire. This is a beautiful organization that is giving "CHANCES" to those that did not have before. I never imagined that giving a CHANCE to somebody will make me so happy. Please, let's GIVE CHANCES!  Let's help fulfill dreams! THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTON OF MY HEART to John and everybody that makes this place such a great place. Marta.

Lingap Childrens Foundation	102750		/users/profile/135474	vicki.carmichael	General Member of the Public	5	12/31/2011	My husband, Lonnie Cooper, is a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Philippines. His "assignment" to the Lingap Center was my introduction to this wonderful facility. I have been visiting with him at the Center for the past two weeks now and I find it to be a terrific place for kids to feel safe and secure. The children are wonderful, talented and very engaged in their studies. The staff is most helpful and excellent with the kids. I could not imagine a better facility anywhere! I have spoken with John Drake (and will meet himm in person today). His heart is full of love and pride for the Center -- as it should be.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	101091	1	/users/profile/128131	Ben Hogan	Volunteer	5	11/26/2011	We first heard John Drake at church in 2009. We donated after hearing his talk. We heard him again in 2011 and donated and asked to meet him. My wife and I have met John and Judy, and I have spent considerable time with John in person through emails and on the telephone since. This is one of the best causes and stories that I have heard in my lifetime. To take childern who have no hope, no outlet for the future, and no food to sustain them, and provide all these things, along with love, is God's work. And HE is doing the work through John. I've talked to many people, including several priests, who have visited the Lingap Center and are all very impressed. -Bill Phillips
Lingap Childrens Foundation	100684	1	/users/profile/124037	CraigBolland	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2011	My encounter with the Lingap foundation is perhaps a little different. I became aware of a situation with youth homelessness in Ormoc city, Leyte. In trying to find more information about the social support available there, the name of the Lingap foundation kept coming up over and over.  So I contacted the Lingap foundation looking for information about social services available in Ormoc, and John replied to me very generously, in detail, and over a period of some days. The point I would like to make is that the Lingap foundation is not only providing a very unique mission in it's local area, but it is also exceeding it's mandate by providing information to interested parties about the broader situation in surrounding areas. The flow-on effects of this are doubtless hard to quantify, but are extremely important. Thanks to John, I achieved a much clearer understanding of the situation throughout the region, and was put in touch with the people most likely to help. Through this I have learned: That the Lingap foundation is providing a unique and vital service to these poor children in an area where there is next to no other social support for vulnerable kids. I'm not prone to hyperbole, but can honestly say that my impression of the Lingap foundation is that of a small, single light shining in the middle of a dark field. That the mission of the Lingap foundation rightly emphasizes education as a way of breaking the cycles of poverty. That this is a rare and unique effort in this particular part of the world. That the impacts of that effort extend well beyond it's geographical and operational mandate, as in my case. I highly, highly commend John for his generosity and passion, and the Lingap foundation for providing a beachhead of hope. May the momentum be supported and grow.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88691	1	/users/profile/100048	mtoerne	Donor	5	05/13/2011	I first heard about the Lingap Center from  its founder, John Drake, while at a church retreat. John's story impacted me by opening my mind to possibilites beyond what I had imagined toward serving others. John, his wife, and the Foundation have impacted so many lives in postivie ways. To see the "before" and "after" photographs, one could see that not only were the gifts of food, clothing, stability, love, education, and a place to call home, but one could actually see a gift of hope and self-worth reflected in the eyes of these children. It is satisfying to know that 100% of donations go toward the children. John runs the organization effectively and efficiently- nothing is wasted and everything is used to its full extent. I phoned John after my initial donation, and he personally returned my call and answered my questions and provided more information on the Lingap Center. A worthy cause and a worthy, focused use of your donations!

Lingap Children's Foundation is one of the strong partners of our project.  I work with so many child caring organization in the country and Lingap is probably one of the top 10% with regards to excellent service in the development of the children.  When it comes to serving the children in especially difficult circumstances, Lingap definitely have a very high standard.  Working with Lingap as a partner has been a pleasant experience for me.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88352		/users/profile/99341	srbarbq	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2011	I have closely followed the story of the Lingap Childrens Center since its inception. It is a modernday miracle. John Drake started with nothing and has loved into existence a wonnderful center which allows children to become healthy, schooled and be loved. I only wish I was wealthy because I would give generously.  It bring tears to your eyes to hear the chilldren talk about their new lives. At present their are 14 children in college. Wow that is great success with former street children. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88325		/users/profile/99297	vcs2004	Volunteer	5	05/03/2011	The Lingap Children's Center is a wonderful non-profit organization that is saving the lives of many orphaned and exploited children. They provide a home and schooling for children that would have otherwise been on the street in the Phillippines. They nurture and encourage these children by showing them how to do work together, go to school (college too!) and succeed in life. 100% of the donations to the Lingap Center benefit the children because the administrative costs are taken care of by directed donations. 
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88236	1	/users/profile/99151	Ron K.	Donor	5	05/01/2011	I have known John and Judy Drake for over 30 years, and the story of the Lingap Center is truly a journey of hope for some kids who had none. It was by accident, or more likely that this was God-ordained because I'm sure it wasn't how John envisioned spending his retirement years.  But hope he has brought to some kids who the world had forgotten is truly miraculous at Lingap Center. Every story is a touching and real because I've met some of the kids personally through John's generosity to bring them to America for a visit. These kids experience a happy ending, instead of the horrors that awaited these 'street' urchins who no one else wanted, except for horrific sex trading or slave labor. Even the Church rejected them.  The reason this is such a worthwhile foundation is that every dime goes to helping kids.  John covers ALL administrative costs, and this labor of love has so positively impacted the 'lucky' orphans who attend Lingap, but also the THOUSANDS of kids who show up for their 3rd Sunday events. John has taken kids from the gutter, with no food or chance at survival, and gave them HOPE.  14 kids are even in college now, and more to come - an unfathomable outcome just a few years ago.  This is one financial gift that I absolutely love to give because I've seen how it impacts lives.  This is truly the Lord's work being accomplished through some very special, committed people.  Please consider a generous gift or at least prayers for these folks, and know that it ALL will go to rescuing kids from some horrible circumstances.   
Lingap Childrens Foundation	88207		/users/profile/99107	Steve Y.	General Member of the Public	5	05/01/2011	Foundation Director John Drake contacted me 2 years ago to help with a video project for a fundraising event for this charity. Since that time I've become aware of the incredible work that is being done to make a REAL difference in the lives of these children - giving them dignity, love, education, and opportunity for a better future. John and Judy Drake, the Foundation Board, and the staff at The Lingap Center do this for all the right reasons. I am 100% confident in their motivation and just as impressed by their results.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	85897	1	/users/profile/95977	sallybee	Donor	5	04/15/2011	I have known the founders of the Lingap Center (John and Judy Drake) for many years,  and they have shared with me their stories about the children and the Center's progress.  The scope of what they, along with their team of dedicated staff, volunteers and donors, have been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time is truly remarkable.  The  children who live at the Center have been taken from hopelessness and put on a path to a very bright future, and the Center has positively impacted thousands of others through its community-outreach activities.  100% of the money donated goes to benefit the projects--not many charities can say that.  I encourage you to visit the Center's website to see for yourself the miracles that are taking place.
Lingap Childrens Foundation	85016	1	/users/profile/94566	rghymel	Volunteer	5	04/08/2011	I volunteered to visit the Lingap Childrens Center this past January to take pictures and help with the computer system.  On the way there John asked me to spend more time with the children.  When I arrived, I couldnt help but spend more time with the children.  All of these kids are starved for attention and guidance and the Lingap Center does a wonderful job providing for these needs and more.  The full-time staff is the best.  There are many charities out there, but very few where 100% of donated money goes directly to benefitting the kids.

It is an amazing story,and  shows what one person with a passion for something can achieve.

I have visited the center and seen the lives that are saved by this amazing organization.  100% of all funds donated go to serve the children who, without Lingap, would have absolutely nothing.  The wonderful people who are involved in this charity, at all levels, are quality people who's care for and love of the children are evident in everything they do.  There are just not enough stars available to accurately rate the Lingap Children's Foundation!

We have seen many young lives changed because of the outstanding work of the Lingap Children's Foundation.  The strong emphasis the foundation's leadership places on reducing administrative costs and overhead, and their absolute commitment to see donor dollars directed toward helping the children is unparalleled in the nonprofit community.

We can't save every child, nor meet the needs of all the disadvantaged, but it fills the spirit to help the Lingap Center make a huge, life-changing, life-saving change for these children. John's vision and relentless, tireless quest to fulfill it have been a small miracle, and a tender mercy in my life. It is a privilege to be able to participate in the effort and to know this man. He makes me want to be a better person.I guarantee you that you cannot spend a dollar which will have a greater effect, nor generate more deep and sincere gratitude than by helping these children.

Both my wife and I have witnessed the tragic poverty that exists in that country.  Of particular note are the seemingly hopeless children who have virtually no future ahead of them.  In fact, their next meal is the most important thing in their world.My wife and I have become acquainted with the Lingap Center through its founder, John Drake.The level of his generosity and involvement with these children is unparalled.  We feel very strongly that the shelter and education that Lingap provides for these xhildren is worthy of all support and donations possible. The need is there and cries out for all of us to answer.

So when I recently moved to the area and saw that the VFW National Home for Children was located there, I knew I wanted to give back and volunteer.  I was met with nothing but kindness and gratitude.  I volunteer about 2-3 times a week and look forward to coming to this beautiful, serene, and calming campus every time.  The staff do a wonderful job for the veterans who need a little assistance and I'm incredibly grateful to be a part of it, no matter how small my part may seem.

I have always found the Staff to be passionately committed to the health, education and well-being of the residents. The Administration looks for any possible way to stretch resources, such as collecting enough labels to get  seven vans for Home use. That's over seven million labels!!! Dedication personified.

We stopped to visit for a bit.  The young man was just back from deployment in Afghanistan.  He and his family were residents of the home during his treatment for PTSD at a local VA facility.  The home gave them a place to live during his treatment time, otherwise they would not have had a place to live.  They were grateful for all the help given by the folks at the National Home.  He and his wife thanked us many times for all the help and and explained what a blessing it was to have the services of the National Home available to them.Ed McCray,  Commander,  VFW District 1, Dept. of Ohio

My friend and I are proud to support this great organization which helps veterans and their families during difficult times.  It is so much more than the name implies, for example, on the VFW National Childrens' Home campus are many houses supported by individual states by the VFW and Auxiliary members.  Mississippi has a home there.  My friend and I also tell all our friends, both VFW and VFW Auxiliary members, and relatives and encourage them to donate to this organization/facility by having them sign up as lifetime members for as little as $35.

I am in the single family program.  I qualified because my grandfather was a WW11 veteran.  The home has provided a safe haven for my children and myself.  Before I came to the National Home I was hopeless.  With the help of the support staff I got back on my feet.  My children have a safe neighborhood to play at, and go on many trips.  They also have access to a computer lab with tutoring available.   I ask my youngest what his favorite thing is about living there and he replies; "There's lots of kids to play with, I and I feel safe"  Because of the National Home for Children my children have a since of community and pride!

So many families have come thru there and were able to get assistance. The staff is all friendly and extremely helpful and welcoming. We stayed in the guesthouse, which is really more like a motel. Everything is clean and well maintained. We painted a room off the new museum and sorted and scanned photos. I really enjoyed getting to see the time capsule of memories. Tim and the staff were just as concerned that we were enjoying ourselves as we were to do a good job. I would do it again! I definitely would recommend them - they are deserving of your time and donations!

The kids are smart, friendly, and true ambassadors of the organization.  The parents are given a chance to learn and grow and become the parents they want to be in a safe, inspiring environment.  On one visit I met a mother and her three kids the week they arrived, early in December.  The kids clung to their mother, were fearful of others, and timid when accepting our Christmas gifts.  The next year I saw them again, Mom looked 10 years younger and glowed with confidence.  The children were smiling, offered hugs, and went off, without Mom, to help the staff with some younger kids.   All were talkative and grateful for the opportunities they had been given.  Mom was going to school to get a better job, and the kids were excelling in school.  THIS is why I give my money and my time  --- to give others a hand up so they can help themselves to a better life.

It is a wonderful place that not only cares for the children and the families, but teaches them life skills to grow as people and improve their situations.  They give the parents and children a safe and nurturing place to live, while they better themselves through education and job training.  It is a hand up - not a hand out. At one time, I referred someone to the home.  While they did not end up moving to Michigan, the staff worked diligently to find them the resources that could help them here in Minnesota.

The services provided by those that work and volunteer there is wonderful.  There are houses that were built by funds from different states throughout the United States to provide housing for our military families that have someone serving overseas.   They provide training and help for women in need of getting back into the work force.  They have a daycare and childcare onsite that provides services for those mothers already working.  Houses are built to accommodate those with a handicap.   IF you have a family to visit there, they have a place to stay onsite and a chapel if you would like to have a quiet place to worship.  They have a gym with areas set up to entertain and accommodate different age groups from teens to preschool.    My husband and I stopped in unannounced one afternoon and were treated to a personal tour of the campus.  They are one of a kind.   They are dedicated to helping our veterans and their families.  They  have my blessings.  I am now a lifetime member.  They make a difference.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	116649	1	/users/profile/158784	Bonnie16	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	I had the pleasure of visiting the home and spending time with the people who reside there and the children.  I was extremely impressed with the way they are being helped to put their lives back in perspective with being able to not worry how their family is cared for while they learn to go out into the workplace or by going on to further education to assist them in returning to the work force.  Our military personnel who are married and both are being sent to serve their country overseas have a place where their children can stay and be cared for while both are deployed.  The children at the home receive a home life that is filled with a life that children should have while separated from their parents and are able to stay in a safe comfortable atmosphere and continue a life to which they are used to.  The home also provides a help line for returning military personnel where they receive assistance obtaining help receiving their benefits and if they need medical or mental assistance they are giving information to obtain this help and if necessary they are brought to the home and assisted until they are able to be on their own.  The people who work at the home are some of the most caring people in the world and their main purpose is to help our military families maintain life styles that are beneficial and productive and active military personnel do their job without the worry of what is happening to their children and spouses.

The Washington Cottage was beautiful as was the entire campus.  The family who lives in the cottage was very gracious to allow us to visit their home.  The staff is very friendly and thorough.  They are excellent at Customer Service in person, over the phone or over the Internet.  The basis  for the National Home is very simple, provide a friendly place for veterans or active duty family members, help them and the children get the education they need to be productive members of society and teach patriotism all at the same time.  We met children of all ages and they were healthy and happy.  The program really works, the kids learn responsibility and have a safe place to grow up.  The museum is very interesting, it was good to see how many generations of kids are still in touch with each other and the National Home.  What a great legacy of service to our veterans and their families.  Their arms are always open in welcome.  You should visit, it will give you a greater understanding of their mission.

These children have the opportunity to stay together as a unit and are given great changes to continue their education.  Many have gone on to college and given back to the Home and our world by joining the military service (which is not a requirement)  Other have gone on into the work force with confidence and pride for their Country.This is an important Home where the need unfortunately is needed now even more than in the past withso much going on in the world with the conflicts and economy where families can not always help and take on additional members as in the past.  There are many VFW Comrades and Auxiliary Sisters who support this Home as well as the employees who work there that think of all the children as part of ourfamilies and give them our love and thoughts throughout the years.

This child received an education and a 'family' immediately when he would otherwise have been placed in an adoption home for who knows how long. It provided him with instant stability and he blossomed into a wonderful young man thanks to the wonderful staff at this facility.

Having been a life member of the VFW for many years and listening to the mention of the national home in our closing prayer it just seems natural to help financially.  As a Christian nation  we are called upon to help one another and I can't think of anyone more deserving than our military families.  They have given so much and yet our country expects more and more of them with fewer members.  My meager donations have been recognized on a frequent basis and the National Home does a wonderful job staying in touch it its supporters.  If you can't help financially, take a few minutes and lift the residents and staff up in prayer.  Thanks

We have been donating to the National Home since 2003 and consider it to be the pearl of the VFW and MOC.  In December 2008 my wife and I were able to go to the National Home when I was the Grand Commander of the MOC in Nevada.  We were able to meet with and talk to the staff, parents and children and found that every single one of them were praising the National Home and what was being accomplished there!  They were very appreciative of the support they and the Home receives from members of the VFW and MOC and their Auxiliaries.  We are proud to be considered a part of that support. The recent program that was opened at the National Home to assist the spouse and family of deployed troops is absolutely outstanding!!  The program helps them while the deployed spouse is gone and provides family needs.  When the spouse comes home the National Home reintroduces the deployed member to the family unit and helps the family plan for the future and with getting housing and back into the normal flow of family life.    We pray the National Home continues far into the future because it is truly essential to this day and age!!

There are so many programs being cut and eliminated that try to help and this one definitely provides a second chance to get back on your feet and be able to provide for your family.  I can't bbelieve it is the only one in the county that does that when it could be so useful in so many areas in the whole United states.  It is definitely money well  spent and gives people in troublea solid base to learn and achievea positive way to live.  1000 times up for this program!!!! Need more like it all around the country!!!

The home has always been proactive in doing all within their power to care for the dependents of active duty folks needing help with some of the life challenges that being in the military brings. They have a state of the art school located on a beautiful campus. They have recently been fundraising to raise money for the upgrade of their technology department with computers, printers and such. I donate to the Home on a regular basis and my father who recently passed provided funds for them - a wonderful cause.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	226352	2	/users/profile/290082	MichelleHawaii	Client Served	5	10/24/2014	I was in a desperate situation as a single mother I had nothing and nowhere to turn with my child. I was welcomed in and treated so well by all the volunteers and staff. My daughter was my major concern and she was so loved and cared for at the nursery that without them I do not think we would be where we are today. I was able to take my time and search for a position to where I could support myself and my daughter. I went from worrying if I was going to have to live in my car with my 1 year old and what I could do to feed her, to making 6 figures a year. This place was a answer to my prayers and the service they do to families in need of comfort and help I can not put into words. VFW home for Children saved my and my daughter's life and provided a safe environment until I was able to provide a future. They gave us our lives back!

The children are given a place to live, are taken to school, and fed regular meals.  They take care of teens as well as infants.  The VFW helps to support the home with donations of money as well as school supplies.  Our soldiers have no worry about  how their wives and children are being cared for while they are serving our country.  The homes as well as the grounds are beautiful and extremely well kept.  I am  honored to recommend donations to the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children in Eaton Rapids, MI USA to help care for families of our troops around the world keeping our country safe from harm.

They constantly provide the services as advertised, and the services they provide exceed the standards one would expect of such an organization. They should receive an "A-One" rating for all of their programs.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	226256	2	/users/profile/289993	USNRetired	Donor	5	10/24/2014	Words can not express how terrific the VFW National Home for Children is. This is a place where families who have experienced difficulties in their family. These can range from injuries, unexpected deaths, financial problems, familial problems and many other issues. Residing on campus for up to three years the families are expected to have gainful employment, receive consuling and training in money management, eduction, savings, communication, etc. The children are offered one on one tutoring, a computer lab, science center, nursary services for three different age groups at no cost to the family. Testimonials from former residents indicate that at the end of the three years on campus, their lives have been completely changes. Most have acquired enough savings to have a down payment to purchase their own home, have repaired credit issues, and have earned a college degree. There is much more to the VFW National Home for children, but the best evidence of how how long the staff members have served on campus. Many for over 25 years. It actually takes a personal visit to the VFW National Home for Children to understand how great it is.

It was one of the most inspiring visits that I have had to be able to visit Eaton Rapids, Michigan and see for myself what great work is being done at the VFW National Home for Children.  The openness of their acceptance of any military person and their families to help them get reestablished after being away from home and then cannot get a job or back on their feet is beyond anything I have seen in other groups.  The respectful way those living there are treated and the great staff's ability to make then feel at home is something you need to see.  Great job!!  My vote is for this home to be given 5 stars for their achievement in helping those in need that have served in our military.

This is just like home.  The housing is marvelous and the staffing is 100% effective in helping the veterans and their families.  They utilize every penny that is contributed in each aspect of the campus.  There is always more to be done and I would recommend this charity as a #1 on any contributors list of excellent charities to support.

Everything the VFW National Home does with their children is commendable. The VFW National Home has been serving children and families in need since 1922 and I do everything I can you help them in raising money. General Motors and the UAW have also helped.

Im a Past VFW Commander of Clio, MI and now Sr. Vice Commander of the Military Order of the Cootie, Grand of Michigan. I have helped in anyway I can for all the Children of the VFW National Home in Eaton Rapids, MI over the years. I was working a few years back at the General Motors Proving Ground when GM made a rather large donation to the Home from their cars sales. I appreciate them for that and wrote them to let them know. I help with a Christmas Party every year for the 70 to 80 Children there and will look forward to that for years to come. Its important what The VFW National Home for Children is about and the whole world should know about it. We at the MOC Grand of Michigan raise funds for them nationally every year. Hope everyone will contribute. Thanks, Bob R.

It has been my pleasure to interact with the VFW National Home for Children on several ocassions.  A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Home with several dozen other VFW members from my state.  Whatever I had known about the great work the Home does for children and families, it was reinforced on this visit.  The residents are mostly families, single-parent, who collectively have about 120 children in residence, who are getting an opportunity to improve their lives through the help of the Home.  The residents are set on a path of self-sustainability, through regular monitoring and evaluation, goal - setting, and activities tailored to their goals.  The child care / nursery school was very impressive, with dedicated personnel.   I have re-dedicated myself to do more with and for the jewel which is the VFW National Home for Children.

Not only do our Arizona VFW  Auxiliaries continue to support the National Home we also specifically donate to keep the Arizona House is top shape.  The entire campus is well run and maintained to the highest level of our expectations and continues to meet the those expectations.  Donations are used for their intended purpose and right now we are helping to bring the entire campus up to date with new computers.  I have nothing but appreciation and admiration for the staff and volunteers at the National Home for everything that they do for veterans and their families to help them thrive.   Children make great strides when they are in a place where they feel love and safe.  That's what it's all about!  
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	226145	2	/users/profile/289885	PAGirl	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	The VFW National Home for Children is an outstanding non-profit organization.  I have heard many stories of veterans who have come home from military service overseas, have lost jobs and are suffering from PTSD.  They cannot take care of their children for this reason or because spouses have left them while they were serving and cannot make ends meet when they get home.  The VFW National Home for Children has been there to help many veterans in situations such as this.  The children thrive at the National Home and the parent is able to get back on their feet and realize what a service they have performed for our county and what a tremendous service they still have to contribute to our world!  This non-profit organization does not allow any veteran to be left behind and this, in itself, is worthy of an outstanding rating for a non-profit organization.  
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	226140	2	/users/profile/289880	mdscha	Donor	5	10/24/2014	The VFW National Home for Children serves as a living memorial to Americas veterans by helping our nations veteran and military families during difficult times. The VFW National Home for Children was founded in 1925 as a place where the families left behind by war -- mothers and children, brothers and sisters -- could remain together, keeping the family circle intact even when their serviceman didn't come home. Today's families face different challenges -- reintegration, post-traumatic stress, high unemployment and rehabilitation from battlefield injuries, among others -- and the National Home has evolved over our decades-long history to meet those changing needs. Whether they help a family find strength and support close to home through their Helpline, or the families become part of their campus community, military and veteran families can count on the VFW National Home for Children to help them build better lives together.

Some of the children are orphans while others just need a home and a place to feel loved, while a parent is deployed. This organization gets that kids are not grown at 18 and has services to successfully transition teens to college or to an independent adult life without throwing them on the street like foster care. Children there have opportunities that enable them to reach for the sky.

The help that we have received has far exceeded any expectations I could have imagined. From providing amazing childcare to our son,  to assistant for groceries while we were struggling to get by financially. The staff at the National home work around the clock with the sincere motivation of giving back to veterans and their families. I speak for my whole family when I say that, to us, the National Home has become our home and the staff our extended family. We hope to one day give back to the organization that has selflessly supported and believed in our family.  Beyond the staff, the veterans who tireless work to fund this organization so that they may help other veterans and their families... I have to say that I have been struck several times by the generosity and concern of these veterans. There is still "good" in this world and if you ever need to be reminded, visit the National Home.

I lived here for a few years and it was all a total faade. Everything that you see on state days is FAKE. All the "shiny happy people" are just people who are being led into insanity by Patrice Green and Molly Studinger. I have seen this firsthand, every "house tour" is set up. Everything has to be done to the employee's standards and I feel that is very wrong. Is it suspicious that the houses look virtually vacant when you tour? I know that the social workers such as Naomi McClurg and Andrea Durkee did NOT like me and my family being present during house tours. Point is, they want to control and manipulate your lives and it is WRONG. For the love of god, donate your money to worthier causes, such as the "Stand Up And shout" cancer fund, or the Michigan Humane Society, just not these fools! Expect this to be taken down as soon as a rep from the hime finds this, as a form of damage control!

I continue to support it with monetary donations. This past year as the VFW Department of Maryland State Commander, I selected the home as one of my Special Projects. We raised in excess of  twenty two thousand dollars for the home, but more importantly, we also added 112 new Life Members from the department. This is significant in that anyone, even a non Veteran, can become a Life Member of the National Home by making a one time donation of  thirty fiver dollars. I have also visited the home on several occasions and am very impressed in the way it operates under the leadership of Patrice Green and the other employee's. It is a wonderful place for the children and families of our veterans to reside in the many houses that our VFW Departments have adopted and fund. The children attend school and are not only educated throughout their time living there, but also are involved in many worth projects that teach them the tools they will need to succeed in life.

The work done for our veterans children is outstanding, educational and given with lots of love from all employees. I encourage all members and non members to visit the Home web site to learn what a wonderful life these families are given at our Home. In June of 2009 I was given the opportunity of representing the National Organization at the graduation ceremonies and was very impressed with senior class and their goals to further their education. They each spoke of their time spent at the Home and what it meant to them to remain living there as they attended college. I have supported our Home for Children for 42 years and will continue to do all I can to assist in any way I can.Betty Royston, Past Dept. PresidentDept. of Texas 90/91

The best thing that the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary could do for a Veteran. The staff will even reach out and care for families in need all across the Nation when called on to do so. Money spent here is well invested in children who need the care.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159445	1	/users/profile/158566	Jane31	Donor	5	06/04/2013	I have visited the National Home for Children and was so impressed with the dedicated staff.  The children all seem to be happy, confident and well cared for.  It is an honor to be a regular monthly donor.  It is so easy to set up a monthly donation.  No amount is too small.  I encourage everyone to visit their website and if in Michigan to visit the National Home itself.  It's one of the best things the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary do for our veterans and their families.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	116480	1	/users/profile/158566	Jane31	Donor	5	06/25/2012	I visited the VFW National Home when I was Jr Vice President.  It is the most beautiful, caring and serene place.  It is a wonderful and safe home for the children and families of our veterans.  I've been making an automatic monthly donation for 3 years.  Can't think of a more worthy cause.  I was fortunate this year to visit when Santa delivered gifts to all of the children.  What a great experience!  I would recommend this home for even my grandchildren if it were necessary.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159435	1	/users/profile/211602	Debi C.	Donor	5	06/04/2013	I have visited the VFW National Home for Children and it is a wonderful place.  The homes and grounds are beautiful and WELL kept.  The National Home is a positive place for families to grow and make a better life.  I love that the National Home has also opened up to the children of our service men and women that both are serving overseas at the same time.  What a blessing for these men and women to know that their children are safe and well cared for.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159428	1	/users/profile/211594	Matriarch38	Donor	5	06/04/2013	I have been an Auxiliary Sister for 30+ years.  I and another Aux. Sister attended another convention in Grand Rapids a few years ago and I had told myself, if I EVER get to Michigan, I am going to visit the VFW National Home for Children and we did.  I collect the Campbell Soup POPs to help get the vans for the National Home.  When we visited - they had just received Van #5 and I believe they now have Van #6.  Wherever I travel and visit, I have my handy "clipper" available and often ask friends and families to allow me to search for POPs in their pantries and they are gracious when I tell them the POPs are for the VFW National Children's Home for a new Van.  We were able to visit the Washington State sponsored home on our visit, stayed in the Guest House and saw the need for the repairs and upgrading project recently accomplished and supported that.  I feel it is an honor to have been given a LIFE Membership to the National Home by my Auxiliary in years past.  I strongly support the memorial bricks and FINALLY signed up for automatic donations since this is one of my favorite non-profit charities.  The staff that assisted us were wonderful and so helpful.  I cannot say enough about the wonderful things the staff and volunteers do for the veterans and their families.  We visited the nursery and were impressed with the cleanliness of the facility.   
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159422	1	/users/profile/211583	Mike Fahle	Donor	5	06/04/2013	I became a donor when my dad died.  He was a WWII veteran in the European war and was a long time member and supporter of the VFW, especially of the National Home For Children.  I gave in my dad's memory and have continued to honor him with contributions and because after visiting there the need for help became even more obvious.  I was also impressed at how well the whole place was maintained - the buildings as well as the  whole property - nothing fancy yet the responsibility and  pride showing in the level of care was obvious.  I donated a tandem bike and office furniture on that visit and the people I met with were very pleasant and grateful.  I highly recommend this for those looking for a very worthwhile giving opportunity that serves a much needed purpose and is received with appreciation.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159419	1	/users/profile/211579	Debbie Ferrell	Volunteer	5	06/04/2013	I have been supporting the VFW National Home for Children since becoming a Ladies Auxiliary member in 1989.  Coming from a military family and living close to an Army post, I see what the Home offers our military people when they really need that extra support.  I visited the Home two years ago and was extremely impressed at the "village" atmosphere.  I encourage others to support the Home.

As a member of the auxiliary of Tonganoxie, Kansas Post 9271,  I and the other members of the Post and Auxiliary support the Home  on a regular basis.  I was able to visit the home recently and tour the campus.   It is wonderful place for our military families and their children especially who need help.  It is beautiful campus and well kept.  When I visited, I saw the children, with their backpacks, waiting on the school bus.  They were happy and well cared for.  There is also a playground and daycare for the younger children.   Those children have opportunities that help them thoughout their lives. 
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159401	1	/users/profile/211559	Denise54	Donor	5	06/04/2013	The VFW National Home is a community for the children, widows and widowers of our service men and women who have died for our freedom.  The grounds and homes are well kept providing a community environment.  Children attend schools within the local school district and either go on to college, join the military or return to the National Home as counselors and house parents.  When donations are requested for specific projects you always receive an update on the progress and completion.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159398	2	/users/profile/211555	Kerry Issovery R.	Client Served	5	06/04/2013	As a former VFW National Home resident, I didn't truly realize the impact that was made in my life and how many opportunities were given to me at the National Home until much later in life. Now, as an adult in my forties, with two children of my own, I now realize the enormous impact the VFW National Home had made in my life. The VFW National Home had given me a second chance at a life that I would not have experienced otherwise. The National Home had instilled in me the moral values that would be the foundation for my life as a husband, parent, and societal member. These values had also set the tone for me joining the United States Marine Corps and serving my Country proudly, even though I had been provided with a scholarship by the National Home. The National Home had also provided me with many opportunities to experience the world that I would not have previously had. For instance, the National Home had organized cross-country bicycle trips for as many as ten members to embark on a journey that would build up our self-confidence,  comraderie, and fitness level. Still to this day, I continue to cycle on a regular basis and had recently completed my first ever DALMAC bike tour of 400 miles over a four day period. I had also gone back to college to be the first of nine children to receive a Bachelor's Degree. I am now seeing these same values being instilled in my two children, passed on by my wife and I because we highly value our faith, family, respect, education, and service to country.  The VFW National Home had planted these seeds early in life that now bare much fruit in my own life,  the lives of my children, and theirs to come.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159396	1	/users/profile/211553	ralph.connorjr	Donor	5	06/04/2013	I'm a life member of the VFW National Home for Children because there is no other organization that cares so much about the lives of the orphans and widows/widowers of America's heroes than this one. It provides for every aspect of American life and its experiences that these beneficiaries would likely not have or be able to afford. Aside from those organizations that provide for our wounded warriors returning home, I can think of no other organization equal to the VFW National Home for Children!
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159395	1	/users/profile/211552	vfwmgtxsec	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2013	I joined the VFW Auxiliary about 15 years ago.  One of the first things I found out about was the VFW National Home for Children.  I purchased a Life Membership as soon as I found out about it.  My husband and I ride motorcycles and we have made several rides to collect items and toys for the children at the facility.  My husband made 2 trips with the State Cmdr. of Texas to deliver the items and toys collected.   I was so proud when Texas was able to adopt a home there and it was called the Texas House.  I collect soda and beer tabs for them to help as a donation as well as I make donations when able to.  I really feel that this facility is just one more way that we can help a veterans familiy in need and after they have done so much for us I feel we should do what ever we can to help them.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159391	1	/users/profile/211549	Theresa29	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2013	I have been a member of my local Auxiliary since the age of 16, I am now 63.  I am a past officer and hold a life membership.  I feel that anything we can do for our service people and their families and the veterans and their families is little enough for what they have given us in return.  I include their families because they also serve by keeping  the home fires burning so to speak.  The VFW and its Auxiliary are and have been such a part of my family history with my Father and Mother both participating as much as possible during my growing up years.  I will continue to support this organization for as long as it exists and in anyway I can.  I find it to be worthwhile of my efforts and time because it works and helps so many people.  Terry S.

Those who don't just haven't been exposed to the facts.  What better way to help the family of the veteran that gave us our freedom of today than supporting their families that National Home has taken in.National Home gives the children a chance at life through education, protection, and love.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	159388	1	/users/profile/211546	Dorilynn G.	Donor	5	06/04/2013	For many years I donated to the home because it was encouraged for VFW and Auxiliary members.  Then I went there to visit at Christmas in 2012 and returned there a few weeks ago.  My donations now are not because they are encouraged, the donations are because it is money best spent.  The level of care, honest love, the amazing support system and a staff second to none has created an environment that fosters success.  I once thought the cost of the home was expensive until I realized that the people and the facilities enable permanent life changing success stories.  The fact that they exist without any government support is testimony to the compassion of the American people and the generosity of many business entities

Building on an incredibly long history of helping families in residence at the Home, their very impressive and professional staff have expanded their focus to assist veteran families wherever they are located.  With caring and compassion, they stand ready to help families in need navigate the often complex sea of services available.  Families in crisis are so often consumed by the daunting pressures they face, that they are unable to search for those services available to assist them.  This is a mission that the National Home has readily accepted and joyfully support and guide families to those solutions that provide life changing events.  I am very, very proud to be a supporter of our National Home.

They really give the veterans and their families the help they need to get back to a self supporting family. They truly care about the children, and the parents needs. The love they show to all of them  is amazing. They support the children in their daily activities whether it is school, sports, 4-h choirs, or just having fun outside. They have fishing derby's . The care they give the children is wonderful. They help the veteran heal by getting him or her the help they need it's different for all of them ,so they have so much to offer each of them. They teach the family how to function as a family.I think the National Home is the best organisation to donate to because it helps the whole family.

Any organization must continuously evaluate its value and relavance.  The VFW NH does that.  With new programs the NH has demonstrated its wllingness to change so that it may continue to serve without changing its core mission.  The VFW NH has shown its fiscal responsibility as well as its social responsibility maintaining the trust of its supportors.  The children and families served can be forever grateful for the opportunities given to them by a caring organization and loving staff.

I was very impressed by what they do for our Veteran's and their children. The campus is beautiful. The staff is first rate. Every State's Veteran's service officer should have access to what the National Home is all about and how they can help our veteran's and their families.

I am proud to be a part of the Home "family" since the level of professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm of the staff is obviously the reason for the success, happiness and love found in the kids, both those presently living there as well as those who have moved  on.  The VFW National Home provides an excellent proxy home for its kids and parents in a normal familial environment without which many of the kids would be in a public entitlement program.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	116441	1	/users/profile/158511	Tess Faust	Volunteer	5	06/25/2012	I am a member of the Ladies Auxiiary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  We have a program for this organization.  We have events to raise money for donations to this wonderful place.  I recently had the opportunity to take a tour of the facility.  It's beautiful!  Each home is sponsored by a state VFW or Cootie.  The staff are some of the nicest, most helpful people I've ever met.  We, the Dept of Kentucky VFW, sponsored the Fishing Derby this year for the children.  We fished, had a cookout and provided prizes.  Some of the patients from two of the local VA hospitals were brought in to share in the day's event.  The Home provides shelter, clothing, food and training for military families accross the country who have fallen on hard times, either through the deployment or loss of their military spouse, or, when both parents have been deployed or lost and there are no other family to help. The children go to school and are taken care of until they are 18.  Then, the Home pays for their college.  Our military has given and continues to give and pay the ultimate price for our country.  This VFW National Home for Children is just one of the ways we can give back. 
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	116440	1	/users/profile/34639	amber5	Donor	4	06/25/2012	I've been a Life Member of the Home for almost 10 years. While I haven't had the opportunity to visit the Campus, I hope to be able to go this year.  I receive the newsletters and updates from the Home staff about activities at the home. I have contributed to various Department (VFW and Cootie) sponsored events for the Home's Christmas parties. The Department of Florida sponsors one half of a Duplex and it is a great feeling to know that we are directly helping the family of a military member.  Without a doubt the VFW's National Home for Children will continue to be one of the few non-profits I support forever.  Helping our veterans and their families is the most important thing we can do.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33818	1	/users/profile/34639	amber5	Donor	5	03/24/2010	I love the idea that there is an organization out there to help the families of our military.  As a member of the military it means a lot to me to know that my husband and children would have a place to go should the need arise.  While I haven't been fortunate enough to visit the home yet, I am very impressed with the stories I hear from others.  Donating regularly to the National Home is but one way we have to show our support and love for these families.  Bless the workers and residents at our National Home for Children.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	116439	1	/users/profile/158510	Anna18	Donor	5	06/25/2012	I have had the privilege of visiting the VFW National Home for Children.  I have been serving this great facility now for several years for the Veterans and Family Support Program in the VFW Ladies Auxiliary.  To know that there are folks that love those that have served our great nation and give from their hearts to help those in need for whatever the reason is a wonderful gift not only to our military but the children who give so much to our country.  This is a beautiful family neighborhood.  The families are cared for with great love, honor and respect that they so richly deserve.  Just knowing that I can make a little difference in someones life is a great feeling.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	114555	1	/users/profile/156091	Carol50	Donor	5	06/11/2012	I feel everyone reading this should know about the wonderful, professional and caring people that work at the National Home. I visited recently to invesigate the facilities and to learn about what they offer. To my surprise it was the staff, the social workers, the executives' determined attitudes and knowlede that won my heart. I donate very little compared to all they do. I wish I could do more, not for them but for those they serve.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	100289	2	/users/profile/121953	beckyjo_ridler	Client Served	5	11/04/2011	      I moved to the VFW National Home when I was 7 years old, from Ohio. My Grandfather was a WWII Veteran. My Sister, Brother and I came with our mother and were part of the single parent program for 3 years. Then one day my mother left us and we ended up in the residential program (the best thing that ever happened to me). Even though my mother couldn't get it together, the National Home didn't give up on the 3 of us.        I cannot say enough good things about the VFW National Home for Children. They gave me opportunities that I would have never been given. The staff there taught me how to be a good person, the importance of being a hard worker and doing my best no matter what. They taught me what it meant to be a family. They gave me a second chance. Not to say that everything was always peachy, but if it wasn't, it was usually due to my bad decisions at the time.      I graduated high school 10 years ago and left The National Home 9 years ago. I have been married to an amazing man for the last 7 years and last year gave birth to the light of our lives, a perfect baby boy. I know that without the guidance of the people in this organization, I would not be the person that I am today and am so thankful for all that they did for me!

My father was a WWII and Korean vet and served as a civilian during Vietnam. As lifetime members of the VFW with many options, the Children's Home was their top choice for the good it does the families of veterans.  I choose to continue to offer support just as they continue to provide a much needed service for our brave military families.  Job well done, keep up the good work.

I served as National Home Chairman for my auxiliary for several years.As a member of the Women's Auxiliary to the Military Order of the Cootie, I have enjoyed many Cootie Christmas Parties with "Our Kids" and spent time visiting with many of the families.It is important to know that the National Home does not receive any money from the federal government or the State of Michigan.For many years, the Home was funded solely by donations from VFW Posts, Ladies Auxiliary units, Military Order of the Cootie Pup Tents and Women's Auxiliary to Military Order of the Cootie groups.In the past several years, we have been fortunate to receive donations from individuals, corporations and other groups.The children and families that live at our Home, with the exception of the children of deployed troops, are the children and grandchildren of members of the VFW and Ladies Auxiliary -- as is stated in the eligibility requirements.Many families are on a three year program to learn:  financial responsibility, parenting skills and home management skills.Our Veteran Families have a safety net while undergoing physical therapy and job training.I am honored to be able to help with the goals of "Honoring The Dead, By Helping The Living."

Blake, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2006, we sought a charity to donate to that assisted military families, especially children.  We contacted and visited the campus several times before we decided to provide a matching grant to help establish a permanent endowment fund called the Amy Ross Fund.  We were impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the quality of the programs on campus.  We reviewed the financial reports and forms 990 before making our final decision, and are very glad for the decision we made.  This is an organization that is meeting a multitude of needs, not only for veterans' families but for active military families, as well.

Part of that Chairmanship includes the VFW National Home.  Through this Chairmanship I have learned of the wonderful opportunity for our Veterans their families and those children who may not have any one else to care for them. Through my life membership with the National Home and my Chairmanship I have become very aquainted with the programs offered at the National Home through correspondence, webinars and simple investigation.  They offer an opportunity to feel safe and heal, they encourage community and more importantly they inspire us the public to be more compassionate about how we treat each other.  These are life changing opportunities for all of us.  I will continue to support this worthwhile organization and challenge those who think differently to go visit.  You will be welcomed with open arms I am sure.

My father who was a WWII and Korean War Veteran died dued to injuries from a car accident. He was my last surviving parent.  I was taken in by the home.  I was better cared for then most parents are able to care for their own children these days.  Every single person who worked there that I came across cared for us and not just because it was their job.  They were invested in us.   My house parents were priceless.   I know my dear father rested in peace to know that by serving his country and being a member of the VFW with fellow military members that his family was NOT forgotten when a tragedy occured and his family needed help.

ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER VISITED THE NATIONAL HOME, THE CHILDREN AT THE NATIONAL HOME SEEM LIKE MY EXTENDED 'FAMILY OF GRANDCHILDREN'. WHEN OUR LADIES AUXILIARY GROUP, ALONG WITH OUR JUNIOR GIRLS GROUP, GOT TOGETHER IN DECEMBER TO MAKE SCARVES FOR ALL THE CHILDREN AT THE NATIONAL HOME FOR CHRISTMAS, IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE WERE MAKING THEM FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN! ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE SMILES ON ALL THE CHILDRENS FACES WHEN THEY SAW THEM.     I REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NATIONAL HOME FOR CHILDREN, AS I CAN PICTURE MY OWN DAUGHTER & GRANDDAUGHTER IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MANY OF THESE CHILDREN ARE RIGHT NOW. DADDY IS DEPLOYED, MOM & DAUGHTER ARE FAR AWAY FROM FAMILY. FORTUNATELY, ALL IS WELL WITH THEM.  BUT, IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT SITUATION.. & IT DOES MY HEART GOOD TO KNOW THERE IS A VFW NATIONAL HOME FOR CHILDREN THEY COULD HAVE TURNED TO HAD THE NEED BEEN THERE.   DOING ALL WE CAN DO TO HELP SUPPORT THE NATIONAL HOME, AS WELL AS SPREADING THE WORD THAT IT EXISTS, IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT OF OUR LADIES AUXILIARY, AS WELL AS OUR POST. EVEN OUR NEW JUNIOR GIRLS AUXILIARY HAS JUMPED RIGHT IN & PUT THE NATIONAL HOME FOR CHILDREN AS ONE OF IT'S FIRST PROJECTS BY MAKING ACTIVITY BOOKS FOR THE CHILDREN.   IN CLOSING, I WANT TO SAY, THE VFW NATIONAL CHILDRENS HOME, IS THE MOST AMAZING PROJECT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN. IT FILLS A MUCH NEEDED GAP IN THE LIVES OF OUR MILITARY, & I AM PROUD TO BE A PART OF THAT.

I was the Virginia VFW National Home for Children Chairman for 6 years and made 4 trips to the home located on a section of land outside Eaton Rapids, Michigan. The children of our National Home need us to support them financially and physically as some of them do not have biologic mothers and fathers still living so we are their mothers and fathers.The staff of our national Home for Children do a fantastic job of taking of the children through their expertise and loving care.WJ Leonard post 7327 Virginia

Our Children and Families are special to us. We collect UPC Codes from Campbell Soup Labels as well as Prego Labels to help towards their education. We donated  monetary gift for their 85th Birthday to help purchase a Mini Bus along with a Birthday Card. We donated to the Children's Christmas funds so they would have something to enjoy at Christmas time. Hawaii and Alaska also sponsors a home there and make sure that the maintenance cost is solid, by contributing to the finance of these homes. When I first saw these children and families at my very first National Convention in Salt Lake City, Utah few years ago, I knew then, that all our efforts all worthwhile!! I am now our Department President for our Ladies Auxiliary and I continue to encourage our Ladies to contribute to this worthy cause and they have been doing a great job even in this most difficult times..I am so Proud of them and "We Believe" in what we are doing and continue to do.

Although I have never visited the National Home in person, I feel like I know what it is, and what is does by visiting the very informative web site they have.  Even though a small Auxiliary, we are proud to contribute to the National Home financially, as well as collecting and mailing UPC codes from Campbell Products to the National Home. (Those UPC codes are redeemed by Campbells  under their labels for education program.)  We let the children know we care about each of them by sending a birthday card to the children celebrating birthdays that month.  What continues to inspire me is the fact that the VFW National Home receive NO federal funding, but is supported solely by contributions from private individuals and organizations.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33940	1	/users/profile/34753	aunt-kitty	Client Served	5	03/25/2010	I grew up 'knowing' the VFW National Home but I was over 50 when I became 'aware' of just how much help they were to the children...when I chose to entrust my niece & nephew to the Home's care. I had guardianship for two years prior and realized that just my love was not enough. To help them grow, I needed to find a place that would safeguard them, where family could still be a part of their lives, where they could develop their potential, where they didn't feel they had to chose sides and could live without extra pressure; yet still be supported, nutured & loved. The VFW National Home has & continues to be all those things rolled into one. I loved them enough & trusted the Home enough to let them go...and we became even more connected as a family as when they were with me.

This children's home was an excellent resource for our family.  Our mother had deserted and our father was a disabled veteran.  The campus is beautiful and the houses are spacious and I made many, many childhood friends.  Some I still correspond with today.  It was an excellent start for us in troubled times and we are lucky to have had this good start to launch us into adulthood.  We are all fine citizens with jobs, some college under our belts and fine examples of what the right upbringing can do for a child.  Plus, our strong belief in America, the flag and veterans overall remains in our lives today.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33888	1	/users/profile/34702	stevie125	Donor	5	03/25/2010	The National Home for Children is thrilling to visit, but limited in its capacity at the Michigan campus. I am much more impressed by its attempts to move out of the "local community" with its outreach to military families in other states and a program to assist those families where they live. There will always be orphans, but thankfully they are fewer now. I believe the Home's new direction lies in its efforts to fix the broken families all across the nation.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33878	1	/users/profile/34691	jane5	Former Volunteer	5	03/24/2010	The first time I visited the VFW National Home was through the VFW Voice of Democracy Scholarship competition. Upon stepping foot on the National Home campus and hearing about the service this great organization provides to the family members of our country's heroes, I was instantly compelled to help share what was then known as the VFW's best-kept secret. As a leader in the Michigan District of Key Club, I helped partner the National Home with thousands of high school volunteers. Though we came from all over the state, we visited the National Home to help with beautification projects and provide general donations. It's always wonderful hearing from the National Home and keeping up with their buddy poppy children and their graduation rates. I truly believe that the National Home provides a sustainable and effective model for assisting military families and would love to see an expansion of the campus!

"I asked what can we do to help you",the answer was; "we are taken care of but our families need the help and support of everyone here at home because they are also making sacrifices and we feel much better and can focus on what we are there to do, if we know that they are taken care of".

I have not had the opportunity to make the trip to Eaton Rapids to visist the Campus, but I get regular updates of the activities and successes and find it to be one of the best non-profits I could possibly support. At our VFW Post in Korea, I make it an annual event to collect money to support the Home's Christmas parties. Everyone they help is missing a mother or father due to their service to this country and I find that anything I can do to help the staff and faculty to put together a celebration at a time when the children and widows/widowers should be missing their lost parent/spouse the most, is well worth replaving tears shed with the smiles and gigles heard that time of year around the campus.

The services provided by this organization are critical to the well-being of our nation's military families and are entirely supported by donations; it receives no public funds.  I have overseen the contributions from my local VFW and MOC over the past year and the VFW National Home always goes out of its way to let donors know they are appreciated.  Most people outside the military do not realize how much other family members sacrifice while the service member in the family serves his or her country.  With a donation to this noble cause, we show our support for the children, grandchildren, and other family members of brave service members that have made personal sacrifices so we can enjoy the fruits of liberty.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33771	1	/users/profile/34591	kf	Donor	5	03/23/2010	I became aware of the National Home for Children after I won the National VFW Voice of Democracy Speech Competition. What an incredible place. What better way to contribute to the future of America than supporting the children and orphans of veterans. I met lots of the kids who live at the home at the National VFW Convention in Reno, Nevada. They are remarkable, and the home is remarkable. It is like a community of homes, and the children go to the local public schools, participate in little league, and eventually are supported through college. I put banks in all my local stores to raise money for the home.Now I am a junior at Princeton thanks to my VFW Voice of Democracy scholarship. As soon as I graduate and start working, I will definitely contribute to the National Home. Please give now; and go visit: it's awesome.

Its truly a blessing to be the Chairman and vision the happiness in the parent's, children and staff. The staff are very well organized and helpful, especially to the needed young family and children.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33755	1	/users/profile/34575	big-bob1	General Member of the Public	5	03/23/2010	What a great experience I had during my short seven year stay at the VFW National Home. My two brothers were also there, though not in the same cottage but just across  the street. At a very young age I or should I say we all learned teamwork. From making our beds to preparing food, to working on the grounds or in the garden or barns we all were being taught principles of life. Myself I was lucky to represent the home at the 1951 convention in New York City along with three other kids. I remember all of the things that were made available to us kids from the swimming pool to the baseball and football fields. Even the hills where we used our sleds and ski's and kites that we received from the great Christmas Party that the Cooties provided. No kid missed a holiday or the chance for a education thanks to the generous members of the VFW throughout the United States. Today when I mention to people that I was in the VFW Home people look at me and say they pity me for having to live in a orphanage. When I explain and I have even taken some people to the home and showed them how we raised they couldn't get over how beautiful the grounds are. I take my hat off to every member for allowing me the chance to live a great life.

The National Home is a good neighbor in Eaton County, it assures that the children have the support they need to survive in local schools, and prepares them for post-high school education. I am only a small-change donor, but I believe the National Home plays an important role for members of the Armed Services, for veterans and their families.

Shortly thereafter we came to a decision as to whichorganization we would contribute to, and this is THE ONE. We do an annual benefit to raise money to donate to The Home every year, and we normally present the check in October at their annual meeting in Eaton Rapids. A lot of our members also donate clothing and other items to The Home throughout the year. Whenever we stop by to visit The Home, either individually or as a group, we always get the red-carpet treatment. It is a great feeling to know that our organization can make a difference to this organization and the kids. We are very thankful that The VFW National Home for Children exists and is not far from us.
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children	33734	1	/users/profile/34558	jas	Volunteer	5	03/23/2010	This is an outstanding charity doing good for our Armed Forces families. Some of the children are orphans while others need a home while a parent is deployed. This Children's home understands that kids are not grown at 18 and has services to successfully transition teens to college or to an independent adult life without throwing them on the street like foster care. Children have opportunities not just a bed and meals. Please take the time to learn about the VFW Home for Children, thank you.
Camp Casey	314171	1	/users/profile/405533	Andrea160	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I have been volunteering with Camp Casey for many years.  As someone with ZERO horseback riding experience, I love that I can be involved in the healing power of horses without actually being involved on the horse side!  The child we serve, and their friends and family have the best day.  It is such an amazing organization to support.

Everyone was so pleasant, kind, fun, energetic and polite. I am elated that we could be a part of this charity.When you go through all the pains of childhood cancer and see what your child has to endure it brings a deep sadness. Camp Casey shines a ray of hope.  Once your child sees that horse and gets so excited it helps remind you that the fight is all worth it............And I want to thank Camp Casey for that gift!
Camp Casey	297076	1	/users/profile/387853	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	07/18/2016	I cannot say enough good things about the horsey house call! I think my favorite moment was the expression of complete joy on my daughter's face when she realized she was going to get to ride a horse---at our house yet!!! She had so much fun---I told someone else that for that afternoon, I honestly think she was able to forget she has cancer, if only for a little while. What an incredible blessing. Without exception, all the volunteers were so kind and friendly. It is clear to see what a labor of love it is for all of them and we were the lucky recipients. What an amazing, amazing experience and gift!

What a blessing to surprise a child dealing with cancer with such a special visit.  To watch their faces when the horse is led up to their door is priceless. It is just a wonderful  time for the entire family to enjoy a horse ride, lessons on tacking up the horse and even making a snack to be given to the horse at the end of the visit. It is a time to dwell on smiles, fun and not illness.

Camp Casey	269000	2	/users/profile/357729	Jessica251	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I volunteered for a camp back when completing my internship during the final year of a health care doctorate program. I was originally inspired by the ability of an organization to combine two of my passions - horses and health care. My experience with the camp was one of my favorite experiences so far. While I was only able to participate in one of the camps, it gave me the opportunity to take a step back and be reminded that there are so many different types of experiences and therapies that can produce positive outcomes for patients and their families.  In following Camp Casey over the years it continues to amaze me how much they have grown and how many lives they are affecting. Molly and the rest of the leadership and volunteers are truly an amazing group and one I wish that I could actively participate in if I lived closer. I am excited to see what is next!

Camp Casey	268810	3	/users/profile/357546	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2015	Camp Casey provides a profoundly beautiful experience to ill children fighting cancer, and their siblings!  Camp Casey can be seen more clearly at www.camp-casey.org and please visit their website.  Several day camps throughout the summer months at numerous volunteer stables allow the kids to be physically and mentally empowered in an world, that for them, is always and forever over-powering.  Personal and spiritual growth often results from the activities and demonstrations (not only for the children, but for parents as well).  Loving, trained staff give the campers their utmost.  Some children start the day with their heads low, shuffling, clinging to parents.  At the end of the day, nearly all are painted, proud, and skipping home after an exciting day of horsemanship!  Medical staff are present.  In addition to day camps, the Horsey House Call is an absolutely wonderful tool to bring happiness, empowerment, confidence, and FUN to kids in strict urban settings!  Check it out...a great big horse comes to your front door to spend a few hours with you!!  Very special.  The administration and staff of this organization are dedicated and have a huge heart for the kids and their families.  Just check out the website and go to a day camp, or witness a real Horsey Housecall.  You'll never be the same person.  This is guaranteed.  Volunteer and see what Camp Casey is all about!  I'm a bit bias, because I'm Casey's father.  We are proud of what God's love, one woman, one girl, and the love of horses has wrought.  Minimal overhead, maximum output, and maximum benefits to truly deserving children.  Just two of our mottos (my best shot) are:  "The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a person" and "Helping kids fight cancer one neigh at a time"  Not just sayin'...this is valuable.

Who DOESN"T want to open up their front door to a horse, all saddled up and ready to go for a ride?  And what I love most about Camp Casey is that it's not just working for the  child with cancer, but their siblings who often feel left out and the parents who need a break from doctors appointments, the medications and the red tape.

Camp Casey	268607	1	/users/profile/357340	Ruth60	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	When Molly asked me to help her on a Horsey Housecall, I had no idea what to expect. What I witnessed was not only a sick child getting some time off from the daily routine of cancer; I participated with a group of people dedicated to the idea that teaching a child to care for and control a horse allows that child a chance to control a part of his or her life during a time when that life feels very out of control. It is a day away from needles, medications and worry. It allows the child's family a chance to relax with each other. Hoisting the child up onto that horse are volunteers educated about the possible needs of the child as well as maintenance and care of the horses. Camp Casey also provides outings like trips to local baseball or basketball games, and visits to theaters or even beauty pageants. In the summer Camp Casey offers a weekend away at a dude ranch, for an entire family, to provide even more Horsey experience.  I don't know of any other nonprofit that comes close to the love, dedication and heart that those involved in the running of this charity provide. They are a first class operation. Yee haw!

As a mom of a childhood cancer survivor I know all to well how every aspect of cancer consumes your child and the whole family. But when Camp Casey brings their horses to the homes if children with life threatening illnesses is it not only a joy but also a complete peacefulness that for that couple of hours the child and their families can forget about the rest of the world and focus on making everlasting memories. Camp Casey is as intregal part of any treatment plan as the medicine!!! Keep up the great work!!!

Camp Casey	268478	1	/users/profile/357210	Michael356	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	I volunteered recently for one of the Trail Ride Cookouts and had a spectacular time. In getting a chance to chat with some of the other volunteers before the families arrived, it put me in such a great mood. Camp Casey does well in terms of vetting the people they allow to volunteer and I think that's important. Once the kids and their families showed up, it was so great to meet each of them and have some time to interact. Such smiling faces as they got to eat some great food and take a ride on a horse. Heck, I would be happy doing it! All in all, I can't wait to volunteer again and plan on it. They really do make a difference in providing an environment where the kids  and their deserving families  can all take a moment away from what's ailing them to laugh, smile, and enjoy the comfort in knowing that there are people who care about them immensely. Thanks to Camp Casey for making it possible for me to have this experience. I hope I have given back what was given to me.

I learned more working with Camp Casey than I could in any class room. I will forever cherish the time I spent in and out of the office working with the exceptional women who keep this unique program running. Molly, Katie and Jessica would give anything they could to help a sick child and their family. They have set up a program that will leave a mark on this world and truly change a child's outlook on life when going through such a tough time.  I have never met more hard working people in my life. Supporting Camp Casey will not only impact children with cancer, sickle cell and aplastic anemia but it will also have an impact on yourself. The memories made while being a Camp Casey volunteer/supporter will last you a lifetime and will have you keep coming back for more. I highly recommend anyone who is interested to  reach out to Camp Casey and get involved in anyway that you can. At the end of the day you can't beat putting a smile on a face of a child who has been through more than they should at that age. Camp Casey has changed my outlook on life and I hope it does the same for you!

I have also been able to talk to parents of these kids who are so excited to hear the laughter and see the smiles coming from their children.

My daughter Ashlee had cancer and the first time we went out to a ranch to camp casey and she got to meet Moe and brush and ride him. We were invited back a few more time and Ashlee loved riding Moe. Ashlee was then told the cancer was gone, but it came back. During the 2nd round of cancer Moe and Camp Casey came out to our house and Ashlee was so surprised and loved the visit so much. We lost Ashlee on 11/15/09 but Camp Casey gave her something that we couldn't and we love them. Great job Camp Casey!!

I can't be anymore proud to confidently say that I know whiteout a doubt that 98.9% of every  dollar raised goes directly to help support our Michigan families that are having their worlds turned upside down by childhood cancer. It is our goal to insure that no one fights this battle alone. 
Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	306559	1	/users/profile/397824	asjoblom	Client Served	5	09/26/2016	Hi id like to take a moment to introduce myself, my name is Andrea Sjoblom I'm a 35yr old mother of four! I was recently diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer stage two with lymph node involvement in April 4th.I'm not going to lie I was super shocked still am! I wanted to take a moment and let you know a little bit about me and my family. My husband Joe and I live in Oxford we're raising our four children Jade 13, Paige 12, LaMia 7 and Jaxson 4. I'm super worried about how my children are going to handle all of this. I know for a fact they're all very strong loving children but they have gone through so much in the last two years. In November 2013 my younger sister unexpectedly passed away leaving behind two children at the time the children were one and five. My husband and I have taken them in as our own. We are a very close family so this was difficult not only on my sisters children but on my biological children as well. Since the loss of my sister they've lost two grandmothers. These past two years have been filled with a lot of sadness for my kids. With the recent diagnosis of breast cancer my children have become very concerned with what the future holds. I have assured them that I have great doctors and that the good Lord knows what he's doing! I know that brings them some comfort but with that being said they are children who have been through a lot already in they're short lives. My husband has been working full-time as a high-rise window cleaner for the past 20 years he recently had a job change to something a bit more flexible in hopes that it would help with his back problems. He was supposed to undergo back surgery this summer however with my recent diagnosis he has decided to put that off for now so he can continue to try to support us the best he can. I've been working full-time as a dental assistant until just shortly after my  diagnosis  when I was fired their reasoning my cancer was going to be a problem for them. As you can imagine that's been quite a pay reduction and a major stressor for my family. It can be very difficult for me to reach out and ask for help. I'm generally the one offering to help others,however right now I'm just concerned for what the future holds for my children. My husband and I are doing our best to make sure not to many things in their day-to-day change. We're hoping they adjust well to our new normal. Just this past Wednesday September 21  I went in for a double mastectomy. I am now home and have started the next chapter in our crazy life. I just wanted to say that with out the help of this  amazing organization  Angels of hope I would not have been able to make a few of my mortgage payments. This organization has helped me and my family in more ways then I can express. We are eternally great full for the help we have  received thus far. Andrea Sjoblom

In Jan 2015 I was diagnosed with colon cancer. I was lost. I called United Way I have donated to them thru work on my first job in 1981, I called UNICEF I donated to them in 1982 I called churches they said call 211...I called American Cancer Foundation.... NO HELP FROM ANYONE. Then I asked my oncologist how will I survive I need help. He mentioned Angels of Hope. Angels of hope helped my daughter and I keep our home. Throughout the year they had events for cancer patients. We are more than grateful for being able to attend some of them ....this really helped keep our sanity...along with meeting some wonderful people. A day without Cancer. After having a colon resection my stomach remained swollen for a year. I kept going to the doctor....oh it will go down. It never did. As time passed I called numerous doctors to help no one took my insurance so on May 16 2016 I called 911. During that week visit they told me I had Liver cancer.  Having this second cancer hit my daughter and I harder than the first I immediately called Angels of Hope. Not only did they only help us the first year but the second year of cancer as well. They...ANGELS OF HOPE have paid our mortgage so we can keep our home, and Paid my dental bill so I could start chemo. As I could not start chemo without the dental work. We are rather grateful and have met some amazing people, friends and mentors thru Angels of Hope Michigan Cancer Foundation. You are our Angels. And we could have not survived without you! We are forever Grateful! Thank you.

It was overwhelming especially when I was told I had to give my family member's car back.  Well The Angels of Hope stepped right in and provided my new transportation.

This left me unable to work and our savings was spent and we learned of Angels of Hope. During a time of sadness and overwhelming prognosis we were afraid we were not going to be able to give our daughters the Christmas they deserve. We were accepted for a grant and a weight was lifted.

In 2011, Angels of Hope helped us with our finances for one month while we were dealing with having no health insurance and raising 4 children.  In 2015, His cancer re-surfaced and a very risky surgery had to be done in California.

We spent most of 2015 in a whirlwind of hospital stays and clinic visits and a perpetual cloud of worry, fear and stress as she underwent a difficult regiment of chemotherapy. Having a child in cancer treatment affects the entire family in so many ways and near the end of her treatments we were all struggling in various ways - emotionally as well as financially. Receiving a grant from Angels of Hope to help with our mortgage and utility costs gave us time to rest and recover and to begin putting our family back together as we looked toward her end of treatment as well as the holidays and beginning of a new year for 2016. I can't even begin to explain what this has meant to us and how wonderful this organization has been to work with. They truly are 'Angels' of Hope for families affected by cancer.

They heard our needs and came through in more ways than we ever thought they could. God bless each and every person involved in this GREAT Foundation! We look forward to a full recovery for our daughter and a chance to help other families going through similar situations. The Angels Of Hope are just that "Angels that give hope!!" We could never thank them enough... Gid bless them ALL!!

Over the last three years, I have learned that cancer is a word not a sentence.  Through faith and organizations such as Angels of Hope, life has been easier  caring for my son.  Please do not get me wrong, we have had some good days as well as some learning days.  But, during those learning days our faith grew a little stronger.  William is now 14 and is a freshmen in high school.  It has been a long 3 years but God has brought us all the way.  We are set for a June 2016 finish date.Thanks again to Angels of Hope for relieving some of the other stress that arise during the difficult time of beating cancer.

That was the beginning of our very long journey which is still far from over. Braylan has never since day one met the standard with treatment. We tried to keep on track with the high risk protocol until August when we found out he would need a bone marrow transplant. We did a chemo that is literally never approved by insurance that ultimately put Braylan into remission just in time. His transplant took place on November 4, 2015. We had to move our family of 4 to Grand Rapids over 3 hours away from home and everyone we love. People help us as much as they can in different ways but we have both had to take off so much work for the last 7+ months that financially Angels of Hope helped us with a grant and our bills... It took off so much stress since we didn't know what we were going to do and it weighed very heavy on both of us. This foundation is truly amazing and when I think of other gift I often cry happy tears.

We had no idea the fight we were in for. Our time was spent in the hospital, fighting cancer, taking care of our other kids and trying to keep up with work.

This fabulous group of people were so quick to act and offer us a help line that we so greatly needed. Because of them we were able to continue on, keep our home, and concentrate on Aiden's recovery.

Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	270785		/users/profile/286542	Michelle264	Client Served	5	11/02/2015	Brooklyn was born December 13th 2011. She was a normal, active, happy baby and toddler. She loved going for walks to the park with mommy and daddy. On June 1st 2013 Brooklyn was diagnosed with Stage 3 Neuroblastoma at 17 months of age. Her symptoms came on quite suddenly first starting with vomiting, eye darting, startled easily, uncontrollable muscle movements, and not being able to walk normal.Brooklyns journey began on May 22nd with her new pediatrician Dr. Linda Bolton. Blood and urine test was done that day. Both came back normal. Our next visit was to the Neurologist. Dr. Rashmi Gupta. An MRI and EEG were ordered. Results showed her brain was perfectly normal. Her next appointment was with the Ophthalmologist Dr. Rou. We found out she is very Far sighted and will need glasses for the next 10-12yrs. The doctor said that the eye darting, vomiting and muscle movements had nothing to do with her eye sight. Later that day. I received a phone call from Brooklyns Neurologist. She asked me to come in. She ordered a chest X-ray and a CT-scan of her abdomen. She also wrote down the word Neuroblastoma and told me to research it. The chest X-ray was done on May 31st. Her CT-scan was done on June 1st. After a Long day we finally get home. Brooklyn is in her bouncer and daddy is asleep on the couch. I get a phone call from Dr. Linda Bolton telling me to meet her at her office in 30 min. I asked her to tell me anything about the results. She said I think its best that all 3 of you come in so we can talk and pack a small bag for Brooklyn because she will be going to the hospital My Husband and I began to cry. We drove to her office not knowing what was going, but knew it was going to be bad news. We were told our daughter has a tumor in her abdomen near her spine.Brooklyn was admitted to Beaumont Childrens Hospital in Royal Oak right away. Many tests were ordered along with a Biopsy on her tumor. Brooklyn had a Meta-port implanted in her chest during her biopsy. Her biopsy came back positive stage 3 neuroblastoma. Her MYCN came back non-amplified and favorable histology. Bone marrow test came back negative and so did her MIBG scan. Chemotherapy began on June 7th. Today is June 20th 2013 and Brooklyn's hair is begining to fall out. We are praying that her tumor is shrinking. Brooklyn's 2nd cycle of chemotherapy begins June 28th. Today is July 16th Brooklyn is completely bald now, but beautiful as ever :) She goes for CT scan in the morning. They will be looking at her Chest, Abdomen, and pelvis. We get the results on thursday july 18th. We are praying her tumor is shrinking. Results are in but still not ready for surgery. She will begin her 3rd cycle of chemotherapy on Friday july 19th. This is a 3 day stay. She did great this round :) cycle #4 chemo will be August 14th. This visit is a 24hr stay. She did ok with this one too. On Monday Aug. 19th Brooklyn was admitted due to not eating or drinking well and also reacurring symptoms. She is having full body tremors and is not eating, or talking very well. She is not able to sit, stand, crawl, or even walk on her own. Another diagnosis for her was confirmed. Opsoclonus Myoclonus Syndrome. (OMS) Brooklyn is now fighting two battles. We took her to see Dr. Pranzatelli in Illinois. He is the ONLY one specializing on (OMS). He video taped her at the visit and did a Lumbar Puncture to collect spinal fluid. He is also a scientist. We now have a protocol for our doctors to follow so they can treat her. Brooklyn is currently getting nightly ACTH injections and IVIg treatments for her OMS. Brooklyn cannot walk so she is also getting physical therapy to help her with that. Her oncologist scheduled her for an MRI on August 28th to check the status of her Tumor. We recieved a phone call the very next day from her oncologist stating that her Tumor is growing and that we need to continue Chemotherapy treatments. September 1st Brooklyn began her 5th cycle of Chemotherapy which was a 3 day stay. September 24th 2013 Brooklyn began her 6th cycle of chemo. This time around her Chemo was scheduled for 4 days. She will also be getting IVIg treatment & ACTH injections. 2 new chemo agents were introduced. One of them called Cisplatin caused her kidneys to leak. Her Phosphate levels began to drop. Our 4 day stay turned into 9 days and Brooklyn was tranported to the PICU. She was treated with potassium and magnesium and we were sent home with some too. On October 3rd We took Brooklyn to the University of Michigan to see the Neuroblastoma specialist for a second opinion. He and the team of doctors recommended that Brooklyn have another MRI & MIBG scan done soon. Brooklyn's MRI was done on October 10th and the results showed no change. Her MIBG scan will be done on October 22nd & 23rd. The team of doctors & specialists will have a meeting after her scan and go over her results and come up with a plan together. After the meeting with the doctors & going over their findings they have discovered that Brooklyn has some lesions on her spine. They also said that now is the best time to go in and remove as much of the tumor as possible. Brooklyn has gone through 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Her surgery is scheduled for November 7th @8am. The Surgeons went over everything with us including her scans. We were able to see pictures of what this Beast looks like. They also Showed us the lesions on her Spine. We were not even aware that they were present. Our previous Oncologist never mentioned them to us. The treatment she was getting was the correct protocol. Brooklyn's Stage is changed from a 3 to stage 4 Neuroblastoma Please Keep our Brooklyn in your thoughts and prayers! Her tumor resection went really well :) They removed 90% of Brooklyn's tumor in her abdomen! She had a very hard recovery which took 10 days. 8 days in the PICU & 2 on the PEDS floor.On December 2nd, 3rd, & 4th She began her 7th cycle of chemotherapy. She took the treatment very well. Her incision is healing very well and she is back to playing again.December 30th Brooklyn completed Cycle #8 of chemotherapy. Her oncologist said No more Chemo!!! These last two cycles should've killed whatever was left inside my baby Lets PRAY it did because I don't want to put her through anymore chemotherapy or any other treatment. I just want her cancer free. January 22nd & 23rd Brooklyn will have scans done again to see if there is anymore cancer left inside her. She will have an MRI, CT, MIBG, & ECHO done all in the same day.Brooklyn's CT scan was negative! Her MRI & MIBG scan was not. They did a urine test to check her VMA & HVA levels. they were still elevated. The doctors think its most likely scar tissue from her surgery back in November. Tests and scans will be repeated on April 23rd & 24th.  Today Brooklyn is in Remission. We thank God everyday for this Blessing and pray the Cancer stays away forever! Brooklyn is still Battling with her OMS and is still in treatment at Beaumont Rose Cancer center in royal oak. She also needs a medication called ACTH. This is injected into her thigh muscle every other day. This keeps her from having body tremors and eye darting. Her IVIg treatment makes her get sick after a couple of days. She is also on many other medications to help her live a somewhat normal happy life.Angel's of hope was there to help us when we needed it the most. We struggled financially during Brooklyn's fight and Angel's of hope assisted our family so that we can focus on getting our daughter better. Thank you Angel's of hope for your kindness and generosity.

My son was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011 and his regular chemo appointments are a four hour round trip for us.  I had a lot of anxiety over my eleven year old car getting us there and back but was unable ever to pull enough funds together to get us into something more reliable that we could afford.  Angels of Hope made that happen for us and I can't thank them enough!  This organization is absolutely amazing.  The stress of having a child fighting cancer is wearing enough without the added stress of financial concerns.  Thank you Angels of Hope for removing the financial stress!

My son Noah was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma and things were very tight financially.  Shortly after Noahs dignosis angels of hope got us a awesome van to help with transportation and this resent time our landlord had a offer for our house for much more than we could afford and since we were month to month he gave us 30 days to leave... we were petrified with 3 children and had no idea what we were going to do. Robin with Angels is also a realtor and she went above and beyond to help us find a place and Angels of hope (Steve York) approved us for a grant that covered our security deposit and first 2 months rent!!!!!!!!

It would take years of chemotherapy, spinal taps, steroids, and medicines to combat migraines and a whole host of other issues before Collin and his parents would celebrate his leukemia going into remission. Unfortunately it would all come at the hefty price of his normal childhood.   Collin is just as sick today as he was when he was first diagnosed.  He has developed severe side effects from the cancer treatments.  My husband and I have had difficulty staying on top of the never ending medical bills.  During these many years of struggles Angels of Hope has stood by our side.  Our guardian Angel if you will.  Without question they have continued to help us through our darkest hours.  We are forever indebted to this all volunteer organization.  They deserve a Medal of Honor!  Thank you to Steve York, Robin Sanderson and all of the board members of Angels of Hope from the bottom of our hearts.   - Kathleen and Greg Stempniewski, Macomb Michigan

As the sole provider for our family - particularly our 3 year old twins , we were panic stricken at the thought of how were we going to survive for the next  6-9 months. Between the house payment, food, utilities and then the costs of his treatments we didn't think we'd be able to manage.  But the Angels of Hope were introduced to us and helped us by taking some of the burden off and giving my husband the chance to focus on his treatment and recovery.  They even gave our family a night out at a Tiger's Game so we could be like a normal family again and not be consumed with hospitals, doctors and treatments.  I cannot speak highly enough of this organization, and I hope to be able to repay their kindness and generosity to our family.

I was only 14 at the time so I obviously couldn't drive or anything at that point. Bills started piling up and as time when on and I got older and closer to 16, it was pretty obvious my mom (single mother of 2) did not have the money to buy me a car. Right after I turned 16 I got a job and it was very hard for me to find rides there and back because of only one car in the household and with my mom always having doctors appointments it was challenging. About 6 or so months ago one of my moms friends told her about angels of hope And that she should check it out. Honestly they have changed my life forever and I am so thankful for them. Something I thought I'd never get, a beautiful 2007 Honda Civic! I couldn't believe it when my mom told me it was really happening and I was getting the car. Angels of hope has forever changed my life and I could not be more thankful. Thanks to them I not only have a ride to my first job, I picked up another summer job as well! And  I also have a nice new ride!!!:) Could not be more thankful, if it wasn't for them I would still be struggling to find rides to work and stressing out about saving money for a car. They truly are angels I tell you.

We quickly became very close to Connor and his grandparents who are currently raising him. On March 21st I attended the Angels of Hope gala and was introduced to Steve York. I shared Connor's story with Steve and he shared that he had already been in contact with the family, but they had not expressed a need for help.  A couple of weeks later Connor was back in the hospital with a massive tumor that needed to be removed and grandpa needed to take some time off work to help care for Connor. This was the moment that Angels of Hope stepped in and took care of  monthly bills. This organization was a Godsend to this family! Grandpa was able to concentrate on what was important rather than finances.  Thank you ANGELS of Hope! You truly are Angels sent from above to bless these families!

Angels of Hope has helped our family with rent and utilities 2 two years in a row. My daughter was diagnosed at age 13 with Metastatic Papillary Thyroid Cancer in January of 2014. I lost my job the same day we found out her diagnosis. She underwent 2 major surgeries here in Michigan and was referred out to MD Anderson in Houston, TX for her radioactive iodine treatment. Angels of Hope was instrumental in helping us pay our rent and utilities for 3 full months while we were in the middle of her treatment and having to travel out of state. Their process was extremely quick and efficient. They also provided Christmas for our family through their Christmas program. It was so great to not have to worry about acquiring any new debt just to try to give our daughter a decent Christmas. The family that adopted us took care of both of us parents as well as our daughter. They literally went so above and beyond. They bought every single item on each of our needs/wish list! In February 2015, Angels of Hope stepped in again to help us pay rent and utilities due to my daughter's testing schedule in December and January and us both having to miss so much work to attend each appointment.

True Angels that do give you hope when all hope seems lost. My daughter Olivia was diagnosed in May 2012 at the age of 18 of Hodgkins Lymphoma stage II just a few weeks shy from graduating High school, after grueling chemo treatments, she was in remission January 2012, I was able to go back to work. The evil demon known as "Cancer"found its way back into our lives once again, and after countless test, and biopsies, we were given the dreaded news on September 24th 2014 that Olivia now 20 relapsed and is stage IV, and would need a bone marrow transplant. I was knocked to my knees. I had to quit my job to care for her as she is now undergoing very aggressive chemotherapy, and admitted 6 days each treatment. Already struggling financially, as a divorced mother of four words cannot describe my despair. I received a call from Steve York (My personal Angel), and found out that a friend had called him on our behalf. We were accepted by Angels of Hope and they have taken care of my rent, and utilities, as if that wasn't enough, while in the hospital I received a call saying we are one of many families chosen for the Christmas program!!! I will forever be grateful for Angels of Hope, and Steve York, for rescuing my family, taking such a HUGE burden off of me, so that I can focus on Olivia and my other three children. I have many moments where I just break down, but many of the tears are tears of joy, because of such great acts of kindness that goes above and beyond! Thank you Angels of Hope, much much love from the Hawley family.

Our 8 year old son Noah was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma of the left scapula and the ball of his humerus on Aug 14th 2014. We also have a 3 year old son and a newborn daughter.  When we started this journey we were already having financial troubles and were trying to make it by with 1 car, with my husbands work schedule which is our only source of income and Noah's treatment schedule their was no way for us to make it work so my husband started calling in a lot until a friend let us borrow a truck for a few weeks. Well the few weeks was coming to a end and they were going to need their truck back which was making us very nervous because there was no way for us to come up with the money to buy a car right then. Well Angels of Hope (i.e. Steve York) reached out to me and said that my family was accepted and that they would like to get us a van! I never felt more relief and it took a ton of weight off of our backs during this already difficult time and very quickly Steve York with the help of Orchard Chrysler Jeep found us a beautiful Grand Caravan just in time and not only got us the van but paid for the title and registration for us as well. We could not be more grateful for the help and not only did they get us the van but they let us join the Christmas program where a family or organization helps us with Christmas gifts! We will never forget the generosity this wonderful organization has showed us and we will forever be grateful!  The Gochanour Family
Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	234498		/users/profile/299766	ladyalvia	Client Served	5	11/26/2014	It's 3:42 am....Wed morning, November 26, 2014. Once again I find it difficult to sleep, witch always makes  me think. Tonight seems to be somewhat quieter. My thoughts weren't racing as I stared at the ceiling ...AND so I'd like to share my testimony....referring to this as a review somehow just doesn't describe how I really feel about the Angelsl of Hope family.  Missing my Dear and Loving husband Michael, who just passed January 13, of this year, I sit in bed and unable to sleep, I reminisce of our  lives together and all the love we shared, missing his presence but knowing and taking comfort that he no longer suffers from indescribable pain allows me to rest peacefully some nights.Only God knows why he was called home so soon. The last few years have been very difficult for me and my family. My husband was diagnosed with Squamous cell carcinoma (cancer in the esophagus) in the spring of 2012...just writing that last sentence makes me teary eyed... As I reflect on my memories from first hearing this tragic and unbelievable information, I realize that God has always held my hand and guided me through some very difficult times in my life...Always knowing just when to send Angels to help me be strong when I am at my weakest moment. As my husband endured radiation, chemo therapy,malnutrition and ultimately a very complicated surgery , I can testify that watching our now, eight year old daughter watching  her daddy go through this had been one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. My daughter and her father were two peas in a pod. He was her best playmate, she now often talks about all the things she'd done with her daddy and how this Christmas she wishes Santa could bring her daddy back for Christmas surrendering her toy list completely. I know that Angels hold her hands too because she is a very brave child but a worry wart now. I remember my husband in remission and thinking how incredibly strong he was and having faith that he would be freed from this awful disease because of the remarkable progress that he'd made, gaining most of his weight back, becoming more & more active and ultimately returning to work full time.. that he'd kicked cancer's butt! I now know that it was GOD preparing him for his next journey......After having a routine tooth extraction in the first part of September 2013, & experiencing some swelling in the back of his throat that was very persistent & even after two different prescriptions of antibiotics the swelling increased making it almost impossible for him to swallow a biopsy was preformed and reviled that cancer once again had shown its ugly nature and spread causing a very large tumor on the back of his tongue as well as in his lungs and stomach, which was now pulled up to his neck from having his esophagus removed...stage 4... I can remember just clear as day right now that gut wrenching feeling that came over me when his doctor told us that he had 3-6 months to live from that very cold day early in December 2013. I excused myself from the room and must have had a very bad break down...because  I can only remember two maybe three nurses helping me from the bathroom floor as I just died on the inside. One of the nurses saying things to me like your not going be homeless and your going to be able to give your daughter a Christmas...all sorts of things that I couldn't really comprehend, "why would she be saying these things to me" Later I realized that I was on the bathroom floor praying that GOD would send me an Angel.... AND that's exactly what he did! Angels of Hope spread their wings and rescued my family from financial hardships that existed and that bound to spiral out of control. With the help of wonderful nurses from St.John Maross' Professional Building in Warren MI. And the Financial Resources Department at St. John Maross Hospital of Detroit, I was introduced to Mr. Steve York from Angels of Hope.  He was able to secure a grant for our family, which allowed Angels of Hope to make our housing & utility payments as well some very needed car repair. Christmas was just ABSOLUTELY beautiful as it had always been. Had it not been for the Angels of Hope network, family,friends and my daughter's school at the time (Steenland Elementary) who provided a new Christmas Tree with all the trimmings.....I probablyWOULDN'T have been able to put my mind at ease to realize that this could be the most precious time our family would have together. Steve York was very sensitive And attentive to the needs of my family. He was always courteous, kind and respectful of how difficult it can be for someone to ask for help. Steve was wonderful through the entire process. I am so grateful, as so many of us are to be sent an Angel in our time of need. For me this has been an on going battle. Losing my husband has been unbelievably difficult. He would've been 52 this past November 20. I miss him through my soul our baby daughter is in counciling to help with her grief. I've not yet found the courage to express my deepest feelings to anyone especially a complete stranger, perhaps one day I will. I haven't been able to work since my husband departed this earth. And as we approach Christmas again, I find myself worried for my baby girl. These are the the times that I pray the longest & ask God for strength and knowledge. AND just when I'm at my wits end my Angels appear again watching over us and removing burden from my weary heart.....The Angels of Hope has reached out to me this Christmas and again prepared to help me with making  sure that the first Christmas without Michael, my husband...and my daughter's Angel from above; will not be only joyous but a time to remember and reflect on God's Angeles upon us. I pray for the family's who have and are grieving a loved one....know that you are not alone and Angels always walk among us.... THANK YOU ANGELS Of HOPE FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

I quickly turned back to Angels of Hope and they were again able to assist us. My husband was unable to work during this most recent battle, but the Angels were there for us in our time of need. Unfortunately, my husband passed away in August (2014). My family and I are forever thankful to all the Angels for their support and encouragement during the past couple of years. Most of all, we look forward to the day that we are able to pay it forward and donate back to the foundation for them to continue to be Angels for others when they need it the most!

When the reality of our 17 year old son, Sean, was diagnosed with ALL Leukemia on May 18th, 2014, we were stunned, with no sense of direction, & our world turned upside down. My husband & I had secure full time jobs, but found out that didn't work out with a critical ailing child in the hospital. We were juggling to keep the balance of working, our other two children ages 15, & 19 yrs old. For the first time in our lives, we became the Family we always read about to help. We went quickly to two months behind on our mortgage, in our home of 14 years. Also, 2 months behind on car payments. Friends, Hockey Teamates, & Families started organizing Meal Train.com, & a couple fund raisers. A Beaumont Nurse reached out to us, by educating us on support in the community, such as, Angels of Hope. Steve was so personal, & when he said he was looking into different things to support our family. Home mortgage, utilities, considered it done. Always easy to contact, & punctual with results! It was amazing, & took the focus back to caring totally for our Strong Sean. It took that financial pressure, & insecurity my husband & I were experiencing. Our son is turning 18 next month. He's Goalie Captain of his HS Hockey Team. He misses hockey, & his physicians stated during his Maintainance Dose of Monthly Chemo in January, he's looking forward to stepping back on the ice again! Strong Sean always wanted his goalie helmet painted after playing ice hockey for 9 yrs. Steve from Angels of Hope gave us an amazing connection to have Our Strong Sean's Goalie Helmet painted by a NHL Designer of Goalie Helmets. Ray Bishop sent a creative video telling Sean, he will be talking to him about teaming up with his Goalie Design on his mask. These kinds of things keep our son in motion, & looking forward to things in his life. We NEVER thought we would be the family that ever needed a helping hand, because we always helped others, & that's just what us Korpal 5 do, but now the shoe is on the other foot. We are BEYOND grateful!!! With much love, & appreciation, The Korpal 5 (Jim, Kristine, Strong Sean, Ryan, & Lauren). When we come up from air from all this. Plan on us Korpal's paying it forward, thanks to the Angels of Hope

Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	232665		/users/profile/296219	Niki S.	Client Served	5	11/02/2014	My life came crashing down on November 2, 2011 when I was told that my 27 month old son, Max, had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  Max was initially in the hospital for 32 days and I continued to stay off of work for 6 months due to multiple hospital stays.  Even tho the hospital bills were being taken care of, the household bills continued to pile up.  Angels of Hope stepped in and helped me pay them and also took care of us for Christmas through their adopt a family program.  Not only did I not have the money to get gifts for Max, I didn't have the time.  He was hospitalized during Christmas 2011 and 2012.  Just knowing that such an organization was there to help out in ANY way they could, just made me feel less stressed during an unimaginable time.  I am happy to say that Max is now in remission and is doing well.  Thank you Angels of Hope for being our Angels in our darkest time!!
Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	232567		/users/profile/296110	jen76	Client Served	5	11/02/2014	On May 28, 2010 our 14 year old son Cameron was diagnosed with AML Leukemia, the next 9 months brought us to our knees so many times. It was the scariest time of our life's. Cameron's initial stay in the hospital was 36 days when he finally did come home, it was only for 5 hours because he spiked a fever. My husband lost his job after three weeks because we were both off those first three weeks of diagnosis and he promised Cameron he was not leaving him until he came home. It was a promise he kept. It all worked out because Cameron needed someone to be with him full time and I needed to keep working to keep our insurance. Our lease was due up on one of our cars so we turned it in and went to one car, there was some days I did not know how we would eat or take care of our family, Cameron has two younger siblings Cassidy and Cole. We heard of Angels of Hope through children's Hospital and we applied for a grant. We needed help paying our mortgage. The thought of losing our home at such an awful time was overwhelming. Angels of Hope put that thought at ease and helped us catch up and it was one less thing to worry about.  That Christmas we knew there was no way we could give the kids a Christmas, the thought of losing your child and that this could possibly be is last Christmas, well, there are no words. Angels of Hope came through  again and my kids had the best Christmas they ever had. It wasn't about the gifts but the extreme generosity of people we did not know. We gotten the chance to go to the Lions game and a breakfast with Santa through Angels of Home. There are no words to say Thank you enough and we will be forever be grateful.

Client Served	5	10/20/2014	My son was Diagnosed with Leukemia on Aug. 24th 2012.He was complaining of a head ache & chest pains, no 9 yr old should have chest pains.Within 12 hours we knew what was wrong. Within 24 hr I lost my job, because I could not full fill my hours due to my son being in the hospital. He was in there for over 2 weeks. At that time I had to supply food for myself while he was in the hospital and he would not allow me to leave at all. Then our van decided it had enough and quit working. Angels of Hope became our angels. They called us within a week of our application and informed us that they had a van for us. Words could never express how blessed we felt. We then got a phone call asking if we would like the a family photo. That is something we never had as a blended family and that was a great photo to have from the start of our treatment. They even called and "Santa" was asking what our kids would like. My home was filled with gifts on Christmas that I would never had been able to get.Now 2 yrs later our life hit a wall of bills that we could not get over. Angels of Hope came to the rescue again. They are helping us get caught up and able to breath again. We are not going to face shut offs, and phone calls asking for money we don't have.When all you want to do is make your son feel better, you don't care what bill is due. But the world does not stop for a family fighting cancer. Angels of Hope cares. They care about Michigan families and their fight. They care if a child has a toy, a outing, a way to the hospital. They make sure to check on the families, to let them know they are not alone no matter how alone they feel.Thank you Angels of Hope. Thank you for making us feel like we have someone in our corner.

I went to the ER because I thought I had been having migranes.  What a shock to learn that I had Leukemia.In March 2010.  I had a stem cell transplant to keep my leukemia in remission.  I had 2 years of being in remission and dealing with a roller coaster ride of medical problems.  In June 2012, I relapsed.  This time around was much harder on my body and I was so sick, visiting the ICU several times.  On December 12th, 2012, I had another SCT which put me in remission.  I am now dealing with many side effects from  treatment.When I was first diagnosed I was going through Nursing school to become an RN.  It's hard to say if I ever want to go back in that field again.It's been very hard making ends meet for my husband and I with our 3 children.  I thank God everyday for the help that Angels of Hope has given us and I try to keep paying it forward everyday.  I was referred to them from the Children's Leukemia Foundation for help paying our surety and they were more than accommodating and for that we are forever grateful to them.Thank you Angels of Hope for helping us!!

Angels of Hope - A Family Cancer Foundation	222997		/users/profile/286741	BeAnAngel	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I have never quite seen anything like Angels of Hope.  A small group of committed volunteers who go out of their way to make a difference for 100's of families on the cancer journey each year.  When I am around this group, the energy and passion are simply amazing.  I also donate my money to Angels of Hope.  I can follow a $ in and tie it directly to the family it has supported.  You will not get this level of transparency from any other charity.  Zero payroll, zero offices, simply a team of people with HUGE hearts focused on making a difference for kids/families battling cancer. I've lost many loved ones to this dreaded disease, and it's not an easy journey   I would encourage you to attend an event, or have a personal conversation with any of the Board members, you will definitely see a different type of non-profit than I read about in the news all the time.

This foundation began as a grass roots organization and has grown into one of the most respected foundations in the State of Michigan.  I say that because we are an all volunteer board of directors.  All our money we receive from donations goes right back to helping the children and families we support.  As the word continues to get out about Angels of Hope and people see the impact we make on families dealing with this devastating disease of cancer it's becomes easy for people to want to get involved with our foundation.  We have and continue to make a significant impact in people's lives here in Michigan.  I'm proud being part of a great organization and all the people who support us.

Including my precious Niece, Lauryn Howard, who is waging war against stage 4 Neuroblastoma.  Her Mommy and Daddy, Laura and Randy, and the rest of us are so grateful that Angels of Hope is here!! It is beyond horrible to watch your child battle such an illness. Laura took the Family Leave Act so she could be with Lauryn during the past year of surgeries, chemo, radiation,  four hour MRI's, and now antibody therapy. During this time, the bills fell far behind. We tried to help. Many precious people tried to help. But then YOU , Angels of Hope, stepped in and lifted a very heavy burden off of Laura and Randy so they can now get back to ONLY worrying about their Lauryn. You are a God Sent Blessing and we all love you so much! I myself have EVERY intention of joining your team! I have been ill, but I will be better soon and I will do whatever I can to help you keep helping all the families here in Michigan that need you so badly. With sincere love and gratitude, the Clise/Howard family. WE ALL LOVE YOU

If you're struggling with cancer, why should you have to struggle with that too?!?  Adults can go anywhere for a wig but Kid's wigs have to be made for them.  And once you're one of Maggie's Kids, you're always be taken care of by W4K.  There are so many ways to help.  Grow your hair and donate!  Participate in the W4K events and volunteer your time and if you donate money, know that all $ go to the Kids.  Everyone is a volunteer.

Wigs 4 Kids is truly an amazing organization. 
Wigs 4 Kids	251884	5	/users/profile/339882	Deakit	Client Served	5	08/06/2015	Wigs 4 Kids is amazing. They have provided our family with the emotional support needed to get through a hair loss diagnosis. Our family feels blessed because other than my daughters alopecia she is very healthy. Many of the families that utilize the services at wigs 4 kids have to deal with not only hair loss, but an ill child as well.  My daughter has gained confidence and self-esteem by now being able to look like all of the other children. She has received a beautiful natural hair piece every year since the age of four. This is provided to our family by wigs 4 kids at no cost to us. Maggie has inspired myself and those around me to grow and donate our hair back to the program. This includes my son and many of his friends.  Thank you Maggie and staff for all you do. We wouldn't have been able to get through this without you.

Wigs 4 Kids	251822	9	/users/profile/339816	keltay	Client Served	5	08/05/2015	Our circumstance is unusual: my daughter was a donor and I was a client in the salon. Then, we noticed our same donor daughter was pulling her hair out. So, now she is not only a donor but a client. Though she never needed a wig we utilized many of the services and opportunities Wigs 4 Kids offers. Our daughter needed to know she was not alone, is beautiful and most importantly a self esteem/confidence boost. Wigs 4 Kids is a great support and has such wonderfully kind, caring individuals involved. They are all in living with their confidential care of every family making us feel comfortable.

Wigs 4 Kids	251451	6	/users/profile/339400	LaVeta D.	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	Over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to volunteer with the Wigs 4 Kids staff and see the amazing work that this team does for children that have experienced hair loss due to illness. First, I was surprised to learn that there is an organization to help this particular community, giving free wigs and free support services to families with this unique need. Learning this inspired me to see the work in action and to see how I could help! At my first meeting there, I was introduced to the intricate structure and depth of the Wigs 4 Kids program. There is a very holistic approach to boosting the confidence and self-esteem of the children they help. The most heart-warming sights that I've seen, included: The humble compassion and sense of pride shown by adults & children who donated their own hair. Then, most awe-inspiring, were the shy smiles, bright eyes, and beautiful hair styles that were  made for and chosen by children who had been helped!!I have immense respect and appreciation for the conscious, wise, visionary - Ms. Maggie Varney  & her dedicated team! They have created and maintain a venue that gives enrichment and joyful experiences to families. I'm so proud to have been allowed the opportunity to help this team!Additionally, I felt so appreciated for volunteering. This team is grateful and considerate to the people that time to help. Everytime that I have been there, the atmosphere of Wigs 4 Kids has been a pleasure to encounter; filled with peace, and love, and bustle! There are amazing and effective happenings at this well run non-profit and much to be done. Wigs 4 Kids is a purposeful place!

The first day I spoke with Mrs. Maggie, she told me not worry anymore and that they would help my daughter with her issue... And that's exactly what they have done at wigs 4 kids... Because of Corey (her therapist) she has been doing so much better with her urge to pull out her own hair.. It's like he give her something to be proud about because she knows she's going to see him. Mr. Corey has helped my husband and I as well with different ways to deal with her disorder. And then Mrs. Maggie and her staff make us feel like family every time we are in the wellness center. They have lead Kendall to believe she owns the place... Lol. I am so excited to know such wonderful people who care genuinely about their clients and work hard everyday to make them feel special... We love attending the special events they have for the ambassadors and their families. We are always excited to me others who share the same love we have for Wigs 4 Kids. The custome wig that was made for Kendall makes her feel more than normal she feels like a princess!!! We're so blessed to be apart of Wigs 4 Kids and I will do whatever I can to bring more awareness to this wonderful organization full of wonderful human beings. THE RICHARDSON FAMILY  WIGS 4 KIDS!

I have had alopecia all my life , and when I was 8 I was told I would never grow hair ever again.  Now with that heart wrenching news I had given up all hope and I felt awful about myself . But my mom found Wigs 4 Kids and Maggie, to me it was the biggest blessing in my life . I'm now a senior in high school and I can honestly say that I have a good self estem , and I never let anything hold me back just because I don't have hair . Without this program I don't feel like I would have been able to accomplish all these projects in my life because I was so afraid to go near people for fear of their comments . Not to mention Maggie makes sure that we always have a support system behind us in everyway. I'm so happy and proud to be a ambassador for this amazing program .

She never knew what it was like to have hair, ponytails, braids etc.  When she turned 6 I brought her into wigs4kids and was greeted with so much kindness towards not only my daughter but my whole family.  Seeing Ella in a wig for the first time and seeing her smile made me cry tears of joy.   The support they provide for the health and welfare of the children is a blessing.  
Wigs 4 Kids	251409	1	/users/profile/339355	Jennifer460	Client Served	5	08/03/2015	In 2011 our oldest son was diagnosed with cancer, with him being a singer in a screamo band his hair was quite unique and ment alot too him. Anthony's treatment left him to ill to make it to the center so Maggie came to the hospital to measure Anthony knowing how important it was to him.  Maggie never ceases to amaze me. She always make sure these children and their families are taken care of when faced with such challenges  The smile on Anthony's face was priceless when he received his wig, one I will never forget. Maggie and her team and the many volunteers always go out of their way to make the children feel special and help in anyway they can. This goes far beyond just receiving a wig, from field trips, nutrition classes and cooking, to boat rides and dinner with your family. Things to take your mind off the challenges of day to day life with a child who is Ill or facing a different disease that require her services.   Thank you Maggie and Wigs 4 Kids staff for all you do!!! Much love from your ROCK STARS mom

It was the best decision I have ever made. Every single employee has such a kind heart and never fails to make anyone happy. Everytime I walk into that building, I feel a sense of comfort and love. The workers there treat you like family and are such hard workers. Anyone that has a certain type of hair loss disease is guaranteed to get a wig that fits right for them. You even get to pick out your own length and color so it suits you. I want to thank everyone that works for Wigs 4 Kids and especially to Mrs. Maggie for changing my life and giving me the confidence that I once never had. Every kid that steps out of that building gains confidence and happiness everyday and there is nothing better than that. 
Wigs 4 Kids	247381	1	/users/profile/334907	mehdina	Volunteer	5	07/03/2015	Hi, I am a mother of 2 girls that have Alopecia. My First child was 5 years old when she was diagnosed and may second child was just one year old. They were both diagnosed at the same time which was very stressful. My first child was going to kindergarten and I was very scared for her of what kids would say to her because kids can be very cruel. One day my sister-in-lav found Wigs 4 Kids on the internet and we called to set an appointment. They were so generous and they told us we could come right away. When we arrived  a woman with a very big heart welcomed us and her named is Maggie Varney, She nicely told us all about the program, how we would get the wigs right away and that the whole program was free including the wigs, hairstyling,hair cuts, ect. After  year my first child's hair started growing back and my second child got her first wig. 8 years passed and my second child is still  in the program. All the workers there are very kind, polite, and love the children Thank god there is a program that helps kids not feel feel insecure.  Sincerely,Emina Didic

Wigs 4 Kids is an OUTSTANDING nonprofit organization. They offer a number of services  to individuals and families who are coping with illness/medical treatments that result in hair loss.   The kind caring staff members at Wigs 4 Kids truly make a difference in the lives of their clients (children and families). I have had the pleasure of working directly with social worker Corey Faulkner who helps individuals as well as families cope/recover from social, psychological, emotional as well as physical side effects of hair loss. I would, without reservation, refer any individual dealing with a hair loss related illness to Wigs 4 Kids.  I am happy to be apart of such a wonderful organization, and I look forward to many more opportunities ahead.  Lisa Q

Wigs 4 Kids	245493	6	/users/profile/332667	nonprofitrev4757	Volunteer	1	06/17/2015	I read all of the reviews about Wigs 4 Kids on this site prior to volunteering here. I brushed off the last review (by tbennettbaker) because with a mission like this, how could they NOT be caring, wonderful people!?  Boy, was I wrong.  I've volunteered at numerous non-profits over the past fifteen years in a variety of capacities, but this was by far the most degrading and upsetting volunteer experience I've had to date. I did not feel like my work had any impact nor would I suggest volunteering for this organization in any capacity. I was openly mocked by the employees and owner and left at the end of the day almost in tears because of their utter lack of professionalism and communication skills. Bottom Line: Should you donate your hair here? Yes, there really aren't many organizations that offer this service. Should you get your hair cut and styled here? Yes, the stylists seemed friendly and professional. Should you volunteer or seek employment here? No... For an organization that prides itself on helping children with their self-esteem they did a fantastic job at attempting to crush mine over less than a dozen wasted pieces of paper. 
Wigs 4 Kids	232929	8	/users/profile/296569	tbennettbaker	Volunteer	1	11/05/2014	I have volunteered for four hours. The place definitely has a great value and mission. It's definitely an inspiring and upholding place for clients who are going through cancer treatment. It was a warming and welcoming environment "for the customers". However, behind the scene was a terrible experience. You cannot be a leader but mistreat your staff. You cannot be rude to your staff in front of customers. If you're going to be a leader, you have to treat "everybody" with dignity and respect. The boss was a hypocrite who tries to present herself as a great, caring, and loving person for the kids. You cannot put your standards higher than the people who works for you. If it wasn't for them to help run your place, you will not be where you are today. Another staff was asked or "demanded" to take care of another task with an attitude and high tone in front of a customer. I am sure the staff feels degrading. This boss had little patience when it comes to hearing what anyone else has to say. It was a horrible experience volunteering for this place. If you're going to donate or take their service, I recommend it. But do not volunteer or work for the owner of this place. She treats you with no respect. She's all over the place and cannot make up her mind of what she wants you to do. She will try to manipulate you for not having "enough skills" when really she's the one who does not have clear instructions. This is to all students who are interning. Definitely not a great scene for helping out in the back.

He always got called a girl, but he didn't care, because it was one gift we could afford to give. We heard about the organization through the salon we go to. We decided to give to this one, because one of the bigger organizations would charge for the wigs and this is free!!!. For the kids who need it.  We received the postcard with the thanks and it will always be a reminder to him..

Met her professionally, when i was assigned by my editor to write a story on this new non-profit. Since that time Maggie and I have become like-minded, close friends. I'm now an Advisory Board member of Wigs 4 Kids, and have the deepest respect for what Maggie and her staff do to support our sweet "kids" in need. It's fulfilling to see the love at the Wellness Center for our "kids." For any negative remark or review there may be, there are easily 10 positive reviews to back that up. There's a sense of purpose in supporting this organization. I'm happy to be on this journey with Maggie, the kids, her staff, and our board.

Wigs 4 Kids	223733	5	/users/profile/287476	Momofgirls	Donor	2	10/17/2014	Actually I was disappointed finding out what happened after my daughter chose this charity to donate her hair this time around.  When my husband dropped it off, since it was "local" instead of a thank you and something for the scrapbook.  They were more invested in making him but a tshirt for $25.  Was the hair (very long, very thick) not a huge donation?  Apparently not appreciated to even give the child a tshirt.  No they wanted cash too.  Definitely won't be the place she donated to the next time around.

Wigs 4 Kids	160329	1	/users/profile/212602	Stephanie93	Volunteer	5	06/11/2013	WIGS4KIDS Is a Non-profit organization which in my mind supersedes many!!!! Parents have enough to worry about with costs of healthcare, medications, and other bills not paid due to leave of absences from work. I have been involved with WIGS4KIDS for ten years now and have seen the impact personally on each and every child that has walked through the doors. Maggie is kind, courteous, understanding, vibrant, educated and loving. She has the passion no other women has that I have ever met. Even during her own health battles, she put these kids first. Not only has this organization helped these children, it has also broadened my horizons, taught me valuable life lessons it has also taught me great working skills. To anyone who needs services of this kind, the support, education, and determination this organization has is by far the greatest around.

Wigs 4 Kids	223178	1	/users/profile/286922	Lynn85	Donor	5	10/15/2014	I first found out about Wigs 4 Kids from my facebook. Im not sure who posted it but when I seen it I started to look up any information I could for this. After reading about it I decided to donate my hair. I have been wanting to cut it for a long time but my granddaughter always stopped me. Then I wasn't sure how to do it because I live in Alpena way up North, when I made a comment on a post I was answered back which I did not expect and was happy to no that they took the time to look up where I could go here to donate my hair and make sure it goes to this great charity. As I said my granddaughter was very upset I was getting it cut but after I talked to her why and what the hair was going to be used for she was excited and then wanted to get hers cut. She is 9yrs old and said to me can I say a prayer for all the kids, she then asked what Chemo was and I explained it, I told her how you make wigs for the kids that their hair falls out from Cancer, she said Meme (name for grama she came up with when a baby) I will pray for them because kids are mean and make fun of them and its not right. She then told me she was proud of me can you believe that. I don't have money but would love to do what I can for this cause and to get my grandkids involved to show them that you can help others, if there is anything or any way we can help we would be honored to help. Thank you for helping these children out in there time of need.

I was blown away by the stories the children told, and what Maggie has been able to do for them! It is comforting to know that if something were to happen to my children, or any of their friends, that they would have a place to go that feels like home and truly takes care of them!

When I was much younger, I used to donate my hair to Wigs 4 Kids. I had recently moved to the area and decided to come check out Wigs 4 Kids and their Wellness Center. I was overwhelmed with the amount of services that they offer to kids. Between wigs, counseling, music, art and drama therapy, nutrition classes etc. - and all FREE OF COST! They never turn a child away - and are always there to help. What a great way to run an organization! The kids of Michigan are lucky to have Maggie around to help them when going through a difficult time.
Wigs 4 Kids	217247	1	/users/profile/280773	Chammons	Client Served	5	09/25/2014	How I became a Client of Go Green Salon, was quite unusual.   I was there on a business meeting with an inexpensive wig on, having a hot flash.  Geez could it get any worse.   Maggie looked and me and said stay after the meeting I think I can help you.  Maggie being the caring person she is took me into a private room and we tried on many hairpieces.  Which were beautiful, and of course I had to order one.  But the caring she showed me that day is the, same caring that she shares with every one of her children.  Believe me when I say that they are her children, she will go the extra mile to make sure every child is believing in themselves and confident in the way they look.  I dont think that there is a day that goes by that she is not thinking how to make a childs life better, or even a older Italian thinning hair ladies life better.Thank you Maggie for all you do!

Wigs 4 Kids	204639	2	/users/profile/266666	Yanira	Donor	5	06/30/2014	My daughter's hair was so long & she wanted to cut it. I had known about Lock of Love because of a high school classmate who donated his hair. So I search online for hair donations and found Wigs4Kids. I like it because it was just for kids. I wasn't sure about which organization to donate to so since her hair is thick she said she wanted to donate half to Locks Of Love & the other to Wigs4Kids. She donated 15 inches of hair in April of 2013. Now her hair is long enough to donate again but this time all to Wigs4Kids. We recieved an email last time of a certificate thanking my daughter for her donation so hopefully by now there is a child out there smiling with my daughter's hair on their head. I am so proud of my daughter for willing to donate her hair again that this time I'm hoping my hair is long enough to donate as well.

Wigs 4 Kids	46066	1	/users/profile/46955	jeannei	Donor	5	06/27/2010	I used to donate my hair to Locks of Love, however, I had moved back to Michigan in 2006, I read an article in the NY Times about Wigs4Kids, and was happy to know that this organization gives much more than just wigs to children with hair loss; they uplift these kids morale, and allow them to become part of their family. They provide assistance with grooming and feeling good about themselves, especially in their time of despair.  Best of all, Wigs4Kids is located right in my neighborhood of St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  I walked in to a warm welcome from Maggie Varney and her staff and had my long hair cut for the last time.  (Before I started dyeing it).Whenever I donate to charity, I make sure that the moneys will be well spent and not wasted.  This is obvious in the spirit and the growth of Wigs4Kids, especially these last few years.Once a year Wigs4Kids throws a wonderful fundraising dinner with lovely donated prizes and inspirational messages from the wig recipients and the founder, Maggie Varney.  Everyone who attends finds the evening a great experience, one we talk about all year long!   We always look so forward to the next one!

We entered the facility and were immediately greeted by warm, happy faces. My daughter, who was donating, along with her older sisters were taken on a tour and explained every detail how Wigs for Kids helps kids in need. She got to see wigs awaiting their owners, watch a video and see memory books of kids who have been helped. The salon service made my daughter feel special throughout her new hair cut. She even recieved a gift and a follow up phone call thanking her and asking if SHE had any questions. This is a wonderful organization and should be commended on their work enriching the lives of our youth!  Well done! My daughter has inspired her sisters and they each will be returning to donate soon!

I knew of wigs 4 kids from when i donated my hair but i didn't know what to expect until we went in for our appointment. She was feeling so down when she lost her hair so fast, you can try to prepare kids for something like that but they don't honestly understand until its gone, W4K  was able to gave her a wig that same day and they boosted her confidence back up so much when she got her wig she felt like the princesses that she truly is. W4K is so awesome they do so much more for the kids then just give them a wig they help make you feel beautiful again there is all kinds of stuff they do for you they always have classes  fun activities going on  and so much more they really focus on you and your family needs and they help to give those kids back so much confidence they had lost.

We went to the facility in St. Clair Shores Mi to get their hair cut and see the facility that gives children their wigs.The experience was great.  The hair stylist did an excellent job giving each girl their own style, and the receptionist was very friendly and informative.  She showed us the room where young children, get their wigs, the room where teenagers get their wigs, and can also come back for proms and have hair and make up done for them.  Then we saw the family room where they have events so that the recipients of wigs can get together and meet other children that are going through similar situations.  We also saw a picture of one of the teenagers that models, the receptionist told us that she actually won best hair in .one of her events.  They had no idea that she was wearing a wigs for kids wig.

Working with Wigs 4 Kids has been an amazing experience.  We were invited to meet for a fitting locally, as representatives happened to be in town for a meeting on our side of the state.  Their willingness to grant us the time in their already busy schedule proved their love of what they do, and the kids they do it for.

Wigs 4 Kids	160323	1	/users/profile/212597	tulrich	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2013	Wigs4Kids definitely fills a need in this community. I remember when my son was in need of a wig during his bout with Hodgkins. We bought it when his hair was falling out due to the chemo treatments and had it trimmed by a barber in the same building as the wig provider. What a mess. But, he wore it every day. That's how important it was to him to have that shield. He went through 3 of them before he was cancer free and his hair grew back. Now, we have a tremendous resource in Wigs4Kids. They provide the wig for free to the child and update it before it's needed. It is custom made and looks as natural as can be. The dedicated staff is knowledgeable, caring, efficient and hard working. They are a treasure to this community and an asset to any group that works with them.  The long and short of it is just this: They love these kids and it shows. And we love them for what they do.

We heard about her from another young girl who had been a client after my daughter lost her hair in 5th grade. She has Alopecia. My daughter was outgoing and very active- competitive dancer. She started to withdraw and wore hats all the time. Then she started to pull away from dance because she was embarrassed to be on stage. One simple call was all it took. Maggie does EVERY appointment herself in special rooms set up for her clients for comfort and privacy. They receive rockstar service and attention. And the parents and siblings are a part of it too. My daughter has been with the foundation for almost three years now. Maggie counsels, supports, and loves each and every child. All services r free to the families. Even after a serious bout with very cruel public bullying, my daughter stands strong and confident and that is largely due to Maggie, the great ladies, and other fabulous kids at W4K.

Throughout this terrible diagnosis and treatment we have blessed with amazing things to help us get through this time in our lives. Wigs 4 Kids is one of those blessings! The more people this organization can help the better. Hair is so important to our children's self esteem and socialization and having a wig that looks like her natural hair was a huge advantage when my daughter started to lose her hair. She just started to wear the wig and it is so real looking no one even knew it was a wig and she is comfortable going out in public and being with her friends and it was just one more blessing to make this experience a little easier for her and our family. And not only do they provide these temporary and permanent wigs for free they also hold workshops and classes and have outings where these kids and parents can get together at no cost and just have a good time together or learn something new. From the bottom of my heart I am so thankful to Maggie and her staff they are so professional, caring and knowledgeable. This organization is amazing and the people that work there are truly making kids lives better with what they are doing.

I have had the pleasure of volunteering for Wigs 4 Kids since it's beginning and have watched it grow from a small grassroots organization run out of an 800 square foot salon into the Wigs 4 Kids Wellness Center that now provides hair prosthetics to hundreds of children a year. Maggie Varney founded the organization and her love of these kids and passion for the cause has driven her to help so many children. In addition to providing wigs, support services such as music therapy, nutrition classes and counseling for the kids and their families are available. It is important to these kids to look like their peers and with bullying being so prevalent in society making sure these kids feel good about themselves is vital. To witness the positive reaction these kids have when they receive their wigs is beyond heart-warming. Many of the families report that their children's grades, relationships and all around outlook improves after receiving their wig. Maggie and Wigs 4 Kids are truly making a difference in a lot of lives and touching a lot of hearts!

Maggie Varney the founder of this wonderful organization puts her heart and soul into everything she does for these exceptionally wonderful children in this program.  Wigs-4-Kids does a wonderful job in helping the children in some of their many challeging day to day experiences.   I have never seen an organization more devoted to children, let alone the CEO provides hands on love, compassion, services, skills, devotion, time and the list goes on and on.  The devotion and attention that Maggie and her wonderful staff provides is just one lf the many things that drew me to become a volunteer for Wigs-4-Kids.  My co-workers always  look forward to our yearly and some times twice a year fundraisers and they love to compete to see which person and/or location can raise the most funds and to attend the Annual Wigs-4-Kids Gala.  Being a Board Member is just a plus to be able to be a part of helping out and interacting with the Children.  If anyone really wants to know whT Wigs-4-Kids is all about just stop by and take a tour of the Wellness Center and come to the Galaand meet some of the loveliest children around.

He was getting chemo treatments at the Van Elslander Cancer center where he met Ms. Maggie and saw her interaction with the children there. When he died of his cancer his wife Jenifer requested that donations were to Wigs4Kids because she knew how much John thought this charity.    When my daughter, Christine suddenly lost 80% of her hair to Alopecia my mother in law suggested we consider John's charity. I made a call and was placed with an appointment that changed Chrisine.  Christine, Mom, and her 2 sisters were at the appointment. She was very apprehensive over all that was going on so quickly. Gently Maggie talked to her about her Alopecia and how she was going to get her a wig that will make her feel better about herself.  We went home feeling much better about everything.      Christine got her wig and her self esteem improved immensly.   The center has fun classes,like painting and baking, that are meant to bring the children together to see the common issue of no hair and not even realize that it is therapeutic that they are not " the only one".      Christine knows first hand how good her wig makes her feel and on her own did fundraising with her school(spirt week) to provide a wig for another child. This empowered her to know she can make a difference. Thank you Ms Maggie and your organiztion for making a positve difference in my childs life!
Wigs 4 Kids	132227	1	/users/profile/177844	Marie30	Client Served	5	11/01/2012	My daughter Mariah is Cancer Survivor.  Two years ago when my daughter was ten she was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.  When she started treatment (Chemo) we were told the probability of her hair falling out was 99%.  My daughter was horrified.  Not only did she have to undergo  surgery and treatment with needles galore, but her hair was going to fall out.  Mariah is my girlie-girl tom-boy.  Her hair started falling out on a Thursday by the handful, I called Wigs 4 Kids and we had a n appointment for the following Tuesday.  She played Volleyball that weekend with a bandana on, because she did not want everyone to know she was losing her hair.  Maggie the CEO welcomed her with open arms and a smile on Tuesday morning.  She was compassionate, yet treated Mariah with respect and dignity.  She asked Mariah to see her hair, she asked Mariah if she could cut off the remainder so they could fit her for a wig.  (I am teary eyed remembering the details.) Mariah was fitted with a wig that day, which she was able to pick out and Maggie styled it for her.  Mariah wore her wig every day to school until after treatment and her hair finally came back in.   The ability to go to school, go out socially and not be looked at differently was a redeeming factor to my daughter.  I have to tell you, it meant so much to my daughter, the following summer my daughter and her friends raised over $800.00 to purchase a wig for another child, so they could have their self-esteem during difficult times.  WE LOVE WIGS 4 KIDS.  Maria & Mariah Michalowski

When she found out that she would lose her hair she said, that she wanted a pink wig. Well, Maggie got her that pink wig and her first synthetic wig as well. Our dtr remembers sitting at a friends house watching all the girls play with there hair while she sat bald. She was glad and very blessed to feel some normacy at Wigs 4 Kids because there were children like her there and she was treated by the staff as if she was so so special yet a normal teen in many ways. Maggie has made several special wigs for our dtr for special events. Ballet ( a bun), school musical ( a forties hair style) these are some example of the extra loving touches from W4K. When Maggie thought it was time for a real natural wig she gave it to her. We will never be able to thank her and the foundation enough. W4K is truly a group of angels with loving hearts for any child in need. We are big advocates for W4K.
Wigs 4 Kids	89836	3	/users/profile/102332	trish	Client Served	5	06/07/2011	I found out about Wigs 4 Kids after researching organizations on the Internet that help children deal emotionally and physically with their hair loss. This organization was most appropriate for my daughter.  My daughter, age 7 was diagnosed with Leukemia on June 4, 2010. I contacted Wigs 4 Kids as she began to lose her hair. We attended our appointment and the staff gave us a tour and we reviewed the books and brief stories of all the children they helped thus far. The before and after pictures was proof that Wigs 4 Kids has made a life long impact on the lives of many children with various medical conditions that resulted in hair loss.  Mrs. Maggie Varney personally made us feel welcome, comfortable and relaxed throughout the entire process. When I saw the precious and heartfelt smile on my daughter's face, it was truly priceless.

I was diagnosed with Alopecia Universalis and never could have overcame Hairloss with a smile on my face without the staff of W4K. I am confident in everything I do because of how beautiful the hair pieces are, and because of the support the team at Wigs 4 Kids offers. It's a personal experience and they make you feel like family. 
Wigs 4 Kids	47904	3	/users/profile/48735	katrina1	Volunteer	5	07/08/2010	I have had the pleasure of working with Maggie for 8 years and watch her develop the Wigs 4 Kids program out of her salon and see it grow into such a wonderful organization. The best part of being involved in something like this is to see the positive impact it has on the children who receive their services. Not only the physical aspect but the emotional aspect - their self-esteem improves and the you can see the joy on their faces when they receive their wigs. I am glad that there is an organization like this working everyday to help children affected by hair-loss.

Wigs 4 Kids	46462	3	/users/profile/47303	mrsmouse0002yahoocom	Donor	5	06/29/2010	After some research I found that Wigs 4 Kids was the best choice for us.  Previously I donated to Locks of Love, but never knew if my donations were received.  Wigs 4 Kids sent us a timely thank you note that was very much appreciated.  It's great to know that our very small donation was recieved & made a difference.
Wigs 4 Kids	46345	1	/users/profile/47210	sami2002	Donor	5	06/29/2010	My daughter, Samantha, heard that one of her friends (a fellow 1st grader) donated her hair to Wigs for Kids.  We initially thought Sami would give to Locks of Love, but then heard the differences...Wigs 4 Kids is just that - for kids.  They also give the wigs away, while Locks of Love charges for their wigs.The experience was amazing...they have the donator look through books for a hair style.  These books also have stories and pictures of the recipients.  My daughter received a gift bag, a ton of attention and the knowledge that she was truly helping someone in need -- and it was only $20 for the cut...which goes directly to the charity!  We will definately do this again...and by we I mean me too  :)
Wigs 4 Kids	46100	4	/users/profile/46984	rose93086	Donor	5	06/28/2010	I donated 18 inches of my hair to Locks of Love in August of 2006. I was so happy to do it for someone else to feel confident. Recently one of my friends had told me about Wigs 4 Kids and I went to their website and was overjoyed when I saw how wonderful all of the girls looked. I think that Wigs 4 Kids is an amazing foundation and their goal and purpose is so helpless and kind. My fiance and others love that my hair has grown back long again however I want to make someone else happy again. My fiance, Sean, fully supports my decision to donate my hair again this fall after our October 10th wedding and I can't wait to make a difference to someone else in need. Thank God for charities like this and for the wonderful people who receive our hair donations, We are thrilled to help out.
Wigs 4 Kids	45936	8	/users/profile/46810	livtmissscs	Volunteer	5	06/26/2010	I became involved with Wigs 4 Kids about a year and a half ago.  I am a local representative in the Miss America Organization; my current title being Miss St. Clair Shores, and came to Wigs 4 Kids for my platform. It wasn't long and I was hired as an employee. My interest in the beauty industry and love for the program has a special place in my heart and I think everyone who is involved with the organization can say it has touched their lives in one way or another--I know it has changed my life.  It is a privilege and honor to be a part of Wigs 4 Kids, knowing that everyday we are changing the lives of children struggling with their health challenges and knowing we are and continue to put smiles on their faces and lift their self esteem dramatically.  After all, it's all about the kids. :)
Wigs 4 Kids	45766	6	/users/profile/46649	verncline	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2010	A friend of mine invited me to a Wigs 4 Kids fundraiser, and I was not sure what to expect.  I did not think there was such a need for this service, boy was I in for a surprise.  The event was done first class, and the volunteers and staff were very organized.  The staff members were caring and compassionate, the founder showed so much love for these little angels.  I was moved beyond belief when I heard a recipient of the program candidly speak about how Wigs 4 Kids changed her life. This is a wonderful thing- focusing on making kids feel like their peers so they can worry about one less thing, when they are going through treatment.  I commend this  selfless organization for the desire to help children feel good about themselves.  After all, what else is there?  The self esteem of a child is so important and knowing someone cares about this; makes me think this world isn't so bad afterall.

Although my Nephew was not here in Michigan, there were comparable organizations in Florida which helped my Niece and her family deal with this devastating illness.  Wigs for Kids is an amazing organization that helps in ways only the recipient knows.  This is an organization that truly has a heart and soul, and it is one that is needed in todays world of I, Me, My..
Wigs 4 Kids	45690	6	/users/profile/46573	spaul82478	Volunteer	5	06/25/2010	Wigs 4 Kids came to me by accident. I was getting married and I came to Maggie for a consult for the wedding. While doing my hair, she was explaing to me what she does and what Wigs 4 Kids means to these children.It was the morning after the first dinner fundraiser they had had and i was inspired. At this time she was just becoming noticed, this was 6 years ago. After I heard the stories and met the children I instantly became a volunteer. Helping out when I could, being a full time student, I still found myself there every week. During this process, the Wellness Center was being constructed, it was just a dream, but now 35 buildings and 6 years later, The Wellness Center is open. With all this going on, I found my calling to become a Social Worker, and in doing so, I also enlightened the Wayne State School of Social Work to become involved. On March 26th, 2010, Wayne State School of Social Work held their very first Bowling Fundraiser raising enough money to become a founding memeber. I may have organized the event, however, I would have never been able to do so without the dedication and skills I was taught at Wigs 4 Kids. I have learned to care more about others, more about myself, and the awsome feeling of giving, even when I have nothing but time to give. This organaztion is like nothing I have ever seen. I am proud to be a volunteer, and a part of Wigs 4 Kids, and will continue to do so until I am no longer able. This is truly a heartfelt enviornment and I am truly blessed to be a part of it.
Wigs 4 Kids	45678	6	/users/profile/46560	jayne2	Donor	5	06/25/2010	I always had long hair.  But after my wedding I thought why?  Who cares and so i contacted someone who cuts hair and donates to you and they took off 13 inches.  I have very thick hair so I hope it was useful to some child out there to make them feel beautiful.  It did me for such a long time.  Now it is out there doing good somewhere.  I had a great experience.

Wigs 4 Kids	45675	6	/users/profile/46556	c-pokrzywa	Volunteer	5	06/25/2010	My daughter has been volunteering as a musician for Wigs 4 Kids events for three years now - she plays her harp at the Annual Gala, at the Capital Campaign launch and at the Wellness Center Grand Opening. Maggie is so inspiring that all three of my daughters have donated their hair to Wigs 4 Kids, and are growing their hair to donate again. We have had the opportunity to interact with kids who have been served by Wigs 4 Kids, and it is obvious that the caring, supportive environment combined with delivery of an essential and clearly overlooked service makes the organization an important addition to this community.
Wigs 4 Kids	45535	8	/users/profile/46424	alissa3	Client Served	5	06/24/2010	I had been really sick for a while, and no one knew what was wrong with me. They said it was in my head and I was faking it. I knew I wasnt though, because things happened I couldnt control, and my hair stared falling out. i started getting huge bald patches, and I didnt want to start school as the weird sick girl. we found wigs 4 kids and decided it was time to go try. I was worried they would turn me down because we didnt know what was wrong with me, but we went anyway, because I needed help and we didnt know what to do. when we met with maggie we told her what was going on, and everyone at wigs 4 kids were some of the nicest people ive met. maggie reassured me that it would be okay, and they wouldnt let me feel like i was ugly because of how i looked. i was starting school within 4 days. she got me a wig within 2, in time for school. i was able to attend the first day of school, and i didnt have to worry about anything! it made me feel beautiful again, and more importantly, like myself again. the doctors finally diagnosed me with some rare diseases, and we dont know if i will loose my hair again, but it doesnt matter, because i know I will always have wigs 4 kids. they have helped me so much, and I only hope I can do the same for them some day. I am going to try ang grow out my hair and donate it too one day!I love you all! you are the BEST!!!!

She was a Freshman in High School and kids were cruel to a child losing her hair, especially at an age when appearances are so important.  Wigs 4 Kids donated a wig to her, and totally redeemed her self esteem.  The staff is super friendly and they all were a great help to helping her establish her self worth again.
Wigs 4 Kids	8228	12	/users/profile/10011	klcourter@yahoo.com	Client Served	5	07/31/2009	I was a ten year old boy when I found out I had cancer. Life threatening? Scary? Life altering? Yes to all above. People stared,  children pointed, it was hard to go outside my home knowing how ugly I was. Then I met Maggie. I knew that she could do nothing for me, but I humored my mom and dad and went to her shop. She sat me down and told me how brave I was and that she could help me to feel good about myself again. No way, I thought. WOW was I wrong! She fitted me for a wig, and in no time I had a real human hair wig. I brought pictures in and she cut and styled the wig, then turned me to face the mirror. It was the me I was inside. I could go out and I looked like everyone else. I wasn't ugly, I had worth. (Which my mom and dad had told me all along.) She showed my how to care for my wig. I wore that wig for nearly a year, every day, and well, THANKYOU WIGS 4 KIDS for helping me though the toughest time of my life! Love, Joshua Courter
Wigs 4 Kids	8134	10	/users/profile/9929	nadasaad	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	My daughter Rachel was devastated when she lost all her hair.  She was 12 years old and soon to become a teenager with many other emotional battles to fight as well.  I had a great deal of difficulty finding ANYONE to help me and I called every salon in the Detroit area.  When I found out about Maggie and Wigs 4 Kids, my search was over.  Maggie was able to arrange for Rachel to have a custom Wig made just for Rachel.  She also instructed Rachel  on how to put the wig on, how to care for her wig, and she styled the wig exactly the way Rachel wanted it.  We were fortunate enough to find out about  Wigs 4 Kids last year BEFORE their annual fundraising Gala.  This Gala was a real treat  for Rachel and all the rest of my family.  Maggie and her staff do a wonderful job putting this on and all of us had a great time.  We are very thankful to be included in all the events put on by them.  Rachel attended the Christmas party with her brother and was able to meet other children and she could at last not feel that she was DIFFERENT.  My family and I applaud this wonderful organization for all their selfless work!

There is no other way to put how important they were to my 6 year old daughter when she was diagnosed with cancer.  The wig they provided Haley was so important to her recovery and self esteem as she was going through her cancer treatment.  The first day we met Maggie, Haley thought she was going to get a wig that day, she was very disturbed with loosing her hair.  Well when Haley got very upset about this Maggie was able to get her a beautiful wig the nest day.  Haley wore that wig everyday, without it there would have been no way that Haley would have gone to school or possibly even out of the house.  I cannot say enough about the important role that Wigs 4 Kids played in the recovery of my daughter as she fought her battle against cancer.

They offered support and guidance when all seemed lost.  A family member was hospitalized and our rights were being violated.  There was internal chaos within the hospital over our case.  PANDORA was there with us, step by step, sorting out the steps, and with PANDORA' s help and our insurance company, we were able to have the strength to leave the hospital AMA and get the second opinion we needed, which was drastically different from the first.  They also sent us a gas card to help with travel cost.The passion and compassion that drives the volunteer members is amazing.  They understand the needs of people who have NEIDS.  They change words into action for what is needed most to help a person overcome rough spots.

Pandora Org	314292		/users/profile/96458	Karen B.	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	I have seen many friends find hope through this organization. Hope is a lifeline that is very sorely needed at times when pain and suffering is at a peak. Giving out quilts to cover these patients in love is an amazing act of compassion that offers so much comfort to worn minds and bodies!As a huge group of people who have little help in the current medical community, Pandora being a voice for our suffering is a huge relief to us. Most do not have the physical ability to be proactive in our own medical future. I rely on them to be the voice for all of us. They do this well! I am thankful for all the members of this amazing organization and all it does for the ill community.

The volunteers have these disorders themselves so they know of what they speak which makes their informative information more timely.   When I was very, very ill and totally unable to get out of bed, I received meals from this wonderful organization and tips to help myself get well.   The information that I received from the hospital and doctor did not even have these little tips to feel better.   I cannot fully express all of my thanks for their help when I needed it most!!!!

Pandora Org	314094		/users/profile/405452	AnnetteV	Client Served	5	10/25/2016	I just cannot say enough about Pandora.org. And all the things they do. They reach out to people during hardship. Or if they think they might be lonely and having a hard time. I mean a hard time for us is everyday care. Like just fixing a little something to eat or shower is a huge chalengelle for us. Our illness is so misunderstood by family and friends. It truly is sad and lonely. People really do not understand that we cannot function correctly.. This puts so much pressure on the spouse, if you have one. And for those that have no one, it is even worst. There acts of kindness just brings such happy tears. Between the Beautiful handmade Quilts that are full of love put into them. That they send to people to make them feel loved and supported.. Or the Meals, 3 Meals a day for 7 Days. I got teary eye each time I had a meal. To know someone cared about me. This gave my husband a week off. And he really need it. To do such a Wonderful thing. When I was having such a hard time. Which I try not to talk about it. I get so teary eye every time I see a picture of someone getting a covered in love Beautiful Quilt. Or someone getting A huge box full of Wonderful Meals. Then there advocacy work to bring awareness. To Myalgic encephalomyelitis, a Neuro-immune disease.  Which there are still no FDA approved treatments for us. So we are very misunderstood By most Doctors.  What they do really wonderful. Very grateful to this organization.

Many times, just a tiny ray of hope is all that is needed to get through to the next rough patch.  The notes the recipients write are heartwarming and heart wrenching, both at the same time.  The quilts nourish the souls, and the food delivery nourishes the body.  What a tremendous gift for those who feel forgotten and neglected.

They are our voice at local, state, and national events.  They let us know of complicated issues involving the FDA and CDC, etc. and put it in terms those us of with cognitive issues can understand.  PANDORA educates health care providers so that they understand what we go through and keep them up-to-date on the latest research.  They have pulled together the patient population that they serve, to have a voice, a loud voice, in an otherwise voiceless illness.  We are the forgotten.  We are the hard to treat and easy to ignore patients.  PANDORA is a remarkable organization, with an incredible board of creative and inspiring people, many who know first hand what these illnesses can do to families.   The patient population is very thankful to have PANDORA on our side, to advocate, educate, and enlighten us.

It is a pleasure to serve the people who rely on Pandora Org! This is the only ME, CFS and fibromyalgia organization that directly serves patients. My heart melts every time a recipient is over the moon happy to get help. You see, most people with these illnesses feel abandoned and isolated. Pandora Org remembers them and acknowledges their suffering and existence.  Can you imagine being too sick to walk to the kitchen to cook? People with severe ME are bed bound. I know people who have eaten cereal for each meal because it's easy to have a box of cereal at bedside. Pandora Delivers fresh meals is a game changer for these people.  It's a difference of being placed in managed care or staying home and remaining independent.

We don't profit financially from our service. In fact, I donate to Pandora Org so I pay to "work" here. What a privilege! We do, however, get paid with showers of praise by the patients and their families for making a difference in their lives.  We also advocate for better health policies. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis is not understood, so medical care for these patients is sub-standard. There are not any treatments or medications for this illnesses. Our roll to educate physicians and governmental officials is sometimes met with opposition. There were a loud few last year that took it upon themselves to criticize Pandora Org for taking a strong stance in helping the Institute of Medicine with their peer review study on ME.  These few gave us poor ratings based on politics. Take their comments with a grain of salt.  I'm sure you can see from the many 5 star ratings that we are an upstanding and honest organization who cares deeply about people. Please consider donating, or volunteering, so we can continue our good works that directly support patients with compassionate care programs.   
Pandora Org	309969	1	/users/profile/401319	Writer	Board Member	5	10/12/2016	A wonderful organization that provides so much for those in need of support. They have helped my daughter greatly with her ME and helped her get diagnosed when no one else knew how.  Great advocates as well! Very worthy of your donation!
Pandora Org	309062	1	/users/profile/400424	Terry97	Client Served	5	10/08/2016	I received the most beautiful red and white throw quilt from Covered in Love (one of the services provided by Pandora) at a most difficult time in my life. I have a chronic illness called M. E. which had progressed to the point where I couldn't work anymore.  No matter how much I willed my body to function, it was like trying to get a car to start with a dead battery.  My doctor could see how much I was struggling, and indicated it was time to medically retire.  I was risking my life by continuing to try to push forward. It was devastating news because I loved my job as a school counselor. I was no longer able to do what had been my passion, and to be productive in the world in the way I so desired. Financial worries loomed like thunder clouds overhead. My life seemed very bleak and limited at that time. That amazing gift arrived at such the right moment. I cried out of sheer joy when I read the beautiful note which described how with every stitch there was much love sewn into that quilt. What had been such a moment of despair had been turned into such a  moment filled with overflowing love!! It hasn't been quite a year yet since I received my quilt, but every time I see that gorgeous quilt or wrap myself up in it, love and joy abound. Pandora has also offered meals at a very difficult time when my husband had been in the hospital for 11 days.  He was now home, and I was literally on my own with out much help from the outside world. My husband who usually was the caretaker and did the food shopping was obviously unable to do so at this time. He was recuping from his surgery and unable to drive. I was in a vulnerable sutuation. I had exhausted the little energy I had, yet we had run out of food. I wasn't capable of going out shopping at that time. Pandora stepped in and offered to send us frozen prepared meals. I will always be indebted to them for that offer!! I have seen how Pandora has so generously made the lives of others much better by the services it provides my patient community!!!  Many are isolated, homebound, and without help. Thank you, Pandora, for always seeming to step in at the right moment !!! 
Pandora Org	309048	1	/users/profile/290390	Jan_55	Client Served	5	10/08/2016	PANDORA set me up with meals during a severe crash when I was unable to prepare nutritious food for myself. At a time when I needed help most, they were there for me. To one who has a disease that is invisible to most of the world, the help from this wonderful organization is a shining light in a dark world.
Pandora Org	226658	3	/users/profile/290390	Jan_55	Donor	5	10/25/2014	I have many neuroendocrineimmune disorders, i.e. ME/CFS, FM, Interstitial Cystitis, Sjogrens, and others. I so admire the wonderful folks at PANDORA for their hard work, caring and support for patients with NEIDs. I have observed and participated as I have been able in their many advocacy efforts. They strive to spread awareness, advocate, educate, support patients in various ways, and promote research. One of their most important endeavors is physician education.  Thank for all that you are doing for our "invisible" illnesses!

Pandora Org	277100	3	/users/profile/200763	DrDaveOkie	Board Member	5	01/19/2016	In October 2014, 10 people, in a concerted effort, posted 1-star reviews of PANDORA Org. to try and influence our rating negatively. They were angry because once we had learned HHS had already contracted with the IOM for the ME/CFS study, we decided to work with HHS and the IOM to ensure the IOM panel had the best membership possible and was asking the right questions with the best instructions possible. Others wanted us to join them in trying to have the contract cancelled, but we believed our fallback position was essential.As it turned out, the IOM panel, with over half the panel members being experts in ME/CFS, conducted a very thorough and honest review of ME/CFS (which they recommended renaming SEID) and provided very strong and favorable results. After some initial shock and backlash about the report, everyone saw the government actually start taking action by funding SEID research, taking renewed efforts to reinvigorate SED strategic planning, treatment plans, developing diagnostic criteria, and more. Now patient groups are enthused and hopeful for the first time in a long time.PANDORA doesn't expect to get any credit for choosing the right path, now that it's apparent we did, but we would hope we've developed  some credibility with the community of ME/CFS (SEID) advocacy groups that we do share common interests and do have some workable ideas and expertise working with government agencies. We hope they will give us some credit in the future as we help lead the way in bettering the lives of our patients through advocating for better funding, research, treatments, and solutions. 
Pandora Org	222183	3	/users/profile/200763	DrDaveOkie	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	PANDORA Org is an all-volunteer organization that operates with very little funding, yet does very big work on a national level. It advocates for patients with NEIDs (ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Lyme Disease, Gulf War Illness, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and more) to the HHS, FDA, NIH, IOM, VA, and all the alphabet soup that is our federal government. And it advocates successfully. It is well-respected by those government agencies who recognize the number of patients that PANDORA Org supports. We also have been very active working as partners with other ME/CFS, FM, Lyme, and GWI groups to collaborate on difficult challenges, bringing all our power to bear on these tough problems. Beyond this national advocacy mission, PANDORA Org also does the little things that mean a lot to patients - supplying meals to those who are most ill or following a surgery, sending a quilt to those who need a hug or the warmth our group can provide, a gift of flowers and a card to our special friends when they need a lift.  We can't help everyone because we never have enough money or volunteers, but we do what we can. We have brought on some new board members and officers and are refocusing on strategic planning and fundraising so we can better support our community of patients and advocate with more direction, train more doctors and nurses, and do all the things we've wanted to do. With luck and help, we'll be able to serve our patients even better in the future!

I was alone and in need of information and Pandora was there providing information (and hope) not available elsewhere. This non-profit is  at the forefront of research....but also an organization that is there for the individual. I don't know what I would have done had I not found them. These illnesses are scary....but Pandora is there to hold your hand and help.

They offered support and guidance when all seemed lost.  A family member was hospitalized and our rights were being violated.  There was internal chaos within the hospital over our case.  PANDORA was there with us, step by step, sorting out the steps, and with PANDORA' s help and our insurance company, we were able to have the strength to leave the hospital AMA and get the second opinion we needed, which was drastically different from the first.  They also sent us a gas card to help with travel cost.The passion and compassion that drives the volunteer members is amazing.  They understand the needs of people who have NEIDS.  They change words into action for what is needed most to help a person overcome rough spots.
Pandora Org	267144	2	/users/profile/355895	Writer	Donor	5	10/25/2015	PANDORA is a terrific non profit resource for patients who are severely ill. Because our illness is not main stream in public or medicine even with the support of the IOM report and others. House and bedbound patients are reliant on a a great neuro-endocrine-immune NP for resources. These are resources we either can't physical acquire due to severe illness or don't have the resources PANDORA can provide. A great NP resource for caregivers and really sick patients. I have found Doctor referrals, wheelchair recommendations, any many other support I just wouldn't have the energy to find. Most of all PANDORA's board understand what I am going through even more than my own family members. A must have!!!
Pandora Org	261361	2	/users/profile/179195	Teresa16	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	Pandora Org has been so very beneficial to me in many ways.    I have received much information that I could pass on to my physicians to aid in my care of Fibromyalgia.   Those of us who suffer with Fibromyalgia and ME cannot just exercise nor get up and be physically active like others can.   With the aid of Pandora Org, I was given info for my doctor to help him understand why patients with Neuroendocrine Immune Disorders need to rest and do things at a slower pace.   Pandora Org even has brochures describing NEIDS and proper patient care for physicians who just cannot understand their role in helping patient needs.    Pandora Org representatives also attend government meetings concerning patients with NEIDS to give real patient testimony to what works and what does not. Pandora Org uses the information given freely by the patients and people whom it works with and not something contrived like some other places do.   Pandora Org really cares about REAL people as evidenced by the many programs that it has such as 'Covered With Love', 'Mom's Meals' and others that assist patients who do not have the resources to help themselves.  Pandora Org is there for it's patients and for their families and those that love them.
Pandora Org	222529	5	/users/profile/179195	Teresa16	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	When I first became ill, I really had nowhere to go for information.   Then I was directed to PANDORA ORG.  The information is up-to-date and very informative about my own illness as well as many other neuroendocrineimmune disorders.   This organization sends people to CDC meetings and FDA meetings as well as other venues where more support and help is needed to keep these organizations aware of patient's needs.   The patient is kept well informed of what progress is made as far as government research and physician education is concerned.    Pandora Org is all volunteers so there is no worry of funds being misdirected or misused.   Every thing is for the patient.   Their website shows just hard they work and there is so much information there.   Patients can ask questions and are given up to the minute information and support.   The voice of the patient is heard and conveyed to the government powers that be.Pandora Org started out small, but has grown to a national level with members all over the U.S.   Even people in other countries can come onto the website or Facebook page to offer support or ideas and collect the same.Pandora Org offers HOPE!
Pandora Org	133471	6	/users/profile/179195	Teresa16	Board Member	5	11/04/2012	P.A.N.D.O.R.A. started with just one person who needed information about M.E. and not finding what she needed, she did research. This research led to more information being able to be shared by others with this disorder.   Then it grew and grew to what it is today.  There are so many of us with these devastating neurological disorders and illnesses who are in terrible pain who now come to this group for help.   P.A.N.D.O.R.A. now has the ability to help so many people with many different neuro disorders around the United States.   This shows us that not only can we all help others but just look what one person can do!

Pandora Org	260996	3	/users/profile/74546	mariemicheles	Donor	5	10/02/2015	As a person who served on Pandora Org.'s board of directors in the past I can attest to what drives this organization.  It is deep concern for patients who all across the country are regularly faced with seemingly impossible problems in their daily lives due to having little understood and often invisible diseases or conditions Pandora Org. works behind the scenes to try to get much needed education programs up and running. They also work with medical centers that develop an interest in opening specialty clinics with the hope that more medical doctors and nurses will continue learning about and providing informed, proper medical care for the millions who suffer from nuero/endocrine/immune diseases. The negative comments left for this organization came about due to a disagreement about an advocacy issue.  Reading through those reviews it could appear as if Pandora Org. did something self serving and wrong.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There are more patients who applauded Pandora Org. for their stand on an issue involving the IOM than the negative reviewers claim.  The fact that some did not agree with the decision in no way means Pandora is self serving, works against patients or that their board members benefit in some personal way etc..  It actually shows that the organization is able to stand up and do what they feel is best for patients after reviewing all the facts of an issue. There is never total support for any one idea in the work of advocacy.  The heart and soul of this organization is a woman named Lori Kroger. I have personally worked with her and I can attest to her honesty, dedication to the patient community and to the fact that neither she, nor any board member personally profits from serving on the board. All board members are volunteers.  Most who serve on the board of directors are sick themselves  They pour out what little energy they may have regularly on behalf of the patient population.  That is honorable and should be praised. It is easy to cast stones, make accusations and sully someone's good reputation.  Neither Pandora Org. or it's board members deserve anything but praise for the excellent work they do, the comfort they give and the sleepless nights many of them spend listening to and being concerned over different situations that patients are struggling with. I am no longer a board member but I think my best endorsement is that I donate to this organization financially and trust them implicitly.  I have had the pleasure of an inside view to how this organization operates and how it's members behave. I have also seen first hand the help behind the scenes that Pandora Org. offers.  I would recommend you study this organization and support it either financially or by becoming a volunteer.

This is an invaluable resource for people in the ME/CFS patient group.  I am so thankful for Pandora Org!!

Pandora Org	229100	4	/users/profile/292759	DavidSpangler	Client Served	1	10/28/2014	Pandora Org does real harm to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis patients by pretending to be a national organization and helping their friends in government agencies.  Right now they are helping the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Dept. of Health and Human Services, redefine ME so it will require treatment by psychs.  In addition, Pandora Org told NIH that they should require even severely affected ME patients to exercise.  This is ludicrous!  Exercise is very harmful for ME patients and frequently causes them to be bedbound for weeks or months after exercise.  It would be better for ME patients if Pandora just went back to doing whatever it does for its Michigan members instead of hurting ME patients all over the country.
Pandora Org	228260	3	/users/profile/107095	Lucy	Client Served	1	10/28/2014	Really, I am a CLIENT NOT SERVED. PANDORA ORG is not helpful to actual patients. They have proven again and again that they do not care about the people suffering with the illness. They should just disappear and stop torturing patients.  I can't begin to describe how much trouble their incorrect information given to my doctor has caused me.  They recommend exercise be required even of sufferers with very severe M.E.  I have personally tried their recommendation for exercise--increasing amounts of exercise supposedly to build up ability to exercise--and it causes me to crash so I cannot get out of bed for weeks.  These people are not helping patients.  They are harming patients.

Pandora Org	227370	4	/users/profile/291098	BarbaraJ50	General Member of the Public	1	10/27/2014	Pandora Org proclaim to be advocates but they are not. Advocates fight for the people they serve. Pandora are only concerned with their own bottom line. Patients need to ask what have they done for you? Nothing except help implement an illness name that is totally meaningless. And they went against patients requests for them to object to a redefining of the illness ME which already had a definition. They have helped assure that ME will be forever cast as a non-illness and that biomedical research will never again exist. They are not advocates, they are running the business of non-profit which caters to the government interests. Meaning no research dollars will go for the biomedical cause again.  Only CBT/ GET and antidepressant which make the illness worse.

This is not true.  They only give quilts to people in Michigan and sometimes they give out donated gas cards to people who are active on their facebook page.  That's it.  That's what they do.  They only do things for a very small number of their friends and they do nothing to help the millions of people lying in beds with chronic illnesses.  They are a phony organization and they lie.

We are now into the IOM-P2P farce that has been orchestrated -- within its set-up rules and parameters, to harm ME/CFS patients further. The ME/CFS Experts and Researchers called for the STOP of the IOM contract--yet PANDORA, claiming to represent patients, did NOT back the ME/CFS Experts and Researchers. PANDORA is not serving in the best interests of patients -- PANDORA along with CFIDS / CAA /SMCI are out for their own interests in lining up with NIH--CDC--IOM.  The IOM and P2P = HARM to the patient community.   This was fully recognized by the ME/CFS Experts and Researchers. Now, it is four years later from these comments--many patients are seeing the truth about what PANDORA stands for and what it does not.

After much speculation last week by patients on the position of PANDORA on the IOM contract and silence for days, PANDORA went into full-blown damage-control mode on October 14, 2013. It finally released an official statement on the IOM contract (position paper). In it, PANDORA concedes that it turn[ed] in a list of expert nominations. Even though we pretty much knew, from the information that leaked last week, that this was going on, many patients hearts sank."

These illnesses include ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, Multiple Chemical Sensitivites, Gulf War Syndrome, and persistent Lyme disease. The organization serves as an advocate for those suffering from these illnesses by helping shape public policy and supporting education and research. They are currently working toward the establishment of a clinical and research facility in New Jersey, the NEI Center. Their ability to bring people from different groups together has been impressive. Although they are a small organization, they were successful in getting other groups to vote for them in the recent Community Chase Giving Contest and won $20,000. The prize winnings will go largely toward the NEI Center. Their motto is: "ONE VOICE, ONE COMMUNITY, ONE CAUSE." Their dedication, enthusiasm, and "I Can!" mentality inspires everyone and gives hope that we will find ways to alleviate the suffering of those with NEI illnesses.!

Not only do they do a ton of good work; helping spread awareness, advocacy, education, supporting patients in various ways, promoting research, etc, etc, but by doing so, they also bring so much hope to a very under served patient population.  When one is as sick as many of us are, and there are so few that even try to understand, let alone actually help, and so little good research for treatments and cures, etc, knowing that there is a group that truly cares is HUGE.  Many in this patient population wind up committing suicide, because we are so sick, and have so little hope for good treatments, and so little validation.  The impact of the hope for a better future that PANDORA gives us cannot be overstated, nor can the understanding and caring that they show over and over to so many patients.

Giving attention to medical,social,emotional and political needs of persons with neuro-endocrine-immune disorders. Making efforts to unify to community of patients for the betterment of all. I know for me personally at about the 3rd yr after being diagnosed and very discouraged (now @10yrs ) I found a P.A.N.D.O.R.A support group that had such a positive aura it helped me tremendously. I was motivated to become a volunteer and work on projects.It gave me a much needed outlet. Unfortunately my condition has deteriorated that I'm not able to participate as before, however I still support P.A.N.DO.R.A. in anyway I can and continue to get support from them by being able to stay current and knowing they are doing the best they can for for persons like M.E.

Pandora Org	163538	5	/users/profile/217160	LD Advocate	Advisor	5	07/25/2013	In 2007, I first met members of PANDORA and its founder Marly Silverman in person at a conference in Fort Lauderdale.  As founder/president of the LIFELYME Foundation, Inc., I established our organization to serve as a educational resource for Lyme disease and other Neuro Immune Disorders.  In 2008, two members of PANDORA were invited to speak at a conference our organization co-sponsored with the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg, FL.  The conference was called, "Similarities and Paradoxes in Chronic Illnesses".  Our intention was to bring together for the first time the top physicians and researchers with expertise on illnesses under the NEI umbrella to share their expertise on CFS/ME, Fibromyalgia, Lyme Disease, Gulf War Syndrome and Environmental Illnesses. Speakers Included: Brian Fallon MD, Nancy Klimas MD, Charles Ray Jones MD, JJemsek, MD,  Leslie Fein MD, Dr. Kenneth Friedman Ph.D, and Kerry Clark Ph.D. Epidemiologist. In the following year, LIFELYME partnered with PANDORA  to establish a NEI Center in New Jersey.  A 'Resolution' to establish a NEI Center in NJ was passed unanimously.  Hopefully in the future progress will be revitalized and make this dream a reality.   Support is paramount to the success of the future visions of PANDORA.  The members of PANDORA are giving their all in this effort to provide awareness, education, research and patient care for all patients suffering with these illnesses. Support PANDORA - The health of all Americans in the future depends on everyone's support.
Pandora Org	163476	5	/users/profile/117975	MEandmyShadow	Volunteer	5	07/24/2013	When I first became ill with this devastating disease, the first information I took seriously was a few websites that had "Memorial Lists" of people who suffered greatly before their disease overcame them.  However,  P.A.N.D.O.R.A was the first Patient Centered Organization that I could trust for accurate, and hopeful education regarding my disease day by day.  There was much support for me at all stages of my deteriorating health.  As time went on, I was better informed to focus on all the ways my Quality of Life can be improved.  This is a very frustrating illness to get medical care for, but with the help of P.A.N.D.O.R.A's long suffering expertise, I have grown immensely in understanding how my life can be stronger on a daily basis.   I have learned to be an advocate for myself and others thanks to Lori and Marly.  I enjoy any opportunity to interact with the staff and Leadership of P.A.N.D.O.R.A.   I believe with the coaching, advocacy, education opportunities and my own personal, individual assistance, my life has been greatly improved in spite of the illness.

It is outstanding. The information it disseminates to the patient community is stellar and plentiful, to the point it can even be overwhelming. I met Tina Tidmore at the 2012 FDA Ampligen meeting and hope to get in touch with her tonight or sometime soon. I found out about a discount lab for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. I am going to call PANDORA for more information. I met another lady at the 2013 April FDA meeting who represented PANDORA and she was wonderful to talk to as well.

With a lot of hard work, the organization has grown from a local, statewide organization into a national presence.  Although the organization represents and speaks on the behalf of other illnesses, P.A.N.D.O.R.A's focus on patient advocacy for chronic fatigue syndrome patients is unique.  There is currently no other organization that advocates for the million or more patients with this illness at the national level.  Advocacy for patients with this illness at the national level is of paramount importance as the federal government and the medical profession have ignored these patients and challenged the patients' belief that their belief is "real."  Without P.A.N.D.OR.A. advocacy at the national level, there is little if any hope for these patients leaving them to suffer untreated or kill themselves.

This organization does many amazing things for the very sick with neurological, endocrine and immune system diseases and disorders. To my knowledge there is NOT another organization that is helping all of these very sick people in so many areas. The head of PANDORA, Marla Silverman, is a CFS sick person who knocks herself out daily trying to do what is best for the entire community as well as individuals in desperate need. PANDORA has provided the infrastrcutre (financing through PANFORA) for a new "Democratic Advocacy" for those with ME/CFS. This group is called ME/CFS Worldwide Patient Alliance. I am a volunteer in this group and we have raised money to get a 1/2 page AD in the Washington Post alerting the US and international public about ME/CFS and the newly discovered and infectious third human retrovirus. In four short months, this advocacy group has over 1,600 members and has raised over $10K. This is an amazing achievement. Ms. Silverman came up with the idea of a patient-driven/patient run advocacy and it has worked. It was what the very sick wanted: to have their voices heard by the governments and the public. PANFORA and Marla Silverman have had an enormous and critical impact on the neruoendocrineimmune sick. PANDORA and Marla Silverman are well known and highly respected in the communities they work within. There is no negative comments or changes that need to be made. PANDORA is a model for what a non-profit SHOULD be doing.

I had the most wonderful doctor (very unusual for patients of ME/CFS) since I was 24 years old. At age 33 my life would stop as I knew it. Similar onsets from so many with chronic fatigue syndrome.  I was so very fortunate that my GP had the knowledge and empathy to help me deal with this devastating disease for 17 years. Sadly he became ill himself and had to retire. Thank God for P.A.N.D.O.R.A.!! They keep very accurate, current, and appropriate listings for specialists to treat all of my symptoms.  I went through 2 months of pure hell feeling like a lone survivor on an island with no help. My doctor that had taken over for my prior doctor didn't have a clue how to treat cfs properly. I was very very scared. I couldn't believe that in 2010 there was so little correct information coming out of the mouth of my new provider! This is why P.A.N.D.O.R.A. became a saving grace. The information they provide, the accuracy and educational guides are so needed by our very ill community. Please choose them and help them get the correct knowledge out for physicians and patients alike. We are suffering and they are comforting!

For what ever reason the government agencies have, on the whole, been dismissive of this illness since 1970.  PANDORA seems willing to stand up to these agencies in a way that our other national group has not.  In some instances they can be a little heavy handed but considering how lax the other national org has been, that might be a good thing.  They will have to recognize that people must be allowed to choose what their own paths will be; but this problem could be due to the youth of the organization.

My family has been affected with numerous NEI illnesses.  Its important to me and my family that  P.A.N.D.O.R.A. gets the support it deserves.Marly Silverman, founder of P.A.N.D.O.R.A. is the most committed NEI advocate Ive ever met.  I finally met her for the first time in Washington, DC at the October 2010 CFSAC Committee Meeting.  Her work to create the NEI Center in NJ is inspiring.  She has been instrumental in the returning of Ryan Baldwin home and helping his family raise money for the enormous legal and medical bills. P.A.N.D.O.R.A. has created the MCWPA (ME/CFS Worldwide Patient Alliance), which is a volunteer patient organization,  primarily aimed at raising funds for a major ad campaign. I am personally grateful for the service P.A.N.D.O.R.A. provides.

Everyone at Pandora are dedicated, caring and professional individuals who are fighting hard to bring recognition to very misunderstood illnesses. They are always happy to reach out to anyone in need and work with any organization that helps people with Neuroendocrine-Neuroimmune illnesses. 
Pandora Org	56098	1	/users/profile/58382	Pat Mayer	Client Served	5	10/31/2010	I met Marla Silverman, the founder of PANDORA many years ago. She has dedicated her life to us, the patients with neuroendocrine-immune diseases.This organization has helped me in so many ways. To know that there is a team of people getting together grassroot efforts to advocate on our behalf is such a comfort. They are fighting for our rights and making doctors and the government aware of our plight. They also are constantly educating people as to the quality of our lives in order to improve them. I would love to be out there marching along with them, but I am too sick. I love that I can watch them march for me, usually even designating a chair or a placard for those of us who can't be there. Also, in the almost 20 years I have been ill, the workshops and support groups that PANDORA has sponsored, have pulled me through some extremely difficult times.PANDORA has served our NEIDS community and me in more ways than I can say. It is a wonderful organization and deserves your consideration. Thank you.
Pandora Org	56089	1	/users/profile/58374	centralfleds	Volunteer	4	10/31/2010	It's not hard to describe the comfort, love and understanding this organization gives to so many as support. "PANDORA" rises above all the rest. I'm an Advocate Extrodinaire and proud to be part of PANDORA and their mission. As a patient "52" years of age with a condition called "EHLERS DANLOS SYNDROME" it falls under other related disorders. Not knowing what I had until the age of 48 - the loss of my home,job,husband and eventually benefits. No one believing in me was an emotional and physical struggle I wish on no one. Yes diagnosed at 48 and born with the condition. Pandora and it's staff/volunteers supported me and still do to this day with e mails and phone calls from time to time. If I ever need to reach out they are there to listen and have BIG shoulders. Being single is something I've accepted as some see us in public as defected. We are not - my companion dog "Stitch" helps me with company. Marly - founder is a beautiful person and deserves to shine above being noticed for her efforts. I sincerely hope that one day people in public will not judge for looking healthy and patients being so sick.  It will be a great mission to get our court system and government to believe in people like me that look healthy and are so ill. It may be hard to understand but God created us all equal as his children just some he made a little more special.  For me life now has no boundries and challenges for I can! I can do anything for I believe in myself because of foundations like PANDORA that have given me the hope, dreams and possibilities we all can!  Any one person that may feel alone and lost when it comes to ME/CF/FM I sincerely hope you will take the time to join in the efforts TOGETHER WE CAN. THANK YOU PANDORA - centralfleds@gmail.com     
Pandora Org	56054	1	/users/profile/58339	Charlotte	Volunteer	5	10/31/2010	I have had ME/CFS, a neuroendocrineimmune disorder, since 1990.  The disease has left me unable to do much, but I continue to try to advocate for greater recognition and funding of NEI disorders such as mine.  Over the years, I have seen many advocacy organization come and go.  Others have lost touch with the patients they purport to represent.  I was thrilled when I first came across P.A.N.D.O.R.A. because this is an organization with staying power.  P.A.N.D.O.R.A. listens, considers, and carefully crafts messages to increase recognition and funding for NEI disorders.  I am particularly impressed with the way it fosters collaboration among diverse patient advocacy groups.  The result of this are strong messages with mass support behind them.  I have worked on projects with P.A.N.D.O.R.A. and have seen the difference in government response due to the way it functions.  P.A.N.D.O.R.A., in my opinion, will only grow in strength and influence because of the caring, sharing, coalition-building organization it is.  And it is desperately needed!
Pandora Org	260484	8	/users/profile/225763	Donna N.,	Client Served	5	09/30/2015	I have tears in my eyes when I try to describe what PANDORA has done for me.  They offered support and guidance when all seemed lost.  A family member was hospitalized and our rights were being violated.  There was internal chaos within the hospital over our case.  PANDORA was there with us, step by step, sorting out the steps, and with PANDORA' s help and our insurance company, we were able to have the strength to leave the hospital AMA and get the second opinion we needed, which was drastically different from the first.  They also sent us a gas card to help with travel cost.The passion and compassion that drives the volunteer members is amazing.  They understand the needs of people who have NEIDS.  They change words into action for what is needed most to help a person overcome rough spots.
Pandora Org	56050	1	/users/profile/58333	Andrew	Donor	5	10/31/2010	NEI disease is mostly ignored and misunderstood. Most doctors know little or nothing about NEI disease, and there is no reliable treatment.  I can no longer work because of NEI disease. Before NEI disease forced me to stop working, I was a Senior Administrative Analyst. Part of my work was to pick companies to work for us as on specific projects. P.A.N.D.O.R.A. impresses me so much I don't hesitate to recommend them. For example, they spearheaded an effort which led to the State of New Jersey approving the building and funding of a a NEI research and treatment center.  This is exactly the kind of result we need if we want find a cure.

She had to give up in order to get an inadequate settlement.You can not fight a war with the walking wounded. You have to organize financially and politically and push for decades to get the awareness and funding for the research necessary to solve the problem. Patient advocacy groups link patients to the effort to do this. Join PANDORA and other groups and do your part.

Pandora Org	55943	1	/users/profile/58205	BeeBee	Client Served	5	10/29/2010	I was blessed to find PANDORA through the CFSAC online.  I immediately began to think how very fortunate I was to have found such a rock solid website.  There has been no limit to the massive amounts of knowledge I have gained regarding NEI patients.  Having access to meetings attended by highly learned physicians and researchers in order to provide us with up to the minute news on the progress being made in these fields is a Godsend for me.  Keeping patients alerted to the scientific gains as well as donating our own feedback is surreal.  It's taken some years for those fighting for us at the top of the field to at last reach this point of having something to work with.  I have learned more about my body in the 6plus years I have been sick thanks to PANDORA.  Marly and Robert Silverman are such awesome advocates on our behalf, never leaving out details.  Everything that comes across my email screen regarding my illness brings me a bit closer to understanding the complexity of it.  
Pandora Org	55931	1	/users/profile/58196	pamrpn	Client Served	5	10/29/2010	We have had CFIDS in our family for 14 years now.  When we first got sick, few people had heard of our illness, and fewer people could act as guides for what we were experiencing.  When we could not find an informed doctor to help us, online we found an educational conference, for which PANDORA was a sponsoring organizer.  At that conference, we finally - and for the first time -  met others in our own situation.  We were especially thrilled to meet doctors who not only treat patients, but who participate in research and know the cutting edge science of our illness.  The conference, and the ongoing online support we've found through Pandora,  changed our lives.  We no longer feel alone, and believe me - it's a big and lonely world out there when you are sick and isolated, like we were before finding Pandora.  They educate the public and medical personnel, and are an important and worthwhile cause for anyone looking for a good place for their donations!

I live in Oklahoma City and there is very little support here for patients with chronic pain issues.  Unfortunately that also means there is very little education regarding chronic pain issues.P.A.N.D.O.R.A. stives to both serve the individual and to educate the public.  This is essential to both treatment and to finding cures for the various diseases which cause serious pain.  Their work has been invaluable in revealing to the public eye, the seriousness of the issues.  Without non-profits such as P.A.N.D.O.R.A, there would be no education, no medications advocated for and no cures!  Please support P.A.N.D.O.R.A. in any way possible in the future - help them as they have helped me!!

MLDA is a source of valuable information about doctors and also about the illness. I have referred MLDA to many people I know in order for them to get educated and diagnosed and ultimately treated for this disease. MLDA put on a conference last fall that had information for doctors as well as patients. It was a day long seminar with speakers from across the nation that provided excellent information related to testing, research and treatment.

However it came back about 4-5 years ago. In googling it I found the MLDA and allied. The president directed me to a LLMD (which I had no clue what that meant then). They also sent me a lot of information on LD and answered a lot of questions. I was also given a list of names I could contact for support sand eventually started a support group in my area. I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the MLDA. They supported me at my lowest points and ow I'm able to give back. They also have an e mail support for those that prefer that way as well as many FB groups on Lyme Disease. It's great getting new info and communicate with someone who understands what I'm going through. I will forever be grateful for this non profit organization

I have learned more about Lyme and received so much support from everyone involved in this charity.  It is non profit and while so many of the individual board members have Lyme Disease and are therefore often sick, they put a lot of effort into helping others and are a wonderful source of support.  They are very involved in all research and extremely knowledgeable in the various treatment options.  They advocate on behalf of anyone that needs help.  They are very involved in trying to keep the publice aware of what parts of the state of Michigan are at highest risk for places where the disease is showing up the highest.  This is not to deter people from going to these parts but so they know to make sure they protect themselves if they are going to be outside in those locations.  I can't say thank you enough to the board and all volunteers who are there to listen and help in any way possible.

I started volunteering early on.  I am the secretary and the person who sends out all the information to those who ask.  Over the last 21 years I have sent out tens ofthousands of pieces of literature.  We do not charge for any of it.  We pay for all the printing and postage  ourselves.  I am mostly homebound  now but still send out information and do what I can..

With help from Michigan Lyme   Association  I found a doctor  who knows how to treat Lyme right in Michigan. Without their info I would still be searching...and sicker.  I can't thank them enough and finally feel like I am on the road to recovery.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	208018	1	/users/profile/270707	tbdbullseye	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	The Michigan Lyme Disease Association has maintained excellence in public education, support, andadvocacy in a very caring and professional way for many years.  Education for the public as well as Lyme disease patients, support groups and individual support for patients, interesting and entertaining annual events to raise funds for the organization, sponsoring conferences, appeals to the state government for decent recognition of Lyme disease as well as education and care - these are only a part of what MLDA does.  And the MLDA newsletter and the website are both very carefully organized and information is always thoroughly documented.   As a neighbor, in Ohio, who has spent years trying to do just a few of the same things MLDA does, I really know what it takes to organize and maintain such an organization that makes such a huge difference for people who are suffering.  I am in awe of the MLDA.
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	207880	1	/users/profile/217187	aazsa5	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2014	The Michigan Lyme Disease Assoc. (MLDA) is one of THE most helpful, knowledgeable, and compassionate organizations around.  Our stories seem all to familiar.  Countless Dr. Visits, years of being told there's not a thing wrong with you as you continue to deteriorate.  This organization knows your story all to well.  They are able to educate you on different treatments.   The best thing... they are working overtime to educate those Doctors who have turned us away one to many times!  I am so Blessed to have the MLDA a part of my life in fighting this disease!
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	163552	1	/users/profile/217187	aazsa5	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2013	I think all these 5 stars speak for themselves!  I have never met an organization so kind and so well informed.  If you have never suffered with Lyme's or do not know anyone it is a very scary disease to have.  It attacks each person differently and therefore your symptoms may differ from the next person. MLDA has been a blessing!  From the simplest to the most difficult questions they always help in any way they can.  It doesn't matter if your a member or not.  They want to help everyone have a decent quality of life.   The MLDA far exceeds the 5 stars!   Thank you for all your help this past year! God Bless, Beth

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44288	1	/users/profile/45198	avalynn	General Member of the Public	5	06/17/2010	As a parent of three children with Lyme Disease, I was at a complete loss of how to deal with this all encompassing non-understood illness.  With the mis-information that is generally put out to the public about this illness, MLDA helped give me the honest information I needed to know about the illness and the support  to help my children in their continued journey to wellness.  The MLDA is also involved in physician education, which is a necessity regarding Lyme Disease.

A five star rating is just the start for those who have struggled with this debilitating disease!  This organization not only is a wealth of support for Lyme disease victims, but the educational literature, prevention awareness, forums, and conferences have been valuable to the medical profession along with everyone who enjoys the great outdoors in our beautiful state.  For some, the journey with this disease is ongoing, and the encouragement and support from the MLDA through support groups, e-mails, on-line support, etc. cannot be surpassed.  Thank you, MLDA members, for your labor of love and all that you do.  My life will never be the same because of all your encouragement and support over the years.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44174	1	/users/profile/45095	susie-4750	Volunteer	5	06/16/2010	My teaching profession took a major turn in 1994 when a minute tick, embedded in my chin, was removed.  Life changed from that moment on. . .I saw 13 different doctors for various symptoms that changed almost daily, spent days lying on the couch that seemed like an eternity as no professional could diagnose what this "illness" was.  The fourteenth doctor tested me for Lyme Disease which had positive results, and the treatments began. Symptoms became much worse than prior with the toxin die offs, etc. Who was out there that I could talk to, not knowing day to day if my life was going to soon be over? After ordering a book from a local bookstore, (nothing abailable in local libraries on Lyme) I discovered a support group about 30 miles from my home.  Thanks to the MLDA and this group which was just being started in Michigan, I once again had hope and was encouraged, educated, and uplifted.  Going through this valley without support would have been unbearable.  Thanks to my good health at this tine, it is time to "give back" and assist the MLDA in educating and supporting those who are newly diagnosed, etc.  What a life-line the MLDA has been in our state. The positive comments from hundreds/possibly thousands regarding the well-planned professional conferences, literature available to anyone, test kits, newsletters, etc. have saved many from ever going down the path that I did. MLDA - a ten in my eyes!!!!

I have also found a group of very kind members who are ready to lend a helping hand, an eager ear, or a shoulder on which to cry.  Annual fundraisers help defer some of the costs of meeting its goals.  Monthly support group meetings are open to anyone who wants to attend. Newsletters are sent out once or twice a year.  There is also a Yahoo! support group.  Informational booths are set up by the MLDA at various events throughout the year (such as dog shows).  The MLDA also sends out literature to medical professionals and participates in educational conferences so as to better inform doctors, nurses, etc on how to diagnose and treat Lyme disease.

I was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease after suffering for over a year with incorrect diagnoses.  Feeling overwhelmed by the diagnosis and prognosis, I turned to the Michigan Lyme Disease Association.  Not only is it a valuable resource when it comes to understanding Lyme disease and its co-infections, but it provides up-to-date news blasts about research and treatment.  The on-line Yahoo! group provides an easy way to connect with others who suffer in the same way that I do.  Members of the Yahoo! group share their experiences, their treatment protocols, their prayers, and emotional support.  Lyme disease is insidious and scary.  The Michigan Lyme Disease Association helps to de-mystify this horrendous affliction.  The MLDA also organizes informational forums and area support group meetings.  At these meetings, those who suffer from Lyme are able to listen to experts on treatment, nutrition, lifestyle, etc. and are also given time to share.  Life is tough when one has Lyme disease. MLDA makes it easier to live with the challenges a Lyme sufferer faces.

My tests kept coming back as negative however my blood results were a complete mess. I went to college for a couple yrs while ill trying to finish my teaching degree. The road since that day began has been a complete & utter nightmare that still haunts me to this day. When u r active & outgoing then u transform into something u r not.  A very long journy until finally Spring 2010 i finally was positive for both. It was a lot to take it.....i then contacted Linda & she saved me.

I was going through the loop of doctors to find out what was happening to me, because I felt, literally, like every system in my body was going crazy all at the same time.  I was getting test after test, but nobody could find anything wrong.  I'd even been told it "couldn't be lyme because we don't have that in Michigan...".  (Not only not true, but hey, it is possible that people do camp/hike OUTSIDE of Michigan, which was utterly dismissed.)They were so very helpful in helping me find a doctor to see if lyme disease was the cause of my problems, and so very kind in just listening to me.  I was having a very bad evening one day, feeling really very, very bad, and one of the ladies talked to me at 10 p.m. for about an hour and a half until I started to feel better.  In addition, they always call you back, which isn't something I can say for some other non-profits I've tried to volunteer for.Things are MUCH better now, and I know if it wasn't for this amazing group of people I'd still be getting bounced from doctor to doctor and getting the royal run-around.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	121224	1	/users/profile/164943	robintoad	Client Served	5	08/22/2012	When I first found out about the Michigan Lyme Disease Association I was in quite a bit of pain, suffering from 4 or 5 migraine headaches per week, and every doctor that I had seen was unable to find out what my problem was. I had already seen 19 doctors and 9 Specialists, spent thousands of dollars on medical testing, and the only thing the doctors all agreed on was that "something was wrong with my immune system".  I was depressed, and had been unable to keep any job due to my poor health. No job means no health insurance, no money, and ultimately - no medical help. One day, I was at an event where the MLDA had a booth set up, with photos of the Lyme disease rash, the tiny ticks, and other information. As soon as I saw the photos, I KNEW that I had Lyme disease. One of the people from the MLDA was at the booth, & she immediately came over to talk to me. It was such a relief to know that other people understood what I was going through, & that I really was ill and not just "making it up to get out of going to work". I have talked to some of the MLDA members by phone, and it is very comforting to know that they are there. I have also joined their Yahoo group, & I have learned excellent information from the group members. I am very thankful that they are here for us.

I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and associated co-infections in May 2010. Along with the diagnosis came confusion, controversy with my doctor and complex treatment regimens. I found Michigan Lyme Disease Association (MLDA) through a website search and immediately joined my community's chapter. My family members brought me and attended the meetings as well.  It was immediately apparent that I was among caring, compassionate and extremely knowledgeable people, specifically MLDA's president and our chapter's facilitator. Becoming a member of the organization has had a profound impact on my life, both physically and emotionally. The president's accessibility is beyond impressive as I feel comfortable calling her any time I need guidance in how to traverse through this world with Lyme disease. MLDA's positive impact reaches beyond those of us with Lyme disease; its mission encompasses awareness of this debilitating disease, de-mystifying misconceptions and involving Michigan's doctors in training to become Lyme literate. Endorsing the MIchigan Lyme Disease Association will help ensure that the residents of Michigan have access of cutting-edge research and daily living support. My family and I LOVE MLDA!

He was very sick and getting sicker by the day and after seeing many doctor's and many tests no one could find what was wrong. Linda took the time to talk to me and help us get some answers, directed us to a Dr that was finally able to test my son and help him. That was almost 2 years ago, and still struggling daily with Lyme and Co Infections, my son is at least doing better. And because of the help and the knowledge I have learned from the MLDA, I was able to see the signs and get my 5 year old son tested before he got very sick and found out he also has Lyme and now is being treated. If it wasn't for this group my 9 year old son would be at the point now where he could not function, before we got him treated he was getting to the point where he was unable to walk or think. It was the scariest time of my life. My husband and I owe everything to the MLDA, Linda and this group saved my son's life!  The knowlegde that I have learned from the MLDA has helped me, help other people in need also. I have been able to guide people that were sick with some of the same things and get them help along with being able to teach people who don't know anything about Lyme so they can protect themselves and their families.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	67232	1	/users/profile/73483	purdypa	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	The MLDA is a very important and worthwhile organization for individuals in Michigan.  This is the only organization that provides a source of valuable information and education to the public to make them aware of the issues with Lyme disease and other tick borne illnesses.  The organization works hard to get the word out to individuals, doctors, nurses, etc by sponsoring seminars, raising funds for research and holding support group meetings.  The MLDA also publishes a newsletter that contains valuable information on Lyme treatments and stories of many patients that have Lyme.

They go behind and over the call of duty in regards to helping people who have lyme disease and other tick borne illnesses. I found this organization within months of believing I may be suffering from lyme disease. I too have been down the road of the unknowing and undiagnoised. If it wasn't for the help and support of this organization I not sure where I would be today in regards to diagnoises and finding the right care. Thanks you MLAD
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	66764	1	/users/profile/72971	Sherri	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	 I have found this organization to be above board and always giving of the respect that Lyme Disease patients should receive. They have tirelessly helped these patients in all realms of their needs, with guidance, doctor referrals, pamphlets and even a phone number where more help can be received.  Thank you Michigan LDA, you have been a Godsend for those afflicted in your area of the Country.
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	66633	1	/users/profile/72828	Finette Lerman-Russak	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/11/2011	I have known Linda and Michigan LDA for almost all of my 21 years in Lyme Disease advocacy and patient education. I have the utmost respect for Linda and her group. They never succumbed to the sabotage, undermining or other political games played by far too many in Lyme advocacy. They are always honest, accountable and put the patients first. A model for any organization, they strive to not only educate and promote awareness among the public and patients, but also provide much needed support and education to the patients and caregivers directly.  Linda has never denied help to anyone, even if theyre from out of her state. She administrates with a goal of team effort and has mentored many in leading their own group. The only negative is that there arent enough groups like this in the  Lyme Disease Community
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	66322	1	/users/profile/72495	molly	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	Linda and other folks at the MLDA saved my sanity early on in my treatment.  I was lucky enough to have a neighbor familiar with the organization and give me the phone number during a time when I was very very ill.Over the years I have participated in MLDA support club meetings, Fundraisers and Educational Conferences.  And whenever I need help they are just a phone call away.I have referred many "Lymies" to this group.  Everyone is very helpful and the on-line support group can be a life saver.It's difficult to have any Chronic Illness - but when you have an illness that is misunderstood it's espeically traumatic.  The MLDA understands this as most (if not all) of the members have Lyme and related diseases.

I  have been living with chronic tick-borne diseases (including Lyme).  If it weren't for the continuous support of this organization, I doubt that I would be doing as well as I am today.  Although I am not from Michigan, the nation-wide, toll-free line is just a phone call away.     I can't recall how I was made aware of the Michigan Lyme Disease Association, but I consider myself a lucky person to have found this caring and dedicated group. Mimi

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44974	1	/users/profile/45878	kat5	Client Served	5	06/22/2010	At age seven, I watched my high-energy, loving, and creative mother become so ill that she wasn't able to do any of the things she used to do with me. One doctor after another sent her away with inconclusive results, sometimes even neglecting to be honest with her about the results of her Lyme Disease tests.  After a hospital stay and a few months of being terrified that I would lose my mother, she was finally diagnosed.  It was Lyme - a potentially incurable and controversial disease that was practically unheard of in our area at the time.  I am so thankful that she found the Michigan Lyme Disease Association.  When someone is diagnosed with a disease they know nothing about, a knowledgeable organization to provide education about the disease and its treatment, as well as an emotional support network is immeasurable.  The MLDA allowed my mother to find the best Lyme doctors in our area and educated her through the medical conferences and other resources it provided. She also found purpose by writing for the MLDA newsletter, which is distributed several times a year to keep its members informed. The MLDA is the only organization of its kind in our area, and provides support for so many people directly or indirectly affected by this disease. She may never be cured, but I have no doubt that if it weren't for the MLDA, she would not be where she is today. This is a GREAT organization!

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44928	1	/users/profile/45837	patty-with-lyme	Client Served	5	06/22/2010	My familys lives have been ravaged by Lyme Disease!  In 1991, my symptoms first appeared: tingly feet and hands, poor balance, dental problems, face dragged, left side of body very off and it felt like sand in my eye, etc.  I didnt have a family doctor and the immediate med doctor said an allergic reaction tries these pills.  No luck!  The next doc said "See a neurologist ASAP".   I didnt.  Instead, I began extensive research at the local library. (No internet back then!)  I concluded that I probably had multiple sclerosis and what I was experiencing was a flare-up.  Another flare-up would probably nail the diagnosis!  At that time there was not a good test for MS, nor treatment.  (I believe this is still true today!)The next year, the flare probably came, but I ignored it.  My vision went double for a few hours, but I pretended it happened because of new glasses.Soooooo in 1996, the BIG flare came.  If I looked at you, it looked like you were jumping up and down.  The neurologistI had evaded so diligently was now in front on me saying I had nystagumus due to multiple sclerosis. A MRI the next week nailed the MS diagnosis.  Lesions in my brain. (We later learned Lyme does this too.)So darn!  I figured I had guessed right, but my husband didnt give into the diagnosis and found a doctor that said get your silver fillings out of your mouth.  Silver fillings (amalgams) have a great deal of mercury in them which is very toxic to the body.   After the amalgams were drilled out (a real process!), I began chelation to rid my body of residual metal.  After just a few treatment, I was dying.  Seriously dying!  I could barely see, walk, talk, ect.!  (Oh, My!)  Luckily, my then 8th grade daughter found Dr. Lida Mattman on the internet and the article said MS was caused by a bacterial infection.  We had Dr. Mattman test my blood and the infection was called LYME DISEASE!We thought this was the end of the storyI would be okay and all would be well.  Nope!  Shortly after my Lyme diagnosis, our 5 year old Black Labrador Retriever began losing his hair, hiding behind chairs and having seizures! My husbands research pointed to Lyme.  We finally found a vet who prescribed antibiotics. Jets seizures stopped almost immediately, but he died a week later. He is my hero!  Because of what happened to Jet, my entire family was tested for Lyme Disease.  Our entire family has it!Today, June 25, 2010, we are all much, much better.  The Lyme is still with us and shows up in curious ways, but we have the tools to fight it.  Our present dogs are vaccinated against Lyme and one just turned 11 years old. The dog vaccine works. YEA!  During our many years of knowing we had Lyme and finding ways to combat it, Linda Lobes and the Michigan Lyme Disease Association has been there to help us.  Lyme can be a very lonely disease. Having people who have been there has helped immensely. Today, my husband and I pick up people almost daily because we think they could have Lyme Disease.  Most think we are nuts, but a few have listened, got help, and are getting better.  We see this as our way of giving back for the help we have been given.Thank you for reading this.
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44927	1	/users/profile/45838	ticktalk2	Former Volunteer	5	06/22/2010	Even after being a 'textbook' case of Lyme disease with positive test results and the hallmark bullseye rash 16 years ago, the specialists in Michigan still insisted I could not have Lyme disease! If it had not been for my local library and the information on our state organization, Michigan Lyme Disease Association, I fear to think where my life would be today!  This organization is comprised of volunteers who are compassionate, been where you are and are there to help you get better and get your life back!  I met Linda Lobes back when the only exposure doctors had about Lyme disease was a few minutes on the topic in medical school!  Now as President of the MLDA, Linda and the hard working Board has helped to turn around the perception and knowledge of Lyme disease in Michigan through reaching out not only to victims but to the doctors and working on projects in cooperation with our state health dept!  Linda has even reached beyond our state of Michigan to meet personally & share  with other organizations across the nation.   She & other volunteers have attended numerous medical conferences and hearings so that they could bring what they learned back to Michigan.  The compassion of Linda and the volunteers has also been a godsend to patients who have nowhere to turn because of the continued lack of knowledge by our health professionals.  Lyme awareness has definitely come a long way in sixteen years, owed to the hard work of grass roots organizations like the MLDA!  It is truly amazing that so much has been accomplished with these volunteers who get no financial compensation whatsoever,  using their own funds for travel and lodging just to get the job done!  Five stars to the MLDA!!!

I have appreciated the awareness and knowledge that has been shared about lyme.  Linda gave a lyme disease presentation to my outdoor club several months ago.  She shared a wealth of valuable information with us....and really opened our eyes to the terrible effects of the disease!  Kudos to all of her neverending efforts!
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44479	1	/users/profile/45374	mary37	Board Member	5	06/18/2010	I have been a board member for some time.  I initially attended meetings to have access to lyme information to distribute to my support group.  Now it is relatively easy to get information on the computer and through Michagan Lyme Support.  I've learned of these sites through the MLDA.  The MLDA does a valuable service by getting information out to the public about the disease and its treatment.  Linda is always available to answer question and to help people find a doctor to treat them.  The MLDA is a valuable resource in our state for getting information out to the public, health departments, and so many more.  Without the MLDA,lyme disease would still be in the dark ages.

No doctor could figure out what was wrong with me. I became very depressed and ready to take my own life.In 2005 I was told of Lymes Disease.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44339	1	/users/profile/45247	carrie5	Volunteer	5	06/17/2010	I have had Lyme Disease for 14 years, diagnosed for 13. With no help from the medical profession in the Grand Rapids area my parents and I looked to the MLDA for answers and help. The president, Linda, has been a God send to us helping with all of our questions answering phone calls and directing us to appropriate doctors where I finally received help. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for her and the staff. The MLDA offers so much information for those who are simply concerned or have been diagnosed and struggling.  Anytime I have questions I never hesitate to call because the MLDA is the best support you could ask for and has more knowledge than any other group I have worked with. I don't know where I would be with out the MLDA.

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44093	1	/users/profile/45015	lurvmom	Board Member	5	06/16/2010	I have been a Board Member for about 3 years now as I was so frustrated to find out a diagnosis for my "multi symptom illness".  I had the help of the MLDA to access a doctor after 16 years, there was a possibilty that I had Lyme.  I had the bulleye rash in 1983 following a camping trip to Nashville, Indiana.  At the time, I worked for 2 Surreons and they sent me to every Dermatologist in Genesee County.  From there, i was sent with my dogs to the Vet for the possibility of "ring worm".  Our Vet told me that was out of the question and whatever I had, please don't give it to the dogs as he would have no idea how to treat it.  The rash finally went away, but for the next 16 years I had severe arthritis pain, plantar faschitis, right hamstring pain, off and on again acute right sciatica and finally migraine headaches.  During this time, my family doctor did blood work testing for Lyme 3-4 times with only "iffy" results.  Finaally in 1999, 4 bands came back positive, the second time, for Lyme and I was started on antibiotics.  I then was put on a waiting list for a Doctor in Saginaw that treated Lyme.  After a couple months, I called MLDA, frustrated and crying as I felt I was at the end of my rope.  Through the last 10 + years, I have asked the President of MLDA, Linda, many questions that she has always had an answer for.  I have never called without receiving a return call.  MLDA helped me get in to see the Doctor in Saginaw and has helped me through many crisises in this period and that is why I went to an annual meeting out of curiosity apprx. 4 years ago.  One thing lead to another and I became a Board Member.  I do the best I can to help educate the public about Lyme and help out on as many educaational projects as I can.  At the present time, my Lyme is in the fibromylgia stage and I tire easily along with the constant pain.  Going to the monthly Board meetings gives me the support I need to keep sane.Thank you MLDASally Lurvey

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44068	1	/users/profile/44985	charlotte8	Client Served	5	06/16/2010	I was bit by a tick while mowing my lawn in the summer of 2006.  I became very ill, very quickly.  Even though I had all the symptoms of Lyme disease, my family doctor was reluctant to treat me for it because the rash was not a typical bullseye.  I was able to contact the Michigan Lyme Disease at it's toll free number and I spoke with the president, Linda, who gave me the name of a doctor who specialized in the treatment of Lyme.  The doctor and support groups formed by others with Lyme disease in my area helped me to get through 3 very long years of recovery.  Without them, I would still be very ill and very depressed.  I am feeling better now and am grateful for all that was done for me.  I now volunteer for The Michigan Lyme Disease Association when I can.  Thank you MLDA and everyone involved!

I kept getting worse. I stumbled upon information about Lyme disease and knew I might be on to something. I contacted the MLDA and was given a list of doctors in my area who could help. I also found out about a local MLDA support group that meets in my area once a month.I have been diagnosed with Lyme and am currently in treatment. I don't know what I would have done without the kind efforts of Linda and Sue. They talked me over a couple of humps and helped me to realize I am not alone in this battle. They give so much to other sufferers of this disease. I can't begin to thank this group enough. I also gain much info from the MLDA group emails. It's still a struggle for me. Someday I hope to be well enough myself to help others through this wonderful organization and to help inform the public about Lyme disease.
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	44016	1	/users/profile/44932	becky7	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2010	In June 2008 I found a small bull's eye rash on my leg.  Took a picture of it as I did with the bug bite reactions my kids have had from our own backyard in Canton, MI. I don't remember feeling like I had the flu but a short time later I started have bad pain in my left knee that spread to my right knee, my elbows, and shoulders that would move around and burned. Initially I was told I had a thyroid problem.  So I went along with that until I over several months I went through these symptoms: heart palps, not being able to breathe at night and pacing the floor, my brain would scream to shut out the noise, jaw and ear pain, not being able to focus on what people were saying or being able to stay focused on reading, ulcerated uvula, tightening in throat, completely exhausted, twitching/spasms on left side of face, etc.  So I began to do some research of my own online about my symptoms and thought maybe it might be lyme disease.  That's when I remembered the picture I took of the rash. I remember feeling stupid thinking that it might be lyme disease because I didn't think it could happen in lower Michigan.  I was afraid people would think I was a hypochondriac.  In my online research I came across the Michigan Lyme Disease Association website where I found contact information.  I emailed my digital photo I had of the rash and I think it was only a day or two before Connie Siese replied.  I had asked her if she thought this might be from a tick bite and if I should bother getting tested.  She was so kind and nonjudgemental in her response back to me and encouraged me to find a LLMD to get tested.  Her encouragement helped me overcome my fear of being labeled a hypochondriac and I did get tested.  I've been diagnosed and treated for Babesia.  Thank you to the MLDA for their encouragement and support through the yahoo chat and facebook too!

They helped in so many ways to get him back to the road of recovery.  As a mother it is so hard to see your child suffer.  The MLDA directed me to a doctor that helped him right away.  The MLDA provides information to many in the state of Michigan and gives them help in so many ways.  Just letting the general public about Lyme Disease and how to protect themselves is huge!

Michigan Lyme Disease Association	43461	1	/users/profile/44327	juliva	General Member of the Public	5	06/09/2010	I have been recently diagnosis with Lyme disease in 2010. In researching the internet I became so overwhelmed I felt hopeless and coping became difficult. I made a call to the MLDA and received direction and courage to deal with my disease. If it hadn't been for the angels voice (Linda)on the other end of the phone telling me You Can Do This I'm not sure what my state of mind would have turned into. Linda, not only talks the talk but walks the walk as she has dealt with Lyme disease herself. I can't think of a better person to be doing this job. She didn't even know who I was and yet spoke to me as though I was her closet friend. She's one special person.. One In A Million in my opinion! I don't know how she does it but she know when to Kick into action even with a stranger. Because of the MLDA my outlook in dealing with this disease has given me hope and the state of mind I need to recover fully! She is always there lifting others up with courage and wisdom when ever needed. MLDA goes beyond the call of duty in my opinion and for that I'm so very grateful they are there! Juli

I began my rounds with all the various doctors until 1986 when I received the news I had all the signs of classic MS. I lived with this 'cloud' hanging over me until 2005 when I was unable to spell my daugther's name on the tax forms.My husband began frantically contacting doctors, medical schools and researching the internet for answers. While online he found a tiny thread of information that eventually led him to the Michigan Lyme Disease Associastions and my lifeline. The MLDA helped me locate a wonderful lyme-literate doctor and provided me with a group of people that offered a wealth of knowledge from their own adventures with Lyne Disease.Without them, I honestly feel that this disease might have beat me into nothing.Thanks to the MLDA for my giving me my life back.
Michigan Lyme Disease Association	43371	1	/users/profile/44220	Sarah M.	Volunteer	5	06/09/2010	The Michigan Lyme Disease Association is an excellent organization and was a great resource for my family when my brother became ill. After a year with no diagnosis, it was my mom, not doctors that discovered it was Lyme disease. When my parents couldn't find a doctor in the area that would treat a child, the MLDA provided the name of a doctor.  The organization is lead by a woman who has Lyme, is an excellent advocate, and passionate about helping others.  The goal of the MLDA is to create awareness for Lyme, not only for the general public but the medical community. Because the disease mimics so many others and the medical community isn't as aware of it's presence, this organization is extremely important.  The MLDA provides newsletters that contain valuable information on Lyme treatments and share stories of people's battles with Lyme. They also put on several fundraisers each year, have support groups, and attend numerous events to generate awareness. The  MLDA has hosted several conferences in which they bring in a variety of speakers from the medical community as well as an attorney who speaks about the disability rights people with Lyme have.  These conferences have been very beneficial to me personally by helping me to understand all of the challenges my brother and those suffering with Lyme face.

This camp gives me and other kids (like me) the opportunity to meet other people who have had similar journeys. The slogan holds true, it really does allow kids with cancer to be kids again. Thank you Camp Quality
Camp Quality Michigan	311591		/users/profile/402954	michaly	Client Served	5	10/18/2016	Camp Quality has made a huge impact on my son David and our whole family. He was not able to do a lot during treatment due to his weak immune system. But Camp Quality made it possible for him to not only have fun but also meet amazing volunteers, and so many friends. He looks forward to camp every year and it is life changing. The volunteers pour so much love into the kids. They also have other events through the year for the whole family. They are a very loving, caring and dedicated group of volunteers and we love them!!!!!
Camp Quality Michigan	152818		/users/profile/11939	MHopkins	Volunteer	5	04/06/2013	Camp Quality Michigan has 2 camps (north camp and south camp) where kids with cancer can enjoy life, have fun and make lifelong friendships.  During the week long camp where they are paired with a companion they swim, dance, play archery, sing at camp fires, and so all kids of things without having to think about chemo, radiation and everything else that comes with it.   Their parents know they are safe and well cared for.  Being a companion changes your life, to see how the kids care for each other and the strength they have.  CQ is one big family.
Camp Quality Michigan	10077	6	/users/profile/11939	MHopkins	Volunteer	5	09/08/2009	Camp Quality Michigan is an awesome program. I first volunteered as a companion, along with my daughter, in August 2007. The impact on me as a person was tremendous and we have been companions each year afterwards. My family has heard so much about this group my niece volunteered this past year and my brother is planning for next year. To see these kids who have endured so much in their lives, more than any child should, enjoy themselves and have the opportunity to explore their own possibilities like other children is a heartwaring experience. The camaraderie and compassion these kids have towards one another is just one small benefit they receive by attending Camp Quality.  As a companion you are a matched up with a camper ( a child who has or has had cancer).  You are with that camper all week ensuring a safe funfilled experience.  The parents of these children can be assured their precious children will be safe and well cared for.  There are nurses and doctors on site 24/7.  Lifelong friendships between campers, campers and companions, and between companions are made at Camp Quality.  It is one of the BEST non-profit organizations.  The worst part of this non-profit is that it is not as well know as others. (e.g. United way) I would like to see more funding for this organization.  They are a great group of people working for a great group of kids.  It does not stop at camp either.  There is a puppet program and other support options for the child and their families.

Children with cancer find comfort and support among peers who understand their feelings, fears, and frustrations.Staff are there often because they too have experienced some of the same concerns personally through their own, or friends or family situations. I have heard teens discuss their therapies and illnesses among themselves-which they never could do freely elsewhere. There is no self pity-just determination!

That was a great shock and stress on him and on our whole family. Shortly thereafter we heard about a camp that Camp Quality provided for cancer patients. We signed our son and one of his sisters up to go. They had a blast. They made new friends, had a lot of fun, learned ne things, and most of all, in interacting with other cancer patients, were able to gain strength and hope concerning dealing with this new monster in their lives. The staff and volunteers have been wonderful. Camp Quality has also provided opportunities for our family to participate with our children in some quality events. Camp Quality does a quality job.

She absolutely LOVES the experience and has grown so much each time she attends for just one week.  She has made long lasting friendships with her companion, a volunteer.  She also has made a lifelong buddy with her roommate and her roommate's companion.  The opportunities that the kids at Camp Quality Michigan allow them to be kids first and foremost regardless of what cancer they had/have or where they are in treatment.  It's a way to connect and be a carefree kid having fun for one week each year.

My camper and I talk throughout the year by email so we can't keep in touch.
Camp Quality Michigan	11589	10	/users/profile/13533	earthmom45	Donor	5	09/30/2009	As a native Michiganian, I applaud this organization for their work.  Camping is great fun in our beautiful state, and I'm happy to help fund this experience for children (and their families) who are struggling with or have survived this terrible disease.
Camp Quality Michigan	11541	4	/users/profile/13482	EmilyZ	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I got involved with this organization by simply answering a newspaper ad.  I always loved going away to camp when I was younger, and there was an ad in the paper looking for volunteers to be camp counselors for one week during the summer.  I looked the organization up online and found out that I would be a one-on-one companion for a child that has or has had cancer. I thought this would be a fun week for me and a great way to reach out to a child.Little did I know, these children reached out to me.  Every child that came to camp changed my life.  To see these kids laughing and just "being kids" after everything they have gone through was great.  They taught me to fully cherish life and to be thankful for all of the positive things.  They taught me that if you concentrate on the hardships in life, you won't really live.  I hope I have been able to give these kids a little of what they have given me.  Camp Quality is the best organization I have ever been apart of.  This camp proves to the kids that they are not alone (many times you will catch kids comparing scars or treatments) and it lets them get away from it all and have a great time.  The kids can prove to themselves that they can do anything.  One little girl that had cancer in her leg climbed a rock wall.  One little girl that went blind from her cancer realized that she could do anything her peers can.  What this camp gives to kids is priceless.  They gain self-confidence, they don't feel "different" because they don't have hair, and they are all able to use each other and their companions as a support group.
Camp Quality Michigan	11469	9	/users/profile/13411	outdoorman	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	The 5 days at Camp Quality was an experience I will not forget. Make no mistake, it is a challenge to spend 24hrs. a day with a young person and keep them focused on all the activities and their medical requirements. However, seeing them laughing, running, playing jokes on you, and every once in a while opening up about their feelings made it all worthwhile. The courage of these kids is truly something to aspire to. I'm sincerely grateful for the time I spent at Camp Quality.
Camp Quality Michigan	11094	9	/users/profile/13034	megnees	Volunteer	5	09/27/2009	2009 was my second time volunteering at Camp Quality. To me, Camp Quality is something to look forward to. Campers get to look forward to this. Sometimes this is the only really big and awesome thing they get to do all year. Lifelong friendships are formed and every child is able to relate and have someone else that has shared their story. They come to camp and can be a normal, active kid. The slogan is 100 percent true. ("Letting kids with cancer be kids again") The week we spend with the campers is inspirational. As a companion, I feel as I get more from camp sometimes than a camper does. They build you up and inspire you as an adult, when its the campanion who is supposed to be doing that! The kids are amazing, and I will always remember every single one. They made an impact on me to want to keep coming and keep helping. Besides the inspirational factor, camp is also a blast! They get to do all sorts of awesome activities that keep you busy from sun up to after sun down! As having a crafy camper, the craft ladies are amazing. They have so many great ideas to keep us busy and so many choices of supplies! They are very helpful. Camp Quality is something I would like to always be involved with. It's a way to let a child who has gone through it all, be a kid again.

I was a "floater" which gave me the ability to get to know every aspect of the camp.  I filled in wherever necessary and whenever necessary.  I loved doing this.  (ie: companion fill in, running errands, cart driver, kitchen, nurses area etc.)  I have volunteered with some of their year round activities also.  The people are marvelous to work with and I am looking forward to next year.

I can honestly say that my time at camp has been life changing. Camp has taught me what really matters in life.. not the quantity of years that we are alive, but the QUALITY of life we LIVE. Camp Quality gives kids dealing with cancer a chance to be kids.. a chance to experience things they would otherwise miss out on because of their illness. It is truly a privilege to volunteer for this organization, and as long as my life allows, I will continue this commitment. They are my second family, need I say more? :)

Camp Quality Michigan was just awesome!!!  It is a wonderful camp that allows children of cancer to be with other children who are going through the same thing. This was the first time that my daughters had ever been to camp.  They loved it.  They talked about it for weeks.  How much they loved their companions, the food, the activities.  The experience they had there provided them with independence, self confidence, and memories that they will never forget.  One week after camp, they were already talking about attending next year's Camp Quality Michigan.  THANK YOU CAMP QUALITY MICHIGAN FOR A WONDERFUL SUMMER!!!

Camp Quality has been invaluable to both my son & me.  Their summer camp for cancer kids not only gives the kids a great experience, but provides respite for parents, knowing that our kids are OK w/proper medical oversight, while we get much-needed time to tend to other pressing matters (including an occassional nap!).
Camp Quality Michigan	10791	8	/users/profile/12689	grandpa ted 66	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Wow! What an experience to be able to be a worker at " Camp Quality ". I thought that maybe I could be of help in a small way to these kids. However they helped me to be a stronger person just by watching these kids to encourage each other. Some of the activites were very difficult for anyone to complete but watching these kids with cancer reaching the TOP was very rewarding to me and probably would surprise the Doctors and Parents of the cancer. I will be back next year to offer any help that is needed. Grandpa Ted

Camp Quality Michigan	10703	6	/users/profile/12601	cerquast	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	I started volunteering with Camp Quality Michigan in 2007 as a companion at South Camp. I immediately fell in love with the campers, families and staff. Last fall, I took on the position of Camper Recruitment Coordinator for the 2009 camp. I was able to connect with potential campers and their families, while spreading the word about CQ and all it has to offer (free of charge, of course!)Camp Quality is the perfect place for children with cancer to feel like a "normal child" again. They are surrounded by individuals who understand what a child with cancer goes through. Children can attend camp without the fear of being judged, asked personal questions, or stared at, because almost every camper there knows what it is like to experience side effects from treatment.CQ has provided me with memories that will last forever, and I know that wherever I am in my life or career, I will always spend a week of my summer at CQ.

This past summer was my first summer involved with Camp Quality, and now I cannot see my summers without it.  The people involved with this camp are exceptional.  Giving up their time to spend with children in need. Not only are the adults and companions great, but SO ARE THE KIDS! I have never been to a camp when the kids weren't so quick to judge and things weren't all about competition.  At most camps, when organized games are played it is all about winning, and being the best.  Here it is about trying something new, giving your all, having fun, and supporting each other. The kids here are experiencing something I never did as a teen, SUPPORT FROM MY PEERS!  I have also never played a 20 inning baseball game, with 15 kids in the outfield,  no score, everyone and anyone rooting you on.  My camper has taught me so much about love, life and enjoying it to the fullest.  I only hope I have taught my camper as much as she has helped me!  I LOVE CAMP QUALITY!

Camp Quality Michigan	10632	7	/users/profile/12524	miinganharmony	Client Served	5	09/21/2009	I first went to Camp Quality when I was 16 in 2008. I had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in my salivary gland called adenocystic carcinoma when I was 15 in May of 2007. I was in treatment the entire summer, but the following summer was awesome, going to Camp Quality and meeting so many people that I could actually relate to. Going through cancer in the middle of my high school career was very difficult, but I remained friends with many of the people I had been to camp with. Talking to them really helped pull me around and to realize that I wasn't alone. The people who worked so hard to make those 2 weeks possible are truly my heroes and my angels. That one week of freedom from cancer and doctors and hospitals and tests and treatments was truly a God-send. Cancer changed my life forever, in both good and bad ways. Cancer was not good, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But my response to cancer has transformed my life, and Camp Quality was a very important part of that.

Camp Quality Michigan	10590	7	/users/profile/12482	AJChris1	Volunteer	5	09/21/2009	My first experience with Camp Quality Michigan was as a camper at the age of 8. I had lymphoblastic lymphoma when I was 4, and then after I had gone into remission we heard about this camp for kids who have or have had cancer, and I decided to go. I loved it from my first summer there, and began to look forward to it as the highlight of my summer every year. I continued to return as a camper for 9 more years, until the summer after I was a senior in high school. I took the required one year off, and came back as a companion after my sophomore year of college, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I have had the same camper for 4 years now (and we plan to hit 5, and then keep going), and it is an amazing experience to get to watch her grow. Camp is one of the few places where I really felt like I fit in, while I was growing up. Although I was young when I had cancer, it still followed me. Everyone got worried about me when they heard that I had it, but there I could go and just be myself. We talked about cancer related things, and it wasn't strange - after all, we had all been through it. I got to experience things I never would have, otherwise. I got to ride an elephant, go up in a hot air balloon, go horse back riding, as well as just be in an environment where I was loved and respected. I'm still good friends with both campers and companions from when I was a camper, and love talking to all the interesting people that I've met.Camp Quality is one of the most wonderful experiences that I have ever had. I'm currently living in Alaska, but still plan to come back to camp - that's how important it is, to me and to all the people that we reach out and are able to help.

My daughter is in remission from Leukemia and has been attending camp at Camp Quality for 6 years now and loves it!  I have never met more dedicated individuals as the staff and companions with Camp Quality, their events throughout the year that include the family and allow the siblings to have a fun time is a terrific idea.  The individual pairing of each child with a companion is a great idea and my daughter loves to communicate with her companion throughout the year.  They now have 2 camps in Michigan which allows more children to attend camp but does make it harder to get space in the family outings.  I would highly recommend any parent of a child with cancer to send your child to Camp Quality and rest assured that they are well taken care of and in good hands!

They have it so organized, and well staffed it makes the week a breeze for the campers and companions! It is an awesome experience, and a very very rewarding one also!
Camp Quality Michigan	10501	6	/users/profile/12383	naturlbornwriter	Volunteer	5	09/17/2009	I have a long history with Camp Quality.  I attended my first camp in 1989 in Northwest Missouri as a camper.  For an 9 year old living with cancer (non-hodgkins lymphoma), the freedoms and opportunities at camp allowed me to be a kid again.  No one stared because I was bald or because I had unusual scars.  No one treated me like I was fragile.  For that week at camp, I was a normal kid doing normal things.  I attended Camp Quality for seven years as a camper, then I returned as a companion.  I lived in Los Angeles for nine years, where there are no Camp Qualitys.  As soon as I found out I was moving to Michigan, I contacted the camp director, Julie, and she let me volunteer for camp.  (Thank you, Julie!!)Now that I'm am adult (and a 20 year survivor!), I was still amazed at the feeling of companionship, the strength that comes from five days of letting kids hike, swim, and have campfires and smores.  At Camp Quality every feeling is valid; and those living with cancer don't feel weak if they cry or embarrassed if they act goofy or ashamed of their bald head.It's impossible to convey here the effect Camp Quality has had on my life.  All I hope is that I can help give other cancer kids what camp gave me.

Camp Quality Michigan	10477	6	/users/profile/12635	camp09	Volunteer	5	09/17/2009	Being a volunteer the past three years has totally changed my life. Seeing these children fight cancer and knowing how strong they are is truly extraordinary and an inspiration to me. Camp Quality is a place where we can all relax, have fun, forget our sorrows, and share life time memories. Being one on one with a child is a great experience because as a companion I get to build a relationship that will last for years. CQ is a free camp for everyone and is definitely the best experience you will ever have whether you are a companion or camper. Every year is new and exciting and as soon as that week is done, you begin counting down the days until you return in the summer once again.
Camp Quality Michigan	10425	5	/users/profile/12308	cbpine	Volunteer	5	09/16/2009	Camp Quality is an incredible experience for kids with cancer.  It provides a positive, outdoor experience full of action, and joy.  Most of the kids and even some of the staff have cancer so they understand what it is like to need a place to escape the stares, questions, worry and hospital smells.  A place full of sunshine, the smell of pine, the sound of waves lapping the shore and the constant spilling over of laughter.  A place where it's ok to enjoy every moment of a day. A place to stare down cancer, because you can see someone who successfully has at every turn.  Camp Quality is a journey that while you're packing your bag to go...you already know it will be wonderful!
Camp Quality Michigan	10422	5	/users/profile/12303	MMad7777	Client Served	5	09/16/2009	I am writing on behalf of my 8-year old daughter. When we first picked her up from camp, her enthusiasm of everything she did that week made me speechless. This program and all of the volunteers had made a special week for my daughter that she still talks about today. The pictures that were taken that week was so awsome to look at and should how much fun she had. I marveled at the amount of different opportunities she was given. How many camps can offer a child to go horseback riding, fishing, swimming, crafts, dancing, archery, ride up in a hot air balloon, zip line, and playing in inflatables. All in the same week!Hats off the the camp coordinators and volunteers on giving my daughter a week to remember!As for myself, I did wonder every day what she was doing (what parent would not). Although, I did not benefit from the emails because I was not at home and did not have internet where I was, I knew she would be in capable hands just from my first visit. This gave me a week to relax without worrying whether I remembered to give my daughter her medicine.
Camp Quality Michigan	10377	5	/users/profile/12257	Sue	Volunteer	5	09/15/2009	My first year at Camp Quality was 2002.  Since that time I have not missed a year and continue to take one weeks vacation from my job as a bookkeeper/tax collector just to attend.  For the last 6 years I have been in charge of the kitchen.  I organize the groups that provide meals and order all the food to feed approximately 200 people 3 meals a day for a week.  I like to tell people it is the second best thing I've done in my life-my daughter Jamie being the first.  Several years ago I attended a meeting of a local Kiwanis Club.  I told the members that working with Camp Quality was like being in a huge group hug.  You feel surrounded by all the love and caring from the wonderful people who give their time to the kids of Camp Quality.  Whatever I give to Camp Quality is nothing compared to what I receive being a part of this wonderful organization.  I plan to keep attending for as long as I am physically able and I'll continue to encourage all my friends to share in this wonderful experience.
Camp Quality Michigan	10248	6	/users/profile/12118	CQislove01	Client Served	5	09/12/2009	Im a typical seventeen years old. I have lots of friends, I play sports, and I try my best in school. Most people dont realize that when I was about half of my age that I am now I became ill with a life threatening disease. My name is Sarah Hoffman and when I was eight years old I was diagnosed with a cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).When youre eight years old you dont know much about cancer. All I knew is that I could die. So through the long months of chemo, losing hair, and not having enough energy to do much I started getting my strength back. Things were looking good. I was in remission, I was getting peach fuzz on my head, and I was having fun. My mom and I still had to go to the hospital for check ups, but while we were there my mom started talked to another boys mom (shes a typical mom). Now this mom started talking to my mom about a cancer camp that her son will be going to over the summer. This camp is called Camp Quality. I never even knew there was such a thing. My mom told me about it, and I, being the outgoing third grader I was, couldnt say no. I was so excited. I had only been to one other camp before and I had a blast. August came around and I made it to camp. I was nine my first year and was eager to get started on the fun.    A normal routine day at camp is everyone gets up, and we go to the flag raising. We have breakfast and when were done we get to go have fun. We do pretty much what we want. Camp Quality has all kinds of activities for all the campers from age four to eighteen can do. My first year I mostly did archery. They have ceramics, arts and crafts, horse back riding, frog catching, the occasional rock climbing, and on two of the days we have baseball games with former Detroit Tiger players. After all the fun, it is lunch time. Then we all take a rest around one oclock. Not only is it a state law, but because all of us campers have so much fun, we like to have a nap. After our hour of relaxation we are energized and ready to go play again. Pretty much all of those same activities are provided for us. We go have dinner then there is a camp activity set up. Each night is different, but we always have at least two camp fires. Then its time for a night time snack and we all go to bed. On one night we have a dance, and it is a blast, and the night before we have a teen night. The teens either go bowling for putt-putt golfing. So Ive listed all this great things Camp Quality has in store for us so youre probably wondering who watches us. Well, each camper is assigned at least one companion. The camp staff tries to pair up similar personalities so the campers can have the time of their life. You also might think, Hey, wait. These are cancer kids. Dont they need medicine? Yes. Some of us cancer kids need to take medicine. Camp Quality gets professionally trained nurses and doctors to volunteer at camp so we can all have fun and stay healthy at the same time. All my years Ive had great times, but dont just think Camp Quality is just a week long event during the summer. Camp Quality works hard all year round.    Not only does the staff work to keep ideas going to get ready for camp, but they also plan weekend events about every other month. There is a trip to Kalahari Water Park in September and we all have fun. We have a reunion in November to get our year books and see our friends. They tell us the theme for next year also. Yes we have themes and they get better and better every year. January there is a teen winter camp where the teens go to Boyne Mountain to ski, and then in February there is a family winter weekend when a campers entire family goes to Challenge Mountain to ski. Camp Quality has another weekend event for families in May where we go to CMU where we just hang out. Our last event before August for out week long camp is in June. It is the teen camp at Beaver Island. They year I turned thirteen and went to Beaver Island is the year I met most of my friends from camp. I connect so much with them. We always have a great time together, and we have an inseparable bond that no one can understand. We look at life differently than most teenagers do. We know life has value, and we appreciate all the little things that come into our lives. Because we find friends that totally understand us we also find our sole mate or at least I did. I met my boyfriend two and a half years ago. He has only been going to camp for two years, but those two years he loved. Weve been dating for a year and a half to this day. Unfortunately something terrible happened this summer. Doctors discovered his brain tumor came back. Now I dont know exactly what is going to happen to him, but at one point the doctors said hes not going to make it. Lately they have been more positive. I know him, and I know hes not ready to go. He wants to come back to camp next year and be a companion to some little boy. He has so much fun at camp. All of our camp friends, he, and I always have so much fun when we are together. There is no telling what is going to happen next. No matter what happens though, I will always be apart of this CQ family. I love them all dearly, and this is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me.I was also able to share this exprecience with a close friend of mine who i knew before she got sick. Last summer one of my best friends had a brain tumor and the first thing she thought of when she found out is that she wanted to come to camp with me. I talk about it all the time and she knows how much fun i have that i couldnt wait to share the experience with her. she had a blast and we all had a great time. This family is the one that will stick with me through thick and thin. They are the best.
Camp Quality Michigan	10228	5	/users/profile/12097	hairstylistlori@aol.com	Client Served	5	09/11/2009	I am 8 years old with cancer! This was my first ever camp experience.... I was scared BUT my mom was a nervous wreck!!! She was afraid that I should NOT go anywhere while I was sick. Then she realized that this was a SPECIAL CAMP where all the kids had cancer and the staff  was comprised of SPECIAL, LOVING, CARING and TRAINED adults who all knew about cancer. Camp was awesome! We had flag raising ceremonies, free gifts and stuffed animals,t-shirts, great food, fishing, horse back riding, baseball with the Detroit Tiger players, ziplines, Remax hot air ballon rides, special theme events, camp fire singing and s'mores, canoeing, swimming, craft sessions, a bungee race AND MUCH MORE....I made many new friends and realized that a Camp Quality week allowed me to forget that I had cancer! Who cares about an illness when all you can think of is.... FUN, FUN, FUN!!! Go Camp Quality!!!OK, now I am home again, back to reality. But wait....... I can deal with the reality of life with cancer because I get to go to Camp Quality again in just 310 days from today!!!!Thank you to the entire staff at Camp Quality.Love,Devin Statetzny
Camp Quality Michigan	10186	5	/users/profile/12051	dburdick	Client Served	5	09/10/2009	This was our daughter's second year at Camp Quality. It is by far the best thing that has happened for her. She was diagnosed with melanoma a year and a half ago and has successfully completed treatment. At camp she is just one of the kids and not a "special case" as she sometimes feels at school. The companions are extraordinary and the camp is run so every kid can do as much as they possibly can. We also do several special outings organized by the camp throughout the year.I wish I could offer some "constructive criticism", but quite honestly it is the best run organization I have ever been involved with.
Camp Quality Michigan	10139	7	/users/profile/12001	Diane_mcmahon_1@yahoo.com	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/09/2009	Camp Quality is such a wonderful experience for children. The volunteers and community are so giving to this 1 week of enjoyment for the children. The friendships that develop among the campers is so important. Most of the children look forward to this experience all year long. I have been pleased to be a part of this organization for 6 yrs.
Camp Quality Michigan	10114	6	/users/profile/11974	mike24jac	Volunteer	5	09/09/2009	I was a first time counselor at the North Camp and found it to be extremely rewarding.  The staff was very organized and truly put all of their energy into allowing the campers to have the best possible week.  We had 71 campers and activities galore.  It was amazing to see so many people come together for one common goal.  The kids were the focus and everything else took a back seat.  What a tremendous organization!!
Camp Quality Michigan	10105	7	/users/profile/11966	judytymes1	Volunteer	5	09/09/2009	I was asked 8 years ago if I would be on standby as a "Health Officer" for Camp Quality. I knew little of the organization, but was retired and summered in MI. I was disappointed I wasn't needed that year-but have been on staff ever since. I have been rewarded time and again by the courage the kids show in the face of uncertainty, and the compassion of an all volunteer staff. The camp offers respite and support to families of kids with cancer. In many cases, kids who have beaten cancer come back as staff, and share their stories with the kids. A lot of hope, a lot of laughs-a "Quality" adventure.
Camp Quality Michigan	10103	6	/users/profile/11965	amybirish	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2009	My daughter went to Camp Quality for the first time this summer.  She loved it!!!!!!!!!  She wanted to go back a week later.  Gracie is 8 years old and was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at age 4.  She was in remission a week after diagnosis and underwent chemo for 2 1/2 years.  Recently, she's had 2 benign tumors removed from her leg and this camp provided a huge outlet for her while assuring us as parents, that she'll be cared for and all  of her needs will be met.  As parents, we were very at ease knowing CQ has doctors and experienced, caring staff.  It was fabulous!!! Gracie loved horseback riding, hot air balloon ride, fishing, canoeing you name it, she loved it.  The one on one companion/camper ratio is sooo unique and we were very comforted knowing her companion had it together and was just going to have fun with her.  Gracie bonded well with Lindsay and still talks about her and can't wait to see her again.  Camp Quality is truly SPECIAL!  We are very grateful to have such a fabulous outlet on such a beautiful lake!!!

Every year exeeds his expectations and ensures fun and friendship.  Camp Quality does such a great job of letting the kids just be kids and have fun.  At camp he is able to be just a kid with no judgement from anyone.  He has formed great friendships and bonds with other campers, companions, and staff.  The day camp is over with he starts looking forward to the next year!
Camp Quality Michigan	10089	5	/users/profile/11952	Tiffany	Volunteer	5	09/09/2009	Camp Quality is a place where children with cancer can come and enjoy LIFE for a whole week.  They are surrounded by people who care about them invidually, experience many new adventures,forget about treatments, and be with kids who are or who have gone through some of the same things that they are dealing with currently.  It is an envornment of care and support for families and the child. I love being a part of the companion staff and I wouldn't spend a week doing anything else!

Camp Quality Michigan	10080	5	/users/profile/11943	McKenna	Volunteer	4	09/08/2009	This is my second year as a golf cart driver and I have as much fun as the campers. It is a pure joy to watch these campers riding horses, flying down the zip line or just laughing with other kids. I know two little campers who can melt your heart with a look, they like to ride around on a golf cart and I love taking them. The staff and companions are great people with big hearts, I am proud to be a part of this organization.
Camp Quality Michigan	10074	5	/users/profile/11936	campquality2	Volunteer	5	09/08/2009	The Camp Quality "family" is an extraordinary group of individuals. From the campers, our inspiration, to the staff and volunteers, there could not be a more wonderful group of people! Camp is not just a week in the summer; it is a year-long support system. I have served as a companion at camp for five summers and I am continually amazed at the amount of love and support found at camp.
Camp Quality Michigan	10072	5	/users/profile/11934	jharri7415	Volunteer	5	09/08/2009	As a first year volunteer at the Michigan North Camp, I enjoyed this experience very much, as it provided a glimpse into many different facets of the camp, as well as an opportunity to get acquianted with many other staff members, volunteers and campers. I felt this was an extremely well run camp and was so impressed with the energy and enthusiasm of the staff and campers alike. There was a tremendous amount of planning and coordinating involved, and I commend the staff for a job well done...from hot air balloon rides to the high ropes couse/climbing wall to playing ball with some former Detroit Tigers players. The experience was fun and rewarding, and I'm already looking forward to next year.

Camp Quality Michigan	10046	5	/users/profile/11906	nluckynumber7	Volunteer	5	09/08/2009	This was the first year that I got involved with Camp Quality.  Going into it I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  I was so overwelmed efforts of the staff and volunteer to help to make an incrediable week for the children.  There were so many didn't activies going on each day.  There was never a dull moment.  The children really enjoyed escaping to camp and forgetting about the worries in their lifes  I have never seen so many kids as happy in my life.  Camp Quality is truely something special!
Camp Quality Michigan	10038	5	/users/profile/11898	relayheath	Volunteer	5	09/08/2009	I became involved with Camp Quality after my grandson was a camper back in 2003 and he was so excited and had such a great experience at the age of 6.  The next year I became involved as a companion and also got my best friend to come and we have been coming every since.  This was our sixth year at camp this past August.  We are both part of the kitchen staff and thoroughly enjoy seeing the kids have such a great time getting together with other campers they have met over the years who keep coming back year after year and meeting new campers. The companions are matched up so well with their camper and they surely have a good time since there is so much for the kids to do at camp.  I, myself, enjoy getting together with other companions, campers and staff each year and see how the kids have grown and that they are still part of the Camp Quality family.

Camp Quality Michigan	10019	2	/users/profile/11876	blondebiggirl	Client Served	5	09/08/2009	CQ is for children who are going through cancer treatment, children who are cancer survivors and siblings.  These children lose their childhood.  Their wks, months and years are at best filled with endless pokes, medication, separation (from school, siblings and friends) and isolation.  A cancer diagnosis has such a tragic effect on the whole family unit.  My 7 yr old son who is a leukemia survivor and my 5 yr old son went to CQ for the 1st time this summer.  Families who go thru this lose all stability in this world; often times financial as well.  This camp is FREE!  The kids were a little hesitant to go... as they have both had severe separation issues as my oldest son was hospitalized 237 days in 2006 and the younger one was often left with caregiviers :(Trust me these parents DESPERATELY need a break!!!  and that is what they get!!  There are trained nurses at the camp; and the most amazing part is EVERY camper gets a 1:1 companion for the entire wk!!! :)  they try to match each child's interests with that of their companion (18 & up, trained, & background check)This was one of the most amazing things i've ever been involved with!!! Truly!!!  The kids had such a blast and got to forget about everything for just a few days and be kids again!!!  They had everything you could imagine there for them!  Round the clock activities and crafts... water sports and fun, pony rides, police, fire, helicopters, motorcycles, camp fires & silly songs, talent contest, birdhouse making, rocket making and launching... i really could go on & on & on!!The camp sent updates and pics nightly to tell us how our kids were doing and what they were up to!  When we pick the kids up they have all the parents stay to watch a slideshow of the wk and have a picnic.  It was absolutely magical to see the life, joy and careless laughter of these children so beaten and maimed by this deadly disease.  My precious 5 year old who has been in a shell since his brother was diagnosed 3 years ago had a blue & green mohawk when i came to pick him up!!  He was grinning from ear to ear!!  He had found joy! and confidence and happiness!!!  i was soo proud that he had conquered his fear of separation from his parents and thrived in this loving environment!  Words cannot be used to explain the love and gratitude in my heart for the people who put this together; "Letting Kids With Cancer Be Kids Again!"  is their motto, and i believe they are achieving this goal 110%!!!  Even in writing this i get teared up thinking about the kids... some have only wks or months left... others may go on to live a fairly healthy life.  But this is a bright light of HOPE and LOVE in the most dark dungeon you can imagine.CQ also has events yr round (4 i believe) to keep the campers & companions in touch with each other!  Last year we went to a snow wknd they had and the boys loved going down the hill on the sled.  This fall they have a water wknd in a hotel water park.  The boys are beyond thrilled!!!  And the best part is it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the kids have literally lost a couple yrs of their lives with this monster called cancer... and these little outtings truly bring joy and peace into a family that has just not been able to experience these things in a long time.GOD BLESS CAMP QUALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and everyone who is a part of this organization!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are kids that were put on a waiting list to go to camp this year that were denied  :(For all of the heartbreak and pain these kids go through my hope and prayer is that the funding is there to allow each child the opportunity to just be a kid again... if only for 1 wk a year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Camp Quality Michigan	10009	6	/users/profile/11863	swimnewbie09	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	Camp Quality has changed my life forever.  My first time I went to camp I was a very shy girl and did not knowing anyone. I made friends immediately because everyone is so friendly.  The one on one camper companion ration really makes everyone feel special.  These kids who have gone through such a traumatic event now have all attention on them. And for their parents, they get a break for a week, knowing their children are safe and taken care of. My camper has attended the camp for over 10 years where I have only attended twice.  Both of us enjoy the new special events that happen every year.  At points she feels like she has done everything and then we discover a new activity she has never tried.  Camp Quality has taught me patience, understanding, sympathy, strength, flexibility and so much more.  I tear up thinking about the joy these children experience when at camp.  Camp isnt just a week long experience, it is for life!  My camper has made best friends that she sees regularly outside of camp.  This year I ran every morning of camp to stay in shape. One morning I got the opportunity to run with a 17 year old cancer survivor. I felt so empowered and she pushed me to my limit and made me a better person and a better runner.My favorite experience was during the memorial service.  I was having a hard time dealing with a loss of one of last years campers.  One of the 8 year old cancer survivors turned around in her seat, saw that I was crying and held my hand.  The strength of this child blows my mind.  I am a relatively healthy person and this little girl who has gone through so much, comforted me when I was crying.  I still am shocked by this event.  It most likely meant nothing to her, she just wanted me to feel better, but I will NEVER forget that moment, EVER.  Camp quality has also given me tools to deal with death.  This is a very important part of camp.  It shows me they know how I feel and care about my emotional health, while at camp and while away from camp.  I have told hundreds of people about my experiences.This camp has also led me to a career as a Child Life Specialist.  I am currently pursuing a degree in Child Life, focusing on play as an important role in hospitalization. This camp is the ultimate Child Life experience.  At work, I bring crafts to children waiting for doctors or deliver toys to children that need something to do during long doctors appointments. When I receive my degree, I will be distracting children during procedures, helping the child and family deal with the illness, and aiding in the process of bereavement.   This camp has showed me how important the role of play has on children dealing with cancer.  I plan to take everything I have learned and use it in my career.I am from the Chicago suburbs, one of the only volunteers from out of state and I drive 7-8 hours to get to camp.   This year I had one day in between the last day of camp and the first day of school (University of Iowa).  Driving 12 hours in a 24 hours period was tough but so worth it. I wouldnt miss camp for anything!  I encourage everyone to get involved with something they love and this is mine. I love the smiles and the joy radiating from the children who attend Camp Quality Michigan.  This year we had the most people ever at camp and everyone is included.  I look forward to the next year as I drive off the campground on my way home from camp!
Camp Quality Michigan	10003	6	/users/profile/11857	Momma Pat	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	I have been involved with Camp Quality since 2007 when my daughter (Stacy Brooks) asked me to help. I have been a companion to a six year old and last year I became part of the staff working with arts and crafts and overseeing activities in the main lodge. This has been the most fulfilling experience of my life.Cancer has touched our family in a very personal way and because of this we all felt like we needed to give something back for all the help, love and support that was given to us at a very hard time. What better way is there then to give children a chance to just be kids again when they are fighting everyday for their life. What better way then to give parents a break and to know that their kids are having fun and just being kids for a week. Camp Quality is a Great Big Slice of Sunshine in their uncertain and scary world.
Camp Quality Michigan	9999	5	/users/profile/11852	khord08	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	I absolutely love Camp Quality. When I signed up to be a companion I was nervous that I wouldn't be strong enough to be help a child with cancer. But being around those incredible children for a week was the most inspiring thing I could have ever done. They teach you strength and compassion and you just have the most amazing time! CQ is awesome because it's all free for the campers and their companions! And because it provides a comfortable and safe environment for children who deserve a fun week of being a kid! I honestly can't wait to return as a 3rd year companion next summer!
Camp Quality Michigan	9998	5	/users/profile/11851	tegg15	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	When asked to help at Camp Quality, a camp for kids with cancer, I was a little nervous. The thought of a child with cancer is enough to make me cry! I decided that I could be strong and I would help and I am so glad I did. The unbelievable number of incredible people who volunteer during the week is awesome!! The camp is a week for the children to forget that they have cancer and to have a ton of fun, AND THEY DO!! I was overwhelmed by the number of volunteers who spend the entire week with a camper, cook, clean, take photos, bring a hot air balloon, provide free concessions, do crafts, take kids fishing, horseback riding, help build rockets, take kids canoeing, swimming, climbing, scrapbooking. The last thing on their minds is cancer! What an awesome organization! To see a child who has been through so much (surgery, months of chemotherapy and radiation), smile a genuine fun filled smile, is incredible!! Instead of sadness and illness, this camp is filled with fun, laughter, and excitement!!

It helped me realize that I wasn't the only kid that had cancer and helped me be comfortable with taking my hat off and exposing my bald head. The friends I have met at camp understand the word cancer and how it feels to actually have it. The campers are able to forget about their cancer for one week with all the activities that are put together for them. Anywhere from the ropes course, arts and crafts, rocket building, bounce houses, the slip n' slide, to the baseball games. Camp Quality isn't something you can completely understand until you actually become part of the "CQ family". It's a place where everyone is loved and cared for individually, and that's why I think it's the best.
Camp Quality Michigan	9995	5	/users/profile/11845	mistere213	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	Camp was fantastic. This was my 2nd year as a Companion at Camp Quality and it is one of the best experiences in my life. I look forward to it every year now. The kids seem to have a blast too. There are so many activities to do, it's almost hard to do them all! This is one of the finest organizations out there.
Camp Quality Michigan	9994	5	/users/profile/11844	jremus	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	Camp Quality is an amazing organization that allows lids with cancer to be kids again, even if for only that one week at camp.  My parents were the first in my family to be involved. They just finished their 12th year. My mom runs a craft cabin, my dad drives a golf cart to transport campers to and from activities, and I lifeguard and help to run the waterfront activities.  This year my son also volunteered as a lifeguard.  Three generations of giving to a cause we truly believe in.  We wouldn't do anything else with our time that week.Our family is also involved in the Boyne Thunder fundraiser for CQ.  Anything we can do for CQ...because paraphrasing another volunteer.."it is not the quantity of time on earth, but the QUALITY of time"...Camp Quality Rocks!
Camp Quality Michigan	9990	6	/users/profile/11838	lolarings	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	This is the second year that I have volunteered at Camp Quality Michigan. I am proud to be paired with my new friend Justin. I  continue to see him and his family.I feel fortunate that I am able to provide him with a great camp experience at no cost to his family.As a cancer survivor the doctors were able to heal my body but these children have mended my heart. I am honored to be a small part of Camp Quality Michigan. My favorite memory from camp this year was dancing with a little girl, who is visually impaired due to cancer, to a country song.We were not singing in tune or dancing to the beat but we were having the time of our lives. Could  life get any better?
Camp Quality Michigan	9989	7	/users/profile/11836	Megan Maiani	Volunteer	5	09/07/2009	I cannot even begin to explain what Camp Quality has done for me.  I joined the Camp Quality family back in 2007, and it will forever be a part of my life.  What this camp provides for children with cancer is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  These children get to come to camp for a week without having to pay for anything.  There is so much food, crafts, gifts given to these children in one week, while their parents get to relax and spend time with each other or with other siblings who sometimes do not get the attention that they need.  When you spend a week at Camp Quality, it touches your heart no matter what kind of person you are.  There is not one volunteer that joins the staff that is not capable of caring for these children.  Children are allowed to be children again and forget about all the treatment they have to go through and all the stares and looks they get.  I have had a camper who has passed away, and the Camp Quality family and staff has provided myself and that family with so much support and love and character that I cannot even express to you in words.  I am thankful every day of my life for Camp Quality and I always anticipate the next event they put on.
Camp Quality Michigan	9987	6	/users/profile/11833	TPie	Volunteer	5	09/06/2009	I was a companion for a camper at Camp Quality. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.Camp Quality sets up the companion-camper relationship in a way that is comfortable to both parties. The training does a decent job of preparing the companions for what to expect and how to react to certain situations.At the camp, the administration does an excellent job in scheduling the events and making them fun for everyone. My camper and I had a lot of fun on the water activities, the zip line, and at the events thrown by the Camp Copneconic staff. Camp Quality does a great thing bringing a smile to everyone who is involved, especially the campers. It was a privilege to be a part of that.
Camp Quality Michigan	9984	6	/users/profile/11829	stacyraebrooks	Volunteer	5	09/06/2009	I became  involved with Camp Quality 4 years ago.  At the time, my father beat  Stage 3 Colon Cancer and I needed to give back to  the "cancer community" and help everyone that that i possibly could. I know how cancer affected my father and how people were scared of him and I needed to change that outlook.  I joined CQ, I liked their motto, "letting kids with cancer be kids again".  The first summer at camp, I was paired up with a little girl that changed my life remarkable. We met so many people, where everyone looked the same, had the same scars and evryone was smiling. We did everything possible at camp, from ziplines, to horseback riding and arts and crafts.  She is my "buddy'. now, 4 years later,  I want every child that comes  to camp, to leave feeling "like a kid again".  I can't explain to you how Camp Quality has touched so many people.  It is a wonderful organization.  We are a huge family, where we all keep in touch.  Unfortunately, we do have some sad times, and thats when all CQ members come together and support one another.  With  our friendship, our stories of camp we get through it.  I am so proud of Camp Quality.  And i thank them all the time for choosing me to make a difference in a childs life.

Camp Quality Michigan	9978	5	/users/profile/11825	tracey	Volunteer	5	09/05/2009	My week at Camp Quality was one of the best weeks of my life.  I volunteered as a companian this past summer.  We were to "work" one-on-one with a camper.  A camper was a 4 to 18 year old child who has, or is, battling cancer.  We were trained for a day, but I really did not know what to expect.  The entire week was such a warm fuzzy for everyone!!!  Camp was so well organized.  The word bored was never uttered or thought.  There were so many activities, team building skills, and opportunities throughout each day.  I truly felt like my own personal family had just grown by 150 people.  The children have so much fun, and the memories that are made are extremely valuable.  I have shared my experience with so many already, because it meant so much to me.  I honestly cannot think of one aspect that I would change or improve upon.  This was my first year at Camp Quality, but it will definitely not be my last.  Tracey Feil
Camp Quality Michigan	9956	6	/users/profile/11804	janec0310	Volunteer	5	09/04/2009	This was my second year as a companion to a very special little girl named Ragan.  We really hit it off last year and I was very excited to spend another week with her this past July.  We did a lot of fun activities during the week, but I would dare to say that her favorite might have been making me into a human sundae!  We shared a room with Jan and Katie.  Early in the week Katie and Ragan made up a password which Jan and I had to remember to re-enter our room.  I hope that we will be able to meet again next summer.

Each year we have wonderful volunteers (companions and staff members) that come together to deliver a wonderful program to our campers--each of which has, or has had, cancer.  What makes CQ unique is the bond that is formed between camper and companion.  Each camper is paired on-to-one with a companion that spends the entire week with them.  Add in the spectacular programming that is provided and it all adds up to FUN!!!!!  I HIGHLY recommend this organization..not only in Michigan but across the US!

I connected with Jan Lifsey and she explained how the TNR program works. After my dog died I began noticing numerous feral cats in and around my yard. I had no idea that Voiceless-MI even existed. I signed up to participate and have had three cats neutered to date. I am working on trapping and neutering four more. I think this is a wonderful program and plan to become a regular donator as well as continue to participate. I was always a dog person but have now become a cat lover as well

I feed them twice a day and provide shelters in winter.  I have gotten so much helpful information from the voiceless group. Also, they helped me get a new feral cat neutered. He  came around causing trouble with the original feral group. By helping me with the TNR effort the neighborhood is a lot quieter and one more cat is not able to reproduce. The people that work for this organization are generous with their knowledge on feral TNR. They truly care about minimizing animal suffering. I appreciate all the advice and help I have received from them.

Voiceless-MI	302504	1	/users/profile/393637	Writer	Client Served	5	09/03/2016	A voiceless volunteer gave us advise and a special trap when we had a feral mother cat and her four kittens show up at our house in a country location.   When the kittens were safely trapped (as soon as they were able to eat on their own) and taken to a proper shelter we trapped the mother and through the program she was spayed at no charge.  Jan the volunteer helped us with any questions we had along the way.  The mother cat now spayed is returned to our home area where we leave food out for her each morning.  She is still feral and does not come close to us but has a chance to live out her life in the countryside without producing hundreds of offspring.

Voiceless-MI	298633	1	/users/profile/389522	Writer	Client Served	5	07/31/2016	I had wanted to trap and neuter a feral male cat from my neighborhood.  He had fought with a racoon, so was missing hair in spots and had a wound and swelling on his leg.  Two neighbors wanted to shoot him.  I rented a trap (I didn't know that I could have borrowed one free from Voiceless!) but had failed to get him.  Worried, I drove to the spay and neuter clinic to show them photos of his injuries.  I was told to contact Voiceless.  The videos and lengthy encouragement from this great organization stopped me from giving up on him.  I pestered them often with emails and offered my frustrations.  I got kindness and tips in return.  Finally, he was trapped, treated, neutered, and put into my cattery cage, which was a foreign environment for him.  Since his release, he has returned several times to eat and even to sit on my porch!  Although it may be years, if ever, before I can pet him, he knows where and when there is food out for him, and this morning he watched me clean the barn.  I plan to give him a special shelter for winter.  Instead of pain and helplessness, he has a future, thanks to Voiceless!   I highly recommend them!!!

The other 3 mothers shared nursing duties and half of their kittens have already been adopted.  One of theirs'  was put up for adoption by Humane Society making it easier to spay 3 of the mothers (one of which was pregnant again.)   The first cat neutered was an abandoned cat who has since been adopted along with a kitten.  Just neutered one of the four remaining tom cats and hoping to have last nursing mother spayed as she is now pregnant again.  Voiceless loaned me a trap and a medium sized dog crate.  They gave vouchers for the 8 that have been neutered and spayed.  They always responded promptly to emails and offered advice.  Their videos about TNR are very helpful and the suggestion of a chart to show all cats to be spayed and neutered, keeping it organized was helpful.

Voiceless-MI	287280	2	/users/profile/377357	Nadua2	Client Served	5	04/25/2016	I searched the Internet to find just the right little feline companion and came across Voiceless-MI. I am so happy I did!  Listed on Voiceless-MI as "Tripp", I found a wonderful, cuddly male older (possibly 8 years old?) cat, Siamese (gray-point, short hair). When his foster "mom" found him in January 2016, he was emaciated, bitten, and had a mangled left front arm. Voiceless helped his foster mom & dad get the help Tripp needed right away. He got up to date on his shots, fed well, and had to have his arm amputated. Poor guy!  When I met him at his foster home in March 2016, he approached me right away, and ran around the house like he was very excited! Then, when I sat on the couch, he jumped up behind me and proceeded to make his way down to my chest, where he gladly lay down and purred loudly! He actually nudged my face with his! The more I pet him, the more he nudged and purred! I fell in love instantly! Yep, this was the companion for me. I have mobility issues and pain, so I have many "bad" days and end up at home all day, sometimes for two or three days consecutively. He and I seemed the perfect match!  After meeting "Tripp", which Dawn, the Foster Coordinator at my local Voiceless-MI had set up, I received many more emails and texts from Dawn as to my decision and wrapping up the adoption process. All the constant contact was great. I was so happy that Dawn delivered Tripp to me because of my mobility issues! And after a few days of he and I getting to know each other, and "Tripp" meeting my adult daughter who visited, I decided to change his name. It has been changed to "Takoda." This is an Apache term for someone they consider to be "The Friend of All." He certainly is!!! Takoda greets everyone that visits, and he LOVES to be held, hugged, petted, and cuddled; he especially likes to be talked to, whispering with loving tones while holding him close is one of his favorites. He even enjoys being held & loved on by children, as you can see by one of my photos below--that little girl is my friend's daughter.  Takoda seems to really need to be touched in order to be happy--I do, too--I've always loved hugs. Since he is a vocal little guy, Takoda lets me know when he needs a cuddle. I have to admit he's very hard to resist, because, well, I love to cuddle too! We're perfect for each other and I couldn't be happier with our match. Thank you Voiceless!!!!  Takoda is pretty smart; he comes when I call him; he knows what "come, come" and "come here", and what "no" means. Takoda even knows what it means when I tap my hand on my leg without me saying come here! If his water bowl is getting low, he vocalizes to let me know. So, I guess I've been trained to check his water bowl in case it's getting low; but usually his vocalizing means he wants a cuddle. Such a cutie!  Everyone I dealt with at Voiceless-MI was caring and wonderful. I highly recommend anything you need pet-wise, go to Voiceless-MI.

He was neglected during his early months of life, which caused him heart problems and  near blindness. Voiceless was contacted by an animal shelter who realized that his chances of adoption were slim due to his extensive medical issues.Voiceless brought him home, sought out an eye specialist and after numerous doctor appointments he was ready for his fresh start in life. After an extensive search, Mo was placed across the country with his new family. They saw past his medical issues and simply wanted the best for him.  Mo blossomed in his new home and was a hit at a local business where he was welcomed every morning.This is just one of a hundred stories about this wonderful organization that is run solely by volunteers and people with a passion to help the voiceless.  All of these folks work, have families and still make time to change laws, change lives and make the world a better place for animals and humans. Thank you Voiceless!

The group was volunteering at that time helping out with everything from cleaning to walking and caring for the animals.  My LilGirl was adopted from the shelter because of Voiceless's opinion of her.  A little pitbull mix that turned out to be my Barley's best friend.  I have since adopted two other furbabies since then thru Voiceless.  Their foster care parents are the best and work to make sure that all of the furbabies have everything they need until a permanent home is found.  They are involved in so many activites that go toward saving and helping animals.  The administration is always looking for grants to help lower income residents have spay/shot services; trap/neuter feral cats; being involved in fighting to end the inhumane gassing of animals in shelters.  It is any organization that encompasses all kind of animals; wolves, cats, birds, even Tarantulas and the group has a great and loving heart not only for the animals, but for the community.

They serve a need in our community that has many lower-income families that still should be able to enjoy the ability of having a furry buddy in their home.This is a multi-faceted organization with many years of experience behind each officer and volunteer serving.  Their goals give the rescued a "forever" home.Officers and volunteers of this organization work 24/7.  It is an organization that I am very proud to be a part of and hope that they will be able to continue their services to the Voiceless!

We had an out of control feral cat population on our street and they helped us in four important ways. First, they listened to our situation and gave us advice on how to do trap/spay/neuter/release. Second, they gave us the tools (traps and kennel for post-op care). Third, they gave us financial support through vouchers at the CAHS Spay/Neuter clinic. Fourth, they gave us resources and information to help us and also to help educate our neighbors. They are an excellent example of how a non-profit can give financial support and training to get important work done.

She was feral when found. She had to be fixed and I could not afford it. Voiceless MI came to the rescue with a voucher for a major discount. She can't make anymore unwanted kittens. She is now 8 years old and lives indoors only.
Voiceless-MI	282026		/users/profile/372134	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/09/2016	I had low income and needed a kitten fixed that was dumped off in my yard. I decided to keep her, since cats are way over populated in shelters. I got a voucher from Voiceless to get her fixed for a super discount. It helped save the kitten from a shelter or euthanasia and made sure no more unwanted kittens came from this cat. Thank you Voiceless!

A quick internet search led me to Voiceless Michigan's website, and then to just about the best dog anyone could hope for.He and his two brothers were surrendered to the River Rouge shelter at about four years old with obvious emotional damage from some sort of abuse. Voiceless Michigan did such an amazing job working with him and getting him the emotional and physical support he needed to begin to feel comfortable around people again and being on a leash.I'm certain that if  Voiceless Michigan had not been there providing the services they do (which are many), our wonderful dog, Remo, and countless others would not only not be living the life of a loved and loving family member, they would not be living at all.I cannot thank them enough.
Voiceless-MI	282012		/users/profile/349628	Writer	Client Served	5	03/09/2016	I contacted Voiceless-MI about their TNR program for a stray colony that I had been feeding in the trailer park where I live. They agreed to help me trap the cats and even to let them recover at the home of the woman that runs Voiceless-MI. As the trapping was happening I found out that people in the park and the park owner were planning on getting rid of the colony. The woman at Voiceless and another woman that helped me trap the cats relocated the colony to a friend of theirs' barn. They even managed to get the two newest additions to the colony adopted out. This was an ordeal for all involved and the TNR program does not do this pretty much ever. Anyways all cats involved are safe and have homes where they will be cared for.  As soon as I get back to work regularly I am planning on donating some money to them. Many thanks to Holly, Jann and Jackie.

Without their voucher, there's no way I would have been able to afford to keep my furbaby up to date on the necessary vaccines or to keep her from reproducing more puppies I couldn't afford at the time, not to mention to keep from adding to overpopulation of her breed.

They are willing to go the extra mile to help someone who needs it concerning their animals.  I do not drive but have been willing to donate dog/cat food and other items and they more than willing to pick the items up.  I also bake for them in fundraisers and they pick up the goodies as well.  If I had a problem I feel I could call this organization and they would direct me in the right direction for finding out an answer if they did not know it themselves.  
Voiceless-MI	281985		/users/profile/372088	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/09/2016	Voiceless is a top notch non-profit organization that should be in every city in the U.S. They volunteer hours of their time, gas and their own money to try and help as many owners of pit bulls  that can't afford to get their dogs spayed and neutered. In the long run it saves our local shelters from having to euthanize so many unwanted pit bulls. They also help educate people as the many benefits of spaying and neutering. Our shelters nationwide are filled with unwanted pets with the majority being pit bulls. Unfortunately, the majority of the public are not willing to adopt a pit bull due to the reputation they have. They can then fall in to the wrong hands and used as bait or  for fighting. This organization does more to stop this over breeding of pit bulls then any other I have ever known in my 64 yrs of rescuing dogs. I know many of the volunteers personally and can't say enough great things about these people that give up their personal lives, time and money to take on other people's responsibilities because of their loving, caring nature. It would be wonderful if everyone that is able would donate to this non profit organization so they can reach out even further in their dedication to stop the over breeding and abuse.  
Voiceless-MI	281983		/users/profile/372086	Karen393	Volunteer	5	03/09/2016	A few years ago the farm where my clients work was overrun with feral cats and kittens. We had recently heard of Voiceless MI and their Trap, Neuter, Release program for feral cats. We contacted them, and shortly thereafter they loaned us several live traps and we began the process of trapping the cats. We spent much of that summer completing this endeavor. Altogether 29 adult cats were trapped, spayed and neutered and released back to the property. 13 kittens were also caught, and were successfully able to be fostered by us, spayed and neutered, and adopted into loving, indoor homes. The property owner was thrilled and is to this day, very grateful to Voiceless MI, and us for helping to successfully end the constant breeding and repopulating of the farm. The cats that were released, are mostly still residing there, are much healthier, are keeping the barn free of mice, and there have been no litters born there since we started the program! Last summer we worked once again, with Voiceless MI, and successfully trapped 14 cats and kittens from a North Lansing Neighborhood. Only four were feral, and were spayed and neutered, and released back. The other 10, and eleven kittens that they graced us with, shortly after arrival in our home, were all able to be spayed and neutered and adopted into homes! Through our involvement, and greatly in part, to Voiceless MI, we were able to foster and adopt out 52 cats and kittens in 2015. We currently have two females, one who has 4 five week old kittens, that we are fostering. They will soon be attending Voiceless Mi sponsored adoption events, and hopefully all be placed into wonderful homes. Voiceless MI is, as you can tell, by the testimony I have given here, a truly wonderful organization that is doing amazing work to help control the feral cat overpopulation problem. I cannot thank them enough for the help and support they have given us in our efforts, and ALL the work that they do on behalf of our voiceless animal companions! I look forward to continuing to work with all of the awesome people associated with this organization! VOICELESS MI ROCKS!!!

I called numerous agencies and rescue groups for help.  Due to an overflow of cats in our area, none were able to help me.  Until I reached Voiceless.  They sent one of their volunteers to assess the situation and give me assistance.  Her name was Brenda, but it should be Angel.  She tirelessly assisted me in caring for the mother and her brood, humanely trapping them and helping me move them into my spare bedroom so I could foster care them.  She brought me food, supplies, a kitty playpen for the kittens when they were weaned, toys to play with them and tame them. She came several days a week at my request after working her day job to get them ready for adoption.  When my vet gave me the go ahead to have the mother spayed, Brenda personally transported her to and from the clinic, and was a reassuring and calming presence for the mother cat.  She very carefully and selectively picked loving and caring homes for the mother and all the kittens (also spayed and neutered). An amazing lady who deeply loves and cares for cats, a true blessing.  She volunteers tirelessly for Voiceless.

I believe that it is made up of a lot of folks who used to belong to the now defunct FICAS, or Friends of Ingham County Animal Shelter. Years ago, the new shelter director disbanded FICAS and many of the gals (and guys?) formed Voiceless-MI. They are instrumental in getting no- and low-cost spay/neuter to animals in and around Ingham County. They also used to run a HUGE rummage sale every summer to which I would donate a box or two of goods collected 'round my home each year. Well, the sale got so big that they can no longer have it. Sure wish they could find time. I loved donating to them and this was a big fund-raiser. Small groups like this REALLY need your help. So ... give local!

Voiceless-MI	191981		/users/profile/250602	Gordon M.	Client Served	5	01/02/2014	I became aware of a situation involving a significant number of stray cats at a rental property that I own.  I was out of ideas when somebody suggested that I get in touch with Voiceless.  Not only did Voiceless offer a significant amount of education about Trap-Neuter-Release, they also loaned me traps and provided the neuter/spay certificates at Capital Area Humane Society.   The first night that I set the traps, I caught six cats.  I took them in to get fixed the next morning, allw ent smoothly there.  Where Voiceless truly went above and beyond was in housing some of the cats for a few days while I tried to trap the last few cats that were wandering around at my rental.  This allowed me to avoid re-trapping any cats, and get the last three that we had seen. Unfortunately, over the summer, we discovered just exactly why so many stray cats had been in this neighborhood.  Voiceless-MI even offered quite a bit of advice in how to deal with the defective person that was feeding all of these cats and the legal avenues that were available to me.   I could not be more grateful for the help and support that Voiceless-MI has given me.  I have nothing but positive things to say about this program.  It is the product of a very careful management of limited funding combined with a very generous donation of time made by the people who administer and do the work of the program.  These are people who are truly putting themselves out for the betterment of animal welfare in this community.

They managed their limited funds very conservatively and can make a dollar stretch farther than any non profit I know.  Their spay/neuter and TNR programs are making a difference in the number of unwanted and uncared for litters of kittens and puppies in our area.

They help trap, neuter and release feral cats.  They help low income people neuter and spay their pit bull bully type dogs.  They help battle poor breed specific laws which protect neither people nor breeds.  They advocate for the wolf population that has barely recovered before being set upon again without thought or any real planning.  They work with local shelters and advocate against euthanasia by gassing as cruel and inhumane.  They are regularly involved with getting high risk animals out of shelters and into the network of animal placement rescues and fosters they work with.  Basically they are fully involved in anything that could possibly require animal advocacy on a local, regional and state level. And they are wonderful and delightful human beings in addition to all their great work.  I can't recommend them highly enough.

A timely response can be essential in this field, and in our experience, many nonprofits struggle in their response times. Furthermore, Voiceless-MI takes the courtesy to extend their volunteer network to us when we have a dog needing rescue or transfer.

I've worked with Voiceless-MI and many other rescues and animal welfare organizations for several years. I've helped raise funds for them, worked with their volunteers, and referred many adopters to them.  Voiceless is both diligent and accepting. That is, they have great screening procedures for adopters, but are not so over-the-top with their requirements that they screen out most of the people sincerely looking to welcome an animal into their loving homes. The work they do in the community with spay/neuter and TNR is critical and makes an immense difference in our community. They have a plan and they execute it, without fail. This small organization makes a huge difference in our community. I highly recommend Voiceless-MI for anyone looking to adopt, to volunteer, to donate, and for an organization that will implement any grant to the fullest extent possible.
Voiceless-MI	172134		/users/profile/227864	BaileyKim	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2013	I am a veterinary technician who has worked with many rescue groups over the years.  I can honestly say that Voiceless is THE BEST rescue I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  I think all rescues mean well.  However, many take the wrong approach when it comes to helping animals and their people.  Voiceless is a tight-knit community of volunteers who really care and are dedicated to protecting those animals that can't protect themselves.  The volunteers constantly go out of their way to "make things happen" for the animals that find themselves in unfortunate situations.  I've never seen them turn an animal away because of age, breed, size, medical condition or even distance.  They routinely form bands of volunteers who will drive animals to check points where other volunteers are waiting to take over, just so they can get an animal where it needs to be.  They frequently take in older animals who have multiple medical issues and they work and work until they can find that geriatric pet the perfect home where its needs will be met.  They don't shy away from expensive treatments like Heartworm TReatment, Cruciate Surgery and other expensive therapies the foster animals need.  They just roll up their sleeves, brain-storm ideas and find a way to raise the money needed.  They are constantly running fundraisers to help earn the funds needed to help these struggling animals.  Many rescues depend on their adoption fees alone to fund their organizations.  Eventually those funds run out and then those other rescues can't provide the necessary care for the animals they are trying to help.  Not Voiceless! They work hard to ensure that treatments are available, by constantly campaigning for their organization and those it serves.  These people work so hard and give so much of themselves for the cause they believe in.  I'm proud to be a small part of all the great work they continue to do.  I am constantly surprised by their on-going efforts to educate the community on spay-neuter, the importance of preventative care and even behavior issues, which so often can lead to damage of the human-animal bond and eventually owner relinquishment or even euthanasia.  They stand up for animal rights and frequently are found on the steps of our Capitol Building, speaking out for the millions of animals out there who need our help and protection.  They are so generous with their services, that I've even seen them lend a helping hand to other rescue groups and organizations, creating a united front for pets everywhere.  For such a small group they help an amazing number of pets and owners each year.  I've dedicated the last 20 years of my life and my entire career to helping animals.  However, I'll never come close to the dedication this group displays over and over again.  They are the first call I make when I come across an animal in need, and they are the first place I go when I'm ready to adopt a pet myself.  I just cannot say enough about this group, its volunteers, its mission and its great success in helping animals.  
Voiceless-MI	165900		/users/profile/220398	Animalresourcecenter A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/22/2013	I am a President of a cat rescue, but also the sole member. As such, my funds and abilities are very limited. I received a call from an elderly woman at a trailer park who had been feeding a small cloud of feral cats, yet the park was now telling her she had to stop. What would happen to the cats and kittens? We were able to trap the cats, but it was Voiceless who provided the much needed spaying and neutering for them.  With that done, we were able to work with others to find barns for some and others went into socialization programs for adoption. It was Voiceless who prevented these cats from being euthanized and to safety.
Voiceless-MI	107942		/users/profile/146621	Patience M.	Donor	5	03/16/2012	I have donated to Voiceless MI several times and they are always one of the first on my list.  Not only do they rescue dogs n need giving them the care they need and find them great homes, they work at the source of the problem by funding spay/neuter programs.  As the old saying goes 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'.  This is something the shelters and humane societies need to take note of.  It is far less expensive and humane to prevent the birth of unwanted pups and kittens than to kill them because there are no homes.    We need to educate and help people and this group does a great job!  They are on the front lines working to make Michigan a truly humane state.  Also, they don't waste a DIME of any donation.  No salaries or benefits here.  The volunteers are truly dedicated.
Voiceless-MI	56493		/users/profile/59003	techess	Donor	5	11/08/2010	These guys are awesome.  Many rescues only try to find homes for the many unwanted unloved pets in the area.  Voiceless-MI goes a step further.  They fund many spay and neuter programs to help reduce the unwanted pet population and they work hard with the Michigan Congress and Senate to get them to pass legislature that will protect the voiceless animals of Michigan from inhumane treatment.They also raise money for worthy causes like getting comfortable pet beds for animals already in shelters.  
Voiceless-MI	49011	8	/users/profile/50262	robin19	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2010	It has been my pleasure to help Voiceless-MI where I can.  For example, I have given them dog bowls and beds for a shelter that had none, helped fund veterinary services for foster dogs, and donated items for their wildly successful yard sales.  But in reality, they have helped me far more than I have ever helped them.  They helped a dog named Mikki who was looking for a home (and whom I was trying to help) get some much needed exposure.  They helped me find a foster home for a homeless senior beagle... a foster home that led to a permanent home (her new family named her Matilda).  They helped me make a plan when I found a lost MinPin wandering my neighborhood in the middle of winter.  In that case, Spike's daddy found us the next morning, but if he hadn't, I know they would have helped me with him.  These are just a few examples.Voiceless-MI has one of the best multifaceted approaches that I have ever seen in a grassroots organization. All of their actions serve as proof of their beliefs, values, and goals. They foster and find homes for animals who are at risk in other facilities because they recognize there are animals who need help right away.  They make it easier for people to keep their animals with them (and out of shelters) by helping with veterinary costs and by educating people about pet care/ownership.  Voiceless-MI understands that fewer unplanned litters mean fewer animals needing homes.  To that end, they are working with All About Animals Rescue to offer low cost spay & neuter opportunities to people in mid-Michigan  transportation included! They work well with many other organizations, both large and small, and understand the value of networking and cooperation. They have been instrumental in gathering support for, and educating the public on, various pieces of animal welfare legislation... and getting that legislation passed.  In short, Voiceless-MI knows that by using a variety of approaches, they can truly become a voice for the voiceless.  And I will continue to help and support them whenever I can.
Voiceless-MI	48892	6	/users/profile/50104	fauverjo	Volunteer	5	07/29/2010	Voiceless-MI (Voiceless in Michigan) is a group of very dedicated animal lovers who want to give a voice to the animals who cannot speak for themselves.  As a volunteer, I have come into close contact with a number of animals that other groups either could not or would not take in. Voiceless stepped up and helped.Our latest foster, Lilly, is an older English Mastiff who was turned in at a shelter in Indiana.  She was severely underweight, Heartworm positive, and quite a mess.  With acceptance into Voiceless as a foster, we drove to Indiana to get her and brought her home.  As she got used to her new environment (food, shelter and love), she has become a wonderful and energetic dog, and has added 30 pounds to the skin-and-bones body we rescued.  In the 3 months we have fostered her, she has undergone the very expensive Heartworm treatment, a couple rounds of de-worming (Tapeworms - yech!), and will soon be ready to be spayed. Voiceless has graciously picked up the tab to bring this older girl back to full health.  (Lilly became such a great part of our family that we've adopted her, giving her a "forever home" to live the rest of her life in peace.)Over the time that we have worked with Voiceless, we have come to know the founders of the group very well.  They are very dedicated to the welfare of the animal, and will only adopt to someone who will properly care for the animal.  Voiceless will reject an applicant if they are unable to provide the right care for the animal - in other words, Voiceless does everything it can to ensure that the animal being adopted will never again come to any harm.In short, Voiceless is a wonderful organization doing lots of great things with hardly any resources.

Voiceless-MI	48847	6	/users/profile/50056	momtokiwi	Donor	5	07/28/2010	Voiceless-MI is a comprehensive animal rights and rescue organization.  They are key in the sharing of timely and critical information on legislation affecting our pets in Michigan.  Even if they are not directly involved in something, I have been able to get answers to my questions through them and their willingness to find out the answers for people.  It is that dedication that made me want to be a donor.  They also helped me with a personal "pet" project to find rescue for a pet that had been dumped at 11 years old.  They recently took in a lovely pit bull with heartworm and are committed to his treatment and recovery.  In other words, they really focus on what they can do to help regardless of the breed.  The volunteers in this group work days, nights, weekends on behalf of this cause.  They are effective, quick, responsive and organized - all of the hallmarks of a great non-profit!
Voiceless-MI	48811	4	/users/profile/50014	patience	Donor	5	07/28/2010	Voiceless-MI provides a much needed voice for those who cannot speak.  Not only do they help animals in need and assist with low cost neuter/ spay, they also encourage others to help animals by speaking up for a change in the laws.  They provide timely information to help voters contact their elected officials and let their voices be heard on behalf of animals and the people who care for them.  I plan on donating to them again and truly appreciate what they do for the dogs and cats in this state.

People dump their pets and I can't stand watching an animal suffer, so I try to help. Voiceless has been a constant resource with service and advice for the stray cats I've encountered. They have solid connections with veterinary care and shelters, and have helped me multiple times when I capture a cat that needs help. Without their help, I couldn't have spayed/neutered and placed any of the cats that have sought shelter in my yard. They deserve recognition for all they do.

Voiceless-MI	48741	1	/users/profile/49922	tiff	Client Served	4	07/26/2010	My husband and I had been looking for a cat for our daughter.  I think its a good thing to have your kids grow up with animals.  We had been looking on line and a number of adoption sites and on craigs list when we found Kit.  She had a very touching story, she was a stray that had been taken in and had lost a litter of kittens to some feral cats.  The young woman who had her was apart of the voiceless group and told us how much the re homing fee was.  That was what had decided it for us, we couldn't afford to buy all the things we needed for a new cat and 150.00 adoption fee. Kit had been fixed and had all her shots up to date.  We decided to think on it one night and give her time to say goodbye.  We spent the day buying stuff for Kit, all the essentials and a few things to hopefully make her feel at home.  The next morning we picked her up and brought her home.  It took her a few days to get used to her new home but now she is part of the family.

I can't say enough about what ASK does for the otherwise forgotten, of ALL Species -- from dogs on chains 24/7 in some hidden backyard to an abandoned goose in a public park to an injured turtle on a highway.  A simply remarkable organization that I cannot say enough about. 
All Species Kinship	184732	3	/users/profile/140673	Jim_7	Donor	5	10/29/2013	A remarkable organization.  Directly helps ALL species of animals, as its name suggests.  Its outreach to dogs kept outside 24/7 is what truly has impressed me.  Volunteers literally patrol neighborhoods looking for dogs with inadequate shelter or who are otherwise in questionable conditions.  Volunteers will knock on doors and offer free food, straw, shelter, chews, etc., not to mention education.  So many of these dogs so found are later taken inside by the guardians and become members of a family, all because of ASK .

All Species Kinship	255714	1	/users/profile/344095	Staci M.	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Absolutely the best at what they do! They are incredibly passionate and caring. They helped me rescue and regime a dog from deplorable conditions and near starvation. Without A.S.K. many animals like that dog would be suffering or dead. 
All Species Kinship	255711	1	/users/profile/139623	Andrea K.	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	A.S.K is the definition of a top-notch organization. They are all about the animals and will do anything they can to help.  They have helped me personally more times than I can count on two hands! The world is a better place because of A.S.K!
All Species Kinship	104148	2	/users/profile/139623	Andrea K.	Client Served	5	01/22/2012	I came across All Species Kinship about a month ago. I had found 2 domestic ducks at a local park, one of which had a broken bill that I was afraid wouldn't be able to survive the winter without assistance. I called numerous people/organizations in my area for help without any luck. I called All Species Kinship and left a message- not really expecting to be called back after the luck I had up to that point. I was wrong! They not only called me back that same day, they said they would take both ducks, no questions asked! They even met me half-way (I live about 2 hours away from the sanctuary) to pick up the ducks and take them to the sanctuary. They took both ducks to an avian vet the very next day and have provided updates as well as pictures of the two ducks for me. This is just one of MANY great stories of A.S.K. All Species Kinship has changed and continues to change the lives of SO many animals thanks to your donations and the wonderful A.S.K volunteers. 100% of your donations go directly to the animals. The All Species Kinship volunteers do all of the work they do out of the goodness of their hearts because of their love for animals. We need more organizations like All Species Kinship. They truly are angels and do amazing work!
All Species Kinship	255701	1	/users/profile/344081	manetane1981	Donor	5	09/09/2015	ASK is a HUGE voice for the animals in our community....selfless, tireless and deserving volunteers continue to be a valuable resource concerning local wildlife, educating owners about proper care and most of all..providing insurmountable relief to animals in distress :-)

All Species Kinship	255685	1	/users/profile/344064	Jennifer466	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2015	A.S.K is always there when an animal is in need. No matter the day or time. It's such a relief to know that an organization such as A.S.K operates in a community such as Battle Creek. However, don't let that fool you as  they will travel all over in order to save/rescue an animal in need.  If you come upon an animal and are not sure what to do, just A.S.K.
All Species Kinship	255657	2	/users/profile/344035	Tony.G	Donor	5	09/09/2015	All Species Kinship is a marvelous and unique group totally dedicated to improving the lives of all sentient beings. They provide veterinary care, including spay and neuter, to low-income pet owners as well as distributing toys, shelter, and food. They provide education and motivation for owners to interact with and enhance the lives of their pets. Along with this street outreach, they offer a rescue service for injured wildlife and operate a large animal sanctuary. They are a wonderful group and it is a privilege to live in an area with such an extraordinary organization.  We give them as much financial support as we possibly can and are happy to feel that we are contributing in a small way to this excellent non-profit.

All Species Kinship	255643	1	/users/profile/344027	sybilmpd	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2015	This group is amazing.  They truly practice what they preach.    About 9 years ago, I was living in the city.  My dogs were in the fenced in back yard.  ASK was doing some outreach in my neighborhood and came up to talk to me.  They asked about my dogs and were happy to hear that they were inside dogs - just out enjoying the day.  :-)  Just two years ago, I adopted two senior dogs from them that were in desparate need - chained up outside 24/7 in the winter.  I have donated items as well as cash when I can.  ASK is a very valuable asset in our community!!
All Species Kinship	255642	2	/users/profile/344026	Yvonne23	Donor	5	09/09/2015	I love A.S.K., I wish I could do more for them and I wish people would do more for them, They deserve so much for what they do in the community and most of all for the animals. 
All Species Kinship	255640	1	/users/profile/344024	EmilyPP	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2015	I feel like A.S.K. is constantly sharing an educational story about helping animals.  From helping turtles across the road, to financial assistance in spaying/neutering dogs, I have no idea how they do everything that they do.  Even with a background in animal health I feel I am regularly learning something new from them.  What a powerful organization, doing right by all critters.  THANK YOU.    
All Species Kinship	255638	1	/users/profile/344022	Cody2	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	ASK is always quick to respond whenever needed. They help countless animals every day through direct action or giving advise. 
All Species Kinship	255637	2	/users/profile/344020	SunScooby	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	I volunteer for All Species Kinship. They help underprivileged dogs get the free meds, houses, vet care, etc. that they need to have a decent, healthy life. They also rescue wildlife, and transport to vets across the country. So many animals, and humans, benefit from this organization. Sophia, Kathe and their crew are amazing and dedicated. This world is lucky to have A.S.K. !!!

The fact that they continue to check in on the families and offer support and products and to keep everyone safe and improve their quality of life is amazing.  
All Species Kinship	255628	2	/users/profile/344011	LKeller	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2015	All Species Kinship has been a great part of our community. They not only focus on helping animals but also they focus on the education of the human factor. They have come to our classrooms and spoken to our youth and they continue to educate out on the street every day without being rude. The volunteers understand the area they provide aid and they are always willing to help any type of animal out. I  have been volunteering with animal rescue for over 10 years and no other rescue in the area values the education piece as much as they do. 
All Species Kinship	252141	2	/users/profile/340186	karzoo1970	Volunteer	5	08/08/2015	This group is very proactive in improving the lives of dogs that live outside.  They provide food, new dog houses, collars , treats and toys to improve their lives.  They educate owners and the public not only about dogs, but also wildlife.   I have learned much from them.  
All Species Kinship	252123	2	/users/profile/340165	Joeir	Donor	5	08/07/2015	All Species Kinship does some pretty awesome things in Michigan. They assist dog owners with food , spay/neuter, light weight cable tie - outs, Igloo dog houses, flies-off, toys and treats. More importantly, they educate dog owners about compassion for animals and work hard to get outdoor 24/7 chained dogs integrated indoors with the family. This is all done in a kind , patient fashion. A.S.K. Is a 100%. Volunteer organization. No one gets paid. It is funded strictly by like -minded donors.  I appreciate all that these volunteers do , in very extreme weather conditions, on behalf of the animals. State-wide wild animal rescue is also a part of what A. S. K . does. My eyes have been opened and my heart has been changed because of this wonderful organization. All Species Kinship is changing the world...one animal at a time. 
All Species Kinship	252108	2	/users/profile/340149	Lyd79	Volunteer	5	08/07/2015	The people with ASK make a world of difference in our community. So many needless deaths would happen without the food, doghouses, hay, and education that they provide. Wonderful nonprofit. 
All Species Kinship	252081	1	/users/profile/340115	Debra76	Donor	5	08/07/2015	If you need any advice at any time about any type of animal call A.S.K. Some one will always come up with the answer or a suggestion. We the people and animals of Battle Creek are very lucky to have these folks. They never stop working with the ones they know about and they never stop looking for those who need help. Thank You from deep in my heart. Makes me proud to live in a town with such a wonderful group
All Species Kinship	248447	1	/users/profile/336171	pooboo	General Member of the Public	5	07/14/2015	I had a question real late last night about one of my dogs, i didnt know who to talk to about her, so i thougjt about my news feed and what i see this organization do for all these dogs, by chance i sent a message hoping for someone to answer. I instantly got an answer and lots of reassurance that my dog will be ok, so who ever i talked to late last night and even early this morning, i have to say thank you for being so helpful, it was simply advice that i needed and i guess comfort. Thanks for all the hands on things you do for the animals and the advice and education for the pet owners. Thanks for everything.
All Species Kinship	248410	1	/users/profile/336131	danna7	Donor	5	07/14/2015	What an amazing organization that does direct outreach of every animal.  People from all over the world call for advice.  I am so very proud of the work that these individuals do and supportive of their efforts and delighted that they are located in Battle Creek, Michigan.  Great job!
All Species Kinship	247201	2	/users/profile/334698	kgordonlove	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2015	A.S.K. is an amazing group. They are so knowledgeable and they are extremely active and proactive in helping all animals. They are caring and interested and hardworking. I love the work they do to help hurt animals, both wild and domestic, but my favorite thing they do is go into the community to find the sad and lonely dogs that are chained, cold, hungry, and sick and HELP THEM.  They recently were able to help and rescue a dog that was chained 14 years!! These animals would continue to suffer without a voice if not for A.S.K.  They are fantastic.

All Species Kinship	247149	3	/users/profile/334638	Cindy178	General Member of the Public	5	07/02/2015	I have been following A.S.K via their facebook page for quite some time.  I cannot say enough for what these people do. They earn no pay. What they do they do out of the goodness of their hearts and their love for all kinds of animals.  Some of the pictures I have seen {the first initial picture when they first visit a client and their pet} would tear and rip at your heartstrings. Those pictures are usually followed up by their after visits {and what they have done to help the animal in need} which makes my heart happy that there are people like these who really do care and do what they can to help all animals in need. Many many times I have said over the months " I wish I had lots of money cause I would definitely donate it to A.S.K" Unfortunately I don't have lots of money, but I do know a woman who has a yard sale every year for this cause, and she asks for household donations for the yard sale. Every penny she makes off the sale goes to A.S.K. I donated a huge amount of household items to her with hope and prayer that she would make a nice amount of money to donate to this awesome cause.  They really are a great bunch of people doing all they humanly can to help these animals. God Bless everyone of them! 
All Species Kinship	232756	2	/users/profile/296351	krysten.swihart	Client Served	5	11/03/2014	This nonprofit is exceptional in every way. They leave nothing to chance when it comes to the animals they serve. They not only educate, but offer services and supplies for free to ensure the comfort and safety of animals, and then they follow up with them at a later date.  Without A.S.K. and their dedicated team of rescuers, we wouldn't have our sweet girl dog. Their tireless work saved her from a lonely and painful life, and our family is extremely grateful. I cannot say enough positive things about A.S.K. and the work they do.
All Species Kinship	232625	2	/users/profile/296175	crazycatladylw	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2014	A.S.K. is an absolutely amazing nonprofit that works tirelessly to protect, save, and rehabilitate all species.  And the tremendous work they do not only touches animals lives, but human lives as well, especially through their outreach programs.  They are true animal heroes that are making the world a better place for all through kindness to animals!
All Species Kinship	232592	2	/users/profile/240766	Angela73	Donor	5	11/02/2014	I have never experienced an organization like ALL SPECIES KINSHIP. They provide great education for guardian's and a lot of free services for improving the life of all species. Bully breed dogs are in great need for services. Their lives are improved on the spot. The organization is like none other. I give them much praise for going above and beyond to help all species! !

All Species Kinship	222177	1	/users/profile/285867	Shannon80	Volunteer	5	10/13/2014	ASK is one of the most unique organization that I've ever known of or volunteered for! They help almost all species of animals in Calhoun County with some services extended throughout the whole state and the occasional help in other states.  They also have a sanctuary for some animals that would have been a casualty of the euthanasia. They service anywhere from 500 to 700 dogs weekly with emergency relief supplies while educating the owners, if needed,  to better care for their companion. ASK is a nonprofit organization that operates by unpaid volunteers and very little overhead to ensure that as many animals can be reached as possible! My family enjoys giving our time for such a beautiful organization. 
All Species Kinship	221534	1	/users/profile/285224	Linda302	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I have two separate reviews.   Earlier in the summer,  I emailed for advice for a friend who had a turtle lay eggs in her yard.  What to do?   A prompt reply indicated to do nothing and leave the area undisturbed.  That is what they did.   And one day the eggs and turtles were gone. Another time I asked about the legalities of treats being poisoned on a wetland area.   Again,  a very prompt response with information. This is a great group.   I follow the Facebook page,  which is constantly reminding us of the proper way to interact with wildlife when it appears inured.   I was also able to share information on the hazards of feeding bread to duck ks at parks with out local paper.   They took the information and turned i t into a great reminder to the public to feed the Ducks properly. The outreach program is great too.  I would advise anyone to support this group!

Thank you for everything!!!
All Species Kinship	191975	1	/users/profile/250593	Jill59	Volunteer	5	01/02/2014	I first came across All Species Kinship a few years ago when working to rescue some pot bellied pigs.  They were considered to me to be a contact then as I was volunteering with a rabbit rescue at the time.  In time I investigated their web site and developed a respect for their mission and approach and started following them on Facebook.  I sent my first donation and they bought a dog house with it and even mailed me photos of the lucky recipient.  I remember posting that if I ever recognized my dream of having a rescue I would model it after them.  Go figure, another downriver rescue did...  Since that time I have received education, support and encoragement for a sick raccoon, a horse without shelter, a goat on a tether and 2 turtles.  No they didnt do it for me, they gave me the tools to make a difference through education.  In 2013 I was honored to finally be able to fill a transport need they had for some rabbits.  They are phenomenal.

Their response was very fast and extremely helpful. However,  I was most impressed with how knowledgeable they are. I am also in awe of their online/facebook presence. They go above and beyond to educate the public and what and what NOT to do when wild animals cross their path. I can say I have personally learned a lot about wildlife that I never knew just from following their facebook page. A lot of that I have been able to share and educate others.  A great organization with a lot of dedication!!! And not just dedicated to wildlife but also reach out to the unfortunate and unwanted animals that they run across in their journeys. Truly a voice for the voiceless!

ASK is highly responsive to their community's needs and plays a MUCH NEEDED role in the community.  Their methods and policies are responsible and always provide the absolute best for both domestic animals and wildlife.  They are comprised of a highly dedicated group of animal advocates.  As a member of the animal welfare community, I am proud to recommend them!
All Species Kinship	185646	2	/users/profile/242614	echeryl11	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	They were very quick to respond to my dilemma of an escaping pit bull in the neighborhood who was scaring all the neighbors.

They help by making their life outside a little less like hell on earth in my opinion.  They also educate the owners to try and make them see their dog would be happier inside.    I first heard about them through Facebook and ever since I have donated to them and bought them items from their wishlist.   They also help wildlife.   I don't know how they do it day in and day out, but they do and I think they are fantastic!!!!!

My husband would leave food out and she knew where to come to get fed.  When they started chaining her out we would go down and feed her and make sure she had water everyday.  She was very scared and didn't know how to react to someone being nice to her.  We heard about ASK and called them.  They brought her straw for the dog house and left her treats.  When we were finally able to talk the owners into giving her up ASK took her and she is now living a life like she deserves.  They still have her and and she has a friend to keep her company.  If any organization deserves to be noticed and funded it is this one.  They are excellent and have helped many many animals out.  We are very grateful to them for what they did for our neighbors dog.  Please if you can help them out don't hesitate.  Your money will go far to help them help our furry friends

All Species Kinship	156989		/users/profile/208199	Pamela38	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2013	I am on FB quite often and  happened to  read about ASK-I really  liked what I read and  have even  commented a few times  about programs they have.I am about to launch our third year of a local fundraiser we have here in Lansing called B.F.F. (Best Friends Fest) which raises money for Ingham County AnimalControl & Shelter.After reading every post  on FB, I decided to call A.S.K. and invite them to do  a presentation at  our fundraiser in July. Sophia graciously accepted and we are now  looking forward  to "working " together!
All Species Kinship	152295		/users/profile/139445	escatty	Donor	5	04/05/2013	I donate to All Species Kinship because I know that the volunteers are dedicated and tireless in helping chained dogs in the city and rescuing wild animals and birds.  They spend countless hours capturing domestic ducks and geese that are abandoned by their owners.  They are often called in the coldest weather and at all hours to bring these birds and animals to a safe location where they will get food and shelter.  The dogs of the city are very grateful to ASK for all they do to provide food and shelter and most of all to educate the owners so that they will understand what these dogs need.  
All Species Kinship	104046	2	/users/profile/139445	escatty	Donor	5	01/21/2012	I have known one of the founders of ASK for many years.  She has devoted her life to saving dogs that are hard to place in new homes because of the prejudice against Pit Bulls and Rottweilers.  She spends her weekends taking dog houses, straw bales, and food to the inner city dogs that are chained outside with little or no shelter.  She does much to educate the owners of these dogs to improve the dogs' lives.  The work ASK does for dogs and wildlife is very important and their members sacrifice their time and money to help these animals.  I donate to ASK because I know that my dollars are used wisely and help the animals.  
All Species Kinship	149243		/users/profile/198837	1Philanthropist	Donor	5	02/11/2013	I donate to All Species Kinship (A.S.K.) because they are an efficiently operated nonprofit operating services that are unique to Southwest Michigan. I was impressed to learn, and put to use, their toll-free hotline that really is available 24/7 and holidays! I called on a Sunday, very early in the morning to request help for ailing injured farm goose. ASK responded quickly, despite it being a weekend, and they got the goose vet care. They sent me a report about the goose, and still continue to keep me updated. Their professionalism and capacity to follow-through is really remarkable for an volunteer group.  I have continued to use their services to report neglected dog concerns. There is simply no one else that would reach out to the most risky of neighborhoods, to help a dog. I am inspired to be a better person by their work, and I donate monthly. 
All Species Kinship	104900		/users/profile/140770	DearbornPond	Client Served	5	01/30/2012	The pond at my place of work often has unwanted domestic ducks dropped off by people who no longer wish to care for them. Unfortunately being flightless means they can't survive in the wild. I had run out of options for these 2 domestic ducks - one with a hurt wing and one with a fishing line wrapped around it's leg - but A.S.K. was there to offer assistance when I wasn't able to find anyone else who would. It's obvious that they are dedicated to their mission and stay true to what they do. And despite being busy with many other rescues they were willing to go out of their way to help. Wonderful people.
All Species Kinship	104131		/users/profile/139585	PA105	Donor	5	01/22/2012	The work that A.S.K. does is essential - educating animal owners to better care for their pets and other animals; providing shelter, warmth, and food to animals who remain with their owners; and rescuing and offering safe and suitable shelter for abandoned animals. The folks of A.S.K. work extremely hard, have enormous hearts, and do great work.
All Species Kinship	104108	1	/users/profile/139540	Thayo	Client Served	5	01/22/2012	    A.S.K. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization operating direct-outreach services throughout Southern Michigan, with an emphasis on urban neighborhoods of Battle Creek.  Unlike other local animal welfare groups, one hundred percent of all contributions directly benefit local animals in need. Donations are never spent on office supplies or salaries. I have used the services of this exemplary group on several occasions, mostly as it relates to wildlife rescue. On each occasion they acted promptly, professionally and humanely. No animal, wild or domestic, is unimportant to these people. If, for some reason, they are unable to assist, they provide alternate resources for the public to contact. I prefer to keep my donation dollars local, and All Species Kinship is the Number One animal welfare organization that receives my dollars and praise. 
All Species Kinship	104018	1	/users/profile/139374	Julie40	General Member of the Public	5	01/20/2012	I live on a lake.  Last Spring, someone dumped three domestic, pet ducks off on my lake.  They were having a hard time finding food and clearly wanted some love and affection as well.  I fed them bread and they ate right out of my hands.  After doing some inquiry, I discovered they had been pets purchased around Easter and dumped on the lake once they had grown.  I called A.S.K. for help.  They came out right away, despite the long drive.  It was an incredible experience.  The A.S.K. volunteers gently captured two of the ducks right away.  However, the third duck was a bit more difficult.  The volunteer actually dove in the cold water with his net and came up with the duck tucked safely in the net.  I was amazed.  They spent time answering my questions and were very kind to the ducks.  Soon after the rescue, A.S.K. e-mailed me pictures of "my" ducks and filled me in on how they were adjusting to their new home.  They continue to post pictures for me and to answer all of my questions.  I highly recommend them.
All Species Kinship	103790	1	/users/profile/138891	petssave	Client Served	5	01/18/2012	A.S.K. responded quickly to a call I made regarding what I thought was an injured fawn. The fawn was found by my dog in the backyard, near a fence, during the evening.  My call was returned very quickly despite it being a weekend and at night. The person who responded identified themselves as a biologist and they were very throuogh. They emailed me a help sheet and talked me through the steps listed on it once I had it before me.  It turned out that I just needed to be more patient and wait to see if a parent came back to the fawn. While I wasn't too comfortable with leaving it alone, the volunteer assured me that I was doing the right thing. The help sheet she provided was very detailed and actually did make me feel more comfortable not taking any action to remove the fawn. The next day I kept an eye on fawn and was lucky enough to see its parent come back and get it. I was advised to keep my dog away from the area which might have helped the deer to come back. I learned a lot in this phone call and from the help sheet and was impressed that the volunteer would even come to my home had we needed her to. A.S.K. was professional and helpful! They are such saviors for wildlife!
World Animal Awareness Society	321930		/users/profile/415488	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/23/2017	Brilliant documentation of animal related issues, unbiased, yet creatively told, through the lens of a camera. The cameraman, Tom McPhee, has an eye for the art of pictorial storytelling. His favorite sidekick, Deanna Vollano, keeps the organization running smoothly, as she coordinates the organizations activities and volunteers. Their mission, unbiased reporting of animal related issues, has an underlying goal to bring humans together, and inspire an opportunity for solutions. The World Animal Awareness Society gives hope to those that have no voice, and a possibility to save the dwindling habitats and animal populations around the world. It was a great honor and privilege to volunteer for WA2S, to contribute and to be part of the team.

World Animal Awareness Society	319145	1	/users/profile/410502	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2016	Our Non-profit Animal Rescue organization "Tescatame" recently held a MASH style spay-neuter clinic for 400 dogs and cats in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, in partnership with Caribbean Spay Neuter and the team of Vet Drs., Techs and  volunteers who travelled to the DR for this purpose, paying for their expenses and donating their hard work and expertise for the benefit of the animals in need.WA2S sent their team to Punta Cana, they paid for all their expenses and accompanied us during the clinic, filming the different stages of it and interviewing the Vet Drs, Techs and Volunteers.We at Rescatame Punta Cana (www.rescatame.org) are very happy about the videos filmed and produced by WA2S during our October 2016 Punta Cana spay-neuter clinic and feel that they are helping spread the word about our organization and the work we do to help the stray animals in Punta Cana.
World Animal Awareness Society	318340		/users/profile/409498	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	11/05/2016	Noticed they posted some incorrect information with a video.  Others commented for the same reason.   They would only reply with answers like "No, we wouldn't put that".   Even with copying and pasting from their own message they would admit to no wrong doing and just tried to belittle with snide comments in return.  They shouldn't be telling a story if they don't want to use correct information.   Zero integrity.

He is sincerely interested in improving the way we all can assist controlling the stray dog population problem in the world, and he recognizes the possibility that the low -cost injectable castration with calcium chloride in alcohol can and will really make a difference. His crew is ready to record volunteer veterinarians, technicians, rescuers and caregivers at work; and not just the technical stuff; he is working towards a reporting that will show the world the need for this kind of work. We are looking forward to being of assistance to the great work Tom, his crew and his non-profit are doing.

I have had the pleasure of working with Tom and Deanna in the arena drawing attention to the plight of the neglected, abused, discarded, and those of us that love and fight for them. The role of WA2S is detrimental in today's world.  Is it up to us, as humans, to draw attention, advocate and educate to end the pain and suffering to the creatures of this world. They balance out every aspect of these important issues in their array of documentaries and endeavors. I speak for many Animal Advocates when stating how grateful we are for the candid honesty, indepth perspective, and most of all compassion for telling the stories of the voiceless. Because they need to be heard, and there are far too few humans who speak for them.

Most of the time, the public get the information, regarding animal rescue operations, from animal welfare organizations involved on the fields operations, sometimes organizations have political interest; and not always all of the information gets to the general public. I think that the Animal Awareness Society is fulfilling a critical niche by acting as a third party, broadcasting reliable information to animals lovers around the world.  Marcos Polanco

World Animal Awareness Society	162464	3	/users/profile/215639	roadcase	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2013	My name is Bill Gabbard. I was FOH Director of Operations for  6 weeks at Hurricane Katrina, LSU  Animal-Rescue Command Post. I also founded the  group: Japan Earthquake Animal Rescue and Support, which acted as the internationally-recognized, leading communication lifeline to the world during the immediate, post-disaster rescue-efforts, as well as the first, biggest, and longest running, ongoing support-effort on the island, providing support for the local-rescues.   I was introduced to Tom, (and how he rolls), when he called, stated that he wanted to come to Fukushima to get our story, ....and then within a matter of hours..he did-so!  In the world of organizing rescue help and support, someone who can document your situation or story, and then relay that message to the world,... is probably the single most important connection/friend  you can make.  This is a man and an organization who get-in , and get the story,  ...and then they get that  story to the people who can act-on it, and actually make a vital difference. Conversely, if the story is fluid, or changes..they follow that too.  They are literally the ESPN of the animal-world.   WA2S is simply all-business. They are not waiting until  the story fits into "Anderson's" schedule. They are not sitting around until all the accommodations are in place and "Wolf's deli-tray" has arrived...like the mega-media outlets tend to do.  Currently, there is nothing that even comes-close to what Tom and his team are doing at WA2S....nothing that is acting-on  what's going on RIGHT NOW..in the animal-world. This is not a news-outlet that will run the obligatory animal-story... if it will turn a profit.They are an unbiased, non-profit organization that can bring the bright-spotlight to the real issues, which gets word-out, and  the ball-rolling.... to affect a real change. In closing, I was very impressed with Tom's vision, what WA2S is doing, and what they hope to do in the future. I firmly believe that they will do what they say. :)

They joined with our non-profit in a time of need and volunteered help during one of our oil spill surveys and at a very crucial time.  The professional connections which they helped us foster were invaluable in helping us with almost instant credibility with the major media corporations and other production companies.
World Animal Awareness Society	146228	31	/users/profile/192939	Scott47	Volunteer	5	12/08/2012	Thank you for listening and actually doing something to help get to the truth about what is happening not only here in the Gulf but also other ecologically troubled spots that need the sterilizing light of national attention.  Thanks for helping us to continue the investigations.

As a rescue volunteer and healthcare professional, I have seen many human/animal junctions, interractions and have asked myself some pretty powerful questions, along my pathway of self discovery. Any and every response you have, whatever you learn, observe or commit to........keep watching. Never shield yourself from all lives, all species and all humanity.......

I was writing a piece on the online mini-series produced by the "A2WS" executive director Tom McPhee. Subsequently doing research on the project I was pleased to find that The World Animal Awareness Society is a great organization with a great cause. I whole heartedly support their efforts to save animal lives and would recommend the charity to anyone with a philanthropic bone in their body.

We have had a great experience interacting with the World Animal Awareness Society. We have watched the census work in the city of Detroit & found it refreshing to have an objective look at the stray issue in the city. Detroit Bully Corps has worked with WA2S on a few projects & we also participated in the Town hall meeting hosted by WA2S. I find the work that WA2S does to be objective, distinct & refreshing. WA2S certainly has the endorsement of Detroit Bully Corps. Sincere Regards,William J. BellotiieDetroit Bully Corps- Director of Operations
World Animal Awareness Society	160100	5	/users/profile/212329	Carols Ferals	Client Served	5	06/09/2013	My organization, Carol's Ferals was the lucky recipient of a contest sponsored by World Animal Awareness Society to help us increase our online presence through social media.  Being a hardcore rescuer and not well versed in all the ins and outs of Google applications and all that entails, WA2S Executive Director, Tom McPhee came to spend a full day and a half training myself and my social media consultant on how to boost awareness of our group's mission to End Feline Overpopulation in West Michigan through community education and empowerment.  With our mission specifically geared toward Trap-Neuter-Return and with education of the masses being of GREAT importance, the award given to us by WA2S is invaluable.  Tom worked closely beside us and trained us on the next phase of our reaching out to the people who we need to make a difference I our communities.  There is no way that we could have figured this out on our own.  Why is this so important to my organization?  Because it's the FUTURE!  And the insight provided by Tom and the insertion of his message into my brain is going to make it possible for my organization to get its message out as the ever-changing social media landscape changes.

World Animal Awareness Society	147323	27	/users/profile/194639	mujib	Volunteer	5	12/27/2012	Animals of the world are seriously surviving to keep their existence. Modernization and industrialization have become a symbol of threat to lead their life here. To help these animals there are very few organizations who has come forward to turn this wary and warm full world into the safest shelter for animal. After watching their activities through all of their videos, it has come to my mind that WA2S is an outstanding organization that is determined to assist animals live in peace. I think the benevolent service they are providing is only possible by them who have great heart full of affections to animals.

World Animal Awareness Society	147284	30	/users/profile/194577	RobertFelts	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/26/2012	**THIS IS THE UPDATE TO A REVIEW THAT HAS SINCE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS WEBSITE.  I WELCOME ANY RESPONSE FROM TOM MCPHEE, CHAIRMAN OF WA2S, IF HE CAN REFUTE ANY OF THE FACTS CONTAINED HEREIN** *Originally posted 12-24-12*          Tom McPhee, Founder, Chairman of the Board and Executive Director of The World Animal Awareness Society, owes me money. I was laid off by Tom McPhee a little over two years ago -- shortly after the events recounted in the @evolotuspr review below. He had been paying me late for months, then reduced checks, then reduced late checks, until finally he wasn't paying me at all. Now, it's my fault for not leaving when I saw the writing on the wall. Still, I did legitimate work for Mr. McPhee and the WA2S for months while Tom's promises of better days (and back pay) never came true. He laid me off owing me $4000 -- he even signed a contract saying as such. Not even any interest charged, or setting any defined time to keep up his end of the bargain -- just a straight up $4000. Over the course of the next year, he paid me $300, and it was like pulling teeth just to get that much. The last time I talked to Tom McPhee was about a year ago, on Facebook. I had bills to pay too, and sick of Tom's excuses for non-payment, I demanded a more structured payment schedule. He basically told me to get bent. That was a year ago, and in the months since, he has not made a move to get me one red cent of what he owes me. I've moved on. It's not worth it to sue, and even if I did, he probably wouldn't pay me. However, as a remnant of my time at WA2S, I'm still subscribed to their Youtube channel. I saw there a video of Tom McPhee "Pimping" WA2S for P4A. In the video's description was a link to this website, proclaiming that WA2S was a "Top-Rated Non-Profit" for 2012. That got me angry. I have not been affiliated with the group for two years. I have no idea of its current structure. For all I know, they could be doing great work. But seeing a website call them Top-Rated for anything, when I KNOW FOR A FACT THEIR CHAIRMAN OWES ME $3700 AND HAS FOR TWO YEARS, well, let's just say that irks me a bit. And for that reason, I cannot rate them any more than one star. I would give them less, but apparently, you have to give them at least one. Sincerely, Robert Felts -- FORMER Post-Production Supervisor for WA2S/Man Smiling Moving Pictures                                                                                                                                                                        *UPDATE 12-25-12* I've just exchanged text messages with Tom, & I can inform anyone reading this that the Chairman of the Board for WA2S, Tom McPhee, has RENEGED on his contract. He admits I worked for him; he admits he owes me money; and he continues to refuse to pay me.  Why? Because he's a deadbeat, and he knows it.   This is the pattern with Chairman Tom: Agree to a contract, accept the services rendered, don't live up to his end of the deal, obscure and obfuscate when the wronged-party wants their money, tell said party they can go ahead and sue but it will do them no good cuz he won't pay anyway, and then spin it in forums like this as if it's some great opportunity for him to grow as a human and organization.  Don't believe me? Just read his response to the @evolotuspr review several spots below this one. At the end of his meandering essay of a response, he admits a donor stepped forward to pay his outstanding debt. And yet, Mr. McPhee refused to pass that money along and pay off his contractually obligated debt.   Instead, he says he will let their review stand, as the "airing-out" of such "grievances" is payment enough. So, I guess you're even-stevens now? No more debt? As if the only options are between paying a legal debt and letting a web review stand!?  As I say, this is a pattern with this man. After reading my initial review that has since been removed from this website, Tom texted me on Christmas Day -- my first contact with him in over a year.  In it, Tom confirmed he was RENEGING on his contract.   I think people can now clearly see that the word of Tom McPhee means absolutely nothing.   A contract with Tom McPhee isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Tom McPhee is a serial failure who has left a trail of broken promises and bad debt across every project he's undertaken since I've known him. He's a used-car salesman with a video camera. I have reason to doubt he even cares about animals.  YOU CAN VIEW THE ORIGINAL, HANDWRITTEN CONTRACT SIGNED BY TOM MCPHEE ON MY LAST DAY WITH WA2S AT: (http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj491/ClintStarpit/Tom-Mcphee-Contract_zpsf3560a05.jpg)  (please copy & paste address in your browser, without the parenthesis of course)  Written in Tom's very own hand-writing, and witnessed by former WA2S CEO Michelle Way, you can see Chairman Tom agreed to pay me the sum of $4000 for services rendered. To date, I have received a grand total of $300 of the $4000 he owes me.   YOU CAN VIEW THE TEXTS CHAIRMAN TOM SENT ON CHRISTMAS DAY, CONFIRMING HIS RENEGING AT:  (http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj491/ClintStarpit/Screencaps/mcphee-text-message_zps900294d1.jpg) In it, you can see that Tom has gleefully and unilaterally declared his debt paid-in-full. How does he come to that conclusion? Well, obviously it's a result of me publishing this review. It's all just another opportunity for Tom and the WA2S to "mature into the powerful, responsible corporate non-profit that we expect of ourselves." What a joke! You wanna be responsible, Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board? HOW ABOUT PAYING YOUR DEBTS! I hope this is a cautionary tale for all those interested in working for, volunteering for, or considering entering any kind of relationship with Tom McPhee/WA2S. He will promise you the sky, but deliver only empty air. And when the time comes to pay the piper, he will cut you loose like you never existed. He is a man not to be trusted.   **UPDATE 2 - 12-27-12**   Tom, your silence is deafening.  Are you gonna answer these charges?  Or are you just gonna post more cookie-cutter reviews from these volunteers you've snowed into thinking you're legit? You wrote a book trying to refute (unsuccessfully) the @evolotuspr review.  Where's my book!?
World Animal Awareness Society	146369	30	/users/profile/193159	BethW	General Member of the Public	5	12/10/2012	I saw An American Opera on January 29, 2009 at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  "An American Opera" is a documentary made by Tom McPhee of World Animal Awareness Society about the crisis facing domestic animals in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  It was an amazing movie which moved me to tears, opened my eyes, and (eventually) moved me to action on behalf of another group of helpless animals.  One of the messages that I took away from "An American Opera" - and World Animal Awareness Society in general - is that you have to get out there and do something. As corny as it sounds, everyone can do something - everyone has some resource (if not money, then time or skills) that can help animals, which subsequently can make our world a better place.  I realized that I needed to utilize my professional skills to advocate on behalf of animals who do not have a voice and to make people aware of the many injustices that still face animals today.  I have always considered myself an "animal person," but after becoming aware of the amazing work done by the World Animal Awareness Society I realized how passive I was in this belief.  Tom McPhee and World Animal Awareness Society are doing important work to raise awareness of the many, many issues facing animals around the world.  I encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with the stories told by World Animal Awareness Society and then to reflect on what resources you have that you can utilize to help remedy some of the problems identified by WA2S.
World Animal Awareness Society	146139	29	/users/profile/192825	Barbara101	Donor	5	12/07/2012	I found out about this wonderful Non-profit Organization many years ago, during Katrina and the BP oil spill.  They were there on top of taking care of all the animals, who were in need. They also have gone to other areas of the World helping all animals.  All the money  donated help also with the dogs roaming in the Detroit area too! A worthy cause, that sure can use some extra money during certain times helping our, with money or to be a Volunteer! Please come to the help of our animals at join WAAS or WA2S group! Thanks to Tom and his group! God bless them for caring!   Barbara Kwiatkowska

We had the pleasure of volunteering our boat & time to take them out into the marshes to observe the effects of the oil on wildlife the birds & fish We throughly enjoyed the day & would do it again
World Animal Awareness Society	146081	22	/users/profile/192743	boyd jones	Client Served	4	12/06/2012	Winthrop University really enjoyed having Tom McPhee come to our campus. He was so great to host and really spent time w/ students getting to know them and talked to them about their concerns. We loved having Tom on campus. His presentation " A Crude Awakening: When Animals and Humans Collide" was quite interesting and the panel he brought together via skype made this a unique event as it was first time we had ever hosted a skype panel. I recommend Tom as he gives you 110 per cent and is one heck of a guy. You meet him as a lecturer you are bringing to campus, he leaves as a new "friend for life". Tom rocks!

World Animal Awareness Society	145971	9	/users/profile/165854	evolotuspr	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/05/2012	I feel obliged to mention that this organization cheated my company out of money it owed us. In 2010 we signed a contract to perform work for WA2S. We extended very favorable terms because of the nature of the organization, and agreed to allow them to pay after the work was done. However they never paid their bill, claimed they were impoverished, ignored repeated attempts to settle, and avoided collection letters. I stopped short of engaging a lawyer because as a small business it would just put us deeper in debt to collect what WA2S owed. It's the only time we've been cheated, and it's ironic that it was an "ethical" organization who did. In the meantime the organization's leader continued to travel, buy camera gear, and spend money he claimed they didn't have. It's a mystery that WA2S was named a "great nonprofit" by this site. WA2S acted dishonorably, dishonestly, and violated a legally binding contract. 
World Animal Awareness Society	145940	28	/users/profile/192558	Rachel69	Volunteer	5	12/05/2012	I have volunteered with many animal rescue organizations who always promise if there are funds they will reimburse my expenses.  Wa2s was the first to actually do that!  So when you give to Wa2s, know they don't abuse their volunteers like other groups, and this will help keep a strong group of volunteers who can created quality real unbiased information on the human / animal intersection!

World Animal Awareness Society	123865	27	/users/profile/168607	wintercomes	Donor	5	09/29/2012	I first met the founder, Tom McPhee, after he produced the award winning documentary "An American Opera" about household pets caught up in Hurricane Katrina, and have followed his work since. The World Animal Awareness Society is an amazing organization bringing to the public a vision of what happens at the intersection of humans and other living creatures, and helps raise the question of who we are as humans in relation to creatures that share the planet with us. Action must be preceded by knowledge and understanding. The WA2S brings that to us vividly and effectively.
World Animal Awareness Society	123844	27	/users/profile/168583	Ned B.	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2012	The World Animal Awareness Society is an incredible non-profit asset to our community and the animals.

World Animal Awareness Society	123842	26	/users/profile/168579	COOMISH	Volunteer	5	09/29/2012	The most impressive activity of them is their visit to Japan to get a story about the left behind pets/animals in evacuation zone in Fukushima in May 2011 after that awful earthquake/tsunami on March 11 in that year.  There was a first major demonstration in protest against Japanese government's policy to shut everybody out of those zone and doesn't allow anybody who want rescue those pets/animals.  Tom and his colleagues walked with Japanese people together and shot all about it.   It was the time most of foreign people were so afraid of radiation and didn't want to go to Japan.  I was very touched that they actually went there, recorded what's happening and shared that with world.  I strongly believe that the their role particularly in this Japan earthquake/tsunami thing has been so big. 
World Animal Awareness Society	123832	27	/users/profile/168567	Marcel M.	Client Served	5	09/29/2012	In 2010, We were looking for a unique way to fund raise and decided to approach World Animal Awareness Society to have Tom come to Nova Scotia to share with us his experiences during the animal response in the wake of hurricane Katrina in 2005. Tom brought his award winning documentary An America Opera, the Greatest Pet Rescue Ever here to a great crowd. His Q&A after the show was a hit as well. Any animal response or advocacy group would be well served to consider bringing Tom in for a showing. It was one of our most successful fundraisers thus far and we highly recommend to anyone!

World Animal Awareness Society	123829	28	/users/profile/168564	Beth49	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2012	I am an educator in the Pinckney Community Schools. My contact with Tom McPhee and the World Animal Awareness Society began several years ago. Before Mr. McPhee founded the WA2S he worked with my class on a documentary entitled "Homeless Pets: An Economic Epidemic" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MDD6AmpnXU). After he began WA2S he came to speak to another class regarding the oil spill in the Gulf. The WA2S takes animal/human interactions and shares them with the general public. I have learned about a variety of events and interactions in a objective format...I am able to share information with the children I teach. It is exactly what the title implies, "world animal awareness". 
World Animal Awareness Society	123800	28	/users/profile/168531	Kumi I.	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	Went into the zone after the great Tsunami and Earthquake in Japan with WA2S was a great experience for me. They're totally focused to the animals left behind and those people who tried to help them. 
World Animal Awareness Society	123793	28	/users/profile/168523	Mary102	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2012	I love this organization as it so eloquently chronicles the issues facing the world of animals today--not just domesticated dogs and cats, nor just strays and ferals, but information on ALL kinds of animals, and ALL types of issues.  One of the best public awareness non-profits in the world today! 
World Animal Awareness Society	123765	28	/users/profile/168493	Lori38	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2012	Tom and his team support animal equality in the world.

World Animal Awareness Society	123736	27	/users/profile/168455	Gerie M.	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2012	This organization focuses on human and non-human animal relationships and issues from a journalistic perspective. I like the extensive use of video to SHOW us the animal world far beyond our limited experience. This is a great way to enhance public awareness about other sentient beings with whom we share the earth. They too deserve to live freely and to be treated with compassion.
World Animal Awareness Society	123726	28	/users/profile/168438	Patty S.	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2012	World Animal Awareness Society is a very effective group to build the connection of all sentient beings on this beautiful planet. This planet would be much less interesting, exciting and worthwhile without the amazing animals who inhabit it with us humans. It is imperative to educate people to their essence, to their importance and to their need to be free and to thrive along with us. Just imagine a world without all the diverse animals on it- not one that i would want to live in! We must protect, save & appreciate them all. WAAS helps us to do all these things!

World Animal Awareness Society	123711	27	/users/profile/168417	Fred12	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	I have had the opportunity to volunteer with WA2S several times starting with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.  Spent two weeks in the gulf as a spotter documenter.  Took photos, embeded with private, state and federal officials for trips on the gulf visiting oiled marshland.  Conducted and filmed many interviews.   World Animal supplied me with contacts and set up visits to various facilities.  This organization also maintained a steady flow of information via regular conference calls.  I believe in "think globally, act locally".  This was a chance for me to participate in events of more than local importance.  As a result of this "expedition" I was asked to document pet recovery efforts following the massive tornado outbreak in Alabama, and to help with the stray dog census in Detroit, both in 2011.  These efforts were rewarding in that I now have a better appreciation of our collective responsibility to our "fur children'.  These have been rewarding and fullfilling experiences.

World Animal Awareness Society	123701	27	/users/profile/168405	Jenny K.	Donor	5	09/28/2012	World Animal Awareness Society is a charity that shines light on the many issues that animals face in today's complex world.  They do it with the utmost integrity and do not shy away from a difficult or controversial issue.  I have donated to this organization on different occasions and have always been confident that the donation continues the steadfast work for the benefit of the animals.  
World Animal Awareness Society	120267	27	/users/profile/163557	Deanna V.	Donor	5	08/09/2012	It is with my utmost respect for the World Animal Awareness Society that  I invite you to financially support this fine organization, as I have.  The WA2S is quite different in their endeavors than other non-profits as they remain neutral in an effort to document all sides of issues related to the human-animal intersection.  Knowledge and education are are the keys to their work.  Sometimes this can be a difficult road to travel in a world where people are encouraged and even expected to choose a side on which to be.  I applaud the WA2S for their courage and drive to tell the true story even in the face of adversity and controversy.  The work the WA2S does is important, enlightening and relevant.  To see for yourself, visit their website at www.wa2s.org.  Watch the WIRE each week for worldwide stories of the human-animal intersection!
World Animal Awareness Society	120163	27	/users/profile/163405	JayRo	Client Served	5	08/08/2012	WA2S is opening our eyes to the animal/human interaction.  What/where/how/when/why - it exposes us to all of these things and makes us take a closer look causing us to ask these same questions.  Hopefully opening minds to changes for the better as well as a better understanding of our impact on this earth.

World Animal Awareness Society	118936	31	/users/profile/161709	Michael98	Volunteer	5	07/20/2012	As a photographer/ cinematographer, I have had phenomenal experiences to work alongside of the WA2S staff and administrators on several occasions. Without taking an activist stance which many animal & humane protection programs take, the WA2S seeks only to document those events which clearly illustrate the human-animal intersection. They are a dedicated bunch of individuals who clearly demonstrate man's inhumanity to the animals who share the planet as well the incredible dedication of many who seek to protect and save any and all animals. WA2S - the World Animal Awareness Society - is a non-profit unlike any other that seeks to document, demonstrate and display the important roles that animals have in our lives and our survival.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	264676	1	/users/profile/353399	rescuelove	Client Served	1	10/16/2015	I had a great experience here with an Intern therapist, Amanda, (Mar.-Jul2015), but she graduated so I had to transition to another therapist.   I was put on a waiting list for another therapist in mid-July before Amanda left.  However, I never got a call so I followed-up in mid-August and was told that they could not find my application at all.  I was told that I would have to reapply and be put on the approx. 30 day waiting list.  I reported how unprofessional this was and after finally reaching a supervisor was given a therapist the next week.  However, the therapist I was given turned out to be an extremely invalidating intern and ended up betraying my trust by misunderstanding info. I gave her.  After, leaving me in crisis she never contacted me again for a follow-up visit or to check on me. She had a few good suggestions at my initial visit but never followed up on anything she said she'd check on for me.I don't know how this place is funded but the funders might want to take a 2nd look at the quality they are getting from the staffing there.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	223466	3	/users/profile/43418	akotchduda	Donor	5	10/16/2014	The Women's Center has a niche market/clientele that find peace and guidance wrapped in the wise direction of those that work at the Center. All of the adminstration, staff and volunteers understand the unique qualities that the Women's Center possess for anyone walking in off the street struggling with where to go next in life, in their careers, in their personal lives.Having been involved with the Center since the first day they opened 14+ years ago, I have served in many capacities. I've been on the Board, volunteered in different capacities to assist for various programs and on an ongoing basis have donated time and money.I am always humbled by the good people who work to provide a stable, steady, kind and nurturing atmosphere for all who enter. Please take some time to stop by and be amazed and dazzled by the work of the Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan.Andrea KD
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	42702	1	/users/profile/43418	akotchduda	Donor	5	06/02/2010	I have personally been involved with this organization since its inception. I knew 2 of the founders personally and have gotten to know Kim (the current Executive Director) since she started with the Women's Center. These are amazing women who started the center and Kim, who continues to run The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan!They give their heart and soul to make everyone who is impacted by the center, feel like they have an extended family. When life is challenging enough, this group helps keep people grounded and able to find a new starting place or know that they can move on better than before.Everytime I visit the center, I am constantly reminded of the warmth of the staff and the caring way they help each client who comes in the door--whether it is for basic tax filing, job coaching, counseling thru tough times, or financial/legal support.It's truly an honor to be a part of this wonderful organization!

The Women's Center was more than an internship. It was a home or should I say is a home. I can honestly say that TWC, in addition to my parents, had a hand in raising me into the strong woman I am today.  Being a part of the TWC community is like falling in love with your soul mate. One day you cannot imagine how you moved through life before meeting the other. All you know is that you never want to go back.  May TWC continue to be a home to the staff, interns, and countless community members we have reached. May we all feel TWC's love for many years to come. 
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	114789	4	/users/profile/156413	Aesha M.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/12/2012	When I started as an intern at the Womens Center, I was told I was competent and that my supervisor and other staff members believed in me. Initially, I took my supervisors encouraging words as just a nice comment said to every intern. I did not realize that she did believe in me, and that I was competent. Over the course of the semester, I learned that I am competent and I now believe in myself.  One of the greatest things I learned through my work at the Women's Center is that therapy is not a science, or perfected performance. It is an art and an exploration of our clients lives and our own. Whether you are an intern, volunteer, donor, or client of the Women's Center, you are part of a special place that empowers you to achieve your best and be your best. I did not know I was not whole until I embarked on this journey with the Women's Center, but I am grateful to know I am leaving whole.

TWC provides a truly unique environment where both clients and interns can feel supported in their goals. It was a great place to work and I learned so much from fellow interns, supervisors, and clients. I am so grateful for TWC and encourage anyone in need of compassionate, competent, and supportive services to give them a call.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	214871	2	/users/profile/278188	Ruthie S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/12/2014	I'm a former intern (class of 2011) who returned to the center to help in anyway I could. The Women's Center is a safe place that I needed after leaving a very toxic job. I offer my help in anyway I can and the organization warmly accepts me and my efforts. The Women's Center does so much for so many! We offer counseling to those who are truly struggling. We have job coaching for those who need help with resumes and interview tips in this hard job market. If a woman is struggling with the end of a marriage or long-term partnership, we offer educational groups and a support group. When I had the privilege to offer counseling through The Women's Center, so many of my clients showed their appreciation for the therapy they received. The Women's Center does all it can to truly fulfill it's mission and I'm so grateful that I have the opportunity to continue to support this wonderful organization!

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	214661		/users/profile/93300	Mickey	Volunteer	5	09/11/2014	I am PROUD to be the new Chair of The Women's Center of SE Michigan.  I'm also the 'old'est chairperson as I was a co-founder and first Chair in 2000.  This last year has been a very difficult one - financially - and, in fact, we had to briefly close our doors in June.  But the tenacity of the staff, volunteer supervisors, interns, and a major donor brought me to my feet and, together, we're taking a stand!  We have long recognized the need to become financially more sustainable, but how to do so and not compromise our principles was a difficult hurdle to cross.  Together, we are on Journey 2.0.  Together, we have developed an additional program, Room To Talk, where licensed therapists trained by TWC in the past, will be able to provide services to insured individuals and where those who do not wish to use their insurance and/or have the ability to pay a reduced fee will be seen by limited licensed therapists. We hope to have this program fully launched by January, 2015.  TWC is also in the process of working toward expansion of its many group programs.  We can use your help!  Please consider making a donation by going to our website:  www.womenscentersemi.org.  Thank you!

I am utterly amazed at the personal growth I have experienced while working at The Women's Center for only 5 short months. I have learned and began to craft and develop my abilities as a therapist and I am forever in debt to The Women's Center. My supervisor and the supporting staff at The Women's Center has encouraged me to explore different avenues with my clients but ultimately they have allowed me flourish and grow into my role as a therapist. The support here is second to none and I know I would not be the therapist I am now, if it weren't for The Women's Center. Thank you for everything!

Last year I was diagnosed withStage III breast cancer, and had undergone surgery, chemo, and radiation.  I am self employed and have catastrophic insurance, and am currently struggling with finances and anxiety.  The WCofSEM provided me with a counselor at a reduced co pay, and scheduled me for weekly appointments to help aid me in mental and emotional support.  Kara has been wonderful to me and very helpful. She has provided sources to help me seek financial aid with my copays medications, and how to practice cognitive therapy.   I am very lucky to have discovered this wonderful organization.  I hope that other's that are in simuliar situations as I am are lucky enough to discover the WCofSEM.  
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	115035	1	/users/profile/156731	Citron	Volunteer	5	06/13/2012	Self determination can mean a lot of different things. Whether people are seeking ways to stay afloat financially, seeking a job, or struggling personally through a difficult time, the Women's Center is there. With everything from financial counseling to personal therapy, the staff, interns, and volunteers seek  to give women and girls the confidence and knowledge to stand on their own feet and make the decisions that are best for them. Hundreds of women contact the center for referrals and direct help. The staff is so dedicated-- this is no 9 to 5 job for them. The staff and interns have a special dedication to women, and a passion for helping people as individuals, no matter where they are in their life. Even if someone just comes in to use the Clothes Closet (professional clothes for job interviews) or get more information in a divorce seminar, this organization changes lives.

Their care and concern for the community of women, children and families of all kinds is unsurpassed.  Every action that they take is for the people they serve, and they are a true resource for women in need.   I mostly work with Kim Cumming, but I see and feel her leadership and passion reflected throughout the organization in the way each one contributes their time and care for others who need it.

This organization really is one in a million and if you can volunteer, work, or even spend a minute at the Center, you will find that you too can make a difference in the lives of countless women.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	84374	2	/users/profile/93579	Debbie Herbert	Board Member	5	03/31/2011	I served on the board 2004-2010, as chair for the first three years, and continue as a volunteer, most recently as a co-chair for the Power of One event celebrating Jean Ledwith King.  The Women's Center is unique and essential to our community, providing a safety net of comprehensive critical services under one roof and making them affordable.  No one is turned away.  The Center's work consists not only in providing human services, but more importantly in implementing a vision of social justice in terms of gender and socio-economic class.  In spite of the current economy, the Center continues to deliver high quality services because, in part, it draws in professionals who volunteer their skills and time, which have a dollar value of 1.5 times the annual operating budget.  In addition to direct programs and services, the Center has created a General Resources document in order to provide accurate responses to callers (3000 annually) needing critical information about food, shelter, medical care, etc.  As a result the Center has become the go-to organization for other organizations that need to know how and where to refer their own callers and clients.  The Center is unique and essential in our community in addressing the emotional and financial challenges of women who have nowhere else to go.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38548	4	/users/profile/39426	angelacostleyharris	Board Member	5	05/11/2010	I am honored to be the Board Chair of The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan.  TWC provides its services on a sliding scale fee structure, and no one is turned away due to an inability to pay.  It is a vital community resource that is not a nonprofit luxury -- it is a community necessity.  Along with our professional staff and cadre of volunteers, the Board of Directors is doing everything possible to ensure the long term sustainability of TWC so that it remains part of our community landscape for years to come.Everything we do at TWC is guided by three fundamental principles: increase confidence, increased competence, and increased connections.  These principles are my constant motivation in my work with our Board of Directors, staff and volunteers.One of the things that makes me most proud of TWC is the efficiency with which TWC raises the funds necessary to keep its doors open for clients.  There is no unncessary "overhead" -- there is space where our staff and volunteers serve clients directly and there are minimal staff salaries to deliver the services to clients.  When an individual makes a donation or a funder makes a grant to TWC, they can be confident that those funds are used efficiently to make a difference in the lives of clients.    I am grateful beyond words for the staff, interns, volunteers and my board colleagues who give so much of themselves in order to make the work of the Center possible.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	84186		/users/profile/93342	mjsfulton	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	In the world of mental health care approximately 80%-90% of the publicly available funds go to programs that help approximately 10% of the most severely impacted people. That leaves a very large number of people in need of care and support but who cannot afford private practitioner rates. The Women's Center is one a very few agencies that help to fill that gap. I came to the center as an intern while working on my MSW and found the Center to be one of the most amazing agencies I'd ever encountered. After finishing me degree I found I did not want to leave the Center, the experience had been so fulfilling and the work they do being so important in the community. I have since returned as a volunteer therapist to continue helping in the great work the Center does.

The Women's Center really has a high respect for clients and volunteers and everyone here tries to create a welcoming atmosphere for any one who walks in the door. It's an amazing place for the community! 
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	84166		/users/profile/93314	cjovaitt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2011	Ever since I was an intern at The Women's Center 3 years ago it has been my life's mission to make the whole world more like this organization! There is simoply no place I have found that provides such supportive, dignified services in such a genuinely caring and respectful manner. 
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	84165		/users/profile/93313	shovelbaby	Donor	5	03/30/2011	The Women's Center (TWC) of Southeastern Michigan provides services that are otherwise sorely lacking in the community, and in some cases in the surrounding region.  The small paid staff, troupe of interns and bevy of volunteers create an atmosphere of acceptance and empowerment that I have experienced no where else.   
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	84159		/users/profile/93305	jahass	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2011	I've been an admirer of the Women's Center since it's embryonic days.  I had the good fortune to serve two terms on the board, and have recently served as co-chair of an event that celebrated one of our nation's heroines--Jean Ledwith King--and the center's new name.  In my years working with and on-behalf of the center, I've worked closely with the executive director Kim Cumming, gotten to know the staff and interns, and have seen first hand the powerful impact the center has made on our community. Drawing from its feminist values, the center is a fount of creativity, good will, brilliant management of limited resources, and unflinching dedication to the women, girls, and families in our community.  The Jean Ledwith King Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan embodies the values and deep commitment to justice that Jean King's life exemplifies.  I am proud of the Center and hold it out to all of us as benchmark for non-profits that truly 'walks its talk' and makes good things happen.  
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	82541		/users/profile/91061	t7447sb	Volunteer	5	03/18/2011	As the front desk volunteer I see many women (and some men) come in for counseling looking glum or apprehensive and leaving with a smile on their faces.  Clearly something is working right during their sessions.   The Women's Center also offers financial counseling and my  heart goes out to the clients when I hear their needs requiring financial help.  The Jobs Workshop also serves many people each week with help regarding resumes and job searches. I am glad to be able to help such a worthy organization.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	48285	6	/users/profile/49273	jak1	Volunteer	5	07/16/2010	I came to The Women's Center when I was a mature student in a Master's of Social Work program with an idea for a program the community didn't have, information about the Earned Income Tax Credit and the assistance to help folks access this important tax credit for the working poor.A few years later I was hired and now am a staff member. The program is in it's eighth year, has a stable group of committed volunteers and scores of loyal and new clients every spring. This year we are establishing year round access to income tax preparation assistance. Individuals and families can electronically file current taxes with the support and encouragement of a knowledgeable, committed volunteer. Although it is a little more difficult we assist folks file past year taxes as well. I serve as the volunteer coordinator and we literally could not run our agency without our loyal, responsible, generous, and committed volunteers. I cannot say enough good things about them.I have been a social worker for over 30 years and this is one of the most responsible, concerned, committed agency I have ever worked at. I feel lucky to be employed at The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan. We help women change their lives everyday and I find great joy and gratification from that fact.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	43368	10	/users/profile/44214	jj3	Volunteer	5	06/09/2010	I started volunteering at the Women's Center of SEM a few years ago, and I was a little nervous about working the front desk where calls would come in from sometimes desperate women who needed help; help with living expenses, help with a divorce or abusive spouse, help with taxes, help with a legal problem,help finding a job. You name it,the Women's Center received the calls. But there are so many resources out there, and if the Women's Center staff, volunteers and counselors couldn't actually provide the help needed, we were able to connect callers up with someone who could. It was very rewarding work, and I often left for the day feeling like I had really helped someone in need. I think the staff is fabulous and very caring, and they show every day how much they value volunteers. It's gotta be the best place in town to volunteer!
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	43286	8	/users/profile/44109	courtney9	Donor	5	06/08/2010	The women were a delight to work with and really appreciate our support. I just know that the money we raised is going to an amazing cause. I see the results first hand with new programs such as the free legal clinic for women.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	42801	8	/users/profile/43531	nigelkerr	Volunteer	5	06/03/2010	I helped the staff and other volunteers get the Center's new space ready in the summer of 2009, largely by helping with painting.  This brought me into informal contact with Center staff and volunteers.The center has attracted a very high-quality and high-energy staff and volunteer following!  As this is a Women's Center, I myself am not part of their audience, but I can see from the people that are collected there that they bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm to their tasks and goals.  If I were a woman and in need of the services provided at the Center, I would find the opportunities, support and people breath-taking, I have to say.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38658	4	/users/profile/39548	debbie6	General Member of the Public	5	05/12/2010	I have had the opportunity to watch the Women's Center grow over the past6-7 years. They have touched the lives of many people in a positive direction, including myself. The Women's Center has a staff of some truly amazing people that are there out of the goodness of their hearts to help people.  The Women's Center is an honest hard working organization that is affordable and gives people hope and a chance that they thought they didn't have.  I will continue to support the Women's Center anyway that I can.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38642	2	/users/profile/39528	caitlin1	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	My sorority supports the mission of The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan.  I was the Vice President of Philanthropy.  I organized girls working in their office and organized a silent auction for their orgainzation, where we were able to raise 20,000 dollars.  I was so motivated by working at their office once a week for 2 years that I was determined to make as much for them as possible.They have a wonderful office that services a great deal of struggling women.

Teaching them how to use Turbo tax so they can complete their own return in the future.  In some cases correcting prior year returns to get the largest refund available and getting clients caught up with all their tax refunds.  Empowering clients to learn this skill to use in the future.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38456	5	/users/profile/39334	dedicatedsw	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	The Women's Center is a wonderful organization.  My perspective is that of a current clinical intern but I have learned so much and the supervision/clinical experience provided by The Women's Center has been exceptional.  The greatest part is to see the impact that The Women's Center has on clients in the community.  The Women's Center offers a variety of services and really is a very important resource in the community.  To see how clients are helped and empowered by The Women's Center has been truly amazing!  It's difficult to imagine this community without this vital resource.

Both clients and volunteers are treated with great respect and regard.  Programs are in place to help low-income women navigate the complex modern world, including personal, financial, legal and divorce counseling.  A tax program helps clients complete their income tax returns every year.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38409	9	/users/profile/39279	beth14	Donor	5	05/09/2010	The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan is an amazing resource for our community!  I learned of this resource through a colleague who volunteers her time with the Center, and I was immediately impressed by the professionalism and kindness of all of the volunteers, staff members, and Board members that I met.  I helped organize a fundraiser for the Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan, and through this experience had the opportunity to meet even more members of this wonderful organization.  I was treated to a tour of their lovely new facility, and, again, was continually impressed by the dedication and true kindness of everyone associated with the Center.  I look forward to volunteering with the Center soon!
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38405	9	/users/profile/39275	cyn1	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	The income tax program provides income tax preparation for clients via free Turbotax. Counselors assist clients with tax questions, running the program and filing electronically or by mail. Time spent with the client is not limited. Counselors will work with the client until taxes are finished. Refreshments and a friendly atmosphere add to the experience.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38393	7	/users/profile/39264	emily8	Client Served	5	05/08/2010	The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan changed my life, and it also changed how I view and treat other women. I felt like I could trust everyone from the counselor who helped me to the receptionist who greeted me every week. In order to do the work that they do you have to be extremely devoted to you job and to the people that you help. The Women's center goes above and beyond devotion.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38391	9	/users/profile/39263	cathyalfaro	Board Member	5	05/08/2010	A wonderful experience for me being part of this hard working and seriously focused group of people striving to make The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan flourish and grow. This is presently a local group in Ann Arbor helping women find a new direction for their lives from professional staff and many volunteers.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38389	9	/users/profile/39261	amenlove	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	I found this organization to be totally dedicated to helping women from all walks of life: poor, well-off but controlled and helpless before domineering men; deeply depressed, scared, threatened and helpless.  They have come out of the Women's Center feeling more confident, knowing what to do, taking control of their lives and also willing to help others.   They have found out information, and they have found camaraderie and support.  It's a fabulous organization.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38388	4	/users/profile/39259	umsocwrkr	Former Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	The staff, interns, and volunteers at The Women's Center were very helpful and welcoming.  The Center's mission is wonderful, and it inspired me to seek employment in a similar agency after my internship was finished.  The community support of The Women's Center is a testament to its mission and efficacy.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38385	10	/users/profile/39255	twcalum	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	The Womens Center offers hope and so many important resources.  I have seen people at the end of their ropes who came to TWC and found an empathetic listener, resources they didnt know existed, or even just a place to take a deep breath and regroup. Some have said they could not have lived without it.  What a difference TWC makes in womens lives.  I also had the honor of working with clients on a long term basis. Being part of a clients cathartic transformation through hard and persistent therapeutic work was a truly rewarding experience for me as a clinician, one I will not forget. Through the help they seek out at The Womens Center many women discover they have choices in their lives, sometimes for the first time. I have been witness to the fact that the ability to make seemingly simple decisions can have a great impact on the power a woman feels she has in her world and what she can do with that power. I have also witnessed women find a more concrete sense of themselves, who they are and what they have to offer the world from a more empowered point of view. Simply put The Women's Center changes lives.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38383	10	/users/profile/39253	iametrano	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/08/2010	The Women'Center of Southeastern Michigan is an awesome agency!  First, they serve clients in a caring way that is rarely seen in public agencies these days. Second, they offer our counseling students wonderful opportunities to work with clients, to receive ourstanding supervision, and to experience all levels of how an agency functions. They are remarkable!!
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38382	8	/users/profile/39252	reallybigfatmatt	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	I was first introduced to the Womans Center when I helped out with an auction a couple of years ago.  My friend was working at the time and asked if I could give a hand.  I was instantly blown away by the kindness, dedication, and authenticity of not only every member, volunteer and employee of the Womans Center, but also by the entire goal and purpose of the organization as well.  Since then, Ive volunteered multiple times and helped others utilize their services.  As a high school teacher working with at-risk students, I often refer kids to the Womans Center for counseling knowing full well that each individual will get thoughtfully placed with an effective match, and that regardless of insurance, they will find a way to get these students the help they need.  Ive also maintained contact and dialog with the staff (particularly their wonderful director), and the advice, tips, and encouragement Ive received for working with at-risk students has been invaluable.  Ive seen, and worked with, a great deal of non-profit organizations throughout the years, but never have I been so impressed and moved by the grassroots work done by the Womans Center.  Quite simply, they are passionately dedicated to helping others, they give hope to those in need, and they truly make the kind of difference that changes lives.  I am honored to have been a part of the Womans Center of Ann Arbor and look forward to helping out in any way I can for years and years to come.

The volunteers and staff of the center have always done their best to work well with our members. They have also always shown amazing gratitude for our gifts.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38371	8	/users/profile/39240	feminista	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/08/2010	This is an easy place for both women and men to get help, even though the programs are designed specifically to empower women. I first came to The Women's Center because I was feeling stuck. Over the years, I have seen that this is not unusual.  Many of us feel stuck for any number of reasons:  relationship problems, care-giving challenges, strained finances, overwhelming responsibilities, and limited decision-making power.  The results are the same:  Emotional paralysis. Anger.  Depression.  Anxiety.  Identifying our strengths is the first step in getting "unstuck."  Women's Center volunteers and staff are committed to helping people build on their best qualities, and this encouraging attitude is evident in their relationships with program participants and with each other. Many volunteers are former clients like myself, who know how critical low-cost, accessible support can be.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38370	8	/users/profile/39243	dianeb1	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	What makes The Women's Center so special is the show of respect paid to all who pass through the doors.  What this kind of respect looks like in service delivery, is holding an awareness of clients as so much bigger than their particular problem. From the amazing staff to the dedicated volunteers and student interns, clients passing through these doors experience, many for the first time, a sense of their own worthiness as human beings. What a way to begin healing.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38369	5	/users/profile/39242	amber31	Former Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	The Women's Center truly allows people in need to receive not only practical support, but respect and dignity at a time when they may feel alone and hopeless. I remember my time at TWC with only fond memories of being able to be a part of something SO much more than just an internship that I was doing to get my hours. It was a place where I grew professionally and personally. Support abounded and allowed me to become who I am today in the work world AND in my life as a whole. I was only there for a year, but I feel that year has allowed me to go into the mental health field as a graduate and have a good perspective regarding our work. I constantly draw from that experience on my job today, sometimes without even realizing it. I see the importance of empowering clients and remembering that we are not "above" them but assisting them, working together, in ways that allow them to reach their full potential - the potential that they are now able to see and want for their own lives. I am grateful for this perspective because this is a challenging field to work in and it is easy to see how people can get 'burned out' after awhile. The staff at TWC are extremely dedicated, sincere and a joy to know. The clients are able to come to the Center and find what they are looking for - be it food, career clothing, tax assistance, counseling...the list goes on. At TWC, I saw how important it can be to have someone who will listen to you - which we may sometimes take for granted. Many of us may not realize just how much having a nonjudgmental, caring person to talk to can open up parts of ourselves -- open up ways of understanding and new perspectives that may have never occurred to us without a safe place. I recommend The Women's Center as that 'safe place' to prospecting interns and women in our communities alike. It is truly an inspiring environment in which to grow. Thanks to The Women's Center for all they do for the people in our communities and our aspiring social workers/counselors.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38365	9	/users/profile/39237	annie-zirkel	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	The Women's Center is one of those organizations that is forever in touch with its mission to help women and their families. They live it, they breathe it. There is little hierarchy. Clients, interns, staff, leadership are all invited to participate in making sure that services are being performed to the best of their abilities. Whether it is how the phones are answered, how the specific needs of a client are attended to - such as practical services, clothes for an interview, the type of therapy that would best suit them, tax help, a variety of support groups that are found no where else in the county, books to check out, or having a cup of coffee - the staff works to make sure that all are supported and empowered as much as possible so that they can get to a better place.I learned so much as an intern there and it has made me a better counselor today.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38361	6	/users/profile/39229	mickey2	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	I am a 65 year 'young' woman who has had the good fortune of a good life, but it wasn't always this way.  When I needed urgent help and long-term guidance, there was no such organization around. Later, when I had the opportunity to participate in creating an organization that helps to empower women and girls, I jumped on the bandwagon (10 years ago).  I am very proud of The Women's Center - last year, we assisted over 700 women providing counseling and referral services through a unique method of working with our local academic institutions educating social workers, psychologists, etc. who need training.  We leverage our Master's level social worker employees who supervise the work of the trainees.  We are actively engaged in the community and work collaboratively with many other organizations to effect change.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38336	7	/users/profile/39222	twcsupporter	Donor	5	05/08/2010	This is an organization that really "walks its talk" and lives true to its mission.  I am continuously impressed by how much they do on so little, in large part because of the multi-talented, incredibly dedicated staff, and in large part because of its incomparable volunteer cadre - including its deeply committed board of directors.  I continue to be inspired by The Women's Center's dedication, professionalism, integrity, and commitment to living its values.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38311	5	/users/profile/39199	janefineberg	Former Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	The Women's Center and it's director, Kim Cumming, set a standard for me. I spent a year working as an intern therapist while in graduate school.  During that time, I learned not only the skills to become a good therapist, but also gained an image of the ideal.  The Women's Center is the kind of organization that allows interns, clients and staff to feel empowered, respected and important.  As my supervisor, Kim taught me how to empower people to change their own lives.  I learned that this allows for lasting change, rather than the impulse to provide for or
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38307	7	/users/profile/39197	linky	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	The people that work at the woman's center are friendly, helpful and supportive.

They just wanted there new home to be the best that it could be.  Not only have a been a volunteer but I was a client as well.  It was a honor to show them how much they helped me by giving back to them.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38299	7	/users/profile/39192	foodgoddess100	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	My experience at The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan (TWC) has been, and continues to be, excellent.  My initial contact with this organization was as a Generalist Social Work Intern.  Following my internship committment, I have remained involved as a volunteer.  The Women's Center provides a warm and supportive atmosphere in which student interns are nurtured and their knowledge is expanded.  Creativity and individual expression are encouraged, and positive modeling and interactions with staff are every day experiences.  Volunteers are appreciated, and offered the opportunity for continuing meaningful experiences with TWC.

The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38293	8	/users/profile/39184	jacqueline3	Former staff	5	05/07/2010	Working for the Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan was one of the most positive emotional and education experiences I was fortunate to have as a young adult. The supervisors at this Center encourage full participation, and cohesiveness amongst all staff members. Real world instruction is provided to the developing therapists, to assist them in becoming skilled professionals in the counseling and non-profit field. Group supervision is provided on a weekly basis, where interns and supervisors alike are able to contribute their unique ideas and/or challenges regarding specific cases, and receive constructive feedback. And last, but certainly not least, all staff members are provided with a plethora of emotional support, allowing them to be the most available and engaged counselors for their clients as possible. The Women's Center is chock full of men and women who truly want to provide emotional and practical economic services to the people of their community, especially those who could not afford such services without the help of sliding scale fees. The staff and interns at this agency are carefully selected to ensure that services rendered to clients are of the highest caliber possible. I was fortunate to begin my professional career with this agency. Thanks
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38291	9	/users/profile/39182	intern2	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	The Womens Center is a place that has been home to me for the last six weeks.  During that time the staff, fellow interns and volunteers have been supportive, positive and determined to service the community in the best possible way.  The people there are open, honest and hard working.   I cannot think of a better place to be an intern or for a client to be helped using a totally holistic approach.  We care about the emotional, mental and physical well being of everyone who comes through the door or contacts us in any way.  The Womens Center is generous with their time and limited resources.  I feel blessed that I am a part of this wonderful team.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38279	9	/users/profile/39173	jennifer31	Board Member	5	05/07/2010	I've been involved with The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan (TWC) for several years.  My involvement and commitment deepened the more that I learned about it and the work it does in our community.TWC helps women and families through affordable counseling, financial, legal, and job-related services. Its doors are open to individuals who want to change their lives emotionally, professionally, and financially.  Although its work is primarily by and for women, we also welcome men and boys.I continue to be impressed with TWC's responsibility and responsiveness to community needs.  I'm also impressed with its ability to help women in a way that develops life skills inherent to thriving families.
The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan	38277	10	/users/profile/39171	ruthie1	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	I am working toward my MSW degree at the University of Michigan. The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan has been a great place to learn how to do therapy. It is an incredibly supportive environment, and everyone who works there works incredibly hard to serve TWC's clients well. It's one of the only places in the area people can get counseling on a *true* sliding scale (many people are priced out of sliding scales that bottom out at $40). TWC continually gets clients calling for counseling because our reputation within the professional community grows; other social workers I know smile when I say I work for TWC and tell me that many of their clients they've referred to TWC were greatly helped.It's a truly amazing place.
NBS Animal Rescue	300294		/users/profile/391142	Marie75	Volunteer	5	08/12/2016	NBS Animal Rescue is such a professional and caring rescue.  I have been fostering dogs for NBS approximately a year when they posted a little girl, Gidget, who needed a foster while waiting for her furever home.  I immediately wanted to foster Gidget and once she was in my home I knew she was not ever going to leave - huge foster fail! LOVE my Gidget!I am honored to be associated with NBS by fostering and helping these pups gain confidence, learn to trust and find the best homes!

NBS is staffed by an outstanding group of caring volunteers. When we adopted our dog, Nikki, we were impressed by the professional and thorough way they handled her placement.  They made sure that we were the best family for a little dog with a sad history. NBS has stayed in touch, answered our questions, and they host a wonderful reunion picnic. We are lucky we found such a great rescue group...and Nikki!
NBS Animal Rescue	242674		/users/profile/217820	Shannon46	Client Served	5	05/08/2015	Our experience with NBS Animal Rescue was excellent.  We adopted our dog Nikki from them and they made certain that we were a good match -- and we were!  Nikki is the perfect dog for our family.  She is a very small chihuahua and gets along great with our dog Riley.  NBS was here for a meet and greet between the two dogs to make sure they would bet along and be good companions for each other.  NBS was very helpful with transition tips as Nikki settled in to our home.  NBS is a great organization run by kind, caring, and well-organized staff.

NBS Animal Rescue	163976		/users/profile/217820	Shannon46	Client Served	5	07/31/2013	We had a very positive experience with NBS Animal Rescue.  We applied for our Chihuahua, Nikki (formerly known as Picca).  We were thrilled to be selected from the group of applicants.  NBS was very careful to make sure that we were a good match for Nikki.  They came to our house and helped us acquaint her with our other dog, Riley.  They answered all of our questions and also gave us a lot of tips to help make the transition and adjustment period smooth and successful.  Nikki is an amazing little dog and we were pleased that NBS really seems to know the personalities of the rescue dogs that they are placing.  I have recommended NBS Animal Rescue to three other families and they have had the same positive experience.  Thanks again for Nikki!
NBS Animal Rescue	293129		/users/profile/383705	Robert191	Client Served	5	06/15/2016	I had been wanting a dog for a long time and for some reason December 2013 just felt like the right time.  I went online and after checking several other websites I came across NBS Animal Rescue.  After about 30 seconds I saw my dog, Gus.  NBS brought him out for me to meet and we became instant buds.  Since Gus was home by himself while I was at work I decided he needed a playmate.  In May 2013 I visited the NBS website.  I scheduled an appointment to take Gus to check out a few dogs.  Gus, being the ladies man that he is, saw 2 female dogs, one of which became his sister, Caci.  Gus also convinced my sister, who went with us, to adopt Caci's sister.  The people at NBS are great and Gus, Caci and I are extremely grateful. They continue to follow up to see how the dogs are doing and offer support and advice.  Should the time come I would not hesitate to rescue/adopt another from NBS.  Special THANKS to Jamie, Aaron and Kaycee.  BEST REGARDS, The Webster Family, Gus, Caci and Robert.
NBS Animal Rescue	292191	1	/users/profile/382686	Joanne55	Client Served	5	06/05/2016	     I have had several dogs throughout my life and for the first time I decided that my fifth dog was going to be adopted from from NBS Animal Rescue because of my brothers experience with adopting his dogs.     My brother adopted a 3 year old dog name Gus in 2013, everyone seems to know Gus, he is the most loving dog even though he went through some hard times.  He decided to get a friend for Gus and in 2014 he adopted Caci (a.k.a. Lulu)  in 2013.  Caci had a sister (and two brothers) and when my brother adopted Caci I met Ellie (a.k.a. Mariana) and my heart melted.  I adopted Ellie on  05/24/2014.  Mine and my other dog Brody's life hasn't been the same since we got her.  Brody and I lost his best friend Hunter in 2012 and the look on Brody's face when I got Ellie was not the face I wanted to see,  it was a "You've got to be kidding me" look.  Ellie at the the time was about 14 weeks old.     Now our lives are filled with more love, kisses and craziness everyday!  And yes Brody has warmed up to Ellie and he has changed from a crabby boy to a cuddly, I love that crazy girl boy.  The warmth in my heart every time I look at both my dogs is overwhelming.  My dogs taught me to not take life so seriously, to have fun, to run, play and maybe lick some people sometimes.     If you want to save a animals life PLEASE ADOPT!  There are so many animals who need a loving home and I know we all have it in our hearts to do that.  The saying is so true about "Who Saved Who?"  NBS saved mine and Brody's life the day they brought Ellie to her forever home.  NBS Animal Rescue is one big family and the dogs they adopt out are never forgotten, they stay in all there hearts forever and always want to know how they are doing.  They are truly amazing!!

NBS Animal Rescue	290758		/users/profile/329204	neighkaye	Client Served	5	05/23/2016	NBS Animal Rescue is the most professional rescue organization I have seen. When it came time to add a dog to our home, I feel so fortunate to have come across one listed under NBS. Our Pinky poodle is a perfect match - he is smart, loving, incredible with kids, and cute as a button! They were so careful about placing a dog in a home with a young child, and did a thorough reference check and home visit. Pinky was dying on the streets when they found him, and they did wonders to bring him back to optimum health and place him with a family who thinks of him as the second "kid." NBS does truly great work and we're so honored to be amongst their happy families.
NBS Animal Rescue	242668		/users/profile/329204	neighkaye	Client Served	5	05/08/2015	NBS Animal Rescue is a super professional and caring rescue organization. The whole process of adoption is taken very seriously from checking references to a home visit and a binder full of vet records and information. We were concerned about finding the right match because we have a 3 year old daughter, and they were excellent with allowing us a trial period, although we knew immediately all would work out. Our dog is simply a gem and we could not be happier. We will be forever grateful for NBS saving his life and caring for him when he was in great need. Their care extends past the adoption process as well - they check in every few months to see how things are going and they have a great Facebook page. I highly recommend NBS to anyone looking for a dog to adopt in the Metro Detroit area. 
NBS Animal Rescue	290498		/users/profile/380846	mbirk	General Member of the Public	5	05/21/2016	We love our new dog Spencer. We got him in January he was about 17 weeks old. He has been a lot of  fun and the adoption process was very thorough and I can't say enough about Kasey our adoption mom. She was so nice and truly a big animal lover. She had rescued Dixon, who was hit by a car on Christmas Day, after his surgery she welcomed him into her home with Spencer and they were best of friends. I felt bad taking Spencer away from his friend but he's right at home now. I'm so glad we found Spencer and how wonderful NBS was to adopt from. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

NBS Animal Rescue	290428	1	/users/profile/380754	ladaig	Client Served	5	05/20/2016	NBS is the greatest dog rescue, and my dog (formerly known as Tony and now called Lil' Dude) is their poster dog since people stop their cars and ask me where did I get him?, and I then recommend NBS.  They were very thorough in matching me with the right dog which has made the adoption which took place 11 months ago very successful.  I was impressed that they spoke to my references to find out about me as a dog owner and found me a smaller dog I was looking for as other rescues I contacted did not.  Since Lil' Dude was fostered at a condo and went outside on a leash, he pretty much came prepackaged to the same situation at my house.  I still have his "binder" they gave me with all of his helpful information that I refer to on occasion.  On his initial visit to my home, Lil' Dude jumped up on the sofa and laid down as if to say, "Yep, this is the right place".   On his second day, I told him there was no use hiding under the desk because I was only going to haul him out of there, and he's never hidden under there again.  During his time with me, he's gone on vacation with me to the dog beach and visited the relatives for holidays.  People say it was nice of me to rescue him, but I wanted a dog, he needed a home, and we were a good fit for each other so I don't think of that as a "rescue".  He thinks I'm the greatest thing that ever lived, and I think he's pretty special, too.  It's amazing to watch his progress getting used to other people and dogs - one my neighbors always says he can't believe how far he's come.   We are definitely a success story, and I thank NBS for that.   Review by Laurie, Lil' Dude's forever pet parent

The police brought NBS with them and they rescue the little dog, she was in terrible shape, my husband did not think she was going to make it. We kept in touch with NBS and ended up adopting her. Her name is JoJo now and she is the best, it's amazing how much love this little dog can give in spite of what she might have gone through before we found her. I can not thank NBS enough for the work they do and their dedication. I tell my story to everyone I know in the hopes they will adopt as well.

My wife and 2 boys loved him too but I belonged to ''Otis''. After a few weeks and a very quiet house I knew I needed another best friend. A co worker told me about N.B.S. and I have to say they are by far the very best at what they do........mend a broken heart. Through N.B.S. we met ''Lucy'' who was a completely different breed but a dog who needed us almost as much as I needed her. Lucy had a tough start in  life and N.B.S. gave us all the information in incredible detail. Today our Lucy is spoiled as can be and  filled a very large hole in this man's heart. N.B.S. .......is the very best rescue organization out there. God bless you all!

It took awhile of training but he now listens well, why shouldn't he?  We treat him like he is our child and he has come to be very protected of us and us him.  Some how I accidentally trained him to bring in stones from the yard for a treat so now we call him the "merchant",  I cannot imagine life with out him.  NBS sure did their work before I got him.  They spoke with 2 of my friends over 45 min each to see if I was qualified.  I wish all animal rescues were as cautious.    If I ever get another pet I am getting one from NBS.  Than you so much.

NBS Animal Rescue	290139		/users/profile/380421	contessa	Volunteer	5	05/17/2016	I came to know NBS Animal Rescue though my adoption of a dog I saw on Petfinder. Love at first sight. In my inexperience with legit rescues, I expected to be able to take my dog home with me upon our initial meeting and was disappointed that I could not have her until a background check and home visit was approved. This is what GOOD and CARING rescues do. They care so much about their fosters, they will not allow an adoption to go through without knowing that the dog will be placed in a home they can be assured will be the best fit for the dog. Now that I understand, though I still share that initial disappointment on first meetings that can't end in an instant new family, I am proud to not only support NBS, but have joined them as a foster parent. There is no higher standard than that of this group. I am blessed to have "discovered" them, and anyone adopting a pet should be assured that  an adoption through NBS comes with all the love and support you'd ever need - beyond that of your new four legged love . . . 
NBS Animal Rescue	290133		/users/profile/380415	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/17/2016	This is a close knit group that have dedicated volunteers. They are not like some rescues that quickly turn around dogs. The dogs that I have seen come into their safety are provided for until they find the right home that works best for both the dog and the home. I always recommend people looking or a small dog, to check them out.

NBS Animal Rescue	175832		/users/profile/232204	Nancy121	Client Served	5	10/09/2013	Hi There! I would like to tell you about our experience with the NBS Animal Rescue group.  This past summer my husband and I decided we wanted to make a change in our home by adding a dog to our family.  We are a very casual, retired couple who like to travel to Florida in our travel trailer and did not want to adopt a "high-maintenance" dog but rather one that could enjoy our life style.  So I went to adoptapet.com and found our Sadie.  She was in residence with a foster NBSAR mom.  I filled out the application and was promptly contacted and approved!  The day that Sadie came to our home I was like a little kid on Christmas!  I just couldn't wait to meet her.  She has fit into our life style very well and I am sure that NBSAR really helped make her transition to our home as "nice" as it could be.They are very caring folks that just plain love the animals they take in.  Jaime brought Sadie to us and made sure all of our questions were answered and that our yard was in good condition for Sadie to be in (she was here for over 3 hours and seemed like she was family by the time she left).  Even though we now have our little doggie, I love to keep up with NBSAR through Facebook and look at all of the new adoptions - they are all so cute!  NBSAR teams up with the best possible people to help them look after their rescue dogs - like the Bingo Pet Salon who gave Sadie the attention she needed to her coat.  I would and do highly recommend this group if you are looking to adopt a dog.  They make the transition so easy and smooth!  Happy tails, y'all!

Our vet was impressed with our "care binder" that we were provided with at the time of the adoption, he had never seen such a complete over view provided by any other agency. They check in periodically, and offer support or assistance if needed, and the foster parents enjoy hearing the updates. The foster process is impressive and had a significant impact on the success of his transition to our home. Thank you NBS!

This was our first dog and they spend a long time answering questions. They provided us with a binder of all kinds of information. It's interested to compare adoption stories with others -- we came into it waaaay more informed. In the end our dog is a perfect match for our family, we felt like we knew what to expect, and we could call with any concerns (and in fact they called & emailed us).

The staff at NBS did a good job making sure I was a good match for my dog, and vice versa. I could tell Aaron and the rest of the staff at NBS were dedicated volunteers when he drove over an hour to my home for the home visit. NBS follows up on adoptions, too. They send out periodic questionnaires to see how the dogs are doing. I would feel comfortable calling them any time if I had a concern or question, even though it's been almost 3 years since I adopted my Westie Poodle mix. They have a rescue reunion every year where families can meet their fosters . They seem to genuinely care about the welfare of the dogs in their new homes and with their human companions.
NBS Animal Rescue	243031	1	/users/profile/329658	SheilaW2013	Client Served	5	05/15/2015	After the passing of my  best friend "Molly" I immediately needed to fill the void in my heart and the emptiness in our home.  I applied with ANOTHER rescue (not NBS) for a Chihuahua, drove 1-1/2 hrs, met the dog and was then told she came as a bonded pair and all the issues that came with both of them. I only have room for one other dog not 2. I was not impressed with the way this 1st rescue didn't give me any of the "issues" before I drove so far and to then try and push a 2nd Chihuahua on to me. I left pretty disgusted. I was still grieving from the loss of Molly I didn't have the time to invest in 2 dogs that would rather hide in a corner and die than to be held. So I  go back to my saved searches and Elsa and Tilly were the next 2 I was interested in meeting. I filled out the application and added an additional background of myself and home. I think it was the next day they started calling my Vet and references. I liked that. They weren't going to waste their time  and they weren't into wasting my time. I ended up applying for Tilly (only because my mother comes over and takes care of my dogs while I'm at work and she was uncomfortable with trying to work with a hearing impaired dog). During the week I borrowed my friend's dog to help us in our grieving. Aaron and I set up the home visit appointment and a few days later he came out with Tilly. The meet and greet went smooth. "Suzy" got along great with Tilly. Aaron went over the notebook chocked full of info (Yes! There is a detailed notebook!)  and he felt comfortable to leave Tilly with us. I signed up for the trial period just in case Tilly was not happy here I wasn't going to force her to stay forever. After a few days I emailed NBS and told them a trial period wasn't necessary, I'm keeping her! My other dog Suzy never cared for Molly, basically just tolerated her. Suzy, who is 12, never played or anything but LOVES to play with Tilly!  Tilly has pretty much renewed Suzy's youth. They chase each other around the house and are respectful of each others boundries, they actually lay curled up next to each other on the back of the couch waiting to sing to the mailman when he walks across the grass. NBS was a fantastic rescue to work with from start to finish. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in adopting a new family member. There is No Bull Sh*%. They tell you upfront if the dog has any special needs or issues so you are well aware before any time is wasted. Suzy has a few more good years in her but when it's her time NBS will be the first rescue I go to when I have an empty spot in my heart and bed needing to be filled. Tilly would need another partner in crime... can't have Thelma without Louise. Thank you again NBS Rescue you exceeded my expectations! SheilaGarden City, MI

The spent time talking to us first, spent time watching the dog interact with us and then followed through with more monitoring to be sure we had not encountered any problems.  Bailey very quickly became a full member of the family and often seems to take charge because of her love.  Thank you, NBS!  We hope to get another wonderful dog from them in the near future.  Duncan
NBS Animal Rescue	242744		/users/profile/329266	Beth135	Client Served	5	05/09/2015	We adopted our dog through NBS over 1.5 years ago at the zoo event. This was our first time adopting from a rescue. (We had adopted our first dog  via a dog shelter). We were impressed with NBS for not adopting their dogs immediately  on site at the zoo event like the majority of other groups. Some people buy on impulse at those events and then get home with the dog and  realize they made a mistake. NBS prevents that.  They collect applications from interested parties for each dog. They review each dog application and choose the best family/person for each of their dogs  (after home a home visit and checking references). We realized how much NBS cares for each and every animal. They didn't want to turn any of  their dogs over to the first person that shows interest (not good for the dog and not good for you). They want to find the  perfect loving match for each animal.  The difference we found with adopting from NBS versus adopting from  a shelter is the dogs are not living in cages/kennels.  They are coming to you from a loving foster home. They are living with a family, learning house manners, learning housebreaking (our dog was fully housebroken when we adopted her!), learning to socialize with other pets and humans already spade/neutered, vetted and up to date with shots. The best part is the foster family knows the animal and knows what type of family the dog will do best with. This avoids bad fits and prevents you from adopting the wrong animal!  Our NBS dog is now  2.5 years old. She is a wonderful addition to our family. We received such amazing support from NBS  during  the adoption process and it continues to this day. We were experienced dog owners but they still  taught us so much. They gave us a folder with everything we needed  to know for our dog. Whenever I had a question or needed advice I went back to NBS (specifically Aaron as he was my contact) and he always helped me.  NBS truly cares deeply for all of their current and past animals. Once you adopt from nbs you become a part of their extended family and they are always there when you need them! NBS is awesome!

NBS Animal Rescue	242677		/users/profile/329219	easchensky	Volunteer	5	05/08/2015	NBS Animal Rescue has heart.  They pull scared, injured and lonely dogs from shelters and literally streets that friends/members have scoured to locate an animal that has been seen.  The dogs are protected, healed and loved by the various fosters in NBS and the veterinary practices that support them. Ron and I have been a foster family for three years.  Ron literally saved a pup birthed in our backyard by a pregnant mom pulled from the streets of Detroit.  He then supported NBS staff who facilitated the birthing of 6 other pups now all happily situated in caring homes.  Mom became a Canadian and has overcome severe separation anxiety in her new home because NBS found the perfect loving and committed family to become her new parents. The foster dogs entering our home come in all shapes and sizes.  The things they have in common are a hope to be cared for and a need for love and support.  We have a cairn terrier Gidget (rescued from a puppy mill in Missouri) who is a wonderful foster sister.  How do dogs communicate?  We dont know but Gidget seems to tell each new foster sister/brother that life is safe here and that they will find a loving new home.  The folks at NBS are careful to clear each adoptive home in order to secure the best of the best for the animals in their care. Our hearts are periodically broken as a dog leaves our home where a special bond has formed.  But our hearts also know that great care is taken to place the dog in a good place and there are so many others who need a safe haven on their journey to security and love in their fur-ever home.

Our JRT's favorite person is my husband. I tried to be content with only one dog but I couldn't. The search began! I found a Yorkie on Petfinder.com the same size as Buttons and her name was Button. I showed her to my husband and he said "Now Della". When I showed him Bently he said "OKay". I put the application in that night and NBS contacted my vet first thing in the morning! I had a lot of questions and NBS answered all of them. Dealing with them is wonderful. They love what they are doing and are dedicated to their vision. All the information that came with Bently (now Harley) reminded me of all the information a new parent gets! Harley is a good fit for us. He thinks that he is my husbands pillow and I am his human toy. He knows our JRT's the boss dog but he's like a little brother and continues to bug her! NBS is a great organization.

We had the opportunity to receive from NBS a little brown toy poodle, now named Bosco.  My wife and I were amazed at the placement process and follow-up they employ to insure the pets can feel secure and be able share their natural love again.   Its hard for us to comprehend what someone may have done to this very smart little dog.  Bosco came to us from NBS after being well attended to by a vet and receiving superb house training that boggles me even now.   He listens and learns fast.  He has his routine established, waits at my feet to have his leash put on, looks forward going for a walk, and at the end of the day goes directly to his kennel for the night.  His favorite place is in my wifes lap getting his love strokes and gazing out the window at the activity outside.  This was our first dog from a shelter of the five pets we have had over 50 years.  If Bosco is an example, then we give a score of 10 out of 10 for the job NBS does and recommend calling them for your next pet.  Bob and Ivie MorrisDearborn, MI

Within a half hour of submitting my application, a NBS member had already spoke to my references and me! The workers are nothing short of caring, personable, and very knowledgable. They brought the dogs over to complete a home visit and do a meet and greet, and they really didn't pressure me or convince me to make any decisions. They made me feel like I had known them for years! After adopting my retriever mix TJ, NBS called for a check up after a week and a few months. They also emailed and asked for updates, so you can really tell they care about what they're doing. Adopting TJ was one of the best days of my life, and I can't thank NBS enough for making that happen.

Even after we called NBS to say the trial period was successful and everyone was happy, they have still been helpful. I have emailed questions a few times with an immediate response. When we first took Ryker to the vet, we brought the detailed binder of information that Aaron gave us. The veterinarian said he had never seen anything like it, and was impressed with Ryker and the information that the rescue provided.

NBS Animal Rescue	195943		/users/profile/256219	windrunner	Volunteer	5	03/20/2014	I feel one of the hardest things foster adults have to face when they are fostering a dog is the day they have to give it up to a furever family.  I know both Beth and I faced that situation when it came time for me to give up Gunther and Beth having to give up Mandy Mae. In fact a few tears were shed upon their departure. But, the positive side to this is the fact that NBS Animal Rescue handled the placement of these dogs into the right home.   A right home that made the animal feel they are now part of a family for the rest of their lives. I highly commend the people at NBS Animal Rescue for their drill down of potential adoptive homes to take on a dog.  It isnt luck that places the dog into the right setting: but, their determination that the dog fits into the lifestyle of that adoptive home. It could be argued that I give out these comments because my daughter, Jaime, is involved with NBS Animal Rescue.  But cudos go out to not only Jaime, but Rebecca, Raylene, and Aaron  Finally, I have to say that my wife and I have become foster failures as the last dog we fostered has now become a permanent member of our household.  Ginger, a Corgi breed, adopted our family for her rest of the life existence ( fosters sometimes do that!)  We are very pleased to welcome Ginger into our home. To the hard working staff at NBS Animal Rescue, keep up the excellent work..  You guys ROCK!!!!!!!!

We had applied to 6 agencies that had taken Shih-tzus to foster.  NBSAR was one of these.  We were very impressed about how thorough the application was, that they actually called my vet and all 3 of my personal references, once chosen,(yes, they choose you and the dog's needs are top priority)  they called to tell me which pup, kept me up to date with her progress, medically and socially and sent pictures too.  When the big day arrived, they brought her for a home visit.  It was like she was meant for us and they were immediately family.  When she had some tummy issues after adoption, they were always available to me by text or phone for advice and encouragement.  As it turned out, she is allergic to gluten And chicken!   Now, almost 2 years old, Daisy is such a joy to us and has given new life to our older Shih-tzu that will be 12 this May.

I worked at Humane Societies and Rescues for most of my adult life.  Since we fostered, it was always easy to pick our next best friend as we were effectively "trying them out".  Due to health issues I've been out of the Rescue world for some time and found ourselves needing a new family member.  We initially adopted a dog from what we thought was a reputable rescue and ended up with a 110# dog that they knew had a bite history.  He ended up almost killing our precious Chihuahua and bit me several times.  Sadly we had to euthanize him, we are just grateful that he didn't injure or kill a child.  When I saw the hoops we had to jump through to be considered for adoption at NBS I was so happy because I knew these people are serious about what they are doing and not just placing a dog to get rid of it.  Initially we thought we wanted another puppy, but after meeting with Aaron & Rebecca and having them describe the personalities of all the pups we ended up adopting a totally different puppy.  Raelene (now Pearline) is the perfect addition to our family and we couldn't be more appreciative for all the hard work NBS does.  My hope is that one day we won't have a need for rescue groups, but until then Thank God for NBS.  We will never adopt from anyone else!  Lorrie Bruel

A relative had told us about the good work that NBS was doing so we indicated to them what our preferences would be for our next dog. They matched us with a dog who is so mellow, good natured and simply fun to be with.......clearly the best pet any of us have ever owned. What we also liked was the packet of information they left behind explaining how to care for your new pet so every question was completely answered. Nice that they also offered a trial by which everyone was able to see how they were going to get along with one another.  And the follow-up phone call was also appreciated. As a rescue organization, they clearly make every effort to match the right owner with the right pet.......we would go back to them in a heartbeat! Thanks for Duffy!

Their work in providing the best dog for our needs was a wonderful experience.  They brought Sidney to our home and inspected it make sure all the safeguards - fence, work schedules, home life - were all acceptable and a good environment.  They also made sure the two dogs would be compatible.  There were several follow-up calls to make sure things were okay.Two years ago in August, Sidney was brought to our home to share a life with Molly, our chocolate lab, who was 4 years old at the time.  Because my husband and I were both working, we wanted a companion for Molly.  One of the first things we did was change her name to Cindy.  For some reason, we could not get Sidney to come out of our mouth.  Cindy is a happy, healthy pup who has been through two training classes and is wonderful to walk.  I cannot imagine life without her.  Every morning Cindy checks the backyard for squirrels, birds, and butterflies.  She thinks it is her responsibility to keep even the shadows out of her territory.  While outside she is constantly on the move, or as we say "on patrol" making sure the backyard is safe.  The trainer told us to prevent digging to fill a sandbox for her digging needs.  Well, at times we think she is digging to China.  The sandbox is a great idea.I believe that NBS provided a wonderful addition to our family and I am glad she did not turn out to be the big dog suggested.  She was to be Lab and Newfie but the only thing lab about her is the left ear, the rest seems to be shepherd, and a border collie mix.

Every 3 months NBS reaches out to us to see that Cap has everything he needs. They hold an annual reunion allowing us all to get together to see the great progress these dogs have made. Above all NBS has shown it's true love and dedication for all animals placed in it's care.
NBS Animal Rescue	164006		/users/profile/217851	Desiree5	Client Served	5	07/31/2013	NBS is a great organization. The dog that I wanted to adopt, had had already found a new home by the time my application had been approved. But within a few days, they sent me a picture of another dog, and shortly after, NBS brought this dog, Charlie, a superfriendly Cavalier King Charles, to our home and Charlie has been making our lives better ever since. They were also most helpful with giving real useful advise on house training in the weeks after the adoption. I also like it a lot that they keep in touch and do followups continously.  Clearly, their priority is to place the dogs in good home forever!
NBS Animal Rescue	163988		/users/profile/217832	wbernzen	Client Served	5	07/31/2013	NBS Animal Rescue is an amazing organization.  They have dedicated volunteers who make sure the animal is the right fit with the right family.  We appreciated that when we were searching for our dog.  We were lucky to find Willow.  Willow, along with her five family members, had been scheduled for euthanasia.  Fortunately, NBS Animal Rescue and its shelter partners were able to foster the dogs and find homes for them all.  When Willow came here for her visit, they brought us binder to prepare us as puppy parents.  It not only gave us tips and tricks, but it also included her vet history.  She was completely up-to-date as well as microchipped.  They made the process easy, and we would absolutely work with them again.
NBS Animal Rescue	163973		/users/profile/217816	kseguin	Client Served	5	07/31/2013	My experience with NBS has been very positive. They take the time to make sure the pet is a good fit with the potential owner. They really care about their placements. I also appreciated the organized binder full of medical records, advice and important information. Our new family member, Collin, is wonderful and we are so thankful NBS helped us find the perfect fit! 
NBS Animal Rescue	157949		/users/profile/209485	Judy73	Client Served	5	05/15/2013	NBS Animal Rescue made a dream come true for my husband Dennis and I when they selected us out of almost 40 applications for one of four puppies born under their care.We had been following this organization on face book and recognized the dedication and compassion that went into each rescue.  I began following them and asking questions about various breeds, early spaying/neutering, tail docking, etc. long before we were acquainted with our puppy.  Each question was answered within a timely manner and every response was in the best interest of the dog in question.When we finally got our 9-week old Yorkie, she was ready to face the world.  She is very good natured and in excellent health.

NBS Animal Rescue	153094		/users/profile/203951	Stephanie87	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	NBS Animal Rescue rescued our very loved dog Moxie.  They were so amazing to her and gave her so much love.  She was so shy and scared when she arrived, and they helped her gain confidence and trust.  We were so grateful to them that we wanted to help more and started fostering dogs for them.  They have been amazing!  Always ready to help or answer questions when we aren't sure what a foster pup needs, and they are EXTREMELY educated about all dog needs and health problems.  The people that run this rescue are truly some of the most caring, compassionate, and trustworthy people I have ever known!

Through their literacy programming the organization not only raises students' educational proficiency, but also increases their self value and desire to succeed.  The students experience quality one-on-one interactions with staff and volunteers  which leads to a high impact on student achievement and the overall success of the program.
Beyond Basics	299912		/users/profile/390726	gkfree	Advisor	5	08/09/2016	Beyond Basics' dedication to the children it serves is unmatched.  There is something magical happening between the organization, including the many volunteers and partners, the community in the city of Detroit, and the surrounding area.  The African proverb "It takes a village to raise a child" is in full motion here and is driven by the amazing work of Beyond Basics.

The programs are helpful and inspiring for the kids in the communities and schools Beyond Basics serves. I think it is a great organization that helps kids read in 6 to 10 weeks! Literacy is important to be successful. Beyond Basics puts words into actions by changing the future of the kids they help!
Beyond Basics	298810		/users/profile/389696	GoodWeek	Volunteer	5	08/01/2016	Great organization to become involved with.  Giving children opportunities by tutoring those struggling to read.  It is very rewarding to help Beyond Basics do what they do best, teach children to read.
Beyond Basics	298808		/users/profile/389694	susandittrich	Advisor	5	08/01/2016	I have recently become aware of Beyond Basics and am so impressed with the mission of the organization.  They truly do what they say they'll do - get kids reading at grade level in as little as six weeks!  As an avid reader myself, I can't imagine a world without books being an open door.  Wonderful organization!

Beyond Basics	267066		/users/profile/355816	chrisdebmc	Volunteer	5	10/25/2015	This is my second school year volunteering weekly with the children at the Woodside Pontiac Dream Center. It has been a most positive experience for me, exceeding my expectations. The dedication to the children by the Beyond Basics people and the staff of the Woodside Dream Center is consistent and tangible. These respectful kids are receptive to instruction, direction and any food there is to eat!  There seem to be more and more children each week receiving not only help with reading and writing but being fed, loved and given guidance in living life through on the spot counseling and team sports like basketball. The parents or guardians almost always are picking up happy energized young people at the end of the session. These are just my observations one evening a week! I believe the Dream Center is  open 7 days a week. Lord willing, I hope to be a part of this work for a long, long time. - Deb McCormick
Beyond Basics	266122	1	/users/profile/354882	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2015	     I volunteer at a DPS school that Beyond Basics services. I cannot say enough about their programs nor the people who work for them.     They use an excellent reading program to tutor the children. The one on one tutor/student  relationship is a huge factor in their success.     I could go on and on. tutoring may be the major piece of their work but their additional programs build up literacy as well.   Five plus stars!
Beyond Basics	266108		/users/profile/354869	Kyle D.	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	I served as a weekly reading and writing volunteer at Barbara Jordan Elementary School in Detroit. It was my job to help students with their writing projects  and through a focused effort, we made that happen.  The Beyond Basics directors were friendly, courteous, helpful, and gave all of us volunteers solid direction to best assist the children.  In the past, I've volunteered with other organizations that felt self-serving  yet Beyond Basics is quite the opposite. True altruism. No self-congratulory pats on the back or expensive dinners. Just hard work and grit.  Volunteers work directly with the students, and are encouraged to use their individual strengths to connect with their students. It is not a rigid, stodgy program and drew lots of professionals to lend a hand. I have recommended this program to every colleague of mine looking to lend a hand. 
Beyond Basics	266097		/users/profile/354853	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	I volunteered 2 years at Thirkell elementary and it was truly a wonderful and fulfilling experience working with the BB staff and students. This program had truly inspired kids at Thirkell to read and It was amazing to see the same kids increase their vocabulary and show immense interest in reading. Beyond Basics...Keep up the good work!!!
Beyond Basics	266096		/users/profile/354852	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/21/2015	I volunteered earlier this year for Beyond Basics Reading Buddies. The program was great and met very friendly staff. They do a good job helping kids find things they like in school and get them motivated.
Beyond Basics	265432	1	/users/profile/354177	lydiaverse	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	I volunteered for Beyond Basics last year and truly enjoyed my experience at Burton Elementary. Reading and creating stories with children is such a reward. Jessie runs things for the program at the school and always brings such positive energy. She has done a great job making these programs come alive for the children and for us volunteers. Looking forward to this year. Thank you Beyond Basics. 
Beyond Basics	264355	1	/users/profile/353075	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	Volunteering for Beyond Basics is an easy and rewarding way to make a difference in the lives of kids who could benefit from a little extra help. The hours are flexible, so I can volunteer around my work and school schedule.
Beyond Basics	264314	1	/users/profile/353032	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I volunteered with Beyond Basics last year at an elementary/middle school in Detroit as the role of "Reading Buddies". What an amazing organization Beyond Basics is. You can tell that these volunteers have a real passion for what they do and really do make a massive impact on all of those who they come in contact with. Seeing how much the kids improve by sitting with volunteers, reading, and having fun with their daily tasks is amazing. This organization should not go unrecognized. I strongly recommend anyone and everyone to be apart of this team. 
Beyond Basics	264293	1	/users/profile/353007	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I am just beginning to volunteer at Beyond Basics but love the chance to make a difference with one time or infrequent activities. So many programs have one day a year or you need to commit to a set schedule. My life is sporadic and this programs appreciates what I can do each time. I know I will volunteer more often as I so respect this program.
Beyond Basics	263001	1	/users/profile/351703	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	I have valued my time not only working in the office with staff but also in the schools with children. So few volunteer opportunities offer so many options, including the chance to work one-on-one with a student. The results of the Beyond Basics reading model are compelling. I am thrilled to be involved on so many levels, but there is nothing like the delight in a childs eyes when he or she realizes he or she can truly and confidently read.
Beyond Basics	249876	1	/users/profile/337723	emilybuchler	Volunteer	5	07/24/2015	I volunteered at the publishing center at Burton Elementary, and the Give Kids a Hand event. It's always really fun to volunteer for this organization.

Beyond Basics	214704	1	/users/profile/277994	cyndyj	Volunteer	5	09/11/2014	We were part of an art project, working with 2nd graders on how they perceived their greatness.  My first young man, felt his greatness when he played basketball, sometimes playing with his 2 year old brother.  My second young man said he felt great when he biked with his Dad, and he wanted to help others as a police officer when he grew up. It was a great day, to work with kids in visioning their greatness in their current life and in their future adult life.  Placing that feeling of greatness into artwork, to be placed in our office at a later date as an art exhibit.  The children were eager to have outsiders be a part of their day, and it was awesome to see what happens in the Detroit Public Schools, compared to our own hometown schools, and what makes these teachers click in educating our DPS scholars.  I look forward to viewing how my 2 young scholars finish out their artwork in color.  Thanks for a great day!

Beyond Basics	214698		/users/profile/277988	Dequice	Volunteer	4	09/11/2014	Beyond Basics not only gives students the tools to read, it gives them hope and allows them to dream beyond the classroom, beyond their neighborhood, beyond their wildest dreams.  This program inspires, encourages, uplifts and promotes literacy in schools and nothing but great things can happen when a child learns to love to read.  Love the program and I love what it stand for. 
Beyond Basics	214697		/users/profile/277987	LAScott	Volunteer	5	09/11/2014	I greatly enjoyed my first volunteer experience with Beyond Basics.  It was well organized.  More importantly, it was rewarding for me and hopefully the kids I worked with.  I enjoyed the personal interaction.

Right away I knew working with the children would directly impact their lives and my own. It is with this experience I am greatly humbled and grateful. There is no other satisfaction knowing you've helped positively influence their lives. Through this interaction, they've grown to adapt and instill the same mentality to their siblings which goes above and beyond my expectations. Thank you Beyond Basics for this great opportunity!
Beyond Basics	202553	1	/users/profile/264274	sohn5859	Volunteer	5	06/11/2014	Over the years, I have been a reading buddy and a publishing center volunteer. The Beyond Basics program helps the children in so many ways.   Not only does it improve reading skills, but it improves confidence in the children by interacting with them individually and giving them the opportunity to express themselves.   
Beyond Basics	196292	1	/users/profile/256606	mackborders	Volunteer	4	03/24/2014	I had the opportunity to work with Beyond Basics in two different settings. The first took place at Wayne State University. My university worked with student ambassadors involved in Beyond Basics from Southeastern HS. We discussed high school, standardized testing, and college with the students. It was a relaxed setting. The next day I worked with Beyond Basics at Central Collegiate Academy. We were paired with students from Central in writing a story and publishing a book. It was an eye-opening experience. We also candidly discussed college and their futures. I truly felt joy while participating in this service and I think the students also had a great time.
Beyond Basics	196289		/users/profile/256603	miniqiong	Volunteer	4	03/24/2014	We had wonderful activities with students from Beyond Basics. They are smart, kind and lovely kids! It's great to know such program is helping children to succeed beyond their basic levels. They are also helping them to understand the importance of education and teach them to care other people who are below the basic level of literacy. We just need more people to help!

The staff is energetic, creative and totally dedicated to improving the lives of children.

It has been a unique view of how important and time consuming fund raising is to assuring the continued success of the volunteers in the classrooms.

Beyond Basics	178663		/users/profile/235289	Meg_5	Donor	5	10/17/2013	Beyond Basics recognizes that not all freedoms should be taken for granted. Not everyone has access to smart education, literacy programs and health and wellness programs. Beyond Basics fills in the gaps for the underserved. This is an invaluable resource to MANY.
Beyond Basics	174950		/users/profile/231250	JeanW	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	I was introduced to Beyond Basics through my department at Chrysler.  We are encouraged to participate in charity opportunities and when I heard about Beyond Basics I thought it would be very rewarding to help children learn to read.  I worked at the library all through high school and college and knew how much the children loved the reading programs.  What makes Beyond Basics special is their technique of Pressure Release that works amazingly well and encourages rather than discourages the children.  All volunteers are first trained on this technique, which only takes a couple hours, before they start working with the kids. I have been doing this for a year now and have been amazed at how quickly this technique works to bring children up to their grade level in reading. I also have to encourage everyone to reach out  and feel how personally rewarding it is to know that after you have worked with a child just a couple of times they greet you everyweek with a big smile and hug.  Even those kids that are tagged as trouble makers in the classroom, you get them one on one and they are truely appreciatvie of your time and help.  I have not had one bad experience in the past year but rather a total since of fulfillment as a person working with Beyond Basics.
Beyond Basics	167823		/users/profile/222710	mspittman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/06/2013	Beyond Basics is a great program that all schools should participate in.  The staff is great!  They are very supportive of the students that participate in the program.  The students are excited with the activities that are provided, especially the writing center.  They love their published books with their own story inside along with their name.  That one activity is a memorable experience and a great keepsake!  Thank You Beyond Basics for supporting students!
Beyond Basics	165755		/users/profile/220257	kenyaaustin2004	Client Served	5	08/21/2013	This company truly cares about the academic success of children.  My students absolutely love the program, services, and volunteers.  The publishing center is one of my favorite activities.   The center provide students the opportunity to publish their own stories, and take ownership for their writings.  In the past my students would take turns reading their stories.  We often used their stories to further develop their writing and comprehension skills.  In addition, some of my students have made significant gains with their fluency and writing skills.  To conclude,  increasing student development is vital in education.   As educators we strive to meet the needs of all students, and with the support of Beyond Basics I feel we continue to move children forward.   
Beyond Basics	165615	1	/users/profile/220117	Brooke S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/20/2013	I started teaching in a school with Beyond Basics housed there last year. They worked with the students amazingly. It didn't matter if they were general education students or special education students, they progressed. The students would run up to me, so proud, and show me books they wrote or paintings they created. I could not believe that the child had this in them. Not only did Beyond Basics teach them, they brought up the confidence each student needed. They took pictures of the children and what each created and hung them on the walls over the whole school. The students would carry books around and read them in the classroom. I would ask them where they got the books from. They would always respond, "Beyond Basics" looking so proud. Beyond Basics should be in every school. I would walk in their rooms and I saw something where I felt so happy inside. They would be sitting one-on-one with the student assisting them learning how to read. The children found Beyond Basics as a place where they felt safe and nurtured in their room. Beyond Basics in the school is more than we can appreciate.
Beyond Basics	162387		/users/profile/215537	cmconway	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	I had the opportunity to visit Beyond Basic's headquarters and speak about potential volunteering opportunities, as well as collaborating the corporation I work for with Beyond Basics. Their passion for education was enough to win me over and I've been an advocate for Beyond Basics ever since. 
Beyond Basics	161614	2	/users/profile/214367	Sarah128	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2013	I've seen so much growth and outreach in the five years I've known Beyond Basics and its employees. The students and their families truly have life-changing experiences thanks to Beyond Basics. I've heard countless testimonies of adults being able to learn how to read their bible, high school students transitioning from high school at-risk to their college's Dean's List, and so much more. I'm constantly inspired by the people who work at Beyond Basics, who put the kids first and are always trying to expand their program's outreach.    
Beyond Basics	160948		/users/profile/213372	bobbipolk	General Member of the Public	5	06/18/2013	I had an opportunity to visit two schools that are part of Beyond Basics program, Burton and Thurkle.  The delight in the children's eyes when the volunteers are working with them was enough to sell me on the benefit this program offers to children in the lowest performing schools in Detroit.  Teachers in the schools are so thankful to have Beyond Basics in their schools and the students are eager to learn and attend the teaching programs.  Students are proud of their accomplishments!  Beyond Basics has given them skills to be successful in all areas of their lives.
Beyond Basics	141489		/users/profile/187821	pmbo	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I volunteered at Beyond Basics because a friend worked for them and said they needed someone to help them with their Art With The Masters program. After the first day of volunteering I wanted to do more! So in addition to helping with art I decided to be a Reading Buddy. Helping a student improve their reading ability was a life-altering experience! I still remember the first child I worked with and will always remember how amazing it felt when she lit up after realizing she was able to read words she was not able to read at the beginning of our session. In 30 minutes, she improved. That said a lot to me. After volunteering for about a school year, I decided to come on and become a Reading Tutor. I have seen drastic improvements in students reading abilities and their teachers have commented on how much better they are doing in class. They come in hesitant to read and by end of our time together, the students are more confident in themselves and are even interested in reading to others. Beyond Basics' approach to education is effective! Beyond Basics engages students and gives them numerous opportunities to hone skills they will need to advance in life and make a difference in their families and communities. Our main focus is literacy, but what makes the Beyond Basics method different is that it does not only encourage academic achievement, it fosters self-discovery, creative self-expression, curiosity, self-respect and responsibility. Whatever Beyond Basics is doing, the students are always BEGGING to be a part of it because they always walk away learning something new. I recommend Beyond Basics to anyone who is looking to make a direct impact on the future of the city of Detroit.

The organization really does make a difference to undreprivedged, inner city children. Many of Detroit's inner city kids have no chance to improve their lives until the learn how to read. Beyond Basics helps kids improve their reading skills so that they can become productive members of society. I am proud to be involved with such a progressive and productive charity. 
Beyond Basics	141266		/users/profile/187541	MVJM	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	Beyond Basics is truly an inspirational nonprofit organization.  This program is definitely making a difference in so many lives, by providing educational opportunities for students in our Detroit Public Schools.  I'm very happy to be a volunteer for Beyond Basics.
Beyond Basics	141263		/users/profile/187537	BB TPC	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2012	I have worked for this organization for two years, and it is one of the best organizations around. Seeing the student's faces light up when they receive their published stories is priceless, and I love it. The reading programs are excellent, and really make a difference. The program also helps build the child's confidence levels as well, and many teachers have remarked about the amazing difference in their students prior to working with Beyond Basics, and after. 
Beyond Basics	141242		/users/profile/187509	GarysReviews	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I was inspired to help children in Detroit Public Schools learn how to read and comprehend what they are reading about and I am so amazed by how much it can help this great city of Detroit.  I began volunteering at Thirkell Elementary School and it has been a wonderful experience helping 3rd graders learn to read, reading to Kindergarten and 1st grade kids and feeling assured that these kids will have a greater opportunity in life to continue reading and then, help their children and grand children.  Beyond Basics is the best volunteer program I found that truly helps kids learn the tools that will inspire them to continue to learn, have fun reading books about near and far away places and laugh with me as we explore new worlds and bond together as a community.  I am grateful to Beyond Basics and Chrysler for giving me the opportunity to help grow this awesome nonprofit.  Please consider Beyond Basics for your personal contribution to truly helping our Detroit kids grow and prosper in the 21st century.    
Beyond Basics	141233		/users/profile/187498	lyacoobi	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I just recently started volunteering with Beyond Basics. I am absolutely thrilled to see how much of a difference this program really makes in the lives of kids who desperately need extra help and attention when it comes to reading. I love knowing that I am spending my time volunteering with a program that is dedicated to improving the educational experience of children who may not have had the opportunity to do so otherwise. I definitely recommend this program for anyone interested in volunteering and looking to make a difference!
Beyond Basics	141231		/users/profile/187494	RJ King	Board Member	5	11/19/2012	Beyond Basics flat out works. Once a student is identified as falling behind in reading, writing, or word comprehension, they are paired with a certified tutor one on one. Working is a special classroom within the respective school (four Detroit Public Schools) for one hour day, the student learns to read and write at grade level or higher within 6 weeks. Once a child learns how to read, the world is their oyster. Without the ability to read, children act up and typically become bullies. The downward spiral isn't far off, and the students tend to drop out, where things often get worse. Beyond Basics does many other wonderful things, including offering students free art programs and field trips to museums.
Beyond Basics	141223		/users/profile/187486	BBRD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2012	I have spent the past two years as a tutor with Beyond Basics. Over the course of those two years, I have had the opportunity to work with approximately 50 students in the Read to Rise Program. In no time at all I fell in love with my job, and the organization. My mind is filled with countless faces and names of students whose lives were impacted by Beyond Basics. After seeing firsthand the remarkable progress in each student's literacy levels, it became clear to me that this organization was one I wanted to commit to long term. After graduating in April of 2012, I decided to dive in full time and currently serve as the Reading Director. The sheer volume of students we are reaching and helping as an organization is increasing exponentially each year. I can honestly say that in my three years with Beyond Basics, I have never left at the end of the day feeling like that day's work didn't matter. I would encourage anybody interested in getting involved with a Non-Profit, or enriching the lives of children, to consider Beyond Basics as the avenue through which to do so.
Beyond Basics	141210		/users/profile/187472	aberens	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2012	Beyond Basics far exceeds the expectations of what most tutoring programs provide for children in vulnerable neighborhoods in Detroit. Not only do they provide one-on-one, intensive daily literacy tutoring, they provide students with wonderful opportunities to achieve a well-rounded learning experience, all during school hours. In addition to the reading program, Beyond Basics provides enrichment programs such as Art with the Masters, Expanding Horizons, and Publishing Center. The joy that children have when participating in these programs is contagious, spilling over into their families and neighborhoods. I have personally seen that change that this organization can make in students' lives, and it is more than remarkable. This nonprofit is one that goes above and beyond the call of duty to serve children's educational needs, and one that I would highly recommend to anyone. 
Beyond Basics	141169		/users/profile/117122	Ant1	Board Member	5	11/19/2012	Beyond Basics addresses a critical need and responsibility: providing at risk children the proper framework to learn to read and write at grade level. This single ability is the greatest predictor of success. Without the ability to read, the life of the individual is severely limited. This organization has quietly helped thousands of students through the diligence of volunteers, donors and foundations. The Beyond Basics program really should be in place in ALL low performing schools in Detroit.
Beyond Basics	98593		/users/profile/117122	Ant1	Board Member	5	09/29/2011	Beyond Basics has grown from a small organization to a group impacting over 1000 at risk kids coming from families living in poverty and getting over 95% of them to read at grade level or above. This is amazing because it takes kids when the system has failed them in teaching them how to read and write. This skill is the one skill that acts as the predominant deciding factor whether kids will be able to take a good job and help build a community in detroit and elsewhere or be a burden on the system because they perpetuate a cycle of poverty, crime and a large burden on society. There are few things as important as breaking that cycle and giving an opportunity for kids to have a future that doesn't involve a 65% chance of better of jail time, teen pregnancy and poverty.
Beyond Basics	141156		/users/profile/187405	MBWV	Advisor	5	11/19/2012	Beyond Basics does for children what few or no other program does. It identifies children who do not read at their grade level and it works with these students to eliminate this gap. This, in turn, allows kids who go through Beyond Basics' programs to follow along at their grade level. This makes a huge difference in their ability to follow along and do well in school and in their future academic success. There is no better way to invest in the lives' of children. I highly recommend this organization.
Beyond Basics	141154		/users/profile/187403	wwp3544	Donor	5	11/19/2012	This is a wonderful organization that reaches many children in the city of Detroit, teaching them how to read.  It is run by a wonderful woman Pam Good who hires skilled tutors that go into these under served communities.  Children and Adults all benefit!
Beyond Basics	131140		/users/profile/176685	kwk2	Advisor	5	10/30/2012	It is an Honor to be apart of supporting Pam Good and her incredible team at Beyond Basics. This program has proven results of getting students to read at their grade level within 6 weeks. In addition, the Publishing Center bounds books from the students original stories. How powerful to have students see their own stories in a book form. It is inspiring when you observe these students in Beyond Basics classrooms learning to read on-on-one with a tutor.These children are our future, learning to read is  essential for their future. 
Beyond Basics	107220		/users/profile/145178	Principal Davis	Client Served	5	02/28/2012	Earlier this school year Mrs. Pamela Good came into my office and expressed a desire to bring her organization Beyond Basics here to Finney High School. She shared information about her program and that customarily they tutor and mentor students on the elementary level. My first thought was that Beyond  Basics may not work with high school students. But fortunately I decided  to give it a chance. Well only four months later, the Beyond Basics Team has become an immeasurable member of our school family.  Dozens of students have received one-to-one Reading help. We have launched a school newspaper and our students have heard from two corporate VPs, a Division 1 Athletic Director, an Astronaut and the Mayor of the City of Detroit.  Most importantly the unique support that the Beyond Basics Team brings to our school is totally funded by community without any financial  burden on the school or school district. 
Beyond Basics	99351	2	/users/profile/119022	Ronald K.

It has been my pleasure to be associated with the level of dedication and professionalism Beyond Basics provides.
Beyond Basics	98786		/users/profile/117384	robinperry	Volunteer	5	09/30/2011	It is an honor to be associated with Beyond Basics. The impact that their programs have on the lives of at-risk children in the Detroit inner city is astounding! They deliver what they promise; that is, to change the destinies of the children with whom they come in contact.  Teaching children to read, then following that up with volunteer mentors who reinforce reading and writing skills truly opens doors to them that were shut prior to that learning experience. Opportunities to expand the worlds of kids who otherwise would never leave their neighborhoods and classroom atmospheres that provide unmatched encouragement and esteem-building activities round out a program that is unmatched in the Detroit area. Beyond Basics: an unqualified homerun for Detroits kids, and ultimately, for the future of  Detroit!
Beyond Basics	98620		/users/profile/117151	KarenOkeefe	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/29/2011	Beyond Basics is extremely effective in helping children who read below grade level get the extra help they need to move up to grade level in a short time. Their use of employed staff along with volunteers helps every fund raised dollar go farther.  I have seen many programs that talk about what they can do. Beyond Basics just does it.  Amazing program with amazing results.   They also bring writing opportunities to the children, by helping kids to write books. BB then has them typed, and put into a book format for the child to illustrate and take home.  This program makes learning fun!  I love watching the smiles on kids faces as they realize they can read.  Too often inner city children in Detroit only hear what they can't do.  Beyond Basics helps to show them what they can do.  
Beyond Basics	98616		/users/profile/117147	heatherine27	Volunteer	5	09/29/2011	I have worked with the organization, Beyond Basics for over 5 years.  The reading and writing programs that they provide in Detroit's Public Schools really work to make a difference in the lives of so many underserved children.  I have visitied the schools that they serve.  The children love the art program and light up when they talk about the projects that they work on.  This is a great program that deserves to shine.
Beyond Basics	98603		/users/profile/117130	lannienorris	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2011	It's inspiring to see Beyond Basics helping so many kids. God bless Beyond Basics!!!

Beyond Basics	98392	1	/users/profile/116840	heidibrandewie	Volunteer	5	09/28/2011	I have volunteered for Beyond Basics and it is by far one of the most rewarding organizations I've ever been associated with.  It brings unbelievable opportunities to the children of Detroit whose school's it helps.  It tutors the children in reading to bring them up to grade level in six weeks!  It brings a writing program that publishes their own stories!  It also has an art with the masters program that teaches the kids about various artists as they get to experiment with different forms of art.  Because of all it does to make them better academically, it gives the kids truckloads of self confidence by helping them realize that they matter, they can succeed and that they are wonderful people!!
Beyond Basics	98386	1	/users/profile/116835	basics	Volunteer	5	09/28/2011	I volunteer at Beyond Basics as a reading buddy and I have also had the opportunity to help edit the stories that the children write so that their stories can be published. It is magical to see a child soar on the wings of imagination right in front of your eyes and that is what Beyond basics is doing for the children of Detroit. For a little while they forget their troubles and are immersed in a world of joy and beauty that jumps out of books, stories and the artwork that they create with the help of the beyond Basics program. I love volunteering at Beyond Basics and absolutely love seeing the spark of creativity being ignited in the children through the gift of reading!
Beyond Basics	98319	1	/users/profile/116751	da.merritt7	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	Beyond Basics is an outstanding organization that is greatly impacting under-served youth in the City of Detroit! I have volunteered and worked alongside Beyond Basics on several occasions, and the experience truly is uplifting and a sight to see. Reading and writing comprehension is a must for our young people and Beyond Basics is making sure our children have these skills!
Beyond Basics	98262		/users/profile/116679	Beyond basics	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	This organization is exceptional in every way. Children in the inner city of Detroit are being helped to read at their appropriate level. I am proud to be a part of Beyond Basics. Sincerely, Gordon C. Rains
Beyond Basics	98231		/users/profile/116646	KEGB	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	For one year, my friends and I volunteered with Beyond Basics in Jamieson Elementary School in Detroit.  It was a delight to work with these children.  They came into the Beyond Basics classroom excited to work.  And their enthusiasm and determination carried them through as they worked one-on-one with another adult.   I very much enjoyed working with the children.  Whether helping them learn how to read, working on grammar and punctuation as we prepared their own creative story to be published into a book; or answering the myriad of questions that young people always have, it was a pure delight to watch them grow and blossom.  
Beyond Basics	98213		/users/profile/116620	AnuK	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	As a Reading Buddy and Publishing Center volunteer at Beyond Basics, I have been very impressed to see the children grow as readers and writers and see their self esteem blossom as a result of this growth.  Without the ability to read they are disadvantaged in life to a degree that is not fully quantifiable and Beyond Basics is providing them a tool for success and the ability to reach their dreams. One elementary child wrote that she dreamed of becoming a Doctor and it reassured me as a volunteer that the small contribution of our time to help them read was going to make a BIG difference in their lives.
Beyond Basics	97861	1	/users/profile/115525	rowlandd	Volunteer	5	09/21/2011	Beyond Basics is an outstanding organization who has put talk into action.  I volunteer in a number of ways from events to in the classrooms, however, I have found that the classroom is always the most fun.  I volunteer with the Art with the Masters program.  I love doing this because it is allowing the children to use their imagination, which I don't think they are encouraged to do too much.  One of my favorite things to see is when a shy boy or girl opens up to us and it reflects in their creativity in their art projects.  Beyond Basics does so much more than simply bring art and reading to the children, it brings them home, and a safe haven where they can be free to be as open and creative as they want.  I truly believe in what Beyond Basics is doing, and hope that they continue to work with the children, and continue to grow.

I was desperate to get medical help for him, but had no money.  A bunch of my friends led me to 4P1H and this organization has been amazing from the moment I first came into contact with them.  They've funded TNR for 6 of my ferals, plus medical treatment for 2 others.

They give animals a chance that normally wouldn't get one. My Snickers was found as a tiny kitten, in a frozen alley crying for help with his eyes encrusted shut. then 4 Paws 1 Heart team went into action and ultimately saved his life, giving him a second chance....and we adopted him.  Since then I have been a faithful supporter of 4 Paws 1 Heart, not just because of this one incident, but because of all the ones that followed.  They work together with rescues and organizations in helping with these medical costs - so your donation to 4 Paws 1 Heart goes to many animal organizations - donate now and spread the love!

I was amazed at the amount of animals in need that they had helped. I started to donate to them. Then in October 2014, I was doing a little TNR & trapped an 8 wk old all black, male kitten  in a residential area in Utica that I suspected someone had dumped.  I already had 3 cats in my home so I had hoped to find him a home. Did some looking but could not find him an acceptable situation. Contacted 4P 1H and they agreed to take him "under their wing" which meant getting him neutered and his shots, if I agreed to keep him. How could I refuse!

His name was Tobias and he had a fractured pelvis and leg, as well as internal injuries.  Surgery was performed and was paid for by 4P1H.  Tobias started to heal and was sent to a wonderful foster home, where he was lovingly cared for by Jessica and Joel Kuhn.  I watched Facebook every day to follow Tobias' progress.  When he was finally well enough to be adopted, I reached out to 4 Paws and filled out an application.  The next thing we knew, Tobias came to live with us!!  We have 2 other dogs and Tobias has the best life now and plays with his brother and sister every day.  We love Tobias to pieces and cannot imagine life without him!  Words cannot express our gratitude to 4 Paws 1 Heart for all of the good that they do, day in and day out.  Thank you for bringing us Tobias.

She had learned the basics for becoming a service dog to help out with my dysautonomia. She came along with letters and advice from the trainers she had been working with, which were incredibly helpful in helping her have a smooth transition. In addition, volunteers and new friends from RPSM have kept in contact to check in with us and answer and any questions that come up. Koda is so much more incredible than I ever could have asked for. She is patient, good with people and other animals, gentle, obedient, a great companion, and incredibly intelligent. Her first alert was within our first 24 hours of working together, and she hasn't let me down since. She loves riding the trains, will"place" under tables in restaurants patiently, and is an essential part of what has been dubbed "Team KJ." Thank you, RPSM, for my best friend and guardian angel!

They hold events where they take dogs that need homes so you can meet them and so many find homes that way!

When I read that Refurbished pets was looking for foster's I immediately did my research and fell in love with their program. Each animal is spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, and most go through a ten week training program! I now foster for this program and I am blown away by the people I am meeting that are involved. They all are truly a caring and loving group! The prison program not only help the dogs get a second chance at finding their forever homes, but give the prisoners a second chance too. I give this program the 5 star rating and wish it went higher because of all the rescue programs I have knowledge of RPSM blows them all out of the water.

He has brought so much joy and laughter into our family; we hadn't realized that we were missing it so much. RPSM was one of the best organizations that I've ever had contact with. The weekly updates were fun to read, we felt that Max was a part of our family from the very beginning. The contact for pick-up/meet and greet was very helpful working around our schedule and hers. The ability to keep Max's handlers updated on his life since "parole" has been fun (I write them as though Max is writing the letter about his life). Max had learned so many tricks and commands while in the prison program and he still continues to perform them for people he meets. We truly love our Max and can't imagine a life without him. Thanks so much RPSM for rescuing him, training him and allowing us to adopt him!!!! I hope your mission continues and many more dogs get rescued and adopted!!!
Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	240870	1	/users/profile/327229	Lancemommie	Client Served	5	04/09/2015	In January 2009, we lost our beloved geriatric Dobergirl, Jessie. I began looking in Canada, where we live, for a rescue Doberman. There were none available for adoption at that time (weird I know, because there are plenty now). That led me to Petfinder where I saw a picture of a Dobe that I knew was perfect and he was at RPSM. Shortly after submitting my request for adoption, I got a phone call telling me that I could possibly have Lance once a home inspection was done. We live 5 hours away! RPSM did not immediately say no, but worked with us to get the local Humane Society in to do the home inspection and within days we were on our way to adopt Lance. The foster home was loving and caring and we could sense that he had improved a lot emotionally from his trauma before his rescue. Lance's adoption fee was the total of all his vet services (which included neutering and immunizations) and since we were from Canada we also received info and paperwork for taking Lance back across the border. For 6 years now I have been telling everyone who will listen how fabulous RPSM is and I would not hesitate to go back to them where Lance's days are done.
Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	240864	1	/users/profile/327221	TNTCAZZ	Advisor	5	04/09/2015	My experience interacting with the RPSM has been nothing short of inspiring and full fulling. To see the volunteer work they do to help rescue the pets of Michigan that otherwise would have been euthanized is heart warming and touches the heart of this animal lover! I have experience their generosity, patience and caring for over 6 years and have had a chance o be a part of each and every dogs life that has come through the program to be trained and adopted. To hear the success stories and see the changes in the dogs from the time we first see them to how happy and outgoing when they are done makes life seem a little more on an even keel. It gives us all hope that everything in this world does not have to be about the negatives. Keep up the awesome work you do guys!!!!

She had learned the basics for becoming a service dog to help out with my dysautonomia. She came along with letters and advice from the trainers she had been working with, which were incredibly helpful in helping her have a smooth transition. In addition, volunteers and new friends from RPSM have kept in contact to check in with us and answer and any questions that come up. Koda is so much more incredible than I ever could have asked for. She is patient, good with people and other animals, gentle, obedient, a great companion, and incredibly intelligent. Her first alert was within our first 24 hours of working together, and she hasn't let me down since. She loves riding the trains, will"place" under tables in restaurants patiently, and is an essential part of what has been dubbed "Team KJ." Thank you, RPSM, for my best friend and guardian angel!

He died in my arms, and after him being the 5th SIberian Husky (and the closest to me) it was very hard to get over. I happened to see Apollo, and it was perfect from the get go.  Even though he does not look a lot like Yukon, his mannerisma are so identical to both Yukon and Sasha, our Husky previous to Yukon. RPSM had such a great idea of training the pets, as well as giving the inmates in their program something to care for, strive for, as well as to give back to the community, I just had to put my bid in, not just for APollo but for the inmastes as well.  I just think the program is awesome, and APollo has such good trainaing, he listens and obeys 90% of the time, and the other 10% is his sassyness.  But we love him to death, and it has been a perfect fit with our other Dog, and 2 cats (one of which as passed on since after 18 years) I would hihly recommend everyone to go to them, and their volunteers are such great caring people to work with, and I truly beleive all is in the best interest of the animals, as much as it is the imates.  Thank you very much for such a great cause and super job!!

We were searching for a lab mix to adopt and were so excited when we saw this video.  We contacted RPSM and had a fantastic experience working with them to be able to adopt Buddy.  Buddy is the most loving, sweet, playful, smart and obedient dog I have ever had.  People who meet Buddy for the first time fall in love with him -even my sister who is not necessarily a "dog person".  I'm so grateful for the work that RPSM do to help dogs like ours find a home and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new addition to their family.   The process was great and the people were top-notch.

Our other small dog Sophie, missed Cocoa terribly.  She was unhappy for weeks.  She would lay the patio door watching for her to come home.  I began searching for a lab or lab mix on Petfinder.com  I located Ellie's picture and bio.  She was in foster care in Coldwater, MI.  So her journey home began!  She was a 6 month old stray that was picked up running the streets.   RPSM put her in foster care until she was evaluated and accepted into Coldwater Inmate Training Program.  We received weekly updates and evaluations from her training team.  We were notified when she had graduated and told when and where to pick her up.  She was 9 months old the day she was released from the program.  I picked her up that same day at her foster mom's home.  As I signed the adoption papers, she laid down next to me and fell asleep.  It took very little time for her to acclimate to our home.  RPSM are very attentive to your questions and concerns post adoption.  We were encouraged to call or email with any time.  We were amazed at the numerous commands Ellie knew and especially grateful that she was completely housebroken.  She's never had an accident.  Ellie is a beautiful, energetic one year old, black lab mix.  She LOVES to play with Sophie and has brought new energy and happiness back to our household.  She runs around the back yard with glee, trying to keep her toys from Sophie.  She also loves to play in the hose and bite the water!   Her only bad behavior now is barking at dogs that pass by.  However, most of her anxiety is provoked by Sophie who is a yappy small dog breed.   LOL  We are putting her in a program to socialize her more with other dogs and further her leash training.  We have been truly blessed by the time and effort the volunteers at RPSM have given, to bring Ellie to our forever home.  We just LOVE her!  :)

The trainers said he wasn't the most brilliant dog, but he sure is lovable... and he knows his tricks really well.  We laugh at him every day, and I just appreciate so much what RPSM does to help save these animals that might have been euthanized if they'd been left in the shelters.  Thank you, and give the trainers our thanks again for training our Handsome Ransom!

Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	209444	1	/users/profile/272210	2DogsLoved	Client Served	5	08/08/2014	I found RPSM 4 years ago when searching for my first dog.  Upon learning about their program, I knew this was the rescue we would get our dog from.  Willow was everything you could hope for in a dog.  And I know that the work the trainers did with her that helped her to become the best dog she could be.  We were so impressed with RPSM that I began to do home visits for potential adopters and have also fostered for them.  Which is how we ended up with our second dog, Cricket.  He was what we call a "foster fail."  We just couldn't give him up.  So now we have two great dogs from RPSM.  I wouldn't adopt for any other rescue.  I refer everyone who is looking to adopt a dog to RPSM.  I cannot say enough good things about this rescue.

Client Served	5	08/08/2014	My Golden Retriever, Bear, passed in April 2013 and by May I was really missing the companionship a pet offers. I wanted another Golden Retriever, but didn't know where to go to find one. I did a general search on the internet for Golden Retrievers and the RPSM Group came up with a hit for an adoptable Golden Retriever mix. I took one look at Cedar and knew she was the dog for me.  I contacted the RPSM Group through their website and the rest is history. They worked with me through the whole adoption process, from application to approval to the day I picked Cedar up in June.  Their program for training dogs is amazing. The behavior Cedar learned through her training with her handlers at the prison is why she's the well behaved, social girl she is today. I am seriously thinking about getting a fur sibling for Cedar and wouldn't go anywhere else. I HIGHLY recommend the RSPM Group to anyone looking for a well trained pet.

After mourning my 14 year old corgi's death and thinking I could never go through that pain again, I found Mickey's picture while web surfing rescue sights. I live over 4 hours away and worried that distance would affect the adoption process; yet RPSM assured me I could adopt  if I met their requirements.  The rest is history!  I'm the proud owner of Mickey-Moo my little clown who happens to be all terrier-even tho he's really a mutt!!  After bringing him home I needed advice on an unexpected behavior issue that was kinda scary.  They were right on the mark with their advice and he has blossomed.  No more issues. He gets along with dogs and people.  They were upfront about his high prey instinct and we manage it with games and toys and water play.  We let him hunt mice and shrews in the yard and occasionally he grabs the unfortunate bird from the air but I understand this is part of being a terrier.  He can't help himself.  He loves to hunt.  He's my little shadow and life is very busy again Now, if only I had his energy . . .  Thank you RPSM for knowing that he was worth saving.  Gotta go.  Mickey is telling me something. No, Timmys not in the well;  I think he said "Thanks RPSM".

I was retired, widowed, and needed to do something that would make a difference for the dogs I was seeing in shelters. I found this rescue to be one of the most caring and devoted rescues to work with. The prison training program is a winner for both the dog and the inmate trainers.  I became a "foster failure" during my first year, by adopting the dog I had fostered.  There was a real connection between this cho. Lab. named Hank and me.  After his wonderful training I decided he had to be mine.  I cannot say enough about how great this program is and how it changes the lives of so many people and dogs.  The inmates that become trainers are learning a skill that has helped several find careers  upon release from prison.  The dogs are saved, trained and adopted and are given a second chance to enjoy the love of a family.  All of our volunteers are so giving of their time and energy and are always willing to go that extra mile to help in anyway. As long as I can walk a dog I will continue volunteering with rpsm.

Our first Abby is a treasure even though she is a little ball obsessed. She could play all day if only would could throw that long. Our second boy was pretty timid(Shield) and it took a long time for him to truly blossom but Ozzy as he is now called is a crazy happy bundle of joy now. we stay in touch with the folks from Rpsm and send pics and post on Facebook all about our furkids for the world to see. If ever we adopt again and I am sure we will in time they will be our first contact. They care deeply about the dogs they foster and want the best for all parties.

He says that she is the "perfect" dog, and she's pretty darned close!  The training she had in the prison really facilitated her transition from the streets to coddled home.  RPSM screens potential adopters carefully to determine suitability of homes, owners and pets.  They do education about spaying and neutering.  What really attracted me to the program though was the rehab potential for the incarcerated trainers.  This could be something that really turns their lives around.     This is an amazing group, totally devoted to their cause.   I also do occasional volunteer work for them and wish I could do more.

Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	154050		/users/profile/204872	Lisa232	Client Served	5	04/10/2013	When I decided to adopt a dog I didn't know where to start.  Discovering Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan (RPSM) changed my whole outlook on the process.  I admit I had concerns about owning a dog in an apartment but during my home visit (yes they do a home visit to make sure you are a good candidate for adoption) all my questions were answered with respect and professionalism.  It's sometimes hard for me to believe that I will have had by dog for five years in October.  It was the best thing I've ever done. The people behind RPSM LOVE dogs and want the best for them -  they take the job of finding the perfect forever home for their dogs very seriously and with great love.  People may wonder about having a dog trained in a prison, but it is the best of both worlds.  The dogs form a bond with humans they may never have experienced, before where love and affection are felt every day while they get wonderful training and care.  For the inmate trainers, they say how important it is to them to have this task in their rehabilitation.  They also participate in fund raising for the organization.  If you adopt a dog still in the system (not 'paroled'), you will receive updates from the inmates as to how your future dog is doing, what they are learning, and a bit of insight to the the personality of the dog. Along with their adoption work, they do a find job of educating animal lovers about situations in the animal world including pet rescue in general and ethical treatments of shelter dogs. I've done a small bit of volunteer work for RPSM (a home visit) and I spread the word any chance I get to those I know who are considering pet adoption.  Adopting a dog can, in all honesty be a dicey situation - you never really know what you will get.  That is unless you go through RPSM.  When you adopt an RPSM dog, you get one that has been temperament screened, trained (house and crate), has had a complete vet check, has been spayed/neutered up AND has a microchip.  You will bring home the best friend you've been looking for.   I can't recommend Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan enough.  Their hard work and dedication changes lives.

Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	132915		/users/profile/178598	Barb V.	Volunteer	4	11/02/2012	I had lost my best friend of 12 years, Zeek, and was looking at pet finder.  The sweetest little face caught my eye.  He was Buttons, a RPSM rescue.  I knew I wanted him, so I filled out an application.  It seemed crazy at first, the references, vet check, and even a home interview.  The more I went through the process, the more sense it made.  There are too many bad people out there who abuse dogs, and some are, well, basically ignorant of what a pet entails.  They are a member of the family, and require love, attention, discipline and vet care.  The fence requirement almost ended it for me, but the meeting with Kathy B. changed that, she realized I knew what I was doing and also that "Buttons" now Butters, had the qualities that would fit with me and no fence.  It seemed like forever while I waited, the updates from the prison helped, and man was I ready when my adoption day came !  I have had wonderful experiences with RPSM, their compassion and concern for the animals is the tops, and Kathy B. was, and is, a wonderful foster (and now a great friend, she probably gets sick of my calls and pic posts...lol).  Diane was very helpful with the updates also.  It was well worth the wait, and almost a year later, Butters and I are both happy and healthy, and fence free, and I have met wonderful people with the same compassion for fur kids as I have.  Wish I could do more.  I am glad I could hook up Sheri and Penny and Barkley, I will continue to try to match people and pets.  I think if everyone was as intuitive as Kathy with the fence issue, more would possibly be adopted, but I do understand the concerns.

Even though I had never met my dog prior to going into the prison, I got great progress reports that told me more and more about my new dog, so that when I finally did take her home, I had a pretty good idea of her personality, eating habits, and her training progress.  The organization did a great job of preparing me to take my dog home too.  The folder of procedures on this was very helpful.  Learning that should anything happen to me, my dog would return to rpsm for adoption and go through the same rigorous screening again, was a great piece of mind to me too, a comfort.I also liked the community service aspect, helping a troubled inmate go through this process and seeing the successful rehabilatation  back into the community was a great feeling too.  Knowing my dog helped an inmate make his own life better and learn some great skills in the process was wonderful.  Great program, great dogs, great trainers, great volunteers.   And I will definitely adopt from there again.

I have seen them at parades, festivals in town-they are always working hard to take care of them and find them all homes.   They feature animals on Facebook as well to get the word out about the dogs and cats that need homes.  This group works so hard, to do what they love-they are great people!  It breaks my heart for these abandoned animals, but with this group of loving people they at least have a chance!

It is shown that this type of programs reduce violence and give the inmates skills they can use when they return to the outside world. In addition, the dog we received had a basic obedience training, another thing that reduces returns and makes for a safer community.

She had learned the basics for becoming a service dog to help out with my dysautonomia. She came along with letters and advice from the trainers she had been working with, which were incredibly helpful in helping her have a smooth transition. In addition, volunteers and new friends from RPSM have kept in contact to check in with us and answer and any questions that come up. Koda is so much more incredible than I ever could have asked for. She is patient, good with people and other animals, gentle, obedient, a great companion, and incredibly intelligent. Her first alert was within our first 24 hours of working together, and she hasn't let me down since. She loves riding the trains, will"place" under tables in restaurants patiently, and is an essential part of what has been dubbed "Team KJ." Thank you, RPSM, for my best friend and guardian angel! She is a champ!

I didn't want to abandon the dog, but, for the safety of the cat, couldn't keep it in my home.  Faced with this dilemma, a friend recommended contacting Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan.  So I did, and from that very first contact, RPSM was wonderful in helping me find a positive solution to a difficult situation.  The people in the RPSM organization understood the dog/cat problem and were quick to respond.  Within a week's time, the puppy was temperament tested  and given the opportunity to be housed with a caring volunteer and start the next prison/partner program.  They were prompt in answering my many questions, they understood my concerns, they empathized with my feelings, and they were 100% solution-based in helping me find the best possible situation and future home for my dog.  It was a pleasure working with RPSM, and I can't thank them enough for their kindness and compassion!
Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	152728		/users/profile/203648	Mickey E.	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	Like many other adopters, we had lost a beloved pet.  Our beagle seemed to grieve the loss like we did, and we decided to adopt another dog to keep him company.  That was when we found RPSM. We were very impressed with their prison training program.  We found Gus and filled out an application for him.  We had a great visit with his foster mom when she came for our home visit.   The adoption process went quickly and smoothly.  We had to wait a few weeks for Gus to complete his training, but it went by quickly as we received regular updates on his progress.  We knew his favorite toys before he came home.  The day we picked him up, Gus was a bit stressed because of all the changes that he had gone through that day - leaving the prison, going back to his foster home, and then meeting us and his new brother.  But he soon settled in with the family routine and everyone in the family loves him.  Even our four year old nephew can play with him like he's his own dog.  We love being able to see updates of the other adopted dogs and seeing the new dogs as they come into the RPSM program.  The RPSM volunteers do a wonderful job and were a pleasure to work with through the adoption process.  We speak highly of RPSM and recommend them to everyone.

However, I went on line to RPSM and there was a litter of standards ready for adoption.  Because of the timeliness of the posting, I could only rationalize my good fortune as angels sent from Charlie.....thus Bosley came into my life.  Bosley is an apricot standard poodle and a true treasure.  Anyone who comes in contact with him is immediately drawn to his hypnotic eyes and loving nature.  All who get to know him, ask about him constantly.....he is unforgettable.  I cannot thank RPSM enough for all the work and care they do for animals in need.  I also cannot thank them enough for all the concern and deligence they demonstrate in the adoption procedures.  They are top-notch!
Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	136561		/users/profile/182487	Michelle108	Client Served	5	11/09/2012	We adopted our dog, Jordy, in August of this year for our 7 year old son.  We were so excited to find a group that would take a dog with a good personality and put them through professional obedience training before sending them off to their new homes.  This worked particularly well with us.  We are experienced dog people but are at a busy time in our lives so bringing in a dog that knew the basics of obedience allowed my son to interact positively with Jordy as soon as he arrived.  He still loves to show off Jordy's "skills" to anyone visiting the house.  Even though Jordy had a few emotional scars from his early life, we have found  that his obedience foundation has helped us work through this.  I would also like to commend the community of volunteers working for RPSM.  They are a fantastic group of people who truly care about the dogs and their new familites.  The Facebook community is great and keeps the adopters connected with each other and their fosters.  I love to read the updates on dogs I've never met but feel I know from hearing their stories and updates.  I volunteered for other dog rescues for many years in another state but I can say that this group is special.  The positive attitudes and sense of community is the best I have ever experienced.  Jordy has not only touched our hearts but he has also helped bring our older dog, Buddy, out of his shell.  Buddy was a severe abuse case who never really learned how to play.  Jordy came in and was so well socialized that he quickly won Buddy over and taught him how to play for the first time in his 13 years.  The two now entertain us with their antics and rough-housing.  He's even won over our cat.  I don't think he'd ever seen one before because he didn't seem to recognize the smell.  But now the two curl up together on a dog bed and snooze.  I credit the personality profiling and socialization done by RPSM for selecting such a sweet dog for inclusion in their program.  Overall, we have been very happy with our new addition and I'd say he's pretty darn happy here.  A great big thank you to all the dedicated RPSM volunteers.  You have certainly made a difference in Jordy's life.  Thank you for seeing somethig gspecial in him and bringing him to us.  We love him dearly.

Everyone thinks he is the nicest dog, and they're impressed by his training (he's also very beautiful!). We make sure to tell everyone where we got him, and we encourage them to look into adopting from RPSM as well--if they're thinking about adding a dog to their family. RPSM was always available--before and after the adoption--to answer questions and concerns and offer help. They are invested in finding great homes for their dogs and ensuring that the match between dog and family is perfect.

They described him in such great detail. We met him and fell hard. He is the calmest and sweetest dog we have ever owned. Our hearts have healed with the help of all the people and this lovable character Buckley from RPSM. I recommend them happily and constantly.

Diane Anthony couldnt be nicer and helped me through the adoption process.  Since I live 5 hours from RPSM, I couldnt do a at home interview, I sent Diane pictures of my home, and family for review, I had a phone interview with Teddy's foster Mom, Keri Ramirez, who couldnt have been nicer.  When I got the phone call from Diane that we were approved and Teddy was ours, I think I cried.  I drove that poor woman crazy with my emails and phone calls, but she was always a joy to work with.   I tell everyone I know about your rescue and how wonderful it is.  Teddy was too little for the prison program, but he was well behaved and housebroken from the day we got him.  We have him since March and I couldnt imagine life without him.  He is an amazing little guy!!!  THANK YOU RPSM!!!!

I started just casualing looking and thinking about a new dog and the void the loss had left in my life. I really missed having someone around to talk to and needed that. I first started looking at the same breed as Riley was but new it would just remind me of Riley and i couldnt deal with that so i started looking at other breeds. Thats when Harley came into view and as i read the story telling me about him and that someone had used a ball bat on him tears formed in my eyes. I realized he was meant to be with me. Though it seemed like forever from start to finish it really was just a short time and all things came together and Harley and i seem to be made for each other. What an experience and what a great dog i have, thanks to everyone at Refurbished pets.

My husband says "we need to get a new dog, right now". So Internet searching we went!  We stumbled upon RPSM and learned about their exciting work with the dogs and the inmates.  We knew we wanted to be a part of this movement!  We located an extremely high energy mix breed dog, Biscuit.  Boy, were we surprised by just how much energy he had!  He was, indeed, a handful!  However, the volunteers were very supportive and encouraging.  They provided us with resources to get through this difficult stage of puppydom. Well, we made it!!! Biscuit still has tremendous energy, but he has settled into our home routines and is a devoted "family" member.  My husband teases him and says that biscuit would be 'soap', without the support of the RPSM volunteers and his foster Mom!

We adopted from them a month ago now and we couldn't be happier with our new little man Tommy. The two biggest perks with adopting from them is you get a very well trained socialized and secure dog. The second is that you are supporting an amazing program linked up with the correctional facility. How cool is that! I love telling our story and I all ready have someone close to me when they get a house with a yard they are going to look into adopting from RPSM.

I have been so impressed with the total dedication this group has exhibited. After loosing my two elder mini poodles, my daughter went searching for a standard poodle to keep our one company and found RPSM. This group of volunteers is by far the best I've seen in a long time. From the first person I had phone contact with, to the foster mom and all the other volunteers in between, they have all shown us what a kind and caring devoted rescue group they are. I adopted a 12 week old puppy that already knew his basic commands and was almost totally potty trained by his foster mom.. Nile still remembers the strong start he got in life by showing his kind, loving heart and willingness to please. They have the dogs best interest in mind and work to thoroughly check out adoption applicants. Even my references told me what nice people they were interviewed by! I can't say enough about all the wonderful things RPSM has done -- all with the animals best interest in mind. I have recommended them to all my circle of friends and will continue to do so. It was well worth the 5 1/2 hour drive to meet RPSM members and pick up our new pup. Thanks to them, more dogs have a wonderful opportunity to have a better life. 
Refurbished Pets of Southern Michigan	132922		/users/profile/178606	Amy_60	Client Served	5	11/02/2012	 We adopted our dog thru RPSM this summer. We were very impressed at how detailed the application was. To us it indicated the caring nature of the group and the commitment to placing dogs in good homes.  RPSM volunteers contacted our vet and several personal references and a volunteer came to our home to see our back yard to make sure we did have a fence. This process moved quickly, I believe it was less than a week. Upon approval, we began receiving weekly reports from the inmates that were training our dog, sharing with us info about her progress. Each week we eagerly awaited the report and the anticipation of our new furry friend finally coming home grew. Questions we had were quickly answered. We had many.... they were all happily answered without delay.  Finally adoption arrived....our contact person welcomed us and made us feel very comfortable as we had our first interaction with our new pet. She talked with us and covered all the info the inmates had sent about our dog. She gave us time to consider if this was in fact the dog we wanted and we did want to adopt her. We didn't feel rushed or hurried at all. We signed the papers and off we went to begin our new adventure with our new dog by our side. Our dog's foster mom stays in contact with us and is happy to answer questions that have come up since we brought our dog home.  The whole process was delightful!  We are so thankful we came across RPSM on line.... I have recommended them over and over to others who are looking for a pet. We have a wonderful dog that we are so happy with. She came to us trained by the inmates.... but we were not trained. Over time we have learned about our sweet dog and she has learned about us... We can see the start she had with the inmates has helped her so much. She is a wonderful dog, and she just gets better and better with time. We are so thankful for her and for caring RPSM volunteers and trainers. They are a dedicated group of hard working people that love dogs and want to see them have good homes.

I also train dogs at Petco. I train basic, advanced obedience, and trix. I specialize in training dogs that most trainers wont touch because of their background/behavioral issues. This being said I used to be an inmate! Yes R.P.S.M. provided me access to the education and experience to make a new life for myself. Since Ive been in the dog business I have had alot of contact with rescue groups. I find many that their primary concern is the almighty dollar. They then go onto place dogs in homes without doing home checks etc. These dogs ultimately end up being returned or worse. This simply does not happen with R.P.S.M. They do their homework plus some. I am very critical when it comes to dogs. My opinion is an educated and skilled one. I dont hand out "freebies" because I have a past with this group. Ive done it for the dogs since day one. I can remember when this group first started as individuals. They have since become an awesome TEAM and deserve all the "kuddos" in the world. I not only like this group i LOVE them and will support any endevor they shall choose. Sincerely, Michael Johnson/All Paws Up! LLC

This program does not cost our taxpayers a dime.  It is funded by fundraisers, grants, and wonderful donations.  The adopters of the trained dogs are thoroughly questioned to ensure provided our well trained, totally vetted dogs a forever home.  Far too many dogs are euthanized yearly due to many reasons that are superficial at most.  The dogs, after being trained are wonderful and the inmates doing the training find emotions that they never knew in their lifetime.  A win-win program for all concerned.

A very dear friend of mine is very involved with Enchanted Makeovers. That's how I learned about this wonderful organization. I volunteered to help paint for one of the shelter makeovers.  Even though I was only painting for a few hours, I was moved by the other volunteers, by Terry, and her devotion to this cause.  You wouldn't think what this group does is a big deal, but it is.  I have not been able to attend a big reveal as yet, but from what I have heard about them, they are life changing.  Women and children in shelters are validated, acknowledged, and loved.  They know they are worthy, that they matter, and that life can be beautiful. That's why I love Enchanted Makeovers.

It has truly been a blessing to donate my time and artwork for such a wonderful organization.  Enchanted Makeovers goes where not many would want to go or have thought about going which is exactly why their work is so important. They are cosmetically improving shelters via painting, repair work, new furniture and bedding which is greatly needed but also bringing much love into the shelters with all of the handmade items either sewn, knitted or hand painted from around the country.  Enchanted Makeovers believes handmade items loving created bring a sense of value to the women and children who find themselves in need of a new beginning in their lives.  The energy and joy they feel with the makeovers of their shelters is truly inspirational.

She is an inspiration to all that have come in contact with her and her organization!      
Enchanted Makeovers	137563	1	/users/profile/183552	Irma S.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Terry Grahl,  founder of Enchanted Makeovers, was born with an enlarged heart, not physically speaking, but in the spiritual sense!  Her passion and dedication, along with her supportive team, to help underserved and abused women and children  to begin the healing process by showing them that they are loved, not forgotten, and are truly worthy individuals  through her detailed orchestration of turning a cold and impersonal like atmosphere of a shelter into a warm caring place of refuge.  A home to wake up in the morning in a room filled with light, color, hand made fun and beautiful things to charge their mindset to a day of hope and inspiration in moving forward in their lives; after an emotionally draining day of working toward reversing all that had once been so traumatic in their lives and return to that warm and inviting sanctuary in the evening for a good nights rest to face the challenges again the next day.  I had the pleasure and honor of working with Terry, her team, and other volunteers on the Myriam House project at Vista Maria.  On the day that the sleeping quarters were completed, the girls opened the doors to their rooms while we stood in the hallway, there was not a dry eye in the house!  It was not only the beginning of a transformation for the girls, but also a rewarding and uplifting experience for all the volunteers to see such joy brought to those with so little and so much heart ache.         
Enchanted Makeovers	168574		/users/profile/223504	powerfulyou	Donor	5	09/09/2013	We love and support the work that is being done by Enchanted Makeovers. It is so vitally important for us as a community to support women who find themselves in a position where they need a helping hand. Terry Grahl and her team put their whole hearts into every project and, as you can see from the photos on their website, the physical transformations of the spaces they makeover are remarkable. From stark, dark and rndown to inviting, warm, homey and beautiful! In this nurturing environment women and children can truly thrive. The Dalai Lama says that the Western woman will change the world. Terry Grahl and Enchanted Makeovers are helping put women in a position to do just this.  If you are looking for a worthwhile, feel-good and do-good organization to become involved with or donate to, look no further. YOU can be part of the change too. 
Enchanted Makeovers	168496		/users/profile/223421	Eric47	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I've worked with Enchanted Makeovers on their  past few projects.  I have been blessed to meet such a wonderful group of people.  What they do is truly amazing.  It's nice to volunteer for an organization that touches so many lives in such amazing ways.  I'm always looking forward to the next project.  
Enchanted Makeovers	168146		/users/profile/183522	Donajane L.	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	I have been a volunteer with Enchanted Makeovers since it was started by Terry Grahl 7 years ago.  I pick up, throughout the greater Detroit area, any donations that are used to totally transform women and children's homeless shelters.  To date we have completed four and the last was a building that is part of the largest rescue mission in Detroit.  Our next project is to complete two other buildings for women and children in that complex.  Some of the materials are donated by companies, but the work to fix and paint furniture, paint rooms,  repair electrical and construction problems and collect all the items for a total makeover of the shelter is done by volunteers.  The curtains, bedspreads, afghans, doilies under lamps and on chests are made by volunteers.  As Terry says, it takes a village to complete a makeover. However, all of the above work is so rewarding then we see the faces of the women and children on the day of the great reveal.  All day is spent by volunteers putting everything in each room and then the women and children are brought to their rooms to see the transformation.  They are awed by the sight and the beauty of their rooms.  There is no greater gift than to show someone how worthy they are to have this beautiful space and to be given hope for the future. It is truly an honor to be part of a truly inspiring organization, Enchanted Makeovers, and to know Terry as it's founder and my friend.
Enchanted Makeovers	137533	1	/users/profile/183522	Donajane L.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have worked with Enchanted Makeovers on three girl's and women's shelters in the greater Detroit area.  Terry has a vision of how transforming these shelters will give the residents a space to call their own, as well as hope for the future.  She changes everything to totally change the environment for the residents and has a cadre of volunteers who love working with her, including murals on the hallway walls.  She has been called and this is her purpose and I am priveleged to volunteer  for her.  Dona45

The tireless and selfless leadership of Terry Grahl and the energy she gives to her passion of helping others gives so many a lift to their spirits and hope in their hearts.   She is truly making a difference in her community - and our country.  The women, children, and families she touches stand a little taller, smile a little more often, and sleep more soundly knowing that someone cared enough to help them change their lives.   I'm so proud to see Terry continue to grow - knowing that every step of the way she is reaching more people and spreading more joy!
Enchanted Makeovers	138535	2	/users/profile/184604	Brenda32	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	It has been my great pleasure to know Terry for the past three years, and see first hand her dedication, compassion, and incredibel drive to help others.   She is an amazing woman, and as founder of Enchanted Makeoves, she gives - and gives, and gives - to others.   With her help countless women are learning the skills and confidence to change their lives, and learning that they are worthy of receiving goodness from others.  I know Terry will not stop until she has touched every woman and child who needs her.    She's a blessing to them...
Enchanted Makeovers	168062		/users/profile/222956	mizz bee	Volunteer	4	09/06/2013	it's a non profit org. that Terry started, that not only do you go in with the knowledge that you're going to help others to improve there lives and surroundings, but you come out with a light within yourself that is truly heart warming.... I had the best experience meeting the other volunteers and meeting the gals that were being blessed with the love pouring out from all different walks of life and organizations so that they may get back on track & get on the yellow brick road... and to find their emerald city so that their lives will be filled with goodness & love that they deserve.... in Jesus' name ~ Amen ;O) xox 
Enchanted Makeovers	167360		/users/profile/222225	ingridriley	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	Terry has made it her life's mission to help empower women from all walks of life. She is fully committed to changing the lives of women and children one makeover at a time. I believe that she truly cares for every person she meets and her compassion really shows. 
Enchanted Makeovers	167206		/users/profile/222067	Jennifer238	Donor	5	09/05/2013	In 2008 I met Terry for the first time. I was in awe of her selfless nature and willingness to give so much of herself to others.Her beliefs of giving handmade items to others is much like my own. The items I,family members, and friends make for the women in the shelters are gifts of love that we hope send the powerful message that someone out there cared enough to take the time to make something with their own hands just for them.The most precious gift is the gift if ones self.The magical part of being involved in Enchanted Makeovers is that not only are you helping others,but you are also learning a lot more about yourself in the process. 
Enchanted Makeovers	167017		/users/profile/184424	GinaK1059	Donor	5	09/04/2013	My connection to Enchanted Makeovers came to be through my daughter, Britni and her friendship with Terry Grahl.   Britni  is not only a team member she is also EM's official photographer.  When I first learned of Enchanted Makeovers and Terry's story, to say I was moved is an understatement.  To see Terry, the EM team members and volunteers converge upon a shelter is a sight to behold.   They bring with them not only the astounding  physical transformation to the shelter itself  but also love and hope to each of the residents.   They put their love into action with every shelter makeover.  I cannot say enough about the passion in Terry's heart and  her commitment to the women and children residing in the shelters.  Terry and EM restore my faith in humanity.  
Enchanted Makeovers	138360	2	/users/profile/184424	GinaK1059	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	I first met Terry Grahl four years ago through my daughter, Britni.  Britni is a team member of Enchanted Makeovers and is the official photographer for this inspiring non-profit.  When I learned what Terry was doing, I was incredibly moved.  Her deep commitment of instilling self-worth, hope, and love to women and chilren that are struggling is beyond commendable.  This is a personal mission for Terry and as such she brings every part of her being into the renovation of women and childrens' shelters.   She transforms their living environments into an enchanted sanctuary of healing.   Her message is powerful, her work life changing, not only for those receiving but also for those that volunteer and work along side her.  
Enchanted Makeovers	167004		/users/profile/221850	Renata Bowers	Donor	5	09/04/2013	I was led to Enchanted Makeovers by a friend, and the organization resonated with me immediately.  What I love about EM's model is that it enables anyone and everyone to participate in a hands-on, personal and meaningful way.  There are opportunities to donate dollars, most certainly.  But for those with gifts and a love for creating things - murals, bedspreads, pillows, lampshades, etc. - EM provides the opportunity to match those gifts with someone to whom they will bring great and lasting meaning and hope.  A child is given a handmade doll or a superhero cape to wear.  Each woman and child rests in a beautifully painted room, complete with handmade curtains and bed linens, pillows and other loving touches.  I've always believed that in any point of one's life he/she is either in the position to give or to take, and that both experiences impart blessings.  What I love about EM is that it gives each and every person an opportunity to participate in something deeply good and lasting.  Everyone comes away feeling like the world truly can be a good, hopeful, gracious and loving place.

Enchanted Makeovers	157184		/users/profile/183325	EllenBanks	Volunteer	5	05/06/2013	I feel so very blessed to be on the Enchanted Makeovers' team as the Chief Operating Officer.  I get to see each and every day how hard the organizaiton works to fulfill the mssion.  We just completed our largest makeover ever!  For the majority of 2012, we worked at the Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries to transform their Genesis III house.  We completely transformed 21 bedrooms with 53 beds, hallways and create a sacred sewing room.  Over 300 people including mural artists, crafters, sewers and volunteers  and around the country helped to transform this house into a home that inspires all who live there while they are re-building their lives.  And, we are already moving full-steam ahead with the next project!  I hope you will join us!  It will transform you beyond your dreams!
Enchanted Makeovers	137351	1	/users/profile/183325	EllenBanks	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Enchanted Makeovers is a 100% volunteer non-profit organization that impacts lives in ways I never thought possible!  I have been involved during an actual homeless shelter makeover for women and children and the impact on everyone involved in amazing.  For many of the women or teens, they have tearfully shared that this was the first time anyone cared enough for them to make them feel worthy.  The impact of just sharing lovingly hand-made items was so dramatic.  In most cases, the residents who call a shelter "home" are used to receiving donations that are actually trashed items people have thrown away.  When Enchanted Makeovers came in with everything beautiful and hand-made, it touched their hearts to know everyone is worthy and deserving of love.  We all learned the fundamental lesson of unity among people.  
Enchanted Makeovers	145418	1	/users/profile/191921	Kevin48	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I heard of Enchanted Makeovers through my girlfriend, Britni Wilson, who is a team member of EM.  I work for a non-profit agency and thought I knew all there was to know about them, that was until I met Terry and saw, firsthand, what Enchanted Makeovers is all about.  I had the opportunity to participate in one of the makeover events at Alternative for Girls in Detroit.  I was amazed at what Terry and her team actually do to put on an event.  The passion that Terry has for what she does and the genuine care that she has for the people involved is unmatched.  I've gotten to know Terry more through conversations and other events, and there is nothing that she can't do.  She has spirit about her that is inspiring.  And it is because of her spirit and her love for Enchanted Makeovers that makes people want to be a part of it.  She has taken a leap of faith, followed her dreams and has changed the lives of so many people.  I am honored to to know Terry and the Enchanted Makeovers team.  
Enchanted Makeovers	145202	1	/users/profile/191750	Piegirl	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I met Terry and the Enchanted Makeovers team through The Creative Connection Event. As the event designer, I was enlisted to help them design and set up a booth in our MarketPlace. Terry and I instantly connected as lovers of all things vintage. I was so impressed with Terry's story and her 100% commitment to following her vision to help women and children in shelters feel the comforts of home. When Terry asked if I could volunteer to help design tables for the She is Me gala, I eagerly accepted, happy to have the chance to help her and the team further the Enchanted Makeovers vision. Terry is so committed to the journey of seeing her vision come to life all over the country. Enchanted Makeovers focus on handmade, vintage and homespun really make these projects come to life and envelop everyone involved.
Enchanted Makeovers	141086	2	/users/profile/187313	annie95453	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2012	I first heard about Terry and Enchanted Makeovers when I was part of an online mall called Shabby Lane Shops.  There was a challenge that went out to us from another group called Make Mine Pink.  A very, very easy slipper pattern had been developed and the slippers would be used for a shelter who Terry was working her magic on!  I made a few pair and naturally started reading more and more about Terry and her dream of giving needful women and children not just a bed and a blanket, but a beautiful place to stay where they would be not just safe but uplifted by their surroundings.  The more I read, the more I wanted to do.  Let me just say that for those of you who haven't had a one on one conversation with Terry, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!  She shared her story and I shared some of mine and she quietly listened to every word that spilled out of me.  I'll never forget that conversation.  Anyway, I pledged to help as much as I could in the way of fabric goods - bags, aprons, slippers, etc.  Sadly, my body decided not to cooperate with my heart and I had to tell Terry I could no longer be a part of her cause.  I still haven't given up the hope that there will come a day when I can again volunteer.  In the meantime, Terry's work goes on.  It  grows and grows and hundreds, probably thousands, of women and children have been blessed by her dream that turned into a reality.  God bless you, Terry!
Enchanted Makeovers	141029	2	/users/profile/187256	Peggy19	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2012	Several years ago I got to privilege of working with Terry Grahl on an Enchanted Makeover project in New York City. It was a wonderful experience. The best part was being able to speaking to the women who were the recipients of our work. Terry has built a fantastic organization doing wonderful things for women and children and she and her people deserve our thanks.   Peggy Gaffney  
Enchanted Makeovers	140897	2	/users/profile/187114	Sally A.	General Member of the Public	5	11/17/2012	I met Terry through YouTube!  We both joined a group that helped us network with others (mostly women) who wanted to be able to create their own destiny...using the talents, gifts, and strengths we were born with, and the ones that we were striving to achieve.  I was searching for a support system of women that would be there to encourage me and inspire me to grow, change, believe in myself, dream bigger dreams, love myself.  I found that in the group and I was drawn to Terry.  She was so genuine in her want to help other women.  She herself is very enchanting.  She has an aura about her that draws people to her.  You immediately feel loved, respected and supported!  She has shared her heart so openly, asking for help always to help others...and God has seen her through so many events.  The door she went through continues to lead her down paths that I don't even think she could have imagined in the beginning.  God will continue to bless her and the work she and all her helpers do for others.  Just take a moment to read about her and look at the things that have been accomplished because she has a vision, a desire, a prayer to let women know that they are loved and worthy.  Oh that we all would take a moment and let some other person be able to believe in themself.  The world would be a much better place to live in.  Thanks, Terry, for opening your heart to me! 
Enchanted Makeovers	140773	2	/users/profile/186989	Heather76	Advisor	5	11/17/2012	I found out about Enchanted Makeovers through a friend while I was doing an online project.  It does not matter where you come from or where you have been, if you believe anything is possible. I will never forget the first time Terry (CEO and founder of EM) and I chatted. I was INSTANTLY connected to her passion and mission. I found it refreshing to see a community so passionate about not only creating a safe, warm and loving environment for these women and children but also educating the donors and volunteers of HOW their time and donations have impacted not only these women by themselves. Enchanted Makeovers (in my eyes) is a shining example of the direction charity needs to go in. 
Enchanted Makeovers	140746	2	/users/profile/186956	Artgirl78	Volunteer	5	11/17/2012	I found out about Enchanted Makeovers from the Dreamers Into Doers site.  I was contacted by Terry to  help with artwork for several events.  I was blown away by Terry's incredible passion for giving and helping women improve their lives.  Enchanted Makeovers helps young women learn skills that will help them for the rest of their lives.  The positive influence in so many areas of young women's lives makes the impact from being a part of EM to be immeasurable.  The joy and beauty EM teams and volunteers bring to each shelter is amazing and helps to make all who stay in one of the transformed shelters feel loved and cherished.  
Enchanted Makeovers	140638	2	/users/profile/29173	snuggleyoga	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I found out about Enchanted Makeovers a few years ago when I was invited to be the dinner speaker at their event in Jersey City, NJ called The Journey-Discovering Our Inner Treasures. I was delighted when I arrived to see what magic founder and director Terry Grahl and a host of volunteers were creating for the women and children at the York Project Shelter. Not only were they transforming the building, but indeed, forever transforming lives. Even now as I think about it, it brings goosebumps. I remember clearly having the thought that the physical makeovers for the women (clothing, hair, nails and makeup) didn't make them any more beautiful than they already were inside. The love that was showered on them brought forth their inner beauty. They walked tall and proud.  Bless you Terry for all the good you do in the world. I will continue to write and speak about Enchanted Makeovers any chance I get. 
Enchanted Makeovers	140633	3	/users/profile/186834	swindsor	Client Served	5	11/16/2012	 In 2008, my daughter and I came to Grace Centers of Hope in search of a new life. I had been struggling with an addiction to prescription pills and was running away from an abusive marriage. At one of the darkest points in my life, God crossed my path with Terrys. Her servitude was symbolic to my own personal pursuit at that point in time. We watched a metamorphosis take place in our surroundings as we were simultaneously experiencing the freedom from our former lives. Her visions inspire optimism, comfort, encouragement and reassurance. It is truly an honor to now have the opportunity to give back to an organization that is dear to my heart and to work along side many amazing women that I deeply admire.
Enchanted Makeovers	140364	3	/users/profile/186537	R. Jean R.	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	It was an honor for me to create the Enchanted Makeovers "pillow" logo pin. I have also recommended EM to friends and colleagues to support and/or partner with. A wonderful organization.

I had the pleasure of meeting Terry in person and I could tell instantly that this is a heartfelt mission for her and a cause that I would be thrilled to donate to! Each transformation is done lovingly, down to the smallest detail.  Enchanted Makeovers is a caring organization that uplifts and brings joy and hope to those that need it the most. 
Enchanted Makeovers	140081	3	/users/profile/186244	Lynn42	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I watched an interview that featured Terri and spoke of her mission and felt drawn to help in any way I could...so many of us has just needed a little help sometimes and its my time to pay it forward.

Enchanted Makeovers	139627	3	/users/profile/185745	idesigngal	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	The work of Terry Grahl and Enchanted Makeovers doesnt just transform spaces it transforms hearts and souls. As a volunteer, I know, firsthand, how the makeovers turn ordinary shelter spaces into enchanting havens of hope and inspiration. But more profoundly, EMs makeovers and development programs also give women and children a sense of self-worth and love (some, for the first time ever). The message that she is me consistently resonates and although the road of lifes journey is wide and varied, it is still a single road we travel together. This is the cornerstone of EMs empowering work.
Enchanted Makeovers	139613	3	/users/profile/185732	Jennifer173	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Enchanted Makeovers is an extraordinary organization, that touched my heart from the moment I spoke with visionary and founder, Terry Grahl. I have worked with Enchanted Makeovers on several projects, programs, events, and makeovers, and with each volunteer effort, I always experience my own 'enchanted makeover'. That's what this organization is about - people, connecting with each other, humanity, uplifting the spirit, serving each other. Yes, we work with women and children living in shelters. But, this organization is not about being a 'superhero' to come and 'save' the 'needy' people - NO WAY!! On the contrary, it's about community, learning, sharing, connecting - together.  We see the common threads that connect us, we experience the power of love in every detail that goes in to each project, program, event, and makeover, we are touched by God's work, and return to our essence, our childlike state of wonder, and we are inspired to live to our full potential - each and every one of us involved, from the volunteers to the donors to the women and children to the staff to the directors to the EM Team. This organization is AMAZING!! 
Enchanted Makeovers	139564	3	/users/profile/185684	Sharmaine	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	When I heard of Terry's story, and how she was using her life to touch the other lives of women, I reached out to her.  We spoke at length about Enchanted Makeovers and how it came to be.  I was so inspired by the depth of her work, not merely transforming women's shelters, but their hearts and hopes, mending their broken pieces and inspiring a new vision for their futures.  And not just that, but the "enchantment" falls upon everyone who is involved.  It is Terry's strength of heart and her spirit that makes this mission have a heartbeat that is felt by all.  Lives are being changed, women are helping women and temporary setbacks in a woman's life become stepping stones to success.  She turns shelters into beautiful spaces where the heart and spirit can thrive and strength can be renewed. My efforts are toward helping Enchanted Makeover get their corporate headquarters from which to operate this wonderful labor of love to womankind.  Enchanted Makeovers speaks to the deep place within our heart ~ the place that says, there but by the grace of God, go I.  The motto is so true... She IS Me!
Enchanted Makeovers	139497	2	/users/profile/185617	Heather71	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Within minutes of meeting Terry and learning about Enchanted Makeovers, I knew that this was something I wanted to be a part of.  Each makeover goes much further than four plain walls and has a deep-rooted effect on everyone involved.  Enchanted Makeovers is truly transforming lives from the inside out.  Such an privilege to be a part of!
Enchanted Makeovers	139339	2	/users/profile/185451	chellymac39	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	I attended the " She Is Me "  in the summer of 2012, invited by my girlfriend who works at a family shelter, not knowing what to expect.. I  was very leary about going, when we walked though the door I immediately felt the love and compassion in the venue I was introduced to Terry as she stood by the door, I was greeted with a warm welcome, hello and hug. It was then I knew I was in the right place, and was glad about it.. As the program moved forward throughout the night I met and introduced myself to some amazingly strong, high spirited, self motivating women... I told myself " She is Me "  we are One!! I also realized if I wanted to move forward with my vision these would be some of the women I could reach out to, to gain insigt along with their experinces, strength & hope... The hope is is that they made them selves availble to me if I needed them.. I understood Terry's vision and why it's important to pay it forward and reach for the stars!  Thanks Terry & the EM team... Michelle Mac Arthur

She is a model for following her dreams which just happen to serve others. Donating to get charity was so simple and I feel so good knowing the Items will go to such deserving people. I hope to volunteer more with this organization. 
Enchanted Makeovers	139284	1	/users/profile/185388	Shelly002	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I've worked on 4 projects with Enchanted Makeovers, and am always touched by the encouragement, care, and love shown to all involved with the makeover or event.  Both volunteers and recipients bless each other.  One of my favorite projects was working with the women living in the shelter, and sharing  thoughts and ideas.  Their joy at being treated as worthy and cared about, was beautiful and contagious. The transformations are incredible.  No heart can remain untouched by the heartfelt emotions and tears at the reveals.    Its more than painting a room or two.  Its a visual parable of transformation.  Vision,  hard work,  and prayer create something beautiful, made with loving hands.  It allows women and children to  believe there can be beauty from ashes, in each of our lives.
Enchanted Makeovers	139116	2	/users/profile/184992	Britni W.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	For the past four years I have been blessed with the opportunity to become a part of Enchanted Makeovers as a team member and exclusive photographer of the organization. Terry Grahl and I experienced an immediate soul connection upon meeting in October of 2008 while discussing the topic of our belief in synchronicity, signs and miracles. As I listened to Terry express her passion, dedication and determination to improve the lives of women and children living in shelters, I knew in my heart that she was genuine and that her life purpose through Enchanted Makeovers would grow in ways greater than what she could have ever imagined. Since the creation of Enchanted Makeovers, Terry has been an instrument of hope, encouragement, inspiration and love to all of those around her. Whether you are a volunteer, a woman residing within a shelter, or a fellow team member of EM, you will be sure to experience Terry's passion for helping others recognize their own inner strength, beauty and unique ability to overcome all of life's obstacles. My life, along with the lives of so many women and children will be forever changed because of Terry and the leap of Faith that she had taken in order to create such an incredible organization. I am truly honored to stand by Terry's side, while capturing every beautiful moment of Enchanted Makeover's journey.

She embraces those who intimately need uplifting and empowerment through an intense and laser-like focus that is awe inspiring.  While others may find a challenge daunting, Terry accepts the challenge as an inner calling...her destiny...making a difference in lives everwhere.  Signed: Jolene
Enchanted Makeovers	138675	2	/users/profile/184753	Lisa184	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I first met Terry at a luncheon for women from a domestic abuse shelter in 2008. Terry's philosophy of "She is Me" is so powerful, I quickly realized that the makeovers that she provides  are so much more than fresh paint and new linens. The (shelter) women are taught that they are deserving of an abundant future and the transformation begins with Terry and the entire Enchanted Makeovers team.  I am thankful to know Terry and thrilled to see her journey and vision grow and help so many. 
Enchanted Makeovers	138556	2	/users/profile/184627	Janet53	Donor	5	11/13/2012	 I  heard about Terry of Enchanted Makeovers when I was part of a wonderful group called Make Mine Pink. I was amazed at how much she cared about helping others. We spoke on the phone and I discovered that Terry is a very lovely, caring and generous soul. She has worked so hard to transform shelters and bring smiles to those who need it.  I wanted to help in a small way, so I donated my Dolls of Hope. If there is anyone in the world that truly cares and wants to make a difference in someone's life, it's Terry.  She's an angel among us.
Enchanted Makeovers	138503	1	/users/profile/184570	Vanessa C.	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	I connected with Terry in 2010, inspiring me to create the Chica Bracelet which symbolizes the powerful action of banding women together in support of another.In 2010, her non profit inspired me to create the Chica Bracelet which symbolizes the powerful action of banding women together in support of another, empowering women to live better lives. EMs mission is to transform shelters for women and children into environments that inspire psychological and behavioral changes. A haven is created where women and children rebuilding their lives are reminded everyday they hold the ''golden ticket'' to transforming their dreams into reality. I was able to see myself in this message and am hoping that through the women well feature in this column you too will find the beauty in giving and how to can be an agent of change in someone elses life.
Enchanted Makeovers	138485	2	/users/profile/184554	Mary142	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	The non-profit Enchanted Makeovers and EM's founder Terry Grahl are in the business of changing lives.  I have been a volunteer at  events several and the resulting transformations are both inspirational & electrifying.  The surprise element when you first get involved with EM is the change it brings into your own life!  I have shared with many of my friends and family that I have never met a person with more focus and passion for a project than Terry.  With her self-sacrificing heart - EM maximizes every opportunity and really makes a difference in this world.  
Enchanted Makeovers	138454	2	/users/profile/184522	suitestylist	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I am an interior decorator and became aware of Enchanted Makeovers when I was searching for information on how to start an organization to decorate women's shelters. I reached out to Terry in hopes that she would be willing to share a few tidbits of information. I was absolutely awestruck and inspired by her generosity of spirit and deep commitment to her purpose. Shortly thereafter, I learned that she was doing a makeover event in my hometown. I volunteered, to help in any way that I could. Once again, I was awestruck. The event wasn't just a makeover of the facility, it was a transformation... of the environment and of the young womencosmetically, emotionally, physically and spiritually. There were events within the event that celebrated and affirmed the value of every person there, including all of the wonderful volunteers. It was love made manifest and it shined brightly on everyone's faces. The gift Enchanted Makeovers provided that day will last long after the young women move on into new phases of their lives because what it said to them was "you matter, you are worthy, you are worth it". Volunteering that weekend remains one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.
Enchanted Makeovers	138285	2	/users/profile/184340	Christy9	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	I am blessed and honored to walk along a path with the amazing men and women of Enchanted Makeovers.  Terry's vision of compassion, love, valuing, and truly seeing us as more alike than different, fills my heart with true joy and hope.  I have been involved with hundreds of non-profits in my 15 years as an advocate to end violence and I have never seen an organization have the heart that EM possesses and shares with everyone they encounter.  Words hardly express the level of change that is created in each of us as we transform space together and transform ourselves.  I am a new member to this team and I could not be more grateful to connect with this incredible group.  EnchantedMmakeover is revolutionary, brave, courageous, and is changing our world!!! It certainly has changed mine!!!!
Enchanted Makeovers	138187	2	/users/profile/184233	Raej698	Donor	5	11/13/2012	I have never had the opportunity to meet Terry Grahl in person but I have worked with her online.  I am a member of The Pink Slipper Project and our members provide handmade slippers for all of the makeovers done by EM.  Terry tackles every project from the smallest to the largest with the same level of professionalism and enthusiasm.  Her dedication is unparalled .  People like Terry Grahl are rare in our sociey today.  Her spirit is infectous.  There should be more people like her and Enchanted Makeovers to help women and children who are victims of domestic abuse.  
Enchanted Makeovers	137853	2	/users/profile/183870	Sarah92	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Working with Enchanted Makeovers has been a life changing experience.  EM not only transforms shelters into comforting, inspiring, havens, but she also improves the way in which volunteers/donors approach giving.  Terry is an incredibly compassionate, inspiring person.  I am honored to know her and to be a part of the Enchanted Makeovers mission.   My family and I, volunteered for the makeover at the AFG makeover in Detroit last year.  It was an amazing experience.  Even though the aesthetic makeover is only one part of the EM mission,  "reveal day" was something we will never forget.  Terry is an angel. 
Enchanted Makeovers	137833	2	/users/profile/183849	HannahVC	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I believe in life individuals paths are supposed to cross. You are meant to meet someone for a varity of reasons, to teach you lessons. How to love, how not to hate etc. When you meet Terry, there is so much to learn. Terry has taught me what real passion looks like, and to never judge someone because of their situation, everyone is alike in some aspect. Enchanted Makeovers is an amazing organization. I was lucky enought to help, and attend an event, along with some of the women from a past shelter Terry has helped. There wasn't a dry eye in the room. People believe in what Terry is doing, and how Enchanted Makeovers changes lives. The organization gives hope to those who have lost it. 
Enchanted Makeovers	137799	2	/users/profile/183803	Dixie N.	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	I was introduced to Enchanted Makeovers at a screening in Staten Island earlier this year. To say I was touched and humbled is an understatement. I later met Terry at the "She is Me" event back in July. Terry and Enchanted Makeovers are on a mission to change and uplift the lives of women by first enhancing their surroundings, and as a result, their physical and emotional outlook on life. The end result are women who are transformed, with renewed purpose, willingness to strive and a desire to achieve their goals. Terry understands that what the women and children of the shelter require are love, care and hope, and they provide loads through the rebuilding and refurbishing projects that the EM crew undertakes so brilliantly. I guess you can say Terry and Enchanted Makeovers have become the "wind beneath the women and children's wings." I am very excited and honored to now be a part of this awesome and inspiring organization that provides love and hope to women and children who are desperately in need.
Enchanted Makeovers	137751	2	/users/profile/183750	wnderwman	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I had the privilege of meeting Terry Grahl this year at the "She is Me" event, where I fully understood the true essence of what Enchanted Makeovers is. Terry is an amazing and inspiring person! Along with her dedicated volunteers, she has managed to transform shelters into cozy and comfortable spaces that benefit women and children in need of rebuilding their lives. The women and children are as blessed as I am to have crossed paths with Enchanted Makeover, an organization that has changed all of our lives.
Enchanted Makeovers	137743	2	/users/profile/183743	Laura93	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have known Terry for many years. From the moment I met her, I new I would be involved in some way in her projects. Here is a loving women who gives from her heart, thoughts and  prayers. To help someone else start a new story of their life. Terry believes everyone has a dream and she gives them a fresh start to begin that dream. If you were to meet Terry or read her web site you would understand where she gets her strength from, the beflef in God. The miricales that he can do with one person to help others. While I would be quilting in a garage waiting for my car to be fixed someone would ask me what I was doing? I don't know how many times I had told Terry's story and people want her web site, to check it out. They have talents and don't know what to do with them.Example paint, quilt,knit, crochet, the means to give a monitery donation. Terry's Nonprofit organization is where you can help. There are pictures and letters to follow. Everyone is special to Terry in all of her undertakings.  Love ya Terry, Keep up the great work.
Enchanted Makeovers	137736	2	/users/profile/183734	Lori48	Donor	5	11/12/2012	Enchanted Makeovers is doing something amazing, not just for the women and children who will be transforming their lives in the shelters, but for the shelter staff who are learning an entirely new approach to their mission and also the donors & volunteers who make the shelter transformations possible.  I'm happy to say that I have been able to take a small part in this wonderful work, and I look forward to every new opportunity that I am able to contribute to the Enchanted Makeovers mission.
Enchanted Makeovers	137707	1	/users/profile/183705	AndieBee	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have never met Terry in person, but I can honestly say she is one of the truest spirits on this planet! Not only is Terry a beacon of warmth and light in an often cruel, cold world, Enchanted Makeovers is an extension of that light to all who enter any sanctuary touched by EM. I am honored to have been a part of this amazing journey with Terry and EM, even though I was not able to follow through with my commitment for this year's project. The items I made were stolen from my car on the day I was going to send them off. Long story short, those items were used by a young couple who'd just been evicted from their home and had been living in their old beat up pickup truck. Had it not been for Terry, and my pledge to EM, I would have never crossed paths with those kids! EM's impact on every life it touches is nothing short of a miracle. 
Enchanted Makeovers	137673	1	/users/profile/183669	Denise S	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	With a smile I say 'I have known Terry all my life!"..... Terry is my first cousin! When we would travel to Detroit, from our country home in Wisconsin, I always found the big city AMAZING! Terry was always kind and gentle and shared all her toys with me! I think that she was put on this Earth to show others that we all have a 'gift' that we can share with others. She made me realize that I can give through my own talent. I recently gave through my love of crochet! Not only was I enjoying what I was making... I was able to give to her recent makeover, crochet lap-afghans. Thank you Terry for all that you do for others! You are not only an inspiration... but you are truely a blessing!
Enchanted Makeovers	137600	1	/users/profile/183591	Mary138	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have had the utmost pleasure working with Enchanted Makeovers since its inception.  I've been a part of its growing process and movement.  Such an amazing organization that touches the lives of everyone involved, from the Women and Children we serve to the Donors and the Volunteers.  No one but Terry has taken the time, love and energy to find out REALLY what is behind the doors of Shelters, who the residents REALLY are, what the programming REALLY is.  We've learned that the Women and Children who live in Shelters are really quite no different than ourselves or our own kids.  We've learned that Shelters can be quite depressing places and that is not acceptable.  The Women and Children who live there deserve better so that they can blossom and grow into their Hopes and Dreams and move forward feeling worthy of Life's Best offerings.
Enchanted Makeovers	137534	1	/users/profile/183523	Jessica95	Donor	5	11/12/2012	Terry and Enchanted Makeovers has amazing spirit and drive that is completely aimed at helping others. My friends and I have donated many times over the years and we would MOST definitely do it again!

The Moore's will always support Enchanted Makeovers.
Enchanted Makeovers	137484	1	/users/profile/183472	Ryan20	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I love this organization.  Terry's leadership and vision have helped provide hope and inspiration for many hurting woman and families.  I'm honored to have helped on a project with Enchanted Makeovers; I've seen these people work behind the scenes and they are passionate about their mission.
Enchanted Makeovers	137482	1	/users/profile/183469	Becky32	Client Served	5	11/12/2012	Terry and the Enchanted Makeovers crew came to Vista Maria with a mission to make the living spaces for our girls something wonderful and magical. They really did just that. They transformed a hum-drum residiential hall into a brilliant fairy forest; transformed boring rooms into special places of refuge for each of our girls and provided all sorts of amazing gifts like blankets, jewelry boxes and jewelry. It amazing how one person's drive to change the world can impact so many people. I know at Vista Maria Enchanted Makeovers not only made a HUGE difference in the lives of our girls, but also did so with staff, volunteers and every person who enters that building. Enchanted Makeovers is a true gift! 
Enchanted Makeovers	137445	1	/users/profile/183429	DesAnn C.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I first met Terry Grahl, founder of Enchanted Makeovers, at a professional Decorators conference in Chicago 2007. Terry shared a video she had created of the warm & wonderful makeover she had done at Grace Centers of Hope in Pontiac Michigan. From that moment right there, with "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" playing, I knew GOD wanted Terry in my life. I had always been a "believer" but Terry helped ME take my life to a more meaningful level by seeing that one person really could change the world. My journey with Enchanted Makeovers is far from finished as I hope to be involved for as long as they'll have me. I have had the great priviledge to work beside the most amazing people.  Witnessing the women in the shelters truly blossom and see their own power & greatness is inspiring. Honestly the truest nugget of gold from my experience with them is that "She is Me" is truly a life-changing state of mind, not just a slogan, that can and WILL change your life for the better.
Enchanted Makeovers	137442	2	/users/profile/183427	Annette Rochelle A.	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	 If not for the work of Enchanted Makeovers, I believe our world would be a sadder place.  People coming from a world of fear find a world of love when they encounter the support of those volunteering with Enchanted Makeovers.  They learn to trust again, believe in themselves and find their true identity allowing them to become all they were born to be and then some.  Given the chance, everyone can realize their worth which in turn makes this world a better place.  Enchanted Makeovers gives people the chance, the rest is up to them!
Enchanted Makeovers	137402	1	/users/profile/183381	vclifton	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I first was introduced to Terry back in 2008 when I was a resident of the womans program of Grace Centers of Hope.Because of alcoholism and being a victim of domestic violence I found myself in a place I never imagineda homeless shelter for woman and children!I witnessed first hand how a group of individuals can come in and change an environment and in so doing change the outlook in someones life. I am passionate about change; shining a light in the darkness; and an advocate of helping others overcome difficult situations. People need to see hope in transformation.To hear that this is only a temporary setback and that yes.There is hope for them too! 
Enchanted Makeovers	137388	1	/users/profile/183368	Peggy S. V.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Enchanted Makeovers does not just "makeover" shelters, it makes over lives!  From the big projects of transforming a shelter into a "home" to the little projects of making pillowcases and capes for kids, Enchanted Makeovers is shining light into so many lives.  Everyone involved realizes the importance of  giving something new and handmade to those that have lost everything or are starting over.  The Sewing Chapters are a new aspect of Enchanted Makeovers that give local communities a chance to bring joy to those in shelters in their areas.  I'm delighted and blessed to be part of this amazing organization!

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	309147	2	/users/profile/400504	janefurler	Client Served	5	10/09/2016	 I was invited to attend a Family Meeting in Indianapolis in July 2016 (I live in Northern Alberta Canada) so I could  share our story about our daughter, Danielle, who sadly passed away in 2013 after living for 36 1/2 yrs. with AHC. She was believed to have been the 3rd person in Canada diagnosed  in 1979 with this disorder and we clearly charted an unknown path with her. I came away from the meeting having shared our story and having learned so much about the tenacity of the parents and children who battle this disease. The Foundation is made up of an amazing group of people , including parents. They all give so much love and care to each and everyone they encounter. I was a stranger to them but felt like part of the family by the time I left. My one big regret is that Danielle never got to benefit from the incredible work that is being done to fight AHC. She was definitely there in spirit though  as I chose to speak on the anniversary of her 40th B-D and she lifted me up. I trust that my message  will give the parents the strength to keep going - there will be an answer some day & may God bless everyone who is looking for that answer.

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	303267	1	/users/profile/394428	Writer	Client Served	5	09/11/2016	Our daughter (22) was diagnosed with AHC six years ago. AHCF has been funding research for this rare disease for over 20 years. Their funding helped medical researchers identify a common gene mutation which led to more research on the brain, molecular models and drug compounds. This work, in helping AHC, may also help other brain diseases. Every two years AHCF organizes a family meeting which connects families from around the world and the medical community.  We are grateful to the board - a dedicated set of parents - who make it happen.

We have recently returned from the family meeting in the USA from New Zealand. How great it was to meet other people wth this condition and to see how hard the board members and parents work to educate and help us in all aspects of this disability.  There is a wealth of information they have brought together for everyone to share.

It is amazing that such a strong, committed group can do so much for such a rare disorder.
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	284721	1	/users/profile/374787	carolp	Board Member	5	04/05/2016	I have been on the board for over 15 years.   The board is made up of volunteers who have children with the disorder and work incredibly hard to increase awareness.  The support the organization provides to families is incredible with a family meeting in different places across the country, bringing doctors and families together for support.  There is only one part time employee who handles the administration and acts as medical liaison.  The rest of the money raised goes to research and family support.  A small organization with a very big heart!
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	272156	2	/users/profile/361142	Roosky	Volunteer	5	11/16/2015	Our family has been in contact and volunteered for the AHC Foundation or 3 years now.  They have been a huge support for our family and have answered any questions we may have regarding the health and well-being of our son.  Not only have the partnerships between families been strong, we are aware of where the funding is going and are updated about the research opportunities and strides made by the foundation and the partnerships working toward finding a cure.  The AHC Foundation is a great non-profit to help and the children desperately need a cure. We are thankful that AHCF has been working toward that goal and continue to update families on progress.
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	269963	10	/users/profile/358693	StephanieEgan317	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	AHC and the AHCF are very near and dear to my heart.  My younger sister, Kathleen, suffers from this rare neurological disorder that is characterized by unpredictable, often painful episodes that leave her temporarily paralyzed, either partially on one side or on both.  Our foundation, the AHCF, is a nonprofit organization supporting AHC patients and their families. The foundation supports research to identify the causes of AHC, develop effective treatment protocols, and ultimately find a cure. Through the education of healthcare professionals, we promote early and proper diagnosis of the disorder. I have been around since the foundation's inception in 1993 and let me tell you the AHCF is amazing.  Despite the miles between patients, researchers and physicians, (AHC is a rare disease), this foundation is the little engine that could.  I have seen this foundation develop with my own two eyes, from fundraising by families and years of limited research, to what is being done NOW and my goodness are they on their way!   Since the beginning, AHCF has always been about community and support  I remember my mom, current President of the AHCF, staying up to all hours of the night speaking to parents about their child  whether they be recently diagnosed or struggling with AHC. For years, AHCF produced a newsletter  typed and mailed (yes snail mail), full of updates, advice and information.  Why?  Because this foundation has always been about the AHC patients & families, providing as much information and support as humanly possible. Talking about overcoming obstacles, not only were these parents caring for their children with AHC, but they were doing it at a time with little resources and connections there were no search engines or email  the phone was their lifeline, all they had was each other.  Getting in contact with other parents, getting a diagnosis, finding a neurologist who was familiar with AHC... was no easy feat.   Now with the internet, things are so much easier  especially when it comes to awareness, so that patients can be diagnosed much quicker!  The power of things as simple as Google, email, having a website and social media, have made a huge impact on the AHCF. In 2010, AHCF participated and won the online voting contest Pepsi Refresh.  The win allowed AHCF to begin DNA sequencing.  The first gene mutation that causes AHC was discovered in 2012  The same gene mutation is also responsible for Rapid Onset Dystonia Parkinsonism (RDP)!  In the last five years, AHCF has been able to fund various research projects in the United States and abroad.  We are in our fourth year of research at Vanderbilt and Northwestern Universities.  Answers are coming!  We have an outstanding board of directors and medical advisory board that are the driving force behind the AHCF.   I cant stress it enough that there is such a sense of community and willpower within this foundation!  Patients, families, physicians and researchers travel across the country and sometimes world, in order to be diagnosed, meet other families, gain more knowledge of the disorder and collaborate.  Family meetings and medical symposiums are absolutely priceless when it comes to our foundation... the chance to hear from our researchers, the chance to meet other AHC patients, the chance to be together as a community  truly magical.   I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the amazing and inspiring AHC kids and adults and would love to find a treatment for this disease!  Fundraising for AHCF is worth every minute of my time because I know that 100% of the proceeds go directly to the foundation.  I was lucky to have played a major role in our recent fundraiser here in California  Wine Women and Shoes.  The amount of support in the form of sponsorships, donations, volunteers, etc. was astounding!!!  Everyone I came into contact with loved what we were doing and wanted to be part of it!  We have received countless feedback from our guests and donors inquiring when we will be doing this event again and how they would love to contribute again!   Supporting our nonprofit foundation is kind of like supporting the Mom & Pop store instead of the Giant Chain Store --- your funding goes right to the source: straight to research, education and awareness.  Donors are making an excellent decision when they choose to donate to AHCF  volunteers are making a wonderful decision when they volunteer their time and talents for AHCF  your money, your time, your support, WILL HELP THE AHCF GREATLY! You want to make a donation or volunteer for a Great Nonprofit?  Say hello to the amazing Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation!  Were rare, were small, but we're doing BIG things and with your help, we will find a cure for AHC!  
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	269455	3	/users/profile/358183	Writer	Client Served	5	10/29/2015	As a parent of a 23 yr old son with AHC, I fully understand the tremendous void this organization has filled, and continues to fill, in assisting families through emotional support, awareness of medical advances, ideas relating to solutions for day to day problems on such things as adaptive technologies, how to work with school systems on preparing a useful IEP, navigating the bureaucratic nightmare of medicaid, etc. They work to coordinate medical efforts to find a cure (or keep abreast of potential avenues of research) by working with multi-disciplinary doctors. Being such an extremely rare disorder that receives little attention from researchers, they provide some hope in organizing efforts that can hopefully provide some relief to the afflicted individuals and their families. I have been involved with this organization from its inception and know that they perform a vast array of services that may seem minor but are critical to maintain some degree of sanity and realism to the families. Sometimes just venting is needed, other times they will help hook up individuals with another family that is going through similar issues. With low cognitive skills and often extreme retardation, explaining what is happening to the AHC kid having, for example, a terrifying first experience with menstruation, can lead to feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and depression. The family conferences that I've attended are always uplifting. Sometimes just reassuring new parents that they can make it through has a profound effect on their outlook. When your average family doctor or pediatric neurologist knows less than the man on the moon about AHC, it is a great relief to get assistance on where to find more information about this disorder. Being able to call and get a cheerful, understanding, and non-judgemental person to help explain what the future may hold or what medicines have seemed to be helpful is a great relief. Before this organization arose, it was not unusual to go through doctor after doctor claiming it's epilepsy (as in the early years with my son) and having him doped up on phenobarbitol despite no evidence of epilepsy on any EEGs. We need all the help we can get. This disorder is unlikely to have a day, week, or month named after it to promote awareness;  Bono, any remaining Beatles, or Springsteen are not going to do a televised fundraiser for AHC. Living with it is a lonely ordeal that would be brutal without such an organization. I could go on but....by now I hope you get the point on how important this organization is to a group of kids who are marginalized just because they are few in number, and therefore unlikely to bring fame and fortune to researchers, drug companies, etc.
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	269014	3	/users/profile/357744	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2015	This wonderful organization makes a difference.  The focus is truly on the kids and their families and they emphasize results, including funding the exciting discovery of the gene that causes the disorder.  My niece and her family also rely on the support community to stay strong and manage incredibly difficult daily challenges.  AHCF impacts their lives every day.

It goes without saying that we love her completely, but what we didn't expect to feel was such admiration as we watch her cope with seizures and trouble getting her body to do what she wants.  She battles through and keeps on going, expecting to do what her older brother does, and not asking for any special treatment.  Her "can do" attitude comes directly from her parents who watch over her, love her, but allow her to explore the world around her and interact with  it, not just watch it.  All of us have benefited from the AHCF family and their untiring efforts to find a cure for AHC AND provide a network of information and caring people to support the kids and their families.

This foundation was very helpful in supporting us with useful information that helped both us and our Drs.

His episodes of paralysis are infrequent and totally unpredictable. He still walks but his balance is getting increasingly worse and he has very little stamina so uses a wheelchair for walks and outings. Communication is a major problem for him but he has come a long way. He is happy, has a great sense of humor. Please support this organization. We really need this research to help our children.

Very little was known about AHC then and the information available was difficult to find.  This prompted our daughter and other parents to form the Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation (AHCF).It has been an eye opener to observe what it takes to get a foundation up and running.  The continued passionate commitment and dedication of parents, families, friends, physicians, volunteers over these past 20 years is so very inspiring.  And the results have been monumental. Thank you AHCF.  Keep up the good work !!! 
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	169671	1	/users/profile/224861	SMG41	Client Served	5	09/13/2013	During infancy, our son displayed abnormal posturing, constant irregular eye movements, and hemiplegia that progressed into frequent attacks of full body paralysis lasting for days at a time.  As months passed, he was frequently misdiagnosed and received numerous tests that all came out normative.  It took over two years to get a definitive diagnosis for our son and by the time he was finally diagnosed, our parenting had been in question and we felt defeated.The day we heard he had AHC was bittersweet.  For once, we had a medical professional that believed us and knew what was going on with him.  At the same time, we were told that due to the rarity of the disease, only one treatment option was available and there would be no guarantee it would be effective at all.  The relief of identifying the problem was overshadowed by many more scary and unanswered questions.   It wasn't until we came in contact with the AHCF that the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness slowly started to fade.  We were able to have a support system of individuals who knew exactly what we were going through. Without them we wouldn't have had the opportunity for genetic testing that finally identified the mutation causing our son's disorder or known the treatment options available to our family. The volunteers and individuals that make this foundation are amazing.  They are proactive at increasing education and awareness, offer support, and truly care about all the children affected with the disease.

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	163023	4	/users/profile/216391	Teri15	Client Served	5	07/18/2013	My Granddaughter, Melody, was diagnosed with AHC at 18 months (Sep 2012).    She has had some issues with muscular contractions / stiffening / limp in her arms, legs, eyes, and mouth since birth, but nothing that anyone could document well or even diagnose.  One doctor told us that she had a lazy eye and not to worry about it.   At six months she had a full body episode (she had no head control, she was unable to move her arms and legs like she was supposed to and was having difficulty swallowing due to her tongue pushing food back out like a newborn) and this was a child that had been trying to crawl just the night before.  Her hospital stay was one week and EEG, MRI's etc. gave no answers.  She "snapped" out of it and she was sent home with anti-seizure medication.  On this medication she had more episodes and while they were not as drastic as the full body episode, she still would lose control of an arm or leg or both which was very frustrating for her as she was determined to be "normal".  We took her off the medication and while the episodes didn't quit they became less frequent and were minor. During this time we searched the internet for something that could point us in the right direction as the Doctors were as baffled as we were.  We found many things that didn't quite fit and the doctors ruled them all out. At twelve months she had another major episode like the one at six months.  Again, no answers despite massive testing. At this point I must say that her neurologist was WONDERFUL and continued to do research trying to figure out what was wrong with Melody.   When she had another major episode at 18 months, her neurologist again walked us through all the symptoms and asked numerous questions about her minor episodes as well.  It was then that she was able to diagnose Melody with AHC. It was wonderful to finally have a name and the beginnings of an understanding of this genetic condition, but the find out that there was no cure and not much research was disheartening.  Sometimes it's not so great to be a "One in a Million Kid". Further research brought us to the AHC Foundation where there was a wealth of information and better yet, we discovered other families who were going through what we were.  We weren't alone in this! Melody is now 27 months old and while she had another major episode a few weeks ago.  We are able to handle it so much better because we now know what we are dealing with. We have spread the word about AHC to all our friends and relatives and hope to continue educating people about this condition and help raise money for further research and perhaps someday, a cure! We would still be in the dark about this condition if it weren't for the AHC Foundation.  Keep up the great work!

They have funded critical research for this rare disorder, research that may not have otherwise been possible, and which has already led to a major advance in our understanding of the genetics of this condition.  I expect that they will fund future research providing the best chance for more effective treatments, or someday a cure, for AHC.

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	131333	4	/users/profile/176894	Kathryn11	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	This small foundation has been one of the most effective of its kind in bringing together families in the U.S and partnering with its sister organizations worldwide to promote research and improved clinical care for children and adults with alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). In December 2010, they won a Pepsi Refresh award, which provided the necessary funding to finally find the gene causing this disorder, after a dedicated effort spanning more than 15 yrs. This organization is one to watch. Big in heart, though small in overall dollars, they are a force to be reckoned with. 
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood Foundation Inc	131228	4	/users/profile/176786	Karen110	Client Served	5	10/30/2012	My child was diagnosed with this rare condition at age two.  We were told there is little to no information about AHC and no cure.  We were told our best bet was to contact this family organization, which we did.  They helped us on our long and ever-changing, ever confusing journey navigating this condition that effects all aspects of our child's day and our family's day.  Eleven yars later after many drs with  differing diagnoses, the research recently completed thanks to financial support from this group, gave us the first confirmation that this is in fact the condition effecting our child.  This group is truly helping our family.
Mission India	318591		/users/profile/409805	Writer	Donor	5	11/09/2016	Mission India is a well run organization. I feel they can be trusted to do exactly what they claim to do- teach others for Christ in the country of India. 
Mission India	317721		/users/profile/408856	Calvin10	Client Served	5	10/31/2016	One of the most dynamic, fiscally responsible and tangibly impactful ministries I've come across in years. From a highly committed, skilled staff to a healthy long-term vision from its board, Mission India is making a difference in India in unparalleled ways. Very impressive!
Mission India	317598		/users/profile/408740	AMJ123	Donor	5	10/31/2016	I have been a donor for several years and appreciate the dedication that the staff at Mission India has to share the good news of Jesus Christ to a nation that has so much hopelessness.  Mission India makes a difference in so many adult's and children's lives in India.  I appreciate the reports and stories that I receive every month on the eternal life-changing difference that Mission India makes.
Mission India	317555		/users/profile/408702	Megan142	Donor	5	10/31/2016	I am consistently impressed by MIssion India's unwavering purpose:  to support local Indian believers as they take the gospel to their own nation.  I watch the workers at the Grand Rapids office raise awareness of issues in India, treat donors as unique individuals and drop to their knees to pray whenever a need is brought up.  To work so tirelessly for the people of India, without those people ever knowing that a group of Westerners is fighting on their behalf---that is Kingdom work.  
Mission India	313031		/users/profile/404400	Writer	Donor	5	10/21/2016	I recently watched a movie about India's child brides becoming widows and becoming outcasts in their world. I was shocked and began to search for a way to make a difference. That is when I found Mission India. I am so glad that there main focus is the children. It breaks my heart to think of little kids living in dumps and the way they survive there. With Mission India I feel like I can be of some help to these kids.
Mission India	305508		/users/profile/396762	Writer	Donor	5	09/19/2016	My wife and I have been supporters of Mission India for over a decade.

Mission India	301882		/users/profile/392944	Writer	Donor	5	08/30/2016	My church, Immanuel Lutheran Church in Glenview, IL, is a steady contributor to Mission India.I learned about it from my Pastor Dave, who visits Christian mission in India once in the whileand speaks well about Mission India ministry. So I started contributing to Mission India individually as well. 
Mission India	301879		/users/profile/392940	powder77	Donor	5	08/30/2016	I sincerely believe that Mission India is doing the work of God in India.  
Mission India	295038		/users/profile/385841	Writer	Donor	5	07/10/2016	They have such a great heart for the people of India and are so effective at equipping believers in India to spread the Gospel. God is on the move with this group. They also really care about their donors and building a partnership. We have received thoughtful phone calls and even cards. It seems like the most value for our donor dollars and their bible camps cost so little to reach kids. My son loves knowing he's helping send kids to bible camp, it's relatable him.
Mission India	293570		/users/profile/384187	Writer	Donor	5	06/22/2016	We have donated to Mission India for the past several years. Their work of training pastors and church planting is why we continue to support this ministry.
Mission India	286038		/users/profile/376090	Writer	Donor	5	04/16/2016	Your God-lent money can do nothing better than to help non-Christian children and families learn about Jesus Christ.  Watch the Holy Spirit take over lives forever because you have provided resources.  God is working in amazing ways in India, and Mission India is being used by Him to redeem India and the world.
Mission India	284611		/users/profile/374670	Writer	Donor	5	04/04/2016	Love Mussion India and all it stands for. They do great things. 
Mission India	284437	1	/users/profile/374483	Writer	Donor	5	04/02/2016	Mission India is an organization that, in an age of computers and technology, not only uses that technology efficiently and creatively, but also connects with its donors through hand-written notes and personal phone calls.  Mission India goes above and beyond a form letter thank you.  When a person gives to Mission India, he knows his gift will be used for the purpose it was intended and not squandered on unnecessary frivolities.  Our family loves the fact that even one dollar can make a big impact when given to this mission organization.
Mission India	269688		/users/profile/358412	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2015	Love the information they provide to churches.  Love seeing all the new churches planted in India every year.  KEEP IT UP!!!!

Mission India	268842	1	/users/profile/357576	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	My husband and I love Mission India and the work they are doing. The stories they have about the work of the Lord are exciting and up-lifting. It is wonderful to be able to give large or small and know it is having an impact on people's lives.  For us as young donors, to know that even a dollar made a difference was encouraging. 
Mission India	268835	1	/users/profile/357570	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	My wife and I have been supporters of Mission India for many years!  We recently attended a banquet where the staff presented amazing statistics about the ministry in India.

Mission India	268827	1	/users/profile/357562	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	As a donor, I appreciated, when I drove by the building, it was a nondescript storefront in a strip mall. Nothing flashy. The money I give goes to the places I want it to.
Mission India	268628		/users/profile/357361	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2015	I love that Mission India empowers the people of India to reach their own people with the gospel.  It's such a great ministry!

Mission India	268619		/users/profile/357350	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	We have been donating to Mission India now for several years because they use the donated funds to funnel into the programs that will really help the people of India.  Instead of spending money to train people outside of the India culture and language they train the people who already know the language, obstacles, culture of the area...the people of India themselves!  What a great and good stewardship of donated funds.
Mission India	268524		/users/profile/357258	Caleb4	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2015	They are great stewards of resources and are literally reaching millions of Indian people.

Mission India	268378	1	/users/profile/357109	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	 If I had $1 million dollars, I would give it all to mission India. As it is, I give what I can. I have never seen an organization keep such good records financially and use every penny with such incredible results. I trust that they will continue to my gifts in a responsible and detailed manner. I get daily updates for what to pray for and how God is working in India. I highly recommend them.
Mission India	268376		/users/profile/357107	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	Love their women's literacy program!  I feel that my donation is being well spent.
Mission India	268340	1	/users/profile/357070	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	This is a solid organization with a record of continuous service for the people of India.  They understand the needs of the area, and are tireless in their efforts to reach and educate the people of India.
Mission India	268335	1	/users/profile/357065	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	It is remarkable how much impact Mission India has, given its small budget.  They accomplish this by equipping and supporting Indian nationals and giving them the freedom to do the work that needs to be done.  
Mission India	268333	1	/users/profile/357063	Linda386	Donor	5	10/28/2015	Mission India is really making a difference in this part of the world.  Their adult literacy programs are fantastic; they are enabling so many to rise out of poverty.
Mission India	268329	1	/users/profile/357060	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2015	I have the privilege of working with mission agencies, and non-profits,  from all over the globe. Mission India consistently goes above and beyond any other ministry I have worked with before. Their attention to detail, combined with intentionality, are just two things that make them stand out from the rest. Laura 
Mission India	268328		/users/profile/357059	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2015	An organization with great staff, complete integrity, and an exceptionally high degree of professionalism.

Mission India	268287	2	/users/profile/357017	Amy_250	Advisor	5	10/28/2015	Mission India is focused on ministry results.  They are firmly rooted in the Great Commission and bringing lives to Christ.  
Mission India	268285		/users/profile/357015	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	This organization is lean and delivers on their programs. They consistently measure outcomes, which is quite unique in these types of non-profits. 
Mission India	262680		/users/profile/351368	Writer	Donor	5	10/09/2015	Bill and I support a literacy class for Mission India.  Its so wonderful to get reports of "graduates" and see exactly what results our donations  incur and to see changed lives as a result.  Many times we have given to charities only to discover little of the donation gets to the people in need and much supports ridiculous salaries.  Mission India = changed lives and independence! We are never hounded but always informed of their activities. We have been pleased and blessed in our giving to this wonderful organization.

Mission India	226639	2	/users/profile/290371	Christyn	Donor	5	10/25/2014	Mission India has been a God send to our family. It has opened our hearts to experience Christ on a deeper level and taught our children to extend their love for God beyond their daily realm of influences.  With the bible clubs being offered at $1 a child it is a tangible way for everyone, no matter their income or age, to make a difference and share the love of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. The church planting opportunities are amazing and well organized. To be able to provide training to someone in another country so they can share Christ where he is not otherwise taught is priceless. The literacy classes are transforming entire communities and giving women an opportunity to know they are precious in the eyes of the Lord. We are blessed to be a part of such a wonderful mission, Mission India. 
Mission India	226630	1	/users/profile/290360	carolesegullatt	Donor	5	10/25/2014	My husband and I have been donors to Mission India for 15+ years. We supported it before it became Mission India. We have been impressed with the faithfulness of good stewardship that this organization has maintained. Our monthly donation goes directly to those serving in India and very little for administrative expenses. We receive monthly updates and Mission India makes us feel like every penny of our contribution is important for furthering God's Kingdom here on earth. We receive a telephone call from their main office every quarter. It is a person-to-person call and not an automated message. Mission India is the only organization that we contribute to which calls us and gives us a report. During the phone call, we are asked if we have prayer needs so those in the main office can pray for us. A wonderful touch and very appreciated! Mission India operates under the highest of ethical standards and every penny donated is easily accounted for in a written report,. We believe that they are one of the most successful mission organizations due to their accounting practices, commitment to the people they serve, and a genuine call to ministry. We contribute to many Evangelical Mission organizations and we believe that Mission India rates at the top of our list of organizations. We are blessed by them.
Mission India	225277	3	/users/profile/289049	MAPap	Donor	5	10/23/2014	Mission India makes excellent use the money we invest and gives a reliable account of all expenditures. Each story I read about people being touched by God's love helps me know we're touching the lives of real people and families and changing generations yet to come with the truth and the power of the Gospel. 
Mission India	225250	2	/users/profile/289020	topinabean	Donor	5	10/22/2014	We never think twice about donating to Mission India. Their programs are outstanding, helping to reach those who need help. Whether it's a literacy program, teaching women how to read and providing basic life skills, a kid's club or church planting ministry we can count on the gospel being presented and lives changed. We have used their material in our classes to teach our students about life in India - excellent work!

Mission India	220397	3	/users/profile/284044	JBooy	Donor	5	10/06/2014	I have had a heart for India since I was in college. I have two adopted boys from New Delhi. There are few ministries with the humble visionary leadership and the effectiveness of Mission India. They have a great respect for raising up and trusting local leadership in India. I simply do not know any ministry that is impacting more people. 
Mission India	220228	1	/users/profile/283875	joybringer	Donor	5	10/06/2014	We have confidently and joyfully supported Mission India for many  years because it cares for the physical and spiritual needs of people in ways that are sustainable and empowering to the recipients, many of whom are the poorest and most vulnerable -women and children in low caste society.  They don't just give hand-outs for immediate needs, but a hand-up as they build literacy and job training programs while they share the love of Jesus.  I also love the way MI volunteers call us regularly to encourage and pray for us.  We feel like a valued and cared for part of their team.  We are confident that the money we invest in MI is being used wisely and well.
Mission India	216986	1	/users/profile/280510	Missionboy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2014	Mission India is one of the best mission organization in existence. I have been involved in global missions for 15 years and have look at and been involved with many different mission agencies. I like what they do so much that I personally invest in this ministry.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking to give to world missions to look at Mission India.  This is a well run organization. 
Mission India	212804	1	/users/profile/275890	Gini123	Donor	5	08/30/2014	Mission India is a vibrant not-for-profit Christian organization which has grown exponentially over the years to deliver God's love, mercy, and saving faith to the people in India.  Mission India has a wonderful and compassionate ministry team that is prayer-focused allowing the team to reach those who don't speak the name of Jesus.  Primarily living out the Great Commission in the spirit of the Great Commandment through the Indian nationals, Mission India wisely employs their financial donations as good stewards of the God-given resources.  Thank you!  Virginia Campbell --Middleville Michigan
Mission India	183002	3	/users/profile/239902	pjatccohchurch	Donor	5	10/28/2013	Mission India is a Christian outreach that provides literacy training to women who are illiterate, in poverty, and have no way to improve their families lives.  They teach throughout small villages in India where there is no other hope for them.  The teachers are usually women who already went through the program and have had their own lives changed. They are dedicated, devoted, and really care about the other women and their families. Not only do they teach them how to read and write, which prevents them from being taken advantage of in the markets, but they teach them hygiene and how to save money and start their own micro businesses.  The women who participate are truly changed - in fact their entire communities are transformed!  I have been to India and sat in on two different sessions. One was in a small, dark, community room where 25 women were joyfully together learning.  The other was out in the village common area by a huge old tree.  Mission India also does Children's Bible clubs and church planter training, and does all three of these programs with incredible efficiency, commitment and compassion. Only native Indian people are allowed to work in these programs and they are incredibly well trained.  I believe that Mission India gives as big a bang for your non-profit dollar as you will find anywhere! 
Mission India	181507	1	/users/profile/238232	hanssellshomes	Donor	4	10/23/2013	I have donated to Mission India for over 30 years.They have proven to be a mission organization that is effective in spreading the gospel with a variety of innovative ways, while keeping overhead low.We have included Mission India in our estate planning.I heartily recommend this organization.
Mission India	177925	1	/users/profile/234522	orvvh	Donor	5	10/15/2013	I do not remember who spoke in our church several years ago,but it definitely touched my heart.We are so blessed in our lives and that makes helping others our Christian duty. We like giving to India and other organizations because we can do it privately. When I see the conditions that people in India have to endure,I want them to hear the good news of Jesus Christ and hopefully they will receive Jesus as their personal Savior.I do not remember how many years we have been giving to Mission India,I would guess 4 or 5 years.
Mission India	175952	1	/users/profile/94049	Mitch Smith	Donor	5	10/09/2013	I know of no other ministry touching so many children each year with personal interaction and teachings on Jesus. 
Mission India	84721	2	/users/profile/94049	Mitch Smith	Donor	5	04/03/2011	My wife and I were introduced to Mission India in 2011. We did not have a heart for India and were supporting missionaries overseas. However, when we read the 3rd party report on the results Mission India was having, as well as, what return you get for your investment in lives affected, we were sold. We have since shifted over 80% of our annual giving to Mission India due to their effective stewardship of resources for the kingdom. If any organization you are supporting does not offer a 3rd party report, I suggest you request one or look for those organizations willing to provide you with one. 
Mission India	175216	1	/users/profile/231550	rod2	Donor	5	10/08/2013	I'm a board member of a church related 501c3 that has been supporting Mission India for more than 10 years. If you're looking for a way to bring the Gospel message to those that haven't heard in the most efficient and effective way Mission India is the place to look. On a scale of one to ten Mission India is a 20.
Mission India	174473	1	/users/profile/230749	mrkvolkers	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2013	Over the last few years, I've had the privilege of doing contract work with Mission India in the areas of promotion and fund raising. We've done extensive work based on a handshake and it couldn't have been better. The leadership at Mission India are top-notch to work with and also people of their word. A handshake is enough with this organization. 
Mission India	173693	1	/users/profile/229840	john-elmore	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	There is more to any nonprofit than meets the eye. Annual reports offer overviews and statistics. Meetings and presentations provide a glimpse of the work being done, its value to humankind, and a vision for the future. But to really know the heart of an organization, you need to know the people involved. I have gotten to know some of the folks in the home office. This is not work to them, it is a calling. The brilliant things they do include involving indigenous leaders to reach the people they serve, communicating the Gospel through children's Bible clubs and adult literacy classes, and church-planting with ministry partners in India. They do all of this while developing new ways to inform their donors and the public at large via social media, email, videos and ground-breaking opportunities to catch the excitement of changed lives. Mission India (http://www.missionindia.org/) has roots extending back to 1970, and was organized at Bibles for India in 1980, then became Mission India in 1990. They are launching a new effort to assist parents and children in the West in learning more about their work and give them the opportunity to make a difference in lives in India -- it's their exciting "Lost in India" program  with a free "Adventure Kit" to make families better informed and invite them to join in. I believe that any donation given to Mission India will be used most carefully and wisely to further the kingdom of Christ and spread the Gospel in India. Don't hesitate to get involved with them.
Mission India	173682	1	/users/profile/229830	chadbbsdigital	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/04/2013	I've had the privilege of serving alongside ministry nonprofits for over 20 years. Mission India ranks in the top tier of ministry organizations in providing quantitative and qualitative reporting as it relates to ministry impact.  The team is laser-focused on its mission and remains committed to demonstrating the results to its donors.
Mission India	173415	1	/users/profile/229558	richard goodwill	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Mission India is a wonderful ministry of Jesus Christ to the people of India. They are committed to systematic and measurable accounting of a persons contributions to the ministry. They respond to donors with appreciation and continuing information about the outcomes of the ministry. 
Mission India	172740	1	/users/profile/228716	spinakker12	Donor	5	10/01/2013	We support Mission India because of the nature of the ministry, the integrity and honesty, we believe the gifts go where they are said to go, and the finances are used wisely.  Having spent over 40 years working with youth and families in our country we are blessed to support God's Word being taught to children and families in India.
Mission India	170202	1	/users/profile/225516	Mike Buwalda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2013	Mission India is special because they have succeeded in being efficient and effective at the same time. I've witnessed firsthand their commitment to controlling costs and making every dollar count. And at the same time, I've been impressed with their focus on results with an enduring passion to truly see people changed by Jesus Christ in India. On a personal note, I love how Mission India has engaged my family as well, with video tours of India, invitations to banquets, and engaging opportunities to give. 
Mission India	156694	2	/users/profile/207825	brightflash	Board Member	5	04/29/2013	Before I say anything, I should probably note that my wife and I have been raise-your-own support staff members of two evangelical mission agencies. We served on those agencies for the better part of 9 years.  I have served on the boards of two agencies (including Mission India) and as a kind of board consultant to a third agency. My wife is a member of the board of the third agency that I have served as a kind of consultant. It was about 10 years ago that my wife and I decided seriously to focus our charitable giving on "only" four or five specific organizations and to deliberately turn aside donation requests from others. That decision to focus has meant our giving has been very much more strategic; we have had very much more interaction with the various leaders of the different organizations to which we have given; and we have been able to have strategic input into these organizations far beyond mere financial donations. As noted above, we have now served (and are currently serving) on two of the organizations' boards of directors. . . .  Now for my "story" about Mission India. . . . Mission India was one of the four agencies to which my wife and I committed ourselves 10 years ago. Honestly, at the time, it was "only" one and, frankly, we were only just barely aware of what it was all about. Since that time, however, Mission India has become our favorite charitable group. We still give to all four organizations to which we originally committed ourselves, but when we have the opportunity to give a little more, we find ourselves always turning to Mission India.  Our reasons for feeling and thinking and acting as I have just outlined include the following:  * Mission India's ministry OBJECTIVE (church planting among all the people groups of India) in the world's spiritually neediest/least reached country. * Mission India's METHODOLOGIES (enabling--without creating dependency--indigenous ministries to run effective evangelistic/church-planting Children's Bible Clubs and Literacy programs; and training effective and self-sustaining Church Planters), and these programs' proven EFFECTIVENESS (see next item). . . . * Mission India has a proven (almost unbelievably strong) commitment to INTEGRITY IN MEASUREMENT of results, in tracking what its funding is used for and how its projects are being carried out. . . . What is particularly gratifying: these measurements are clearly NOT pursued primarily for self-promotion (though I think it would be foolish of the agency NOT to mention its statistics!), but, far more, it measures its outcomes in order to ENSURE EFFECTIVENESS and to PROVIDE GROUNDS FOR ONGOING IMPROVEMENT. I can attest to this commitment both as an outside DONOR and as a kind of "inside" BOARD MEMBER. I have seen this commitment worked out in practice. * Mission India seeks to FOLLOW ALL SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES and to walk with integrity as humble servants who are DEPENDENT WHOLLY ON GOD. At the same time, however, it CONDUCTS ITS AFFAIRS LIKE A WELL-RUN BUSINESS. The Mission India board of directors is composed of more than business owners only, but it is strongly guided by [one could almost say, dominated by] business people who ask the kinds of questions and demand the kinds of accountability that savvy business owners should ask and should demand. This leads to what is, in my mind, an astonishing balance . . . and a hard-headedness that I have found less visible in other charitable organizations with which I have been associated. * Mission India demonstrates a PRACTICAL COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. --My wife and I have seen this not only in their Children's Bible Clubs programs, but in their investment on vision-building and educational programs for children in the United States.  (My wife and I have had the privilege of helping to encourage all four of the agencies we support to create vision-building, educational fund-raising programs for children in the U.S. Mission India was the first agency to take us up on our offer to create such programs. They entered in enthusiastically, even though the potential payoff for such a commitment was unproven. Having done it once, they did it a second time. [See their www.mypassporttoindia.com program.] And we are working together on a third such program to be released in the fall of 2013. . . .) Clearly, Mission India has the LONG VIEW in mind. * Mission India has shown the highest commitment we have found (among any of the agencies we have ever worked with or given to) to COOPERATE with and HELP other agencies who are intent on advancing the Kingdom of God. Put another way: the agency keeps THE BIG PICTURE in mind.  I just mentioned the children's programs. Following Mission India's lead, and at our urging, all of the other agencies my wife and I support have attempted to create similar programs for their own purposes. We have encouraged these agencies, then, to contact Mission India to acquire whatever insight Mission India may be able to provide. My wife and I have seen Mission India readily, willingly, wholeheartedly and AT THEIR EXPENSE not only speak to these other agencies on the telephone and/or answer these other agencies' emails, but actually SEND STAFF MEMBERS to VISIT every one of these other agencies in order to provide them every kind of help, support, information and/or insight they might need to benefit from Mission India's experience.  I should note: this kind of cooperation often began without my wife's or my knowledge. It was certainly not a result of any arm-twisting or finagling on our part.  I am "just" really impressed with this organization and feel honored to be able to serve on its board.
Mission India	149818	3	/users/profile/199777	wireless10	Donor	5	02/22/2013	We first heard about Mission India (MI) when I was the Missions Chairman for our church.  What intrigued me from the first meeting was the unique approach that MI has to missions.  By focusing on teamwork with the Indian members and partners on the ground, the gospel is presented without it being in a Western voice or an invasive outside force.  I have many family members on the mission field today and others who have gone home to the Lord or are retired.  I have never even heard of any ministry that works as efficiently or as effectively as Mission India. When our family heard about the literacy training program and the childrens programs (how lives could be completely changed by the introduction to the Gospel for so little money), we were moved by how God was using humble means and humble, passionate believers to transform a nation for Christ.   Over the years I have met MI staff both from the US and from India.  This year I had the incredible opportunity to travel to India and meet with the Indian partners.  I have never seen a more passionate or committed team.  When you look at the sheer scale of population in India, it seems impossible to reach the nation.  I am 100% convinced that God has given MI a strategy for reaching the nation of India and that we will see India as a Christian nation.  I consider the MI team in the US and in India Champions of Gods Kingdom, on par with the Mighty Men that we read about in Scripture.  Just as in the days of the early church God, is raising up men and women who are sold out to Him.  He is using these ordinary men and women in extraordinary ways to advance His Kingdom. I am talking to other groups that we have been involved with to get them to study what Mission India is doing, applying the lessons of India to their own nation.  I introduce MI to every Christian businessman I know  I highly recommend that you support this incredible mission.  The harvest is plentiful, the laborers in the field are plentiful  laborers are needed who have a passion for Gods Kingdom to partner and supply the resources that are needed.  Not a penny will be wasted.  There are millions of children on waiting lists, thousands of pastors on wait lists for training, untold numbers awaiting new literacy projects  the fields are white for the harvest and we need all be about the business of bringing in Gods Harvest while it is still day.   May God Grant us passion for the gospel to be fit co-laborers supplying our resources for the laborers in the harvest fields in India that together we will see India come to Christ.
Mission India	124411	1	/users/profile/169256	dvandegriend	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	I have done Video and Photography work for Mission India and have gotten to see what they do and how they do it firsthand.  This is one of the best organizations working in India today and I'm proud to work with them.
Mission India	122476	2	/users/profile/166795	Rob Stadler	Donor	5	09/17/2012	I have donated to Mission India for the past 5 years, having appreciated their mission and ministry only from the literature I have seen.   In July 2012, I had an opportunity to visit India, so I asked if it would be possible to see their work in action.  They arranged for me to visit an adult literacy class in a remote village.  We arrived at dusk to a group of about 30 adults meeting outdoors.  I saw that the group greatly valued the literacy, math lessons, and simple trade skills that were offered by Mission India.  Several of the students shared their stories with me via a translator.  I felt quite privileged to have them share their touching stories with me. Some were sold into slavery as children, some were abandoned by their spouses and left to care for the children with no skills or source of income, some suffered from health issues that kept them from schooling.  All expressed great appreciation for the free education that Mission India was providing.  This education gave them back their dignity and allowed them to live independently.  But, the greatest value of this training was that they came to know their Lord and Savior in the process.  The students told me that knowing Jesus has provided them with hope, purpose, and a future.  The expressions on their faces told me much more than their words -  that they had found true joy through this program.   Mission India has found a very effective means of reaching the lost while teaching valuable skills.  I applaud their strategy and I praise God for the fruit that they produce!
Mission India	121462	1	/users/profile/165262	Margaret A.	Donor	5	08/27/2012	We are happy to support Mission India, knowing that the funds we contribute go a long way to help local Indian churches reach their neighbors through adult literacy classes, children's Bible classes, and even church planting.  
Mission India	120644	2	/users/profile/164094	Jacqueline R	Donor	5	08/14/2012	We started partnering with Mission India several years ago with the Rice Bag Project. At that time, my daughter was learning to read and we really connected with the life changes that are made possible for those in the Adult Literacy program both in terms of literacy and, most importantly, the opportunity to learn of Christ and accept Him as Savior. We have continued partnering with Mission India for both adult literacy and Children's Bible Clubs. My children have loved participating with Chris' adventures as he takes us to India for inside looks. We also love the fact that we are supporting the national people to do God's work in their own country. 
Mission India	13070	1	/users/profile/15075	Dutch	Volunteer	5	10/10/2009	I have seen first-hand the work that this organization does.  I have never seen an organization that has done more with the limited funds that they have.  Through there extensive volunteer network the limited funds are magnified and significant life change has been the result for many Indian people.  I would strongly encourage people to look at this organization for future contributions!
Charity Music, Inc.	275411	1	/users/profile/365034	Writer	Donor	1	01/03/2016	I heard about this organization from a news story and followed up on line.  I chose to donate a very expensive trumpet, personally delivering it.  When I got to their location, they took the instrument but said they did not  have a receipt book so they would mail a receipt to me.  I followed up several times over the last nine months, always being reassured they would send a tax receipt but I never got one.  I don't know how they run the donation end of their business, but I would NEVER give them anything again.  If they treat donors this poorly, I can only imagine how poorly they run the rest of their organization. 
Charity Music, Inc.	212896	2	/users/profile/275994	FormyDaughter	Client Served	5	08/31/2014	I was uncertain how I was going afford my daughter's band election this year.My children and I have had a difficult year transitioning through a divorce, losing their childhood home through a foreclosure, and stressing out in a doubled up living arrangement.I was guided by a friend to Charity Music. Through this organization my daughter now has an instrument to learn to love to play.  As a parent I want her to explore her creativity and not always have to denied due to the financial challenges I face. My hope is she will find how playing an instrument will lift her spirits and soothe her mind from daily stress.Charity Music is a tremendous blessing to the community!Thank you! 
Charity Music, Inc.	210735	2	/users/profile/273525	DanielsMom	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2014	In my role as a student assistance provider in an elementary school, I work with families who cannot afford the instruments their children need for school.  Three years ago, Charity Music provided an instrument for one of my students during the illness and death of one of his parents.   Playing his instrument was one of the few bright spots in this child's life during that extremely difficult time.  I just contacted Charity Music today, and they are going to help another young person I know whose family needs assistance in obtaining an instrument for her.  Music enhances the quality of our lives in so many ways!  Thank you, Charity Music, for all you do! 
Charity Music, Inc.	200933	1	/users/profile/262353	stellajstone	General Member of the Public	5	05/27/2014	As an art student in college, it's truly heartwarming to know that this organization is provides start up assistance to schools that do not currently have music programs. Every one that helps this organization grow is so passionate about it and the great opportunities they provide to the community. Definitely try to stop by at one of the local art fairs to check out the Instrument Petting Zoo; such a unique thing!
Charity Music, Inc.	200431		/users/profile/261639	Cmiller85	General Member of the Public	5	05/16/2014	Charity Music is wonderful Non-Profit organization. With many families these days tightening up on their budgets it's sad to say that sometimes the children's life's may be affected. Charity Music is great way for parents to allow their children to still seek out their passions when money might not be so available. It;s nice to see people in the community still seek to help out the people not just themselves. 
Charity Music, Inc.	200330		/users/profile/261489	Freespirit67	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2014	As more schools are omitting programs such as music and art it is wonderful to see a program like this to help the children with musical talents Not get discouraged. Those who have no funds are able to still advance in their talents with this. 
Charity Music, Inc.	200329		/users/profile/261488	nancydpatton	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2014	This program is Fantastic. As a Teacher it is Great to see that there is a program out there that can help the unfortunate who can not afford instruments and have musical talent. 
Charity Music, Inc.	199848		/users/profile/260887	emmaisfkncool	Volunteer	5	05/07/2014	This is a great charity that helps a lot of kids out who want to learn how to play music but can't because of insufficient funds.I think it's awesome that some kids want to learn music,and we need more places like this to keep music alive in children.It gives them something to do that's better than what some kids are doing now a days. :)
Charity Music, Inc.	199490		/users/profile/260438	s.dz.ew.t	Volunteer	5	05/02/2014	This charity is hands down amazing. Everyday we see kids wasting their talents because of financial issues. With charity music a child is able to seek its musical talents without being held back. When I was young I wanted to play the flute and unfortunately was not able to due to lack of funds, if a charity like this was around who knows maybe I would have went far with it. I'm beyond grateful to have been able to volunteer at such an awesome place, not only helping the organization but being able to benefit a child's life.

Charity Music, Inc.	198557		/users/profile/259299	Andrew65	Volunteer	5	04/22/2014	I relocated to Michigan from San Diego and I was looking for a non-profit organization that has a great purpose and is committed to their cause. Via the United Way website, I found Charity Music. Being a musician, I looked into the charity and I was truly impressed. What they do to promote music for the community, especially children and the military, is truly outstanding! Their 'Instrument Petting Zoo' is such a great idea to instill the desire to take up playing a musical instrument, especially for children, is awesome. Having two young children of my own, I can see the importance and value that this brings. I will be bringing my own children to the 'zoo' the next time it is featured at a local event. So many charities have ulterior motives. There is none with Charity Music. They are an outstanding organization. I look forward to working with them for a long time to come and I encourage others to volunteer their time, donate music and music related materials, and spread the word!

Charity Music, Inc.	162912		/users/profile/216253	storm	General Member of the Public	5	07/18/2013	Charity music is a spectacular organization.  It is definitely a hidden jewel in Macomb County.  This is a great way for children to expand their horizons.  It allows them to explore various avenues and challenge themselves without it being a hassle.  It enables the children to be themselves and have the opportunity to use different tools through music to find who they are.  Ultimately, its a great outlet for children and adolescents that is feasible and accessible to people who cannot afford the wonderful instruments any other way.

Charity Music, Inc.	162680		/users/profile/215909	Pat_30	General Member of the Public	5	07/15/2013	I am working with a group to start a children's museum in Detroit.  I called Charity Music and asked if their instrumental petting zoo could come to our first event.  Even though someone had already booked the same date as I wanted, Roger said he could do my event.  We problem solved and came up with solutions on how his group could do 2 events on the same day.  I also visited Roger at Charity Music.  He spent over an hour with me explaining Charity Music and some ways he could help the emerging children's museum succeed.  Roger gave me a tour of his non-profit and showed me how one day soon someone will be able to donate a musical instrument and later check back to see how many students played that instrument.  Paul gave me a tour of the music shop and showed me where instruments are repaired.  I left Charity Music being inspired and uplifted by who I met.  I am a fan of Charity Music.

This is the best by far giving back to our Military the joy of music and to keep music alive to all those who once helped us. Seeing the children at the (PETTING ZOO) explore all the different types of instruments and getting to keep there dreams in playing an instument regardless of financial curcumstances.Charity Music helps provide children with an instrument for 35.00 a YR  and so much more its great to see the kids have the oppurtunity to explore all that music has to offer.

They will accept instruments and give them to aspiring musicians or they will take cash donations to outreach the community with a petting zoo to give children an experience with different kinds of instruments.  They have keyboards, guitars, drums and wind instruments for the kids to play and experience.  I look to volunteer this weekend at the Stars and Stripes Festival at Freedom Hill.  Please come by and see us and ask us about Charity Music.  
Charity Music, Inc.	126214		/users/profile/171280	Ted C.	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	Charity Music Inc. has developed quite a niche in the community.  From the beginning the organization has focused on service members and at risk youth.  From the donations of instruments to develop programs for the VA hospitals Charity Music is conducting their mission ethically and compassionately.  The feedback from our clients provides our organization with assurance that what we are doing is good for our clients and our community.  I would like to nominate Charity Music for the Non-Profit of the Year for meeting the clients needs and making musical instruments as part of the rehabilitation program at VA hospitals.  
Charity Music, Inc.	161497		/users/profile/214200	Dani N.	Volunteer	5	06/26/2013	I first heard about Charity Music from a friend of mine and I wanted to get involved as soon as I heard about their cause.  Not only does Charity Music give the gift of music to children (regardless of their financial status), but also to the veterans who have served our great nation. The musical "petting zoo" is such a creative idea to allow children to have access to instruments that they may not have been able to otherwise. Introducing children to the benefits of music at an early age can have a positive impact on their future. The talent and creativity that goes into the projects that are donated to auctions and things of that nature are brilliant. I feel so blessed to be involved with an organization such as this one. Music has had such a positive impact on my life and now children of all ages can be given this gift. It is a privilege to donate my time to such a worthy cause. 
Charity Music, Inc.	161484		/users/profile/214184	Kim_80	Board Member	5	06/26/2013	Over the past two years I have had the pleasure of participating in the excellent work done by all the volunteers and staff at Charity Music.  It's been refreshing to be surrounded by such talented individuals who are driven to assist and support their communities throughout Michigan.  Raising public awareness of the obstacles facing homeless students who wish to learn an instrument or begin a career in music is just one of the many ways Charity Music has emerged as a leading non-profit organization.   Musical donations for our Military in V.A. Hospitals all across the U.S. is another unique way Charity Music has impressively supported our troops in ways no one else has.  The kind letters of thanks from so many families that arrive every day are proof of our continued need to keep up the good work.

I feel that they provide an alternative to kids who otherwise would not have one and would end up in very bad situations.  I love the work that they do and thats the major reason Ive been volunteering with them.  Music is important to me and its also important that kids have the ability to express themselves through music and Charity Music, Inc. gives them the chance and opportunity to do it.

Although our content empowers under severed communities and services Veterans, we have not been able to apply for grant funding as we are not a 501c3. We recently contacted Charity Music and met with the C.E.O. Roger. After looking over our materials and meeting with my partner and I Charity became our fiscal sponsor. With in just a few short months we have applied for local and national grants. Roger has been supportive, enthusiastic and has gone the extra mile. Under tight deadlines he provided us all the necessary paperwork from his organization, which without we would not have been able to submit.

Charity Music, Inc.	135094		/users/profile/180960	MJewell	Client Served	5	11/07/2012	For six years I have been coordinating a jazz concert/festival in honor of my late father, Chicago jazz legend Franz Jackson, in Southwestern Michigan (Dowagiac).  I had hit a plateau in terms of moving the event forward in growth because I have not yet become a non-profit organization and, therefore, couldn't solicit sponsorship funds for the event.  Enter Charity Music, Inc.   Our missions are in complete sync and Charity Music almost immediately granted my request to handle the fiscal oversight of the Franz Jackson Jazz Celebration.  With the help of Charity Music, I was able to secure several sponsors in a relatively short period of time for this year's event and that enabled me to offer more performances to our audience.  Roger has been nothing but attentive and excited about my efforts and working with me to further both of our visions.  I am so anxious to start working with Charity Music on the 2013 Jazz Celebration which I hope will not only bring world-class music to people of all ages in Southwestern Michigan at an affordable price, but will also offer exposure to the great work that Charity Music does independently.  I am honored and excited to have this collaboration with Charity Music and I look forward to many years of mutually beneficial partnership.

Roger Fachini has dedicated himself to the success of this organization and carrying out its mission and should be commended for his efforts.   This organization has helped expose the art of music and instrument playing to those who otherwise may have never had an opportunity to experience the joy an instrument can bring.  It has changed the lives of many people and I fully support this nonprofit charity and will continue to do so in the years to come. 
Charity Music, Inc.	129863		/users/profile/175295	Cochran41	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I have just started volunteering at Charity Music and needless to say I am throughly impressed. The staff is very professional and are extremely fast with responding to emails or answering phone calls or frequently asked questions. Charity music provides children with instruments that would otherwise not be able to afford them. With hundreds of events a year, this organization does all that they can to reach out to the public in order to have their voice heard. So if you or someone you know has an instrument or would like to get involved with a good cause I highly suggest Charity Music.
Charity Music, Inc.	126552		/users/profile/64805	Joanne I.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	Charity Music continues to touch lives with music. Many things are happening.  Let me name a few... Currently, the annual donation drive is occurring.  The more instruments donated, the more can go out to those in need.  Earlier this year, CM was awarded a grant from State Farm.  CM received enough votes to catapult it into the top 40 winners!  This grant was instrumental (ha!) in keeping many projects afloat.  It is an honor for CM to be invited to participate in the SE Michigan area Combined Federal Campaign.  The Campaign gives federal employees the opportunity to support their community by contributing to a  non-profit organization of their choice through payroll deductions. The Musical Instrument Petting Zoo gives children, as well as adults a hands-on experience of instruments.  The Instrument Loan Program provides instruments on loan for a fee of $35.00 per year.  I am a proud volunteer!  The lives that have been touched are many and continues to grow.
Charity Music, Inc.	103307		/users/profile/64805	Joanne I.

We have contacted VA Facilities across the country to support their music therapy programs by fulfilling  musical needs, such as instruments, sheet music, CDs and other related items.  Many facilities have conveyed their gratefullness for the items that they have received thus far. Charity Music is really making a difference for our veterans!!

Charity Music was there when we needed help in cultivating her musical talents. The industry wide Clarinet rental fee is $35.00 monthly. When Charity Music reviewed our situation, they provided the instrument at a cost of $35.00 for an entire year. Thanks Charity Music for all the good that you are doing.

In finding out about Charity Music, I am so very impressed with the dedication they have to helping underpriviliged children throughout this country.  To give a child, who otherwise would not have had the resources to do so, the opportunity to learn a musical instrument is a true commitment to our young people.

Charity Music, Inc.	61753		/users/profile/67464	smiley	Client Served	5	01/30/2011	Charity Music was there to help when my son decided he wanted to play an instrument.  They provided him with a trumpet to use for the school year at no cost whatsoever!  Their passion for helping people experience an opportunity when it may not otherwise be possible is evident.  As a result our son has been in band at school, has made new friends with a positive, similar interest (music) and this experience has boosted his confidence! Thank you Charity Music!!!!! It wouldn't have happened without you!  You guys ROCK!!!!!
Charity Music, Inc.	61631		/users/profile/67313	Ted Collins	Board Member	5	01/29/2011	Charity Music Inc. provides a great service to the community.  The service that Charity Music provides is a source for musical instruments to individuals who have the need.  I have witnessed many people to benefit from the donations and in turn those who received an instrument. If you need a musical instrument or would like to donate unused instruments, Charity Music is the place to use.  
Charity Music, Inc.	61210		/users/profile/66791	balan	Board Member	5	01/26/2011	I've been involved with Charity Music for the last 2 years, first as a volunteer participating in a variety of projects and events that sustain the goal of Charity Music's mission, " To provide musical instruments, and instructional tools to at risk and disadvantaged children".   There are many goals in life that can result in accomplishing things that matter.  Providing instruments to  our children who do not have the funds  to acquire them, presents a tremendous opportunity to our youth to set goals,  and inspire creativity, as well as the next generation of musicians.

Charity Music, Inc.	59675		/users/profile/64602	jpcoolit	Client Served	5	01/08/2011	Our Granddaughter is 10 years old and has cerebral palsey. She is able to get around pretty well at this point, but must wear braces and finds herself falling behind her classmates often. We are always looking for activities that she can be at an even keel with people that do not have to wear braces. She was just awarded a scholarship for a strings program. While we were thrilled with this news, our hearts also sunk because we would have to pay for the monthly instrument rental. I have been unemployed for two years and do not have anymore unemployment benefits. We are currently cutting back on everything. We did not want to make this part of our cutbacks. We contacted Charity Music for help. They reached out and provided us with an instrument for her to use. They opened up on a Saturday to allow us to pick up the instrument before her first lesson. We were greeted with kindness and excellent customer service. Thank you to the team at Charity Music!!
Charity Music, Inc.	59647		/users/profile/64547	shandorjazz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/07/2011	Charity music is an organization that I enjoy assisting on a regular basis. As public school programs begin to lose funding for arts programs, students can no longer be provided free instruments to participate. The thought, "If you can't afford to be in band, you can't be in band" is not acceptable on any level. Any child not allowed to be in a band program because they can't afford an instrument is unfair and detrimental to a child's self esteem; making a child feel like they do not belong. Charity Music can change the lives of these kids dramatically and give them a chance to participate and feel accepted. Charity Music has the potential to expand on a statewide level with the right assistance from the community.

Momsbloom Inc	286615		/users/profile/376685	Jennifer_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Because Every New Mom Deserves A Village:When my son was born in 2011, I struggled. Fortunately, I had a great village to help me adjust to being a new mom. Not all moms have their proverbial village to help raise a child.  MomsBloom is a non-profit organization that encourages new moms. It is a volunteer-driven group of women who raise awareness about PPD, offers in-house support to new moms, and helps new moms make connections in the community. MomsBloom advocates for healthy babies and families in West Michigan. I joined MomsBloom as a volunteer in 2012, to help provide a village to other new moms who were not as fortunate as I was. As MomsBloom grew, I utilized my background in communications and knowledge of social media to help MomsBloom grow its online presence: https://momsbloom.org/ In 2014, we launched our first #GivingTuesday campaign. We surpassed our modest goal of $1000 donations by 25%! It was so rewarding to contribute to the success of this great organization, which is why I continue to support MomsBloom as a Social Media Manager, organizing volunteer drives, creating online communities for new moms, and launching another #GivingTuesday campaign this year. I hope to double last year's donations using the social media tactics shared by #GivingTuesday and reaching out to our volunteers and the over 1000 families we have served in West Michigan!#MyGivingStory 
Momsbloom Inc	230509	2	/users/profile/294136	Max B.	Donor	5	10/30/2014	Since life is full of surprises we are not always prepared for them.  If MomsBloom could have been around in the 60s my wife and I would have been given the support we needed.  We would have been able to avoid some of our stress, and heartache, as our son struggled with colic, and as we struggled with feelings of inadequacy and fear. This struggle took place while I was stationed in Berlin, Germany with the United States Army.  Our son was born in the US Army hospital there.  He arrived screaming, which is not uncommon, but it persisted.  Doctors, at that time, did not know how to treat colic successfully so we endured until he outgrew it. Now that MomsBloom is successfully helping families through these difficult times I now realize that my wife and I were in the same situation, but all alone.  Their care and loving support would have made a significant difference in our ability to feel confident and able, and would have eliminated much of our stress. Thank you, MomsBloom, for your loving concern for families! Gramps
Momsbloom Inc	229620	1	/users/profile/293269	RenewYoga	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2014	MomsBloom is an organization that is needed! The lack of help for post-baby moms and moms in general is lacking. MomsBloom makes it possible for moms to get some help when needed and have safe support. I highly recommend this organization and am so happy MomsBloom does what they do to ensure better help for moms. 
Momsbloom Inc	229118	2	/users/profile/155557	katieatmomsbloom	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Our family designates its ongoing United Way donations to MomsBloom because we have met many moms who have received support from a MomsBloom volunteer who say that their volunteer had a life-changing impact on their lives at a time when they were feeling isolated and vulnerable. On the flip side, we have met many, many volunteers who gain a sense of meaning and community connection by offering their hands-on and emotional support to a family in need. This is an organization that creates a win-win for all involved, and these moms who feel more empowered and supported, go on to be parents who are able to raise their kids in a healthy, balanced way knowing that their community cares about their welfare.  Hundreds of families each year are served by a team of dedicated and trained volunteers, while the staff of the organization remains very small. I feel proud to live in a community that cares so deeply for its young families.
Momsbloom Inc	130834	1	/users/profile/155557	katieatmomsbloom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2012	MomsBloom is about families starting out strong. Our volunteers reach out to young families at a time when they need it most -the arrival of a newborn baby. Whether a family is living geographically far from extended family members, facing the challenges of post partum depression, raising multiple children while juggling jobs, managing a child with special health concerns, or recovering from the stresses of chilbirth, MomsBloom volunteers bring a set of loving hands and an open heart to supporting families during those critical weeks of adjustment when baby first arrives home. Week after week, we hear new moms talk about the difference their volunteer has made in their lives - often developing friendships that last beyond their three month period of volunteer support. And the benefits extend just as profoundly to those who volunteer. Caring mothers, grandmothers, and even college women experience the joy of offering both emotional and hands on help to a new mother and they get to share in witnessing a mother's gaining confidence and balance in her new parenting role. Strong families are the foundation of a strong community and MomsBloom helps build those strong families one volunteer at a time.
Momsbloom Inc	114315	1	/users/profile/155557	katieatmomsbloom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2012	MomsBloom begins with a simple premise: young families bringing home a newborn baby are often overwhelmed by fatigue, isolation and a sense of needing extra hands-on support. When extended family is not available to offer such support, MomsBloom matches families with volunteer Moms (and sometimes Dads) from the community who want to help families get a strong start with their new one. Volunteers are often mothers or grandmothers whose families are grown and gone and they have great experience and heart to offer to a new mom. The result is profound. Our new moms report an immediate sense of renewed optimism, confidence and energy with the help of their volunteer visitor who comes for a few hours each week to hold baby while mom gets a much needed nap, or help with light chores to ease the burden on mom, or simply offer an understanding ear while mom describes the transition she is experiencing. And volunteers feel they've made an important difference in the life of a family by helping them build a strong foundation for that family's future. Everybody wins.
Momsbloom Inc	227301	1	/users/profile/291030	Jeff89	Advisor	5	10/27/2014	I've seen MomsBloom grow from a simple idea to an organization that has served hundreds and hundreds of families. People don't always have family nearby to help after a baby is born - and even when they do, they're not always helpful in the way you need them to be. MomsBloom bridges that gap. As a new parent, the simple act of taking an uninterrupted nap or making a meal can take an outrageous effort. MomsBloom volunteers bring sanity back to new moms. Support MomsBloom so MomsBloom can support the community.
Momsbloom Inc	225519		/users/profile/289288	Valerie38	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	It's my honor to serve on the board of MomsBloom.  I got involved because of my previous postpartum depression, and MomsBloom offers such great support and learning for new moms.  It's especially hard if moms don't have family nearby to lean on, so MomsBloom becomes such an important resource when there is that lack of support.  They also have a wonderful program to encourage and walk with families who are dealing with the loss of a pregnancy or infant.  Having been through two pregnancy losses, I know how important it is to have that encouragement and understanding from someone who has been through the same thing.  MomsBloom really cares for moms and babies and the whole family and I'm proud to be a part of it!

I contacted MomsBloom before my son was born as part of my postpartum depression prevention/management plan.  They gathered enough information to pair me with the perfect volunteer.  She was kind, helpful, and understanding.  The birth of my son followed a previous pregnancy loss, and she helped me navigate through the huge range of emotions that followed.  She also helped me fold laundry, and played with my daughter.  She saved my sanity and helped keep me afloat.  I miss her every time I do laundry! :)

Momsbloom Inc	186427		/users/profile/243436	Its a win win	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2013	I'm so honored to participate as  Family Coordinator for MomsBloom because I work with courageous families reaching out for support and get to experience the life-changing role of our volunteers on a regular basis. In MomsBloom everybody wins. The families who reach out for support are able to feel the love and care from their community as they invite a volunteer to help them through the transitional period following a new baby's arrival. The support is offered at no cost to families and our programs service families in every socio-economic sector of West Michigan. Our volunteers also "win" because their skills at compassion, active listening, practical hands-on help and networking make an immediate difference in the lives of new moms. This caring partnership often lends itself to lifelong friendships beyond the MomsBloom window of support. And this program serves hundreds of local families each year with very minimal overhead cost. I think every community would benefit from adopting this new take on building extended family.
Momsbloom Inc	186073		/users/profile/174913	Katie '.	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	My involvement with MomsBloom began about 3.5 years ago.  As a Clinical Mental Health Therapist, I was grateful for this non-profit that was accessible to all families to support them during the newborn phase.  They have created a beautiful model for offering extended family-like support in our moderns times when families are not always so close together or able to support post-partum families as we did years ago.   Additionally, MomsBloom has been vital in raising awareness locally and nationally about Post-Partum Depression and other Perinatal Mood Disorders and Adjustment Disorders.  Cameron's Garden is also providing supportive volunteers to family that experience perinatal loss and infant loss.   I have volunteered with MomsBloom in the past and joined the board in January 2013.  It has been a great honor to be a part of the organization in this capacity and work to developing an alliance with BRAINS, where they will be taking residence.   The clients I provide therapy to have found their weekly to biweekly volunteers to be invaluable to remaining connected, probably one of the greatest gifts we can give any new parent - someone who they can connect to.  Isolation is one of the hardest things both new mothers and fathers can feel after having a new baby.  MomsBloom fills a gap that simply cannot be filled by any other resource in our community.  It's wisdom from the past, the idea that it takes a village, provided to all, but especially families that may not qualify for extra services from some of our other great community resources.  There are so many moms that don't feel like they deserve this extra special care....while its an extra special service in our community....Moms, you deserve it!  To be nurtured means you will increase your ability to nurture your baby with less stress and deeper compassion for yourself.  This gives your baby a beautiful transition into the world, and yourself a beautiful and transformational  transition into motherhood (even if it's your 5th time!) It is my sincere hope that for the greater good, MomsBloom's unique and passionate vision will continue to grow and reach more and more families.

I have had the honor of helping a new mother get back on her feet after nearly dying from the birth of her twins. I have also gotten to experience (from an outsider's viewpoint) the pleasure of watching a couple turn into a family before my eyes! What an inspiration. The twins have grown and changed so much, and knowing that I played a part in the health and well-being of this family is endlessly rewarding. Great experience all-around!

I also have volunteered for MomsBloom and helped found this organization.  This organization has so much heart!  The volunteers that we work with go above and beyond every day.   Recently I have witnessed volunteers providing a listening ear, accompanying a mother to a doctor's appointment, helping out after a baby's heart surgery and cancer diagnosis, assisting a mother during severe postpartum depression, helping a family get ready to move to a new country, assisting a mother struggling with breastfeeding, and encouraging a mother to listen and trust her heart and instinct.   I could go on and on!  This type of support connects us as a community and supports the foundation that holds us together.  I am proud to be a part of it.

Many of the women I have spoke with have dealt with it themselves and it gives me great hope that this period will end in my life or at least get better!  My volunteer has been great and I am also going to take a 8 week class offered by them.  They have even given great  support via phone when I was having difficult times.   They have referred me to counselors, given me resources and made me feed like I am not alone in how I feel.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I learned about this organization through my current role with the Down Syndrome Association of West Michigan.  With most of my family living 5 or more hours away from me, I only wish I had known about MomsBloom when my kids where babies!

Whether it involves holding the newborn so a Mom can take a nap, helping to entertain older children, or just offering some social interaction, these small actions can help lift up new parents.

The volunteer who came into my home once a week for six weeks allowed me time to take a shower, clean up a little and have some adult company. She also assisted me with breastfeeding. When I needed further breastfeeding support, MomsBloom sent another volunteer my way for a visit that gave me the confidence to keep going with it. I am expecting my second child very soon and MomsBloom will be helping me again. I am so thankful that this organization exists as my husband and I don't have friends or family around to help during this time and he works late hours.

I had twin girls born at the end of December 2011, and my wonderful volunteer started coming to my home 3 times a week for 2 hours in January.  It was amazing!  She would sit with my girls while I took a long, long shower (which I learned becomes a rare luxury once you have kids!).  She would also help feed them, and it gave me a chance to have one-on-one time with each twin.  She really helped me get through some long days during my maternity leave.  I recommend Momsbloom to all pregnant women I know, and I can't wait to volunteer myself when my kids are older!
Momsbloom Inc	114598	1	/users/profile/156144	Ellen S	Volunteer	5	06/11/2012	My empty nest and state of semi-retirement from a job that involved nurturing  future nurses, left me looking for a way to care for others and to meet my need to be involved with the next generation. I was lucky to become involved with Momsbloom. After a sensible and helpful training, I met my family. When I leave their home, after spending two hours holding and interacting with a most wonderful settled baby, I feel like I had a massage and yoga class. Also, I have the opportunity to talk to a new mother that is a joy to know. This experience has been just what I needed and I hope has given this new family a bit of a break and the pleasure of having another person to fall in love with their child.

Momsbloom Inc	99325		/users/profile/118953	Denise Cripps	Donor	5	10/14/2011	MomsBloom is *literally* saving lives.  Women (and men!) in the Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan area suffering from mild "Baby Blues" to full-blown postpartum depression could not be luckier than to have a resource as compassionate and educated as this non-profit organization.   MomsBloom supports Moms and Dads and loves them in all their mess and glory of parenthood.  If you've ever dreamed of living in Paleolithic times when your Aunties, Grandma, Mother, Mother-In-Law, little sisters, and nieces all supported you and your newborn, this is it for the modern family.  It's like a miraculous passport back in time to when people cared about new moms and their babies.

I was feeling overwhelmed and exhausted with my newborn son who was colicky.  Sara came and held him while I simply took a shower and a nap. I remember feeling incredibly grateful for a few moments of peace.

With the hard work of healing from birth and learning their new babies - many mothers feel overwhelmed with the other areas of life that sometimes get neglected during this transition. Moms Bloom steps in with well trained volunteers to lend a hand for these new mothers. They do everything from cook, clean, look after siblings, hold the babe so the mom can clean up or just sit and listen as the mom vocalizes her current experiences. What a great resource for connecting women in a time of such change that can many times be isolating. Especially in the lovel winer months here in our snowy state. I highly recommend MomsBloom to all of my clients and have had nothing but positive feedback regarding families experiences.

I am very thankful for the organized and respectful ways they have established their organization. One time, one of our volunteers called to check in with me for substitute volunteering, and she called at just the right moment. The kids were arguing, my baby was crying full tilt, the laundry was all around my ankles and my husband and I had just had a "discussion" over the phone. I just broke down crying. Without being asked, she was at my door and relieved me to go shower. What a blessing!!  Such great communication and caring for our family as well. I feel like they are very sensitive to me as a mother, not to step on my toes, but just to be there in any way I need help. It has been a life giving encouragement to me! I don't know what I would do without them right now as I am home long hours, while my husband works till late at night most nights now. The volunteers are warm and friendly, and always on time! I feel an amazing sense of community and maybe someday I will be able to return the favor and volunteer for them!

BINC stepped up when I thought there was no hope and helped me tremendously.

The owner of the store shared it with me when my husband began his treatment in August for Oropharyngeal Cancer.  He was not going to be getting a paycheck while he was/ is out and I was devastated and so concerned about how I would pay the bills. BINC Foundation has gone above and beyond anything I could ever have imagined assisting with medical bills and the house payment. We are not out of the woods yet, but I at least have the peace of mind knowing that the bills will get paid.  I would like to personally thank Kit for super efficiency and fast resolution of my application for scholarship.  I am deeply grateful and incredibly humbled.

This isn't easy to diagnose, I learned, and the process required many expensive tests and expensive visits with specialists, as well as a hospital stay and time off work. I paid what I could, but I don't know what I would have done without BINC to help with the remainder. They made the process of applying very easy, even in my exhausted and mentally foggy state, and paid my outstanding bills promptly. The person assisting me even sent me a book on living with chronic illness, and this small kindness meant so much to me. This organization is a true blessing for people in the book business and I can't thank them enough.

I haven't worked long enough as a full-time bookseller to earn paid time off. I was able to miss work and show up for my father without losing my apartment or getting behind on my utilities thanks to BINC. It was a huge relief for him to have me with him and my stepmother's family as he sorted through the inevitable details after a death. That time with my family was invaluable to all of us and I will forever be grateful to BINC for taking away the financial sting at such a difficult time. Pamela, the director, responded to my emails right away and was patient and helpful throughout the process. She was also extraordinarily kind, which is something that anyone who is grieving will know how appreciated that generosity is.

Book Industry Charitable Foundation	263633		/users/profile/352340	Writer	Client Served	5	10/13/2015	When I received notice from my employer, a small independent children's bookseller, I thought I would be able to manage financially with supplementary income from unemployment and food stamps. And then I got the news that my rent was increasing by $100 per month. I was managing--barely--to hold on, but was having to pay my rent in installments and accruing $125 late fees every month. At our regional trade show, I attended the general membership meeting and heard from a representative of Binc. I hadn't suffered any of the major catastrophes that I thought were a necessary qualification for a Binc grant, but the presentation at the membership meeting made me realize that maybe I didn't need a major catastrophe, just a series of small ones. Within a week of initially contacting Binc, I was informed that I wold be receiving a grant sufficient to get me caught up on my rent, which would allow me to also get caught up on utilities (and some of my lost sleep). They saved my life and my sanity at a time when I was feeling nothing but frustration bordering on despair. If you are an independent bookseller in need, I cannot recommend the services offered by Binc highly enough. Even if you don't think you would qualify for a grant, I encourage you to ask. You may be pleasantly surprised.

Even with my comprehensive health insurance plan, the procedure--not to mention the time off work for appointments, the surgery itself, and recovery--was cost-prohibitive.  Then came BINC.  Pam and Kit helped me every single step of the way, from guiding me through the application process to making phone calls on my behalf to negotiate with the hospital regarding bills.  They paid a significant chunk of my bills and then set up a feasible payment plan for me to finish paying off the hospital, where I'd incurred the largest and most crippling bill.  I honestly could not have said yes to this very important and pain-relieving surgery if it weren't for BINC's assistance. I thank them in my mind every day and am now finally publishing this story here on GreatNonprofits.org so that they get the recognition they so well deserve.

When hurricane sandy closed our bookstore for two weeks, they helped with rent and other bills I couldn't afford with missed wages, and in for the past two most recent years I have been a scholarship recipient and able to return to school on my own with very little debt! I feel so blessed to have a charitable organization working within the book industry, so dear to my heart. This is an industry full of passion but short on cash and BINC is serving a vital role.

From towering medical expenses to homelessness prevention, BINC is there to help. I also give credit to earlier boards and BINC's tiny but industrious staff, who took an organisation meant to serve the employees of one company (Borders) and expanded their mission to include all bricks and mortar bookstore employees. In just a few years they've managed to make themselves known, and provide amazing services, to a much wider swath of our industry. Yay BINC!

Book Industry Charitable Foundation	252073	1	/users/profile/340105	Lishism	Client Served	5	08/07/2015	We had a rough year including a lengthy hospital stay, a baby in NICU, and then the loss of my father in law. Because of his hospital stay and then wake, we obviously had to take time off work. I feel it was the best and really only choice, but it left us in a bind. We'd just only (finally) been catching up from my original hospital stay. We weren't sure how we were going to pay rent or some of our bills. It was an added stress in an otherwise already incredibly stressful time. I contacted BINC on a Thursday afternoon. I had my application in by Friday after discussing whether or not I fit the criteria. They were so fast, efficient and kind. BINC staff worked on my application over the weekend and they were cutting checks to my landlord and some of my bills by Tuesday. It was such a relief. Our landlords are kind, so I don't think they would have thrown us out, but our water was about to be shut off...the situation was fairly dire and I truly don't know what we would have done without BINC. I've been a bookseller for years and it was nice to find out BINC existed. (My boss gave me the pamphlet when I was first hospitalized.) I now tell every bookseller I know about BINC. I hope one day I'll be in a position to become a donor. Thanks, a thousand times, thank you, BINC!

I want to be able to walk into a bookstore and see books, take books off the shelves, read the first page, check out the story outline and decide whether to buy.  I ask the staff for recommendations.  I go to readings at various bookstores in San Francisco and the Bay Area.  I meet friends and discuss what we're reading.  But running a bookstore is not a high profit enterprise so I give a little to help in emergencies.  I wish I could give more because I get so much.  We need brick and mortar independent bookstores to help us discover new work, new writers, and get the latest of our favorites.

Book Industry Charitable Foundation	233207		/users/profile/268892	RADLV	Client Served	5	11/07/2014	There are those moments when reaching out for help can be very difficult. Recently, I found myself in just this position and was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel only because of the Book Industry Charitable Foundation (BINC) Matching Grant program.  When my 2000 Ford Escort ZX-2 died with no hope of resurrection (no zombie jokes), I found myself in a financial situation I've not experienced in quite some time. I needed to come up with a down-payment that would allow me to obtain a dependable vehicle that was safe and sturdy as my commute to work is 30-minutes each day, all highway.  After recently having a new roof installed on my home to the tune of $15,000 and other work done on my home, not to mention the prospect of another winter, I looked into my funds and saw that I was extremely shy of what I would need.  There was a feeling of hopelessness that I felt, unlike I have felt in a long, long, time. Harvey, the Clinton Book Shop owner and my partner of 13-years suggested BINC's matching grant program, trusting that our community would rally and step up. Step up they did. After only a little more than one week, we had collected the necessary $2,000 through an online "Go Fund Me" campaign with many of our friends even stopping by the shop to extend their support.  It was an amazing show of support, one that I am so grateful for.  I am so happy to say, this weekend I am going car shopping. No, not a brand-new car, not even the car of my dreams. I will have a car that is dependable and safe though. That is all I need.   I look forward to sending a photo of the car along with a huge thank you to the  Book Industry Charitable Foundation and to share it with the Clinton Book Shop friends who were there for us.  I am so very grateful to everyone for being there.  Thank you BINC for being there for me. Sincerely Rob Dougherty

Pride, shame, fear, all of these responses come to mind.  When I was left with no choice but to reach out to BINC to help me become current on my electric bill, I did so with a heavy heart.  The staff of BINC walked me through the process of requesting assistance and did so with compassion and professionalism.  I am grateful that BINC was there to help and have since made contributions to BINC and have directed others looking for a worthy cause to do the very same.

I work for an Independent bookstore in Colorado. My boss was aware of my financial struggles before and after my hysterectomy. She encouraged me to ask for help and provided a link to BINC. My fears kept me silent until I was in danger of succumbing to the darkness of a deep depression. As soon as I emailed Kit, her professional, efficient, and nonjudgmental leadership guided me throughout the process. Within a week, BINC paid the costs of my outstanding medical and doctor bills that my insurance did not cover. In addition, my overdue auto insurance bill. Words cannot express my gratitude sufficiently! I can now take action to pay it forward to others!  Books have been my lifeline, and BINC has helped me not to look away at the moment when I need to pay the most attention. With a grateful and joyous smile, thank you!!!!

As an independent bookseller hoping to go back to school to become a librarian, I knew that It was going to be tough. I have a family, a four-year old, plenty of student loan debt from my undergraduate degree. I was working three part-time jobs to get by day to day. The thought of grad school loans seemed overwhelming and a massive risk. I put myself through college as a first generation student, and with BINC's help, I'll be the first in my family to go to grad school too. I am passionate about literacy and motivated to provide inclusive products and services that empower people to use technology and information to build community and make their lives better. I think the BINC Foundation shares this same mission, and I hope to carry on the non-profit's spirit as i pursue a career in instructional technology in public and school libraries. They are creating real impacts beyond the booksellers' community, and I am grateful. --Christina Czuhajewski, University of Michigan School of Information, Master of Science in Information Candidate '16

Book Industry Charitable Foundation	204216	1	/users/profile/266239	Valerie45	Client Served	5	06/27/2014	The Book Industry Charitable Foundation has truly changed my life. About 5 years ago I applied for funds to help with an out-of-network surgery that I needed to treat a painful condition. They not only supplied the funds I asked for, but actually bumped up the amount citing the travel expenses and such that I had not factored in. Because of them, I am pain free and was able to return to a full quality of life that I wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. The people who evaluate the applications truly care and go above and beyond. On top of that, I am returning to school for a Master's Degree this fall, and I was a recipient of one of their scholarships, which will eliminate or vastly decrease my need for student loans. Since I am still paying off my loans from my previous schooling, this is an incredible gift.

Client Served	5	04/29/2014	Recently I began bi-weekly shots for my asthma which I will be required to take for at least a year. These medical expenses along with the necessary travel back and forth to the doctor's caused a financial hardship for me. The owner of the bookstore I work for suggested that I apply to BINC. I was hesitant because I know there are many other people who need help much more than I do and I felt awkward reaching out for assistance. Finally I completed the application and quickly received correspondence back from BINC. I was brought to tears when Pam replied that they would be able to help me catch up on some of the bills I had. I am eternally grateful to both Pam and Kit at the BINC foundation for all of their help, discretion and kindness that they showed to me. I would encourage any bookseller to reach out to BINC, don't be embarassed or shy...if they can help you, they will.
Book Industry Charitable Foundation	196559	1	/users/profile/256915	SandraBook2	General Member of the Public	5	03/27/2014	I work for an independent book store and heard about BINC from our Human Resources department. I was the primary caregiver for my elderly mother and when she required more care, I needed to take unpaid part- time family leave for about six months to care for her. Fortunately, my work allowed me to do this and was very understanding. However, it was a financial hardship. At the end of last year I was admitted to the hospital for a heart attack. Again, I missed a few additional days of work. The following month, my mother was admitted to the hospital where the doctor stated she didn't have long to live. Honoring her wishes, she returned home with the assistance of home hospice. Again, I needed to take the time off to care for her as she needed 24 hour care and home hospice does not offer 24 hour care. After my mother's passing I needed to take time not only to grieve, but plan her funeral and take care of paperwork and move her belongings from her apartment. This was a very stressful time with my mother's death and then having to take additional unpaid time off I was worried about paying my rent and bills. This is where BINC stepped in and helped me. The woman, Kit, who handled my case at BINC was extremely helpful, compassionate, and kind. She made the process of applying very easy and followed up continually in a timely manner. I was shocked and extremely happy to find out that BINC gave me a grant to pay for two and a half  months rent and several bills. She even referred me to another organization called the Karis Group to assist me with my hospital medical bills. I am currently in process of working with them now.  This has been a huge blessing for me as now it relieves some of the stress I was going through. I'm still stunned when I think of how much BINC has helped me. I didn't realize it would be so much. I am very grateful for this and will share this information with others in need. A HUGE thank you to BINC and Kit!

Unfortunately, my injury necessitated surgery. During my convalescence, I was unable to work for over a week. Additionally, a blizzard hit in our beautiful state of MN and a few days after my return to work, I was unable to leave my apartment due to the fact that I was on crutches. Though I work full-time, my bookselling position does not afford me sick days. Needless to say, my lack of income during that time was very distressing. I applied to BINC and within two days of receiving my application they informed me that they would be covering my lost wages. THIS WAS SO INCREDIBLE! The book industry is not the most lucrative place to work, but organizations like BINC make it possible for independent booksellers to thrive. This is SUCH a necessary organization-- anyone in the bookselling industry can tell you that! I cannot thank BINC enough for the extreme support they have given me. I am so grateful.

I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Living on an island and getting medical care is difficult.  Loss of my salary for over 4 months and traveling off island for medical care created a very difficult fiscal situation for me and my husband.  Dealing with BINC and with Pam proved to be a breath of fresh air.  They were extremely sensitive to our situation and it resulted in BINC paying a mortgage payment and a utility bill which will enable me to pay for my traveling costs to get the medical care I need.  BINC has rescued me from a very difficult situation and will allow me to get on with getting better.  What a wonderful organization filled with wonderful people.  I am so grateful. Mary

That resulted in a significant pay cut.  The circumstances were such that this pay cut came very quickly before we were really able to prepare or process how big it was.  We were robbing Peter to pay Paul and for some time were able to exist this way.  However, it hit a point where were not able to do it any longer and were looking at our utilities being cut off and not being able to make rent.  BINC helped us with both of those and provided much needed breathing space.  We can use the extra time to put some things in place so that we are not in this situation hopefully again.

At age 36, I had no disability insurance, and was new to my job, so I had limited vacation and sick days available.  I am the single mother of 4 kids, and am their sole provider.  As a former long-time Borders employee, I reached out to BINC for help.  They not only helped me cover basic costs to keep my family with a roof over their head and keep my heat on in Minnesota's biggest deep freeze in 20 years, they did it quickly and with a smile.  I worked with Kit, and she was an absolute lifesaver.  My family cannot thank BINC enough for their help, as we would be in a terrible position at this point without them.

Booksellers and bookshop owners usually aren't in it for the big bucks. They love what they do and don't reap monetary benefits. Because of that, they don't always have extra money for the unexpected. Thanks to BINC, there is someone to turn to when disasters strike, such as ill health or physical disasters. They also have a wonderful scholarship program that helps booksellers achieve their educational goals. They really care!

Book Industry Charitable Foundation	188972		/users/profile/246642	dalthoen	Volunteer	5	11/20/2013	I volunteer for and donate to Binc because I believe in the importance of bookstores and booksellers.  Bookstores have for centuries been one of the primary conduits of enlightenment to many communities.  And booksellers have played a primary role in creating interest in the important books of our age and in reading in general.  And today, when the problem is too much information, booksellers play just as important a role in helping us find the books we need -- both to understand the problems of the world today, and to take enjoyment by immersing ourselves in a world very different that our own. Binc is a fabulous organization dedicated to assisting the community of booksellers and bookstore owners.  The people behind it all believe in the mission of bookstores, and they understand that most dedicated booksellers choose to toil for wages that won't cover all their bills when times get rough.  Both compassionate as to the myriad of problems people can face, and savy in their distribution of funds, Binc has helped thousands of booksellers, both young and old.

I started working in bookselling 25 years ago and have always believed that smart and interesting people are attracted to work in books because they have a  passion for connect readers to the written word. But it just isn't the most lucrative industry to be honest. Binc is a critical link in ensuring that booksellers who may face financial difficulties, for a variety of reasons, have a safety net. I have been a donor and supporter of Binc since its inception in 1996 because I believe that we can all help each other in times of need - and we often don't know or can't anticipate when that will be. I know that Binc has changed lives - saved booksellers from financial disaster, or helped them achieve their career goals by attending college. Binc is one of the most critical ways that we can ensure that great people can remain in bookselling. Binc needs help from everyone who is committed to ensuring a stable and healthy book industry. Small gifts add up, so please donate - your time, your expertise, and yes, your money. Because book people need to care for one another - we have to focus on the future of bookselling, and those who connect books and readers. Please give and please share the word about Binc - awareness is everything. Binc Board Member and long-time supporter

We provide excellent medical and dental care to members of the community who have no insurance or can't pay the high deductibles for the insurance they do have.  The majority of volunteers are from the University of Michigan or St. Joseph Mercy Hospital so the care provided is current and state-of-the-art, limited only by the patient's financial situation which means that we can't obtain the tests normally done on a patient with insurance nor prescribe new medications with outrageously high prices.  However, we are very creative and manage patients well, which includes using the phone app Goodrx to make sure our patients fill their prescriptions at their local pharmacies with the cheapest prices, referring patients for free Pap smears/mammograms/colonoscopies, and using the extremely limited insurance sometimes provided by St. Joseph Mercy Hospital the best way we can.  Patients are always treated with dignity and respect regardless of their nation of origin and religion.  I really appreciate the opportunity to provide free medical care to the people who need it most because I feel that I am doing God's work and caring for my fellow man as He has directed.  Our new clinic has eight medical exam rooms and hundreds of volunteers so we can provide care to thousands of people in need.

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	315587	1	/users/profile/406901	lalaf_12	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I currently volunteer at Hope Ypsilanti and I cannot find enough words to stress the importance of this location to the Michigan community. Whether it is proving food or free medication the staff at Hope strives in giving their best to every patient that walks through our doors.  
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	315283	1	/users/profile/406609	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I volunteer as an RN at Hope, and I am very impressed with the clinic.  It is amazingly well-run, especially considering that it is staffed almost completely by volunteers.  The clinic is organized, clean, friendly, and professional.    
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	315280	1	/users/profile/406606	michelehasel	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I am a board-certified nurse practitioner and I have volunteered in the pharmacy for 3.5 years. I'm always amazed by the generosity of Hope Clinic with their free medications, and the breadth and depth of clients that Hope clinic reaches.  The clinicians are extremely knowledgeable about client conditions, and they write prescriptions that reflect the most inexpensive option to meet their medical needs. The clients' psycho/social/and spiritual needs are also met by wonderful volunteers who serve in the social work and mental health areas. Each client encounter by volunteers reflects Hope Clinic's holistic values of treating the whole person.

Hope is there for anyone facing challenging times. No one is turned away. There is genuine love that is demonstrated to each person that walks through Hope's doors. Hope Clinic is not only changing lives. Hope is saving lives by offering the services it provides whether it is medical or dental services, the food pantry, the weekly food distribution, the produce station or weekend meals. Hope does it all while ministering to the whole person with dignity and respect. Hope is awesome!! 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	314471	2	/users/profile/405826	Writer	Board Member	5	10/25/2016	I have been a supporter of Hope Medical Clinic for almost 30 years and it has consistently delivered great medical, dental and other services to those in need while being a truly ecumenical work.    Unlike many non profits I support, the money donated in effect multiplies many times over because of the thousands of volunteer hours given by health care professionals and others to assist those who are being underserved in terms of their medical and dental needs.  After a break of many years, I have returned to the Board of Hope and continue to be impressed by all those involved.Deacon Dan Foley  Christ the King Catholic Church

This facility is an A+  They are really care about their patients and the community!

I am in awe at the compassion and respect the dental team there display toward all of their patients. Each patient receives undivided attention and are not simply pushed through. There is genuine care and concern for all individuals and it's this compassion toward others that drives me to want to be in the dental field and do the same.

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	264887		/users/profile/353616	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/18/2015	When I fell ill I turned to hope for a place of being. I wasn't sure if I would need the medical clinic or the dental clinic which are a great resources for the community but I needed a place to give me hope and a sense of contributing. I was diagnosed with severe copd after graduating with my Bachelor or Science and needed some place to offer my talents and give me sense of being needed. I've been at Hope now a year and work on serving the community every Friday in the food pantry, worked on the annual event committee and also offer my computer skills. It gives me a purpose and it's a great feeling to be needed and appreciated.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	264796		/users/profile/353524	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/17/2015	Hope Clinic helps to fulfill great needs in the area.  The city of Ypsilanti has a negative reputation, but places like Hope make it a place that holds my heart. The atmosphere of the building is bright, clean, and inviting,  staff and volunteers are welcoming and pleasant. It's a wonderful place to spend my time helping those in need! 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	261887		/users/profile/350530	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/06/2015	   I retired and needed something to occupy my time.  I had volunteered for Hope a few times before like with parking cars or community events.  But I talked to the Volunteer Coordinator and she set me up with the perfect job for me.  I love people, so I am at the front desk as a receptionist two days a week, all day.  The people I work with are pleasant and what  impresses me the most is how much compassion the people who actually work here, have for the clients. They are always willing to give and give!!!  People who volunteer feel it is the best day of the week!! I am so glad I have the chance to minister to others!!!  
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	261706		/users/profile/350330	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/05/2015	As a volunteer at Hope I have been privileged with a 'behind the scenes' look at how this wonderful organization serves those less fortunate in the Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor and beyond.  Clients are cared for with compassion and dignity as many services are made available to individuals and families.  The Hope staff, its many volunteers and donors link hands and heart to come alongside those in need.  Medical and dental care, food and laundry privileges are just a few of the services Hope provides. Clients leave Hope encouraged and "Hope-ful"!

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	231458		/users/profile/295048	ymbarefield	Client Served	5	10/31/2014	I heard about Hope when I first moved to the Washtenaw county area.

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	231356	1	/users/profile/294949	Inome	Donor	5	10/31/2014	I am a donor and volunteer.  Hope Clinic exemplifies true Christian love in the services that they provide to the community.  From what I have observed, all clients regardless of religion, race, appearance or circumstances are served in a loving and dignified manner.  I think a testament to Hopes work in the community,  is the fact that many of the volunteers are current or past clients who have been helped by Hope and now want to give back.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	231349		/users/profile/294943	Jeanmariel	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been associated with Hope since 1993.  I started out as a volunteer R.N. and later  went on staff. I retired at age 70 and went back on as a volunteer ever since.  I have been a witness  all these years to the greatness Hope has done for the community and  all the surrounding areas  I have always been happy to be a part of Hope..

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	231333		/users/profile/294929	flowerpower	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Hope Clinic has been a great place to serve the Ypsilanti community. Beyond my own joy to work with the community and being part of an organization that offers such amazing services like free laundry washing, a food pantry, free produce and free medical and dental services, it is incredible to see how many clients appreciate the work that Hope does and love to use this space to swing by and say hello. When clients feel inclined to make an effort to stop by and say hello, it is evident that Hope Clinic is doing something right! 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	231328		/users/profile/294926	hcheriya	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I started volunteering at Hope about a year ago, and it's been an amazing experience. Hope's patients come from all walks of life, and it is truly a privilege to be able to talk with them and hear their perspectives. It's a joy to participate in the work Hope is doing to serve the community!
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	221917		/users/profile/285617	Dababsmom	Volunteer	5	10/11/2014	As  a weekly volunteer in the Medical Clinic, I receive so much more than I can ever give back.  The clients we serve demonstrate courage, tolerance, and faith in ways I cannot begin to describe.   Hope provides a place where respect, dignity, and acceptance are the first and most important services offered.  I consider myself lucky to be a part of this organization and its mission, and am proud to say I volunteer at Hope.    
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	220428		/users/profile/284078	mnicole	Volunteer	5	10/06/2014	I love volunteering with Hope Clinic!!

Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	219616		/users/profile/283238	Andy31	Board Member	5	10/03/2014	I have been blessed in my retirement to have become active with and serve Hope.  My day job at Hope is a volunteer handyman, and my night job is a Board member.  I have known of Hope's mission of providing free medical and dental services to the uninsured poor because Hope was founded by our family doctor over 25 years ago.  Everyone that visits Hope can feel and see God's caring for his children first hand.  As a servant at Hope, I know it is true that "it is more blessed to give than to receive".
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	171778	1	/users/profile/227429	ehenrick	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I have been an active volunteer at Hope Clinic for 4 years now. I've served in a variety of capacities, and am currently a volunteer member of the young Leadership Committee.  I serve at Hope because I believe in their mission, and wholeheartedly believe that the work that they do is commendable. I've seen peoples lives transformed - big and small - by the service they've received from Hope.  The staff ad Hope are truly a blessing; they're compassionate and sincere, and it's obvious that they love the work that they do. They often put in time above and beyond their required workdays, simple because they value the population that they serve.  Hope is also efficient in the way that they handle donations; there's almost no waste, and they manage to stretch a dollar in remarkable ways.  I've never seen this level of commitment to serving the community, as I've seen at Hope.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	170730		/users/profile/206470	afoley57	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	One of the greatest events in my life is being able to see up close the generosity given to the local community through Hope clinic. So honored to be able to volunteer and play a small role in meeting the immediate needs of those, who by a mere chance in life, find themselves in  need.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155553		/users/profile/206470	afoley57	Volunteer	5	04/21/2013	Great to experience unselfish love to those who find themselves at a disadvantage in life for a sort time or long term. Whether for basic necessities such as food or toiletries or even dental or medical attention Hope Clinic stands ready to meet needs.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	158126		/users/profile/209744	Dan54	Donor	5	05/17/2013	Hope Medical Clinic takes 1 dollar and multiplies it to provide more than $5 of services. There is no "skimming off the top" to pay for overhead. It is a charity based on volunteers and does incredible work, as it has for more than 30 years. There is no better charity in which to invest your money. Tens of thousands have been served by Hope and the need is great.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	158089	2	/users/profile/209676	TheScotts	Volunteer	5	05/16/2013	Our family has been volunteering together at Hope Clinic for many years now, and it is such a blessing to be able to have a place where we can serve together as a family.  We are thankful that Hope has given us the opportunity to live out our faith and to be the hands and feet of Jesus in a tangible way.  As we pray and shop with people in the Food Pantry, our hearts are more closely realigned with God's heart and we are humbly reminded that each one of us need Jesus to meet our daily needs.  There is such a sense of community and togetherness at Hope and it is exciting to be a part of an organization that is making a huge impact within our community.  Whether you come to Hope to give or receive, you always leave feeling more blessed than when you came.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	156920		/users/profile/208118	Mephyton	Volunteer	5	05/02/2013	I have volunteered at the Hope Center for over a decade. In that time I have seen them work tirelessly broadening their range of services. For as long as I have known her, Kathy Robinson has taken her job helping  those in need very personally. 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	156151	1	/users/profile/207185	DJTSR	Volunteer	5	04/25/2013	I first volunteered at Hope as an usher when the clinic first opened in the early 80's.Then later when they started serving meals we would come as a family and servethe meal with another family. After a brief pause in our meal serving when life was too busy we resumed our serving of the meal on Saturday. As our family grew older it has evolved to just me coming and working with other groups in serving the meal. I have to share a story. About 2 years ago, I believe it was in October I was serving the meal with at very dedicated Girl Scout troop. We were serving at the Salvation Armybuilding. Before the meal guests were lined up around the room. It was  a BIG crowd.Before I offered the prayer I said something to the people that we needed to pray for amultiplication of the food. I then prayed specifically for that. We had had some experiences of running out of food in the past. We did run out on this particular day but that was after the Girl Scouts had served the last of the chicken to the people at their tables. The had as much as they desired and more! I believe we witnessed a multiplication of the chicken that day!Our God is an Awesome God!!   
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	156143	1	/users/profile/207177	Passionate	Volunteer	5	04/25/2013	I have been a volunteer at Hope Clinic for over 2 years now.  Hope has been a wonderful experience for me.  I came to hope after a dear friend invited me to attend the open house of the new building.  After touring and seeing all that Hope has to offer to those in the community.   I new I had to be a part of what they were doing.  I called and was placed as a volunteer on a awesome team cooking and preparing meals.   I thank God for the opportunity to share His love, grace and compassion to others. 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155267	1	/users/profile/206151	cellomsw	Volunteer	5	04/18/2013	Hope Clinic has been a fabulous experience for me as a volunteer. I work in the food bank and have been impressed over and over with the compassion, grace and love extended to all who come. There never is the feeling of judgement towards those in need, only a desire to do whatever can be done to extend grace and support. The staff makes it clear that there is not  "them and us", just "us". As a social worker by profession,  I have experienced lip service and occasional acts  expressing  commitment to the "value of the individual", but have never seen it lived out consistently in the ways I have seen it at Hope Clinic. When food shopping ends with a hug and "thank you for coming in", there's something extraordinary going on! 
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155219	1	/users/profile/206096	jenni3839	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	Hope clinic welcomes volunteers of all ages and abilities.  Hope is about COMPASSIONATELY serving those in need - medical services, dental services, food services (including a food pantry and weekend meals) & infant needs.  Everything is given FREELY to anyone who asks for help.  Walking in the doors of Hope is like coming home, for clients, employees, and volunteers.   In fact, many of their former clients come back as volunteers!  The warmth, compassion, generosity, welcoming, and unconditional love and support abound at Hope.   
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155189	1	/users/profile/206066	Sharon Flynn	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	For several years Hope Clinic has offered me a rich opportunity to volunteer in the food distribution area. Clients are met at the front door by a friendly volunteer who checks them in.  Hospitality is one of our specialties beginning with coffee, tea and most times a snack to enjoy while they wait their turn into the food area.  LIstening to the stories of clients quickly gets us acquainted and we're laughing and/or tearing up, over circumstances.  One morning a person came in and said, "I don't need food, but I heard there is prayer here and I need someone to pray with me right now." This client left in calmness, more able to face the day.  Hope Clinic is a place to go for those in need.  It extends dignity, respect and empowerment  as each one selects food and personal items filling several bags according to the number in their household.  I can hear volunteers explaining how to cook  fresh vegetables (i.e. squash, turnips, mushrooms) so their family finds them appetizing.  Others have special dietary health needs and volunteers assist them by reading labels and offering selections.  Volunteers have immediate access to Hope Clinic staff who have answers if we need them.  The volunteers quickly form a team community amongst ourselves that works beautifully.  We have fun.  We interact in the joy of serving, stocking shelves, loading or unloading cars, recording data, etc. and giving warm, friendly good-byes to clients as they leave.  Driving home from volunteering my heart is full to overflowing with the spirit of goodness and I look forward to doing it again and again.  
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155170	1	/users/profile/206047	Greta Buck	Board Member	5	04/17/2013	It is a privilege and a blessing to spend my time at Hope Clinic. I have been involved at Hope for almost ten years and have seen first hand the amazing difference Hope makes in the lives of those in need. Hundreds of medical professionals volunteer their time to give free medical care to anyone without insurance, treating each patient with dignity and respect. The dental clinic provides free care to the uninsured - last year over 4,000 patient visits resulted in a lot of smiles. The food programs nourish the hungry with healthy food, as well as a listening ear, an uplifting prayer and a sense of community. My family volunteers in the food pantry once a month and have since the girls were quite young. We have all grown in our empathy, humility and spiritual lives from the experience. Hope is starting a new Family Ambassador program for families with young children. Find more information on their website on how to teach your children about poverty and serving others.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155169	1	/users/profile/206043	Patangquinn	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	My husband and I help cook once a month on a Saturday and have met many wonderful people and groups that want to help out preparing or serving a meal.  It is very humbling to see and experienceALL that Hope clinic does and provides for the community of Ypsilanti.  Praise God for His mercy, goodness and faithfulness.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155165	1	/users/profile/206036	AndyFrench	Board Member	5	04/17/2013	I became involved with Hope Clinic several years ago.  A small group of friends from church began cooking meals a few Saturday's each year.  I was inspired as I became aware of the wonderful services and the dedication the people at Hope Clinic have for the community.  I feel blessed that I have been able to continue to volunteer and become more involved in helping the mission of Hope Clinic.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155139	1	/users/profile/206009	Michael Frison	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	I learned about Hope nearly 20 years ago just after moving to this community.  About 15 or 16 years ago our small group wanted to find some ministry that families with children could do together.  So, we began volunteering to cook a Saturday evening meal for people who show up at Hope for a great meal on Saturday evenings.  We continue to participate in this ministry along with others in our church.  It has been a wonderful ministry for our family to experience together.          This is only one of a myriad of ministries that Hope Clinic has each week.  I am also a member of the pastoral advisory board of Hope.  There I get to see a broader range of the ministries and the lives touched and changed by the work of Hope.  I and our church are huge supporters of Hope Clinic.  
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155123	1	/users/profile/205990	daytona	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	I have known the founder of Hope Clinic and some of the early volunteers since the very early days.  The growth in the size and scope of the services offered to the community is nothing short of stunning.   From the beginning as a small medical clinic, Hope now provides food, dental care, and even a place to do laundry.  For many charitable individuals and churches in the area looking to volunteer time or resources, Hope has become "the" place to go.   Hope is very efficient in the use of its limited resources.  The staff is small, and a large portion of the day to day activity is handled by volunteers.   I highly recommend Hope Clinic as a great nonprofit for anyone who wants to "give back".  You will see the results first-hand.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	155093	1	/users/profile/205957	LASUNSHINE	Volunteer	5	04/16/2013	My name is Lynn I like the hope clinic's share and care program which supplies non food items such as toilet paper, dish soap and other item. When people are on fixed incomes this service can really help out. I also like the food program for the same reasons when you are on a fixed income getting three or more bags of food a month really helps. Last year Hope clinic started a fresh produce give away once a week to get healthier food to the people that come there. All these programs make Hope clinic an outstanding group to volunteer for and the staff is always so nice and helpful.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	153772	1	/users/profile/204586	mmoyad	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	As a volunteer at Hope clinic I have been thoroughly impressed by the level of caring, empathic and professional individuals who make up this wonderful place.  As it is appropriately named, 'Hope', I have had the privilige of seeing first hand exactly that offered to the clients here.  Grace and dignity are only the starting point where first rate medical, dental and many other resources are available.
Hope Medical Clinic, Inc.	153615	1	/users/profile/204436	Jennifer212	Board Member	5	04/08/2013	Hope Clinic is a nondenominational Christian ministry that provides free medical and dental care to those without insurance in southeast Michigan.  It also provides a food pantry, meals, and other social services assistance with an emphasis on health.  The services are virtually all provided by doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and others who volunteer their time and skills to help others.   What makes Hope so special is not only that people in need get the help they need, but also that those who are helping are blessed as well.  There is so much respect and care -- and we get so many letters and thank yous from the lives that are impacted.  A bride who is able to smile because she is able to get an entirely new set of teeth in time for her wedding.  The man who is able to get the treatment he needs to manage his diabetes and get a job.  While we are hoping that the new healthcare law will help more people get more coverage, it is quite clear that the demand for Hope will be there for the foreseeable future -- and the grace, care, and respect that people need to know they are loved is always in short supply!  Please make a difference and support Hope Clinic!

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	316152		/users/profile/407418	Jennifer606	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2016	I have been an employee of the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County for over 5 years and am grateful for all of the experience I have received. I came here a novice, trying to gain some basic experience in the social work field and 5 years later still know that I made the right choice. The services provided by the  shelter for the homeless population are invaluable and a major part of their survival when they are not actually staying at the shelter. I am happy to be a part of a team that cares enough to ensure the safety and well being of a population that most of society wishes would just go away.    
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	316150		/users/profile/407416	johnsonv	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2016	In seven years I have seen many clients benefit from the services and informed staff at the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County! The successes have varied greatly. Many clients have been housed or received assistance with sustaining housing. As a member of the community, I have witnessed how lives have changed after an individual ends their homelessness. Former clients have obtained skills/certifications that have proved to be life changing! Clients have been able to obtain/sustain housing after case managers helped them to become sober. Ive witnessed clients reunited with estranged family. Former shelter clients seldom forget their experience and often return to volunteer or support those still in need. Shelter staff meets clients where they are and link them to supportive services when they've succeeded. Great place to help!

I am getting ready to leave the area but as I do i will always treasure the time that I have spent there and hope to find an organization as wonderful as this one.

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	311285		/users/profile/402625	Jenny107	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	nice place, when I work there it feels more like a social visit, everyone  knows each other and supports each other, nice community.  This shelter offers so many services that are very valuable, one in particular that isn't officially listed is a patient ear and shoulder to cry on-the staff are so caring, and will spend time talking/listening to a resident who's having a bad day, the staff are genuinely invested in clients success and well being. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	310687		/users/profile/402028	noahlybik	Volunteer	5	10/14/2016	I have been volunteering at the Shelter Association for a couple of months now and every single day I am amazed with the patience and knowledge of the staff. They are always working in order to give the people who need their help the best possible care and chances to succeed possible. The services they offer require a great deal of time and commitment and I have never once seen those services offered without a smile.

They offer so many incredibly important services that many people need to get back on their feet. I love volunteering here. There are always great people, volunteers and clients alike. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	224136	1	/users/profile/287892	kpjacrawford	Board Member	5	10/18/2014	I was asked to join the volunteer Board this year by a good friend and former business associate. I've only been involved for a few short months, but I've already been pleasantly surprised by the level of commitment by both the volunteers and the employees. I was surprised to discover that very few, if any, of the other counties in Southeast Michigan offer this kind of assistance to the homeless. I really like the fact that this organization is not a permanent solution for the people that we help, but rather a starting point for them to make it on their own, and to have a better life than they had when we first met them. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	223561	2	/users/profile/287311	Boog5243	Board Member	5	10/16/2014	SAWC changes all of our lives AND our Community by compassionately assisting the most forgotten segment of our society; single, adult males and females who are experiencing homelessness and who, often, are experiencing a myriad of physical, medical and/or emotional issues.  This is a difficult population to serve, but the dedicated staff does it with grace and genuine warmth....AND with an outstanding level of success!  Hope truly does happen at The Delonis Center and I am proud to be a small part of it!!

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	222532	2	/users/profile/286238	CaseyR	Donor	5	10/14/2014	The Shelter Association's approach to homelessness works.  Clients show up with very little hope and no resources.  With the help of Shelter staff, clients develop a better sense of themselves and their place in the world.  They come to see that a home is achievable, and working with that vision, most leave the shelter and move to sustainable housing.

With more people in need places like the Shelter Association are in higher demand to help people who are running out of options.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	215573	1	/users/profile/61664	barb	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	It is every communities responsibility to provide help for the homeless.  The Shelter Association of Washtenaw County has provided this help and is an example of how many caring people coming together to support those in need can accomplish so much.  The leadership, staff and community can all be proud of the work done at the Delonis Center.

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	215431	1	/users/profile/278843	heather.h.wurster	Board Member	5	09/17/2014	This organization is remarkable, with a mission  of "ending homelessness one person at a time" the staff provide services, employment assistance, substance abuse, housing for Vets, & case managers that teach life skills so once a client is housed they are successful.

If there is a solution, they will find it.     
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	214971		/users/profile/278296	hathapond	General Member of the Public	4	09/13/2014	I worked with others to found the first shelter in Ann Arbor, called Arbor Haven. So I have been watching the problem of homelessness for many years. I am grateful for the efforts of so many people to create the Delonis Shelter and to keep it going. It has expanded its services to meet the growing need. The recent brutal winter was a crisis for homeless people, and Delonis is again stepping up its services in response. I am relieved to know that there will be a warm place for homeless people to sleep when winter comes again.What is still needed is a warming center open during the day. This is not necessarily a mission for Delonis, which is doing so much already. Bill Martin used to furnish a space on Ashley Street, but that building no longer exists.  Somewhere, somehow, our community must find a way to meet this need. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	214438		/users/profile/277711	jvcarey58	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2014	The Shelter Association of Washtenaw County is a national, regional and community leader in the art of collaboration within a community to provide services to the most vulnerable citizens.  I am in awe of the work and passion of its staff, and the great way they are able to provide services in a safe, and respectful manner.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	214310		/users/profile/277557	mbs1115	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	For 6 years I have worked with the Shelter Assoc. as a co-ordinator for one week of their Rotating SHelter program.  This winter relief program, requires SHelter Assoc. staff to work with about 25 congregations to be able to provide overnight housing for 25 homeless men.  The staff is marvelous.  Easy to work with and very caring.  This is a fabulous and unfortunatelly necessary service to our community.  I"m proud to work with these committed people.  They all deserve high praise.  Miriam
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	172190		/users/profile/227925	Nancy115	Volunteer	5	09/27/2013	I have been a volunteer at the Delonis Center for about 5 years now and have worked at the Service Center desk, the Medical Clinic, and the Front Desk, as well as serving on a Task Force to increase the number of churches to participate in our Rotating Shelter. I am currently taking on various tasks to help the Medical Case Managers and staff provide the best medical care possible for our clients. I absolutely love my time at the Center. I have always felt comfortable there, and staff has always taught me what I needed to know and I have been trusted to act as independently as possible, which makes the work there especially satisfying.Working in a shelter is complicated business for case managers who have to weave a path through mental and physical health issues, addiction, abuse, and lots of bureaucratic red tape. As volunteers, we provide support to the staff and clients, whether it be completing a specific task or, more often than not, just being there to listen and care.The clients at the shelter come from many backgrounds and experiences and needs. However, I have always found that people are just people...we all have the same basic needs...possibly the most important and simplest needs are to be RESPECTED and to be TREATED WITH DIGNITY. As volunteers, I feel that is OUR most important job.  I became involved at the Delonis Center through our church, First Congregational Church of Ann Arbor. For many years we have participated in the Rotating Shelter program that is run by the Shelter. I signed up to stay up one night in December at the church to chaperone and after that night I knew I had to volunteer at the shelter. I was hooked. The clients were polite, appreciative individuals who were  great to talk with and share life stories and insights. After that night, I knew I wanted to serve this population in a more extensive manner and that is how I became involved at this shelter.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	172146		/users/profile/227877	SA22	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2013	Shelter Association of Washtenaw County is a great place to work and the staff are great :). This program provides services for individual adults to improve their life and get back on their feet. I enjoy being an advocate for a vulnerable population and addressing crisis situations.

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	172034		/users/profile/227735	Lewis I.	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	As a Volunteer for the Shelter Association of Wastenaw County, I had the honor of working with Staff who showed  great care and took a well rounded approach to assisting clients who came through the doors. Offering opportunities that our state has neglected after years of cutting financial aid, and psychological help to those suffering from disabilities and mental illnesses. Even those who have fallen on hard times due to the financial struggles we've faced here in Michigan.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171954		/users/profile/227647	MJCS	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2013	The shelter is one of a kind. The program provides various opportunities for individual adults to get back on their feet by addressing various barriers. There is a free medical clinic, case management for residents and non-residents, job club for those seeking employment,  free laundry, storage, and meals, and showers to name a few. The center also collaborates with other community outreach programs including the Veteran's Administration, Department of Human Services,  Catholic Social Services, Community Support and Treatment Services, and with providers who offer legal consultation.  Also, the warming center provides emergency shelter to hundreds of people a night November into April. Not only is the shelter a place for people to stay, it is a center to improve quality of life by overcoming barriers with the services provided. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171911		/users/profile/227577	Heplayer92	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	SAWC is by far one of the best places that I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  The staff at the shelter is incredible.  It just feels like a big family working there.  My placement was in the clinic, and it was amazing how the clients were cared for holistically.  Their medical needs were met and exceeded, but the clinicians consistently take it a step further and help the patient focus on their life goals.  They do not simply treat the clients, but aid the patient in changing their habits, addictions, diets, and much much more.  Never have I ever volunteered with such an amazing group of individuals.  I feel like I am truly making a difference by being here.  
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171901		/users/profile/227556	Patrick34	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	My volunteer opportunity at SAWC was inspired by the way the Shelter takes care of it clients and i am delighted to be associated with that great organisation. i will still volunteer my time anytime i come to Ann arbor again.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171888		/users/profile/227541	Melissa2013	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I entered the shelter first as a volunteer then later as an intern.

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171844		/users/profile/227496	pstanford	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	The shelter association of Washtenaw County is one of the best non-profits I've volunteered at. The staff at the shelter are very helpful, warming, and they treat all their clients with the utmost respect. I truly believe everyone involved at the shelter are focused on working towards helping each and every one of their clients to find stabilized and affordable housing. It's a blessing to know that there are still organizations like SAWC around who are running effectively and working towards ending homelessness. I love volunteering at this place. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171825		/users/profile/227479	stirdivant	Volunteer	4	09/25/2013	This was by far the best organized facility I have volunteered at. I also appreciated that I could volunteer as many hours as I wanted/ needed. Many facilities require a certain number of hours that is hard to fulfill as a student. I also found the orientation very helpful for not only this experience but others as well. Many places did not have any type of orientation and it was very confusing as to what my job as a volunteer was. I greatly appreciated the set boundaries and expectations.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	171777		/users/profile/227429	ehenrick	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	The shelter association of Washtenaw County provides top-notch service to its clients.

The staff is professional and committed to the mission and works extremely hard every day to achieve this goal. The Board and volunteers are all engaged and dedicated to supporting the staff as they work with the clients to find housing for them and support clients, as needed, to help them remain housed. It is challenging work.

Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	58297		/users/profile/61970	feminist1st	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	I started volunteering at the Shelter Association to gain more hands-on experience in my field of interest (affordable housing & homelessness prevention) while looking for a full-time job. I had already heard fantastic things about the Delonis Center & I was further impressed with what I learned in my time as a volunteer. I now am a part-time employee at the Shelter & I love it.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	58278		/users/profile/61947	tish	Board Member	5	11/30/2010	I've been volunteering with the Shelter for 6 years, and have been involved professionally with the homeless and near-homeless of Washtenaw County for more than twice as long.  I've seen first hand how the Shelter is an indispensable resource for its clients, efficiently and compassionately run by its staff, and respected in the community.  I hear from many clients who say the Shelter has helped them turn around their lives, giving them the supports that allow them to become stable and housed.  We are very fortunate indeed to have such an organization in our community.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	58186		/users/profile/61832	Robert K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2010	The Shelter Association provides many services in its endeavor to "end homelessness, one person at a time."  One of these is the Shelter Clinic, which I manage.  The clinic provides Primary Care and sees homeless people who are both staying in the Shelter and those living outside.  We also provide medical case management: these staff support people in obtaining permanent access to healthcare services, in addition to helping them take care of urgent needs.

Staff and board alike are passionate about the mission. 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	57786		/users/profile/61196	deenam	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	I started at the shelter with some preconceived notions of those experiencing homelessness. The more time I spend the more I learn that many of my earlier preconceived notions were myth based and not fact based. There are so many really great people that are finding themselves here simply because of lack of employment and affordable housing.
Shelter Association of Washtenaw County	57598		/users/profile/60878	Shaktidanes	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	I came to the shelter as a volunteer and worked on the floor with clients. It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I love seeing many clients get back on their feet and regain housing.

Dreamcatchers for Abused Children	187487		/users/profile/244502	Marcy3	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2013	This is a very dedicated group of people who help raise awareness about child abuse. I have been following them since the beginning and have learned a lot about what is going on around us from the internet posts. I rarely comment, but with young children it is imperative that all adults know the signs of abuse in our own children as well as others. They are always willing to help!

She has dedicated her entire life to helping others and educating the public on child abuse and neglect. I volunteer to help as often as I can as I admire what she is doing and want to help as well. She has helped more people than I can count (even some of my closest friends who are survivors of abuse). She is my mentor.

Dreamcatchers for Abused Children	173094		/users/profile/97853	Rebecca W.	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	Dreamcatchers has consistently posted very important information which is helpful for educating and informing the public on the horrific nature of child abuse.  I have watched this nonprofit expland to include radio talk shows. There have been donations made to children in the form of Easter baskets and school backpacks. A very worthwhile cause with very fine people at the helm. I am not sure there is any comparible to Dreamcatchers...
Dreamcatchers for Abused Children	87224	1	/users/profile/97853	Rebecca W.	Volunteer	5	04/26/2011	I presently volunteer for Dream Catchers for Abused Children. It is an on line site and I work for it from my face book site. I usually recruit people so that they might join the cause. I also search on line newspapers in order to forward to Dream Catchers any articles on abused children, dead children, raped children or missing children. These articles are them posted in order to educate people on what is happening to children as far as such abuses would cover. People need to be aware of the fact that children are being sexually abused in stores such as the Salvation army store or the Walmart store. People need to be aware of the fact that a child walked to school and never made it, instead being found three days latter raped and murdered. People need to be aware that parents, doctors, teachers and all others from all walks of life are known to abuse and murder a child.  I find that in helping Dream Catchers for Abused Children I help myself. I have a passion which now occupies my time and I am helping others. In recruiting I have found friends which I would not have otherwise known. My feeling about myself have improved since I belong with an organization that is helping in an area I believe needs to be helping in.  The organization is limited to what they actually can do because of funding. It depends on donations and grants. I would like to see a structured home base. I would like to see it grow to include locations all over the world. Maybe one day a shelter will be built where children could be placed in emergencies. I also would like to see more work being done to revamp bills and laws that do not help the abused child.  I have seen people go and I have seen people come. My hope is that abuse of a child does not become secondary to other causes which I fear. I mean docotrs, lawyers, police pentagon officials are being charged with abusing children. Causes such as Save the Leopards are recruiting more people than our casue for abused children. How many people are still turning their heads when they learn a child has been abused. We need to have dedicated individuals in our cause. We need to work hard in order to stop or even cap abused towards the child.  
Dreamcatchers for Abused Children	173090		/users/profile/229194	Cynthia61	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2013	I receive updates from the Facebook page of this organization because I opted for it. The reason I opted for it: I have three children of my own who I would be devestated if anything were to happen to them. I pass along the information in these posts in the belief that if I hadn't, and one of MY friends had been the one missing piece of the puzzle that led to that child being found, or rescued from a bad situation, or whatever the case may be, I would forever question myself for what could have been. We live in a world of "what if's".     What if it was my child who went missing?! What if my son had been the one murdered and left in a ditch? What if my neighbors' child was the one in the article in question?! I could never sit idly by if I knew something that could help. So I do what I can when I do t have any other information to help more.    In the hopes that SOMEONE, further down the line will step up, raise their hand, and say "I saw her/him, they went that way," or even just POINT!!!    This organization is an amazing hope filled brainchild that would never have gone anywhere had it not been for social media and MANY many many other like minded people, the founder(s) being the first in line for the par on the back.    Keep up the great work! You help so many families move on or recover to heal. I hope that you continue to do so in the future for many years to come.

Together we spread the word and raise awareness nationwide on the signs, symptoms and effects of child abuse.

I was scared no one would believe me. I contacted them and they listened and helped me. They even made the initial police report for me. It's been a very long, emotional and stressful year, but my uncle ws finally prosecuted and went to prison 2months ago. I will never forget what they've done for me. Thank you, Dreamcatchers!

My name is Sierra Sullivan, and I am currently the Event Coordinator for Dreamcatchers for Abused Children. Dreamcatchers not only helps people online by spreading awareness, but also by providing resources to those in need. We recently did an Easter basket drive, and were able to provide baskets to every single homeless and abused child living in St. Clair County, Michigan. (The unemployment rate in this town is over 25%- so there is a devastating amount of homeless children here) I just love this organization, and everything that it stands for. I am so proud to call myself a Dreamcatcher!
Dreamcatchers for Abused Children	87402	2	/users/profile/98066	Julie F.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2011	One of Dreamcatchers goals is to raises the communities awareness surrounding child abuse. They are a voice to the voiceless, a ray of hope in darkness.  Another goal of the organization is public education.  This could keep them busy until the close of the century.  Many parents still do not want to talk about child abuse.  Thinking that if they talk about it this will some how bring abuse their way.  Dreamcatchers works with churches, law enforcement and schools to provide training for families.  I am very supportive of Dreamcatchers and their work.  They have the same goal as I do in my prevention work to end child abuse.  Child abuse is preventable if parents and children are informed.  Please for the safety of your family become informed. Julie Federico Author of Some Parts are Not for Sharing

Team Keegan	162845		/users/profile/216155	Katrina V.	Client Served	5	07/17/2013	Jennifer and Team Keegan are absolutely wonderful!!! They took their own personal experience with childhood cancer and turned it into something amazing. I have contacted them for 4 different families that I know that have babies fighting that evil monster cancer. Every time they responded so quickly and made sure the treasure chest was filled with items that each child would enjoy. I absolutely love everything about their story. What kid, or adult, would not love to open a treasure chest?!!?! The love and time they dedicate to make the treasure chests, then make sure the items are exactly what each individual.child would like is beyond the phrase...pay it forward. There needs to be more organizations like this in my opinion. I am so thankful for all the smiles that they have created for these warriors fighting the biggest war of their lives everyday. Because of people Like Jennifer  Team Keegan, these families know they are not alone and someone cares!! I have been privileged to see the faces of some of the kids when this treasure chest with their name arrives and no matter how bad they feel, they light up and can't wait to see what treasure awaits them. Thanks is simply not enough, but thank you!! 
Team Keegan	160975		/users/profile/213411	Tammy40	Client Served	5	06/18/2013	Team Keegan is wonderful ! What a loving, and caring family they are. Our daughter Hailey received a prize chest from them shortly after she was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, it helped her keep her spirits up and helped to keep her busy and her mind off of what she was dealing with. Team Keegan has not only given us the chest but had visited us in the hospital a few times with other little surprises, and I always hear such good stories of other families getting chests and of how much they loved getting them. 
Team Keegan	160937		/users/profile/213360	Theresa30	Volunteer	5	06/18/2013	Team Keegan is an absolutely amazing organization. This family dealt with a very scary situation - their own child had a brain tumor. After battling and beating cancer, this family decided to create Team Keegan to help other kids going through the same battle. When I heard about what Team Keegan was doing, I wanted to help and so did my 8 year-old son. We decided to make a trip to Walmart to buy toys for kids who have cancer. It was a great way for my son to make a difference! I think it is one amazing organization!

Not only was he sent a treasure box to help with his sad and scary hospital visits he was also sent hope in this box.    He is now three and a half and still goes to the hand made treasure box for comfort after a treatment.  This is something he can look forward to for his bravery.  We will save this box of love for his children .  Thank you Team Keegan for spreading love and hope!
Team Keegan	160932		/users/profile/213355	Stephanie95	Client Served	5	06/18/2013	Team Keegan is an amazing organization. Everything they do to help put smiles on childrens faces is above and beyond what I am able to put into words. My daughter who is 2 was diagnosed last year with Leukemia, we were given their name and we put in a request for one of their stuffed chest that they make. When Amillianna received that chest instantly her eyes lit up to see all the special goodies that were in it. We decided that on days that she has clinic whether it is a routine monthly chemotherapy visit  or a spinal tap with chemotherapy we let her pick out one item from that wonderful chest.  On those days were she is exhausted from all the doctors, pokes from needles and the chemotherapy; she gets so excited to go home to be able to choose a little something from it and each time she is more excited than before, it is little gestures like this that have helped us make it through this long journey. Thank you to Team Keegan for everything you have done, and continue to do to help these children make this journey a little better.

Team Keegan	160779		/users/profile/213165	mo5wrn	Donor	5	06/16/2013	Keegan, his family, and the whole crew that makes up Team Keegan are wonderful, giving individuals! As a mother of a cancer survivor, their mission to bring joy to children who are fighting the fight is so crucial to the healing process.  The process may not always end in cure, but when you live that "life with cancer" you focus on the things you can change and bringing happiness or smiles is one of those things. Team Keegan gives tirelessly to bring beautiful handmade treasure boxes of goodies that causes those very smiles! God bless them in their continued journey and I encourage everyone to consider donating to this amazing organization. 
Team Keegan	160754		/users/profile/213131	Suzanne38	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/16/2013	Team Keegan is an outstanding non-profit organization that draws upon the value of "giving back" to other fighters of childhood cancer, to honor their son,  Keegan, who is fighting his own battle.  The Keegan Prize Boxes are hand-carved and filled with a child's favorite toys. Team Keegan has extraordinary volunteers and donors who help this family put smiles on children's faces when they receive them. But, much more than even that, Team Keegan has been successful in spreading childhood cancer awareness and garnering community support, with hospitals and other childhood cancer network partners, as well as thousands of people engaged in following this organization's mission and reach. I am a donor and a fan. I refer several children to Team Keegan.  A very valuable gift that sets Team Keegan apart - is the quality of the precious hand-carved chests. ~ To last a lifetime. ~ And the meaning behind these toy chests being hand-built gives joy to children who need it most and serves as a timeless treasure to keep forever as a reminder of HOPE ~ to last a lifetime.

It is such a personal gift, and at the same time, like at Christmas, Emma's eyes were lit up in awe and wonder.  The time and energy spent making these gifts are priceless.  The gifts that Emma received were so Emma.  It was like Emma walked through a toy store and picked out what she wanted.  The toy chest will last forever.  It holds her most treasured items.  The chest itself is her entry to never never land.  When she opens it all the things in her life that make her different are gone.  She is a little princess with her own treasure chest.  Team Keegan gave her that.  They gave her a gift that keeps giving.  One that makes her smile everyday.

We happen to come across Team Keegan through a friend of our's through the clinic. We signed Addyson up and let them know what she was interested in. Addyson was so excited when the BIG box showed up on our doorstep. I was shocked when we opened up the "treasure chest" as Addyson called it.  It was full of crafts, doctor kit, a baby doll, blanket and so much more. Team Keegan made Addyson's day! We are so thankful for such a great organization to help put a smile on our sweet girls face when she has gone through so much! Thank you Team Keegan for all that you do.

When my son received his hand made wooden chest filled with toys, he was amazed! It gave him a reward for every poke, treatment and illness he had to endure during his cancer treatments. When all the toys were gone, he decided to use the wooden chest for his precious rock collection, something that is very dear to his heart. Every time I see him looking through the chest at his rocks, I'm reminded that someone made that for him just to make him smile. Team Keegan is just wonderful and spreading smiles to children with cancer all over the country!

I am also dedicated to bringing smiles to children with Cancer, and have learned so much about dedication to a cause through Team Keegan.  Their dedication to these children is unending and very heartfelt.  The boxes sent to these children bring smiles to children who may have forgotten how to smile and gives them a feeling of importance in a situation that makes them feel helpless.  This Team is truly the meaning of a T E A M in every sense of the word, teaming up to bring awareness to children fighting for their lives, while giving people a chance to donate and have a great feeling of paying it forward at the same time.

International Child Care USA Inc	314269		/users/profile/405634	Jack65	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	During this past summer, I was an intern at the US Office of ICC and was able to experience firsthand the good that ICC is able to spread throughout Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Their staff is always searching for the best methods to fight disease and poverty in these countries. The greatest insight that I learned during my time at ICC was that certain problems cannot simply be alleviated by donations and short-term solutions; by operating through Grace, ICC is able to address the shortcomings of children in these countries. The staff also finds creative methods to generate donations for various programs throughout their targeted area. Although they operate within a small market in Michigan, ICC is able to spread their good word across the country as the fight for a truly charitable cause.
International Child Care USA Inc	307556		/users/profile/237939	jhattmd	Volunteer	5	10/02/2016	I am a pediatrician and have been in practice for over 30 years. During that time, I have volunteered with several organizations that are involved in international medical outreach. In the first 10 years of that type of service, I would return home from a trip feeling like our 'team' had simply put a temporary Band-Aid on a huge gaping wound and that the work we did was not sustainable nor empowering to the local healthcare system. Then I learned about and became involved in volunteering for International Child Care. ICC does not send healthcare professionals from the US to do the work that the Haitian and Dominican doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers can do. It supports those that are there working every day by helping to meet educational needs, providing in-kind donations with training in their use, financial support in the field while educating those in the US about the lives of those living and working in a close neighboring country. It is truly empowering. .That was 15 years ago and my husband and I still believe in the work ICC does and support the organization with our monies and our time. And this year the organization celebrates its 50th anniversary, a testament to its history of sustainability
International Child Care USA Inc	222791		/users/profile/237939	jhattmd	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	I am a US pediatrician and have been a volunteer for  International Child Care USA since 2000. I have continued to be committed to supporting ICC for several reasons. I had volunteered with several other organizations prior to 2000 that were involved in international health programming but what has kept me engaged in ICC is its history of sustainability, its focus on empowering the local healthcare community and the programs' emphasis on, not just curative care, but on education and preventive healthcare. The ICC USA staff are dedicated, professional and passionate about their work and seeing that ICC does bring health and wholeness to children and families in Haiti and the DR. 
International Child Care USA Inc	181227		/users/profile/237939	jhattmd	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I am a pediatrician and have participated in international volunteer medical activities for over 20 years. My husband (a radiologist) and I have volunteered in several developing countries, providing short term hands on medical care most often in remote areas. But in working with most of these organizations, I kept feeling like we were just putting a bandaid on a huge gaping wound and at times, possibly even causing harm to the local healthcare systems. Then in 2000 I had the privilege of visiting International Child Care's programs in Haiti and the DR. It changed my view of international volunteer work and gave me a new direction for my efforts. In my opinion, ICC serves as a model for effective public health programming that is sustainable and empowers the local healthcare professionals.   My husband and I have become involved as volunteers, supporters and I am presently serving on the ICC USA Board of Directors.
International Child Care USA Inc	305726		/users/profile/397001	cbutte	Donor	5	09/20/2016	I first became acquainted with International Childcare (ICC) in 1977 when I went on a church mission trip to Haiti.  I was very moved by the children I saw and the wonderful care they received.  I began to sponsor ICC on a  monthly basis once I was in college.  In 2013, I was again on a mission trip to Haiti and looked to see if I was working anywhere near ICC. I was pleased to find out that they indeed were close by.  I got to visit the hospital and take my mission team members.  I got to see first hand the many changes, including how the hospital is across the street from its original location.  It is wonderful to see how ICC has grown and is now ministering to so many people in so many ways.  I am thankful to have been apart of their ministry for these 30+ years.Thankful,Lynn Punner

During my time there I was able to recognize the great impact that the hospital has on the community as well as get to know the staff.

From free HIV/AIDS screening and treatment to also running an eye care clinic, Grace helps to maintain the health and wellbeing of those living in PAP. It was an honor and certainly a pleasure to spend so much time at a place so well staffed and well run!

I have visited their projects in Haiti and the DR many times. Being an RN I was able to provide the shipping of supplies to the hospital in Haiti.

International Child Care USA Inc	299201		/users/profile/390107	revdoug	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/04/2016	I have volunteered with International Child Care raising money for their causes and have gone to Haiti to the their flagship ministry, Grace Children's Hospital.  I am amazed with how well they utilize the resources that we raise for them to impact the lives of literally 150,000+ people a year in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.  I personally know a number of their staff and board members and know them to be outstanding individuals working hard with great integrity.   As an example of resources being applied efficiently, the attached photo is a (low quality) shot of the CPR training mannequins purchased by our church being used in Haiti for training in July 2016.

My times at Grace Children's Hospital and their community health outreach programs have always been excellent.  Grace is truly a beacon of hope for children and families in need.
International Child Care USA Inc	297548		/users/profile/388350	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	I volunteered with the annual Vacation Bible School program that ICC leads. It was a great program that helped to teach children about Jesus and being kind to others. The VBS program focused on learning about the joys and challenges of children living in Haiti, particularly those who spend time at Grace Children's Hospital. The children attending ICC's VBS program enthusiastically raised a significant amount of money for Grace Children's Hospital. ICC cares greatly about its mission to support children and families in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. While ICC also provides financial support for families and communities, ICC is committed to empowering communities through education, health care training programs, preventative health care such as vaccinations, social programs for adolescents with disabilities, healthy birth kits, and more.
International Child Care USA Inc	297539		/users/profile/388340	S.Good	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	International Child Care does an amazing job as a Christian health care organization in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  They show a staying power that demonstrates their commitment to their mission to bring health and hope in the midst of communities plagued with extreme poverty.  I am a former Board Member who has led many church groups to visit and learn from their ministry sites. They always take good care of us while helping to build bridges of understanding across the cultural divide.  I am always impressed by the dedication of the workers and the deep trust they have earned from the local residents who know they can rely on ICC's reputation to effectively care for their loved ones.

International Child Care USA Inc	266818	1	/users/profile/355568	Writer	Donor	5	10/23/2015	I have been bringing church groups to encounter ICC and it's holistic health ministry since 1989.  I like to lift up ICC as an example of an NGO whom donors can trust to be good stewards of their gifts.  The emphasis on hiring Haitians and Dominicans has helped them to endure the tragedies of grinding poverty, hurricanes, military coups, and the earthquake.  ICC's  preventative and curative health care is a model for other NGO's to follow, which the World Health Organization and other respected groups have recognized.  ICC has gained and kept my trust and respect for all these years, and I look forward to introducing it to more people in the future.
International Child Care USA Inc	266678		/users/profile/285284	LeslieTUMC	Volunteer	5	10/23/2015	Our church has been involved with ICC since the 1980s. I have co-led over 7 MEET mission trips through ICC from 2009 through 2015. The organization is truly the hands and feet of Jesus serving the people, and particularly, the children of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The staff both in the USA and in the field, have become dear friends. Their dedication, love, faith and service glorify God and serve our friends and neighbors in need. It is an honor and privilege to partner with them.

Their skills and energy are inspiring. The children and families receiving services from ICC, have touched my heart and soul, and in so doing have forever changed my life. It is an honor, joy and privilege to partner with ICC, a relationship I hope will continue for years and years to come.

They have succeed due to their effort in getting support for the children. I sincerely bless them and wish them the best in order for them to keep helping those kids who really need a friendly hand!

ICC has served their patients well side by side with the Haitian people.  As example, with the American College of Radiology, ICC is in the process of enhancing Radiology services in the country through education and technology.Charles "Chuck" Phelps  II, M D 
International Child Care USA Inc	263423		/users/profile/352127	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	In 1979 when I was 16, I was introduced to Grace Children's Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti through International Child Care.  I still remember that trip and those children every day.  Although it took over 30 years, I returned with my then 16-year old daughter to introduce her to Haiti in 2012 and then again in 2013.  The work of ICC touches so many lives every day.  It's leaders and volunteers truly love from the depths of their hearts, and the impact is felt throughout Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
International Child Care USA Inc	263044		/users/profile/351754	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	I went on my first mission trip with ICC last year. I toured the hospital, helped with a mobile ICC clinic in the Port-au-Prince community and went to the northern community of Jolitrou. I saw Jesus working through the hands of ICC. Every morning, there was a line of people at the hospital waiting to be seen. It brought me great joy to know that all of these wonderful people have access to health care, because of iCC.

ICC is dedicated to bringing hope to children and families in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, a cause that is desperately needed for that island. I have been to both Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and can attest to their mission. If you are looking for an organization that you can trust is doing the work it says, support ICC.

International Child Care USA Inc	230548	1	/users/profile/294176	suehen	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I have been on two mission trips to Haiti through ICC.  The work they are doing is amazing.  On our first trip, we visited Grace Children's Hospital and got to see many of the programs that they offer from working with children with HIV and TB to running outreach clinics and home instructions. Our next visit was to Joli Trou in northern Haiti.  In this region, ICC has offered a program of establishing miro-enterprizes. This program has empowered the women and given them the respect they so deserve.Part of the funds earned have been put back into the community to purchase land for the clinic at Joli Trou. This clinic along with the hospital in Grand Norde offers pre-natal care as one of their main focuses.  Through them, the former mortality rate of 80% for mothers and babies has been reduced to having not lost a single mother or child in the last two years!!  How amazing is that!! All of this and much more is a result of ICC's work.  Both trips were truly a blessing.
International Child Care USA Inc	229478		/users/profile/293130	SJBN	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	I became involved in this wonderful organization when Grace Hospital first opened, and have been telling the story ever since, to anyone who would listen! This amazing group has made unbelievable strides in changing health care attitudes and delivery in this poverty stricken country of Haiti,and spread their work into the Dominican Republic. From a children's hospital with 50 crib mattreses and a rented residence, and with very little money,  bringing hope to the people for relief from the dreaded disease of tb,  - to leading the campaign throughout the country against tb., and continuing to find solutions to their many health problems -  solutions  appropriate for the situations -  throughout the Island, ICC works miracles.  I continue to tell their story - of clean water for communities, school children, families; of healthy births free of tetanus, of spreading hope and love and encouragement and support and practical solutions  health and wholeness.

It is a fantastic organization. I'm happy to say that for my parents' 50th weddings anniversary they requested donations to ICC in lieu of gifts and were able to donate thousands of dollars to this great non-profit group.

Children and families who live in unimaginable conditions are treated with respect and dignity in an environment designed to heal both their physical and emotional wounds.  ICC has been in Haiti nearly 50 years doing amazing work.  They are worthy of my donations because I know lives are being saved.
International Child Care USA Inc	226559	1	/users/profile/290287	ZHK7	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	International Child Care is a fantastic organization that has been working in Haiti for nearly 50 years. They have a remarkable history and provide care to hundreds of children every day. I personally spent several days in Port-au-Prince and visited their hospital (Grace Childrens Hospital). I was impressed by their dedicated staff and overall compassion. Its sad to see so many problems in Haiti, a country thats had to endure so many catastrophes over the last several decades. But, its really gratifying and encouraging to see ICC making such a positive impact there. Truly a special organization...

International Child Care USA Inc	218358		/users/profile/230052	Degaje	Board Member	5	09/30/2014	What is amazing to me is the high level of dedication put forth by the men and women of International Child Care - from the office staff, to the health workers, to the nurses, to the doctors, attendees in the children's ward, to those who provide other important services, sometimes with little or no recognition.  As a board member, I find it very hard to not do my best to assist those in the field, when they do so much to make a difference to those in critical need.  My hat is off to them, and I will continue to strive to provide the necessary resources for those in the field who are putting forth those important services at the hospital, clinic, home, or where-ever those in need gather - especially the children!  They give me tremendous strength, and determination, with a sense of hope for the future in Haiti and the D.R.
International Child Care USA Inc	173896		/users/profile/230052	Degaje	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	My first trip to Haiti was in 1998, when I was 1st exposed to "ICC".  This experience was my epiphany.  Soon thereafter I gratefully accepted the opportunity to join the board of directors, and I have been involved with ICC ever since.  Dealing the non-profit sector is difficult at times.  However, my experience with ICC, and it's mission, has been most rewarding, especially the people that I have had the pleasure to work with and for.  In spite of the obstacles present in Haiti (especially) and the Dominican Republic, ICC continues to make a difference in the lives of children, their families, and those delivering the mission.  Even with its many challenges, ICC is making a BIG difference, and I'm proud to be associated with it!   I will strive to work with ICC to provide "Health and Hope..." to the the "least of these", as ICC has made a HUGE impact on my life too!

This organization does a tremendous job with direct fundraising in the US to support these efforts, as well as working side by side with the great people in these countries that are delivering the much needed services.  I'm happy and honored to continue supporting ICC USA.
International Child Care USA Inc	217939	1	/users/profile/281489	juliamac	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2014	As a board member and volunteer, I have worked with ICC for around 10 yrs now, and traveled to Haiti with them at least 1-2 times/year. The US staff is helpful and works hard to see that funds are used with good stewardship in mind, putting the needs of the children of Haiti and the Dominican Republic above all else. I have been particularly impressed witht he dedication of the Haitian and Dominican Health Care workers who work for ICC to provide care for their patients even when resources are slim. The workers in Haiti worked non-stop during the weeks following the earthquake providing care for both their patients as well as those in the community. The Dominicans worked to help the Haitians following the earthquake, and have continued to provide care for all the disabled kids they help, with reduced budgets due to having to help their Haitian colleagues. One of my colleagues referred to Grace Children's Hospital as "the little hospital that could" which I think aptly describes a place that provides top notch care with very few resources.  I can only hope to do as well as my Haitian and Dominican colleagues....
International Child Care USA Inc	193665	1	/users/profile/252954	rayaller	Volunteer	5	02/02/2014	I am a physician, and my wife Lynne Austin was a pastor/elder of the United Methodist Church.  From our first visit in 2008 to Haiti to our most recent in 2012, we were singularly impressed with the dedication of the staff to improving the health of those coming to the hospital - and with the appreciation of the patients and families for the care they received.  Lynne focused on their emotional and spiritual needs, such as grief counseling, how to disclose HIV status to children, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc. We have established a memorial fund in honor of Lynne, to help rebuild the Grace Children's Hospital, that was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.

International Child Care USA Inc	176416		/users/profile/232828	John195	Board Member	5	10/10/2013	I first became engaged with ICC some 15 years ago when I went to Grace Children's Hospital to visit the children on a trip to Port-au-Prince.  I was so impressed with the quality of care they were providing at Grace that for many years, on each visit to Haiti, I would take any team I led to Grace to see their work.  Two years ago I was invited to be a member of the Board and have had to opportunity to learn more about the amazing work of ICC in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  I would encourage anyone interested to view the organizations website and to become more informed of all the good work this organization has done and will continue to do in the future.  
International Child Care USA Inc	176067		/users/profile/232454	Jo__19	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	The work that ICC does in Haiti and the Dominican Republic is critical for the health and wholeness of children in those countries.  What, I believe, sets ICC apart from so many other non-profits and NGOs operating in the DR and especially in Haiti, is its commitment to an equal partnership between the board of directors in the four countries that compromise ICC (Canada, United States, Haiti and the DR).  Helping Haitians and Dominicans help themselves is central to the mission of ICC which sets it apart from so many other non-profits operating there.  I have been working in Haiti since 2008 and directly with ICC since 2010.  The progress I have witnessed with ICC's programs is remarkable - especially considering the terrible destruction and set-backs caused by the 2010 earthquake.  ICC's commitment to working with the ministries of health in each country, hiring and training local community members for EVERY position and equality between each participating country for the exchange of ideas and program planning is admirable.  I am particularly proud to be a part of the training and education of the women who are part of one of ICC's newest programs in Haiti - the community based rehabilitation program that provides therapies to children with disabilities.  I have had the pleasure of watching this program launch and seeing first hand the leadership provided by competent, capable, charismatic Haitians.  The community based rehabilitation workers' commitment to their profession and the care and love they provide to the children of Haiti is humbling to witness.
International Child Care USA Inc	175508		/users/profile/231855	Cubbiesfan23	Board Member	5	10/08/2013	I have a relatively short history with International Child Care, but have been blown away by the work they do.  The work they do in Haiti and the DR is simply incredible.  I'm proud to serve on the board of such a great organization serving great people.
International Child Care USA Inc	173730		/users/profile/229881	Baz Cunningham	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	As a past board member I spent 25 years working for and with the people of Haiti as a volunteer.  I visited many other NGO's while in Haiti from 1977-2002.  I chose ICC to spend my time and money with for a variety of reasons, but mainly because their charter was to hire Haitians whenever possible and try to conduct the health care projects as "Haitian" projects, not force-fed ex-pat projects.  Also, many NGO's have no plans for sustainability and no long term goals/plans, which often left the Haitian people worse off than if that NGO had never been there.  Hope is always a goal and leaving people in the middle of a project takes away that hope.  ICC is interdenominational and many religious and non-religious groups have evaluated them and found them worthy of support, from many different countries.  ICC has been able to adapt- from a start of being a care-giver for children with TB, to inoculating for TB and other communicable diseases, to starting an 80 bed TB hospital, to instituting health clinics, out patient clinics, training for mid wives and health related topics, to converting over to a "neighborhood" hospital that serves the people in the slums surrounding it.  Other clinics and projects have been conducted as money, resources and people have been available, such as the eye clinic.  ICC has been used as a model by outside organizations, particularly their inoculation program and their work against TB, which, when started, was one of the major causes of death among children in Haiti.  ICC has hosted outside medical clinics, shared their work with others, given aid and help to other NGOs in Haiti when possible.  I served as Treasurer of the board for many years and also as President of the US board for 4 years- I was privileged to work with great people, dedicated people, hard-working people, at all levels, from the board to the staff, from the doctors and nurses to the people who cooked the food, cleaned the laundry and kept the compound clean.  I know the earthquake was a major blow to the program, but they have survived and are working on plans for rebuilding where the old compound stood, continuing their programs across the street where land was obtained some years ago for expansion- a fortuitous decision, but not unplanned or surprising when you know the time and effort that goes into running the ICC organization.  I now teach a class on the history and culture of Haiti and have had the opportunity to mix with others who have had a "Haitian" experience, as short term volunteers or longer term missionaries, case workers, medical study teams and the occasional tourist.  It is not an easy country to do business in, to fully understand and to keep going for over 45 years with the turnover in governments, the interferences (good and bad) by the US and outside agencies and countries, and just the logistics of operating in a country that has no infrastructure, supplies and often, utilities and water.  ICC should be proud of what they have accomplished- I am proud to have been a small part of their past.  My time has past- age catches up with all of us, but it has not diminished my spirit or love for Haiti. 
International Child Care USA Inc	173669		/users/profile/229815	kenmanley	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	I started my involvement with ICC in 1989. It has been a wonderful journey since then.

International Child Care USA Inc	173627		/users/profile/229771	Kwame R.	Donor	5	10/04/2013	I was intially introduced to International Child Care (ICC) as a child over 40 years ago when I travelled to haiti with my late father to visit family and he insisted that we visited Grace Children's Hospital run by ICC.  For over 45 years ICC through Grace Children's Hospital and pediatric clinics throughout Haiti and the Dominican Republic has successfully delivered treatment to poor children seriously ill with Tuberculsis, HIV/AIDS, Cholera and other ailments.  They have offered prenatal services to expecting mothers.  They have also provided preventitive treatment to children through vaccinations and other treatment. After losing contact with ICC in my early adult years, I reconnected with ICC after I made a donation to ICC with funds collected as donations at my father's funeral 10 years ago.  I was presently surprised that ICC had sustained their work in Haiti over time.  Many NGOs had come and gone in Haiti during the decades that ICC continued offering their services to the children in need. ICC distinguishes itself from other non for profits because it operates efficiently with a small staff in the U.S. and productively with a Haitian staff delivering services in Haiti.  Of the dollar donated, the vast majority goes towarss the delivery of services in lieu of funding administration.
International Child Care USA Inc	147617		/users/profile/195282	Kathy Johnson	Donor	5	01/03/2013	ICC is a very highly-rated non-profit organization.  I had the opportunity to travel to Haiti with a group for the first time in 2012, and for me it was a life-changing experience.  Meeting the doctors, nurses and staff at Grace Children's Hospital, playing with the children and seeing Port-Au-Prince first-hand was heart-warming, fascinating and at times tragic as you see the vast poverty and need throughout Haiti.  Grace Children's Hospital is staffed completely by Haitians which deeply impressed me.  Although the hospital is now in temporary quarters, they do a wonderful job of treating thousands of children and their families as well as providing services such as health education and counseling.  I found the staff to be very caring and friendly.  International Child Care is certainly an outstanding organization and Grace Children's Hospital is making a very real and positive difference in Haiti.

International Child Care USA Inc	82272		/users/profile/90563	Thomas Hunsdorfer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2011	I've traveled to Haiti and the Dominican Republic with International Child Care several times. They do a great job of providing health care to at-risk children and families, including working with kids who have AIDS and TB. While the organization's Haiti program is dependent on outside financial resources, all of its employees are Haitians, and this impressed me.  Despite severe damage and loss of life in the 2010 earthquake, they've managed to open temporary hospital facilities that are now serving thousands of patients. I was in Haiti 6 weeks after the earthquake, and the Haitian staff were caring for large numbers of patients and also providing space for food distribution. Very impressive.

We have planted over 100,000 trees in the 6 years we've been in existence and have plans in the works to plant another 70,000! We are helping combat global climate change, protecting water sheds, providing biological corridors for migratory animals, and educating people about the critical role tropical forests play in the health of our planet. 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109783		/users/profile/76847	maryblizzard	Board Member	5	04/12/2012	I first experienced the work of La Reserva Forest Foundation 6 years ago on a tour through their preserve with Roberta Ward Smiley, founder, as my guide. What she helped me see was that small changes in the environment have a huge impact on all surrounding life. The growth of LRFF over the past few years has been impressive, the most recent project put 38,000 trees in the ground in an area that will improve the lives of flora & fauna and the indigenous people living there. I appreciate being able to work for a non-profit where I know monies raised are NOT being used for advertising or fund-raising but are going directly to reforestation efforts.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	70301		/users/profile/76847	maryblizzard	Board Member	5	02/17/2011	La Reserva has the simple mission of planting trees to help heal the earth. Last year they planted 10,000 trees, this year plans are in the works to triple that number. La Reserva works with local farmers, foreign born residents, and indigenous people - whoever wants to join in the campaign to reforest areas with native species and to preserve existing forests. The dedication of LRFF Founders, Roberta Ward Smiley and Dan Spreen Wilson are an inspiration They embody selfless devotion to their work. Tours through the La Reserva preserve in Costa Rica have transformed the lives of many among whom I am happy to take my place.

During my time there I got to see first hand the importance of La Reservas work and work with the people, like the Maleku, whom the charity helps support. I learnt about forest regeneration at all levels and how imperative it is we support the natural regeneration of tropical forests as La Reserva does. I can't recommend this organisation, its work and members enough - if you can support it in anyway it will be one of the best things you do. 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	110639		/users/profile/150610	Jorn D	Volunteer	5	04/24/2012	I have been working as a volunteer with La Reserva Forest Foundation for almost 3 months now. I have learned and seen alot about this great organisation. The dedication to reforest and preserve the tropical forests is amazing. The people that work here and that work with us are inspiring. La Reserva recently reforested an area near the Rio Sol, its a corridor for flora and fauna to migrate and spread to different locations. These corridors are of high importance and La Reserva is doing a great job creating these corridors. Next to creating corridors and slowly reforesting the world, La Reserva helps the local and/or indiginous people by providing jobs in helping maintaning these reforested areas. Also La Reserva helps in educating those who are involved or interested in reforestation and preservation. I have gain great insights of what I would like to work with in the future. Preserving the worlds tropical forests can be done by giving forests a higher economic value than its destructive values (timber, agriculture), in my opinion carbon sequestration is a great solution. I would highly recommend this organisation to any other future volunteer.

Inspired by what La Reserva was doing, we planted thousands of trees on our own property nearby and have been rewarded with the creation of a mini biological corridor for hundreds of species.  This has been rewarding work indeed, and we applaud the persistence and dedication of La Reserva in creating a new culture of growth and conservation around Lake Arenal.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	34601	6	/users/profile/35466	ssh	Board Member	5	04/03/2010	As a former board member and "volunteer," I was helpful in many ways in the founding and organization of La Reserva. It was intense work, because Roberta and Dan are intensely involved in this project, with a passion for living trees and creating forests to preserve the aquifers and offer opportunities for animal populations to migrate.  Costa Rica is one of the most bio-diverse countries on the planet, and we are losing that diversity at an alarming rate.  Just one example:  the howler monkey population has dropped by 50% in just the last 15 years -- mostly due to loss of habitat, as well as the forest "bridges" that connect one habitat with another.    Working with Dan and Roberta is an education -- not just about forests, but about what it means to be so dedicated and energetic in the pursuit of one's dream.  Their trajectory over the past few years has been electrifying.  They are now known everywhere, including among all the environmental institutions, both public and non-profit.  They participate in some of these organizations and carry their message wherever they go -- especially in the local schools.  They give tours of the forest they've created, collect seedlings, sell indigenous trees from their nursery, maintain the thousands of trees they've planted, and manage a thorough-going communications program.     This is truly an organization worthy of support!
La Reserva Forest Foundation	110363	1	/users/profile/150238	murcielago	Donor	5	04/20/2012	From my father, with whom i had a more than lifelong sore contact, i inherited money, during his life and after he eventually passed with 86 yrs of age. I was  never an example of gratitude, and could have spent it wiser. - The repeating thoughts were, i want your love, and not your money - Slowly though forgiveness and acceptance did seep through, and somehow early this year i needed to do something again. Trees and planting trees, has a place in my heart. Unfortunately I don't have land of my own to plant on. Roberta's dedication and enthusiasm in this had already touched me over the years. In the name of my father i made quite a big donation to LRFF, and now a grove is planted there, with his name. Their response, and the effect it had on me was overwhelming, beyond words. I cried and cried.......  Something good happened on various levels.

La Reserva Forest Foundation	109808		/users/profile/149579	Iwona	Volunteer	5	04/13/2012	The work of La Reserva Forest Foundation is so precious, that all words would be not enough. La Reserva is saving our Earth, in fact is saving us, our civilization. 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109800		/users/profile/149567	KC W.	Board Member	5	04/12/2012	I began working with La Reserva Forest Foundation during college for a Service Leadership class where I consulted a non-profit. I had the privilege of being paired up with LRFF. I noticed from the first second I talked to Roberta that this was truly something special. Her passion was unmatched and her goals were out of this world. I realized that this rubbed off on everyone involved with this organization, which eventually rubbed off on me. Everyone involved has such a strong desire to make the world a better place environmentally, socially, and even economically. Their goals of restoring forest habitats, helping the people of the earth, and helping the economies of poor indigenous people in Costa Rica really spoke to me. It seemed as this non-profit really hit all the bases and did not focus on one issue, but somehow fit a bunch of them even though it was not very big. I have now worked with La Reserva on their board of directors for a year, and it has been a wonderful experience. I highly recommend anyone at all get involved with this non-profit since it is something that everyone can relate. It is a non-profit that you get immediate satisfaction knowing you are making a difference on earth. 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109622		/users/profile/149365	mikhail.GREEN	Client Served	5	04/11/2012	La Reserva Forest Foundation is a truly magical place with a tremendous social mission and the staff capable of seeing it to fruition. Roberta and her team are a blessing. To date, they have helped our organization educate over 200+ university students who have taken the positive values and principles of LRFF to heart. The work being done at LRFF is extraordinary and the impact has been clear over the past 3 years of visiting the project sites. Best of luck for continued success.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109612		/users/profile/149354	Roger E.	Client Served	5	04/11/2012	My reforestation project was one of the first and has been an enormous success. We put in at least 50 different types of  trees. The new forest has now a new family of monkeys and untold bird nests. There are now naturally appearing tree sprouts filling in under the larger trees as the forest growth ages. The whole project has been great fun to watch and we get many comments on how fast things can change for the betterment of all.  Roger
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109578		/users/profile/149310	Rebeccabell91	Volunteer	5	04/11/2012	I did an internship at La Reserva for 5 months last year working as Executive Assistant to the CEO, Roberta. As a student of Modern Languages (French and Spanish) in England, I am currently undertaking the 'year abroad' aspect of my degree for which I spent my Spanish half in Costa Rica. Roberta was extremely helpful and welcoming from the start, and after a very friendly Skype interview, found me a host family nearby who are friends of hers and Dan's. At La Reserva I was given a wide range of tasks ranging from translations, letter writing and blogging to video making, calendar design, production and promotion and accompanying them on day trips to Maleku tribal villages! Roberta, Dan (Roberta's partner), Suzy (the very friendly Chihuahua cross who greeted me every day with excitable muddy paws), Gino (the Great Dane who greeted me every day with a very large not-overly-pleasant slobbery kiss), the La Reserva parrot and Squeak the loudest snoring cat I have ever met, really have something special at La Reserva. Even the walk up is pretty surreal, with captivating views out over Lake Arenal and Arenal Volcano looming in the distance, quite often a rainbow or two framing the idyllic scene following the afternoon rains in wet season. The work that La Reserva does is innovative, wide ranging and essential to the survival of the rainforest and its inhabitants both human and animal. The unconditional love that Roberta and Dan have for the earth and its inhabitants is really rather inspiring and it is their enthusiasm and passion that keep LRFF going through thick and thin. I had a fantastic time in Costa Rica working at La Reserva, and I am hoping this summer to return or to volunteer in some way from England, possibly to help set up an LRFF UK! 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	109568		/users/profile/149292	Helena B.	Donor	5	04/10/2012	I am so amazed by the dedication and progress of La Reserva Forest Foundation. They have planted over 70,000 trees in the past four years. I feel grateful to be able to help my planet by donating to people who are willing to go out in to the jungle, trudge through the rivers and dig in the dirt to lovingly plant trees. I like to help physically plant the trees as well but I donate as much as I can to support this very important work. Trees produce oxygen and clean our air what could be more important?

La Reserva Forest Foundation	109521		/users/profile/149234	Beth33	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/10/2012	ECO-Action can not extend enough praise to this wonderful organization!  We have rated them as EXCELLENT in all the following categories:  Educational, Hands-On Effectiveness, Community Awareness, Local and Global Actual Benefit, Virtual Presence, Enthusiastic Leadership, and Sustained Commitment!       These are the kind of people and organization that can take one's breath away - and, in this case, produce enough oxygen for several more!  The variety of projects and areas of effectiveness are especially impressive when considered vis a vis so many bloated and one-dimensional non-profit organizations popular today - and La Reserva operates on a criminally low budget for the time, sustained effort, and effectiveness obtained.  Others in the field would do well to visit and assist this organization with time or money, and leave with renewed hope and vigor.  Their enthusiasm and dedication are contagious!  We are proud to know them and aspire to La Reserva's accomplishments. For more information:    Beth Hollenbeck, Executive Director, ECO-Action, USA, www.eco-action.net, 407-695-5050 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	108530		/users/profile/79274	Courtney C.	Volunteer	5	03/29/2012	La Reserva Forest Foundation (LRFF) is an incredible organization working towards restoring the Costa Rican rainforest. As a college student in California, I haven't had the pleasure of returning to Costa Rica to directly volunteer with LRFF, but I plan to in the future. They are so smart with what they do, considering all aspects on life in Costa Rica from the trees and vegetation to the monkeys and other wildlife, and the farmers and people trying to make a living. I've throughly enjoyed giving some of my very little income as a monthly donation, and have loved reading the periodic emails sent to me about their diverse and focused projects. LRFF is an awesome non-profit that I'm thrilled to continue to be intimately affiliated with. 
La Reserva Forest Foundation	72512		/users/profile/79274	Courtney C.	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	I had the opportunity to fund raise for any organization in the world and chose to donate my funds to LRFF. This organization is run by intelligent, driven leaders that I've had the pleasure of meeting personally. Roberta and her staff are truly inspirational. I hope one day to return to Costa Rica to visit their neck of the woods and plant one of their countless trees that are helping to restore our precious rain forest. Thank you LRFF for your extremely hard work and amazing accomplishments!
La Reserva Forest Foundation	107011		/users/profile/81090	El T.	Volunteer	2	02/24/2012	I have nothing positive to say at this date. Sorry.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	74219		/users/profile/81090	El T.	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	I moved to Costa Rica hoping to be able to engage in reforestation and wildlife preservation efforts. I met Roberta and Daniel of La Reserva Forest Foundation at their first ever fundraiser. Despite having virtually no funding or support at that time, they were planting trees anywhere they could get an agreement from landowners. I was moved by their dedication and commitment to reforestation and habitat restoration. I am proud to work with La Reserva regularly and have seen the foundation take on bigger challenges and become better organized and more effective in our efforts. Community outreach, educational programs, nursery creation projects, animal rehabilitation and reintroduction and biological corridor program, and ongoing forest docent programs along with cultural restoration projects are among the expanding efforts being made at La Reserva. In 2009 we planted 10,000 trees and more still in 2010. Other lands we have reforested are showing signs of returning fauna and diversification of flora in the few short years since being planted! This makes me even more excited about the work we do with La Reserva Forest Foundation. Roberta Ward Smiley and Daniel Spreen are a true inspiration and deserve to be supported and encouraged in their work at La Reserva Forest Foundation.

It is really an amazing work of art what Roberta and her husband have done to help Costa Rica, and mother earth.  Therefore, they are really helping humanity.  She has stimulated my wife, Jennifer, and me to do the same with.  our land and taught us how to do it.  It is amazing that within a year how our land has reforested and hopefully soon all the natural wildlife will be back. Alan J. Sault MD, ABHM

But it wasn't until the recent years that I have been able to see their work, their enthusiasm, their "ant-like attitude" of always working hard no matter what. I TRULY believe these are the type of people and organizations we need, those that stay during the years...'cause you know what, just like the ant has no choice but to bring food to the colony, us humans have no choice but save the planet and save ourselves. - - Roy Prendas lvarez

It has been a very rewarding and positive experience.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	34586	9	/users/profile/35450	vidaloco767hotmailcom	Volunteer	5	04/03/2010	While there are various organizations that are involved in planting or re-planting in deforested areas, La Reserva also makes an impact with education. Yes, they have planed over 10,000 trees, they have also "planted" the idea that the disaster of deforestation can be reversed. They have talked with, and educated local land owners, and school children regarding the importance of this project and the positive impact that it can have for all of us. Additionally, with the tours of the already re-forested land that Dan and Roberta have converted from pasture to jungle, they have been able to educate people from all over the world. Without exception, those who experience the tours come away with a completely different outlook as to the possibilities of reversing the damage that humans have inflicted on our environment. They deserve all of the credit for accomplishing this and with proper funding there is no limit as to what further could be accomplished.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	34562	3	/users/profile/35421	silentlynx04	Volunteer	5	04/03/2010	I was a volunteer at La Reserva Forest Foundation for a month last year. It was an amazing experience doing hands on work to restore native tropical forest. During my time I was also exposed to some great literature provided by Dan and Roberta on restoration and environmental conservation in Costa Rica. While volunteering I worked on biological corridors as living fences, planted over a thousand seeds in the native plant nursery, and learned about tropical forest ecology. I liked the reserve and the work they are doing so much that I returned again this year and volunteered for a few days helping plant trees, repair living fences, and enjoying nature hikes through the reserve. This place has opened a new passion in me and I have the highest regard for the work that Roberta and Dan are doing for the environment. I hope that through the various ways they are conducting outreach that the foundation will be able to do more good for the local community and also for the global community who either knowing it or not, relies on these forests for a better Earth.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	34558	3	/users/profile/35416	nancylee	Volunteer	5	04/02/2010	My husband and I took a tour of LaRserva alittle over a year ago. We were so impressed with what Dan & Roberta were doing we went back to the states, sold our house, and moved here to be a part of this special nonprofit.We're not the only ones who are here to volunteer.Everyone envoled with LRFF has the same passion. They don't just plant trees.It's very important to LRFF that the Ticos[Costa Ricans] are payed for their work.They plant the native trees and maintain them for two years. The forest, once planted, grows back to its thick, lush, green beauty.This is the natural habit of the sloth, birds,butterflies,puma, and our beloved monkeys to name a few animal species. Just last week at LRFf a pair of white face monkeys were spotted. Roberta last saw them here 15 years ago. They are coming back because they have the corridors now.LRFF plants to connect the forest areas to become large corridors so the animal habitat can travel and multiply in thier natural eco system.The indigenous people look to the forest for their food and natural medicines. This just touches the surface of what LRFF is all about.Please go to webb site WWW.LRFF.ORG.   Come to La Reserva ,meet Roberta &Dan;,take a tour and see for yourself.The tour starts at thier house. There is no ticket office or snack bar. After the tour you go back to the house and have a cold drink. LaReserva is truely a "grass root" organization. That's why we're here and we're loving every minute of it. We just need the money to plant. Come experience the feeling of planting a native tree in the forest.LET'S GET PLANTING! That's our motto.

The dedication of both Roberta Ward Smiley and Daniel Spreen Wilson to the native forests and its inhabitants is refreshingly sincere and their energy astounding.  What they have accomplished on a shoestring budget is, by itself, a testament to their devotion to their cause.   The ramifications of their accomplishments will not only restore habitat for the rainforest and its flaura/fauna, but provide desperately needed carbon absorption for the worlds floundering atmosphere.   LRFFs focus is remarkable; I just wish enough funding was available to make more of their dreams come true.
La Reserva Forest Foundation	34536	2	/users/profile/35333	mary13	Board Member	5	04/02/2010	LRFF was founded in 2005 with a very simple but innovative idea. Let's get planting the world's native tropical forests to not only help increase wildlife habitat but to help with the even larger more urgent problem of climate change. I am the founder and president of LRFF (don't know if my review will be eligible) and have watched this organization grow from this win/win idea to actually planting over 10,000 native trees in 2009. We are already on our way to planting at least 100% more in 2010.

Mosaic allows young people to do things that they may not ever have the opportunity to do, like college tours and meeting professionals in the arts. Mosaic as changed my daughter's life for the better for life.  (Jenia is totally motivated to be her best thanks to Mosaic). Jenia has always had an appreciation for the arts, playing the viola, cheerleading and dance lessons were her stepping stone before auditioning for Mosaic. With so many interest and distractions Mosaic gave her a foundation, direction, and the best opportunity ever!My husband and I are volunteers for just over a year I.

We love to go to there shows even before she got into Mosaic. Rick and his staff do a great job with these kids. Every time i tell people who have never been to one of there shows they are a must see in Detroit. The people tell me they can not be that good, i tell them see it for them self. After seeing a show they called me and say i was right, and they are going to make it a family tradition to see every show that Mosaic puts on. That is what makes Mosaic one of the best NON PROFITS  around. I can not wait until next season maybe i can find some others who have never been to a Mosaic show and show them what Detroit and young people are doing.

I have grown so much in my art and as a person being in mosaic, i love it there because its like my little island in the middle of everything hectic i know i have somewhere to go and do what i love. I remember last year we did a show called the Gospel at Colonus and i can still feel that powerful, powerful energy we had during that show and how i realized that i love performing and when your performing with people you love it makes it all the more better. It doesnt get any better than that and that feeling you cant copy, imitate, or duplicate. Its special. I get emotional thinking about it....Anyways if you havent noticed already i love mosaic, and i couldnt ask for anything thing more.....Honestly.

They enjoyed it so much one asked if she could sign up for an acting class, saying she wanted to do a show someday just like theirs! It made me a fav Auntie for the day and they asked to come back next year to see it again.

Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	67293		/users/profile/73550	Bishop	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	Mosaic literally changed my life. I actually couldn't get enough of it! I entered the company as a singer, never expecting that I would act or be a stage technician, but I did. I never thought I could act, yet in my 4th year, I played Benjamin Williams in 'Sing Jubilee' and my 5th year, I was a backstage technician for 'Crossing 8 Mile'. Mosaic gave me opportunities to really explore and 'pull out' gifts and talents that I didn't even know I had. The first time I flew on an airplane was with Mosaic! It shows you who you really are! They push you outside of your comfort zone and challenge and push you until you're tired and that's when they push you all the more. I'm more than thankful for my Mosaic experience and I consider them family! And, I am proud to call myself a Mosaic alum!

Mosaic empowers young people to reach for their full potential which can be carried over to adulthood.   I learned that there isn't room for mediocrity and whenever I'm committed to something be it a job, a performance, or school I should always give my all.  I will never forget my mosaic experience, it's a Gem in the city of Detroit.  Mosaic isn't just a typical theater program, but a life changing experience.
Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	67230		/users/profile/73480	Poohla711	Client Served	5	02/12/2011	I am a Mosaic alum (96-98).  Mosaic helped me to develop focus, a greater work ethic, and self esteem that I desperately needed at that time.  I credit my Mosaic experience with my success as an adult.  I was not a troubled youth by any means, but I don't think I realized my full potential until I joined Mosaic.  I don't work in the performing arts, but I still use the skills and traits that I learned in Mosaic to help me to be successful in my corporate job.  Whenever I'm having a bad day, I always remind myself to "focus up" and to accept "only the best, nothing less" from myself.Mosaic is a wonderful organization that has done so much for so many kids from different backgrounds.  I cherish the memories and lifelong friendships that I made over those two years.

Their qest, talent and ability to move an audience is unparalleled.  It is a pleasure to see  them, whether singing, dancing or acting.  These youg people project confidence and excellence.

I have worked in the field for 30 years.  I am a huge fan of MOSAIC.  They did not ask me to write this and i don't know anyone from MOSAIC personally.  I am always impressed when I see them.  Here's is some of what they have going for them: energy, enthusiasm, professionalism, creativity, respect for Detroit's musical heritage, teamwork, variety of repertoire and discipline. The last performance I saw was on a sunny day in Royal Oak during a fair this past summer.  They were an absolute delight.  The kids smile when they sing and you can tell they mean it.  They collaborated with a couple of dancers, adding visual variety to their show.  They always seem to be trying new things. I have seen them in concert, as well, and I saw them perform musical theater.  They are always great - there is an integrity and dignity about the way they perform that is deeply moving. As I mentioned, I am a professional in the field, but when I go to hear them, I am a fan.

The Mosaic Youth Theater has had an impact on my organizations work for over 10 years. The founder and Director, Rick Sperling is an active member of New Detroit's Cultural Exchange Network. The organization has lent their talent to help break down barriers in race relations by performing at our annual Concert of Colors, Multicultural Leadership Series graduation and more recently our youth summit, with a performance entitled "Speak for Yourself." Over 300 youth of different ethnicities were engaged to talk about racial stereotypes through this phenomenal performance. Not just a performance this show provided edutainment for the young people that attended.

Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	66347		/users/profile/72521	TheLei D.	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	For my three children and one exchange student, participating in Mosaic has been a life changing experience. and really that is the best way to explain it - an experience. My son, involved for 4 years, went from a self-conscious, talented introvert to a confident, talented, assertive, motivated individual. My daughter, involved for 3 years, gained training in technical theater that has given her a sense of accomplishment, and fostered, nurtured, and supported her leadership skills that have carried her into her graduate studies. My exchange daughter, of one year from Hong Kong, had experiences and friendships through Mosaic she may never have gotten otherwise. My youngest daughter has been exposed to Mosaic through her brother's joining into post high school volunteering. Her own personal 3 years included office and summer internships. The years of supporting my childrens' involvement has led to my own personal relationship with Mosaic youth Theater of Detroit.  While focusing on each person's talent, helping them explore other talents, pushing them to respect themselves and others, and maintain educational excellence, this company gives each member a sense of acceptance, belonging, family, and lifelong relationships.

To see young artists come together and grow in their craft and with their community is truly beautiful. MOSAIC gives hope and opportunity to kids inspired by the arts. Sadly art programs usually are the first to fall victim to budget cuts in the majority of school. MOSAIC is truly and amazing organization.

I am a mother of three young children, and I have been taking them to Mosaic's productions since they could sit still, or at least try to contain themselves in the midst of the excitement!  Mosaic provides me with a way to give my kids positive and dynamic role models.  It gives me a way to inspire my children to achieve all they desire by seeing other young people doing it!  I am so happy to have access to this group's efforts and hope it is around when my kids are old enough to participate as members.  Until then, we'll gladly be part of the audience!
Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	64573		/users/profile/70610	Charles S.	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	Mosaic is more than an organization.  It is by definition an "experience" composed of a combination of diverse elements (youth).  The Mosaic experience, unlike any other cultivates the attributes and talents of its members and fuels their passion for the arts.  Unlike most of our secondary educational institutions where funding has been eliminated or seriously decreased, Mosaic remains a bastion for the arts.  I continue to remain in awe of the commitment by Mr. Sperling and Mosaic staff to maintain this excellent program.  I encourage everyone to dig deep to ensure that this wonderful program continues to provide the invaluable service to the youth, our community, and our world. 
Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	64523		/users/profile/70550	kcrafton	Client Served	5	02/07/2011	Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit has worked with the Head Start program with which I am employed for three years.  The staff and youth participants of Mosaic have planned and implemented a series of interactive workshops for the older siblings of Head Start children and their parents. Mosaic was sensitive and responsive to our needs in developing the workshops for an ethnically and linguistically diverse group of parents and youth. I was very impressed by Mosaic staff's efforts to understand the HighScope approach to early childhood education.  Significant teaching strategies relevant to HighScope were embedded in the workshop activities that were utilized with Head Start families. Staff were flexible in modifying and individualizing their approach to workshop facilitation to make the experience relevant to youth and parents.  They were respectful of Head Start participants who were limited in their verbal English language skills.  I witnessed parents who began the series interacting only through smiles and conclude the series by verbally expressing their personal feelings and perspectives with confidence to the total group of participants. Mosaic conducted workshops that "brought out" youth.  Parents reported that they witnessed their son or daughter grow and mature as a result of their experience with Mosaic.  Youth who began the series very hesitant to speak up in a group went on to participate in leading roles in their school plays and stage productions.  For many of our Head Start youth, the Mosaic experience was life changing. Mosaic's youthful singing and acting troupe members that participated in the workshop series acted as positive role models for Head Start youth.  Several of the Head Start youth pursued involvement in Mosaic following the conclusion of the workshop series. It is apparent that Mosaic is committed to its mission to empower young people to maximize their potential.  I witnessed their tireless pursuit to maximize the development of Head Start youth.

Whenever Mosaic visited my school, the connection and admiration of the students was palpable - they were not only galvanized by the entertainment level of the group but by the modeled discipline and comraderie that were impliciat and explicit. This organization is free to its participants so many at risk students were able to audition, join and learn professionlism through theater. Mosaic's rate of participants who complete high school is astonishing given the statistics for Detroit. On a personal level, my own daughters became part of Mosaic and I can truthfully say, the organization changed and shaped thier lives.

I had high expections going in, having seen Mosaic's outstanding teen performers at 2 other venues; yet the summer program still exceeded my expectations.During the program, my daughter was excited every day to learn the beginnings of ensemble performance and eargerly shared her experience daily. In only 3 weeks she and her camp mates put on a wonderful play to exhibit what they had learned.  The staff was patient, concerned, interactive, engaging, supportive and well-trained on the needs of their youngest level participants.

She has come out of her shell and has learned her value as an individual in society.  MOSAIC teaches young artists the importance of giving back to the community through performances at nursing homes, youth lock ups, etc.  All of the shows are full of energy, fun, precision, and competence.  The kids must have an academic standing of 3.2 GPA or above and regular attendance in rehearsals.  These things teach responsibility.  At least one young person take Detroit public transportation to and from which displays a great degree of desire to be a part of something larger than himself.  Great all around organization for youth to teach them about life through the arts.

They are exposed to the arts and grounded in work ethic. I have been to their performances and they are phenomenal. It is a program that works. It needs to be duplicated throughout the country. It also needs to be duplicated in other fields of the arts in the Detroit area since there are so many talented youths here with little to do. I gave to this organization because I am a resident of Detroit and I am very much vested in these future leaders.

A few examples:Motown "Now That I Can Dance"--the audience was literally dancing in their seats--great story well told by great performances--the singing was just awesome--saw it twice!Fisk Jubilee Singers--exquisite singing--still makes me shiver to think of the talent in that --it was a truly transcendent moment to hear the singing and learn about the Singers' storyMagnificat--the audience was mesmerized and jumping and shouting all at once hearing the great, great gospel musicWoodward Wonderland--great memories well told by kids too young to remember much of the wonderful Detroit memories! This group is an outstanding example of what is exactly right with Detroit. It's mission of creating a safe, nurturing place for Detroit area teens to develop their talent and be held to high standards is absolutely spot on. There's so much talent in this town and this is exactly the outlet it needs now that music in DPS is no longer the priority it was long ago.    
Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit	63457		/users/profile/69380	mystee	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	Mosaic Youth Theater is an awesome program. I've had two youngsters to go through the program. It has helped them to develop more confidence in themselves and their ability to deal with everyday life functions. They have both become leaders in any group that they become active with. Mosaic pushes students towards excellence in both academics as well as social events. As a result of my kids being a part of Mosaic they take on challenges and new adventures with a sense of great accomplishment and competitiveness. The training that Mosaic provides for the young artist free of cost is first rate. Mosaic takes you from your starting point and by the end of the year you are performing almost at a professional level again free of cost. Both of my kids enjoyed being apart of Mosaic but wanted to kind of be low keyed. The directors saw leadership  potential  in  both of them and pushed them both into leadership roles.   I also like the idea that the artist are also exposed to college tours to help them in their college aspirations. The parent group is great. We enjoyed getting together to do additional things to help out children and to also let them know that we too have an invested interest in the program. Mr. Rick Sperling made us feel at home and allowed parents to support the program with fundraisers, potluck dinners and cookouts. I truly felt as the youngsters felt that this was out "extended family". I really hope that Mosaic Youth Theater continues to get the financial support from corporate sponsors so that other Metropolitan youth can have a positive role model as my kids have experienced.

Even though I am no longer in the company, I try to stay in touch with as many people as possible. When I was in the company, I learned so much about the demands of being an actor: you will constantly be auditioning, performing and receiving candid and realistic criticism from people around you. Mosaic gives you that REAL experience! I have been involved in numerous acting classes, workshops, casting calls--but none of them can compare to the demands of Mosaic. We not only learn but we do, we perform. I am so very grateful that this organization is provided to the youth in the Detroit area. Mosaic is very unyielding on all of its young artists, its not some typical after-school drama club, it is a youth developmental organization, through the arts. Mosaic not only prepares you for life as an actor or a singer, be also life itself. I have recommended this organization to numerous people and when they receive the Mosaic experience--its truly life changing.

The level of professionalism and discipline achieved by the children and young adults who participate in this program is truly astounding, and we are constantly amazed by the standards of excellence that are consistently and successfully demanded of them by the directors and staff.

It has helped my family in so many ways. Such as help with Christmas gifts for my children, food baskets at holiday time and clothing throughout the year to help meet basic needs.

Associated Charities of Lenawee County	312914		/users/profile/214346	KayRoss	Board Member	5	10/21/2016	Associated Charities is there for the community when needed.  There have been several instances that I have had to call on them to help out persons in dire need of winter coats and they have always said YES, send them over!  It didn't matter that these individuals were not registered clients of AC.  They were helped anyway.  That is what community is all about....helping those that need it...without judgment...that's my experience with Associated Charities.
Associated Charities of Lenawee County	255902		/users/profile/214346	KayRoss	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	Associated Charities is the only organization in our county that does not charge for their services.  They support the community in several ways but one that most people may not be aware of is that we strongly encourage collaboration between other agencies in the community, thus reducing duplication of services. This also helps to ensure more people are served.   As all agencies know, funding is difficult and any way we can work together for the good of everyone is a win win situation.   This is an organization I am proud to be a part of and encourage everyone to check them out.
Associated Charities of Lenawee County	206119		/users/profile/214346	KayRoss	Board Member	5	07/15/2014	Associated Charities is one of the few Charities that do not require the customer to purchase anything.  All items that AC distributes is free.  It is also comforting to know that if someone in our community has a crisis, like a fire etc., they can count on the Charities to help them out in the short term.  They are totally dependent on the generosity of the community for their funding.
Associated Charities of Lenawee County	161598		/users/profile/214346	KayRoss	Board Member	5	06/27/2013	I joined the Associated Charities Board because I liked the idea of giving without cost.  We already have organizations in our community that people can donate to in which they then sell the product at a great savings, thus making money for their program to support itself.  Associated Charities gives everything they get for nothing.   I know there are times when parents have to make a choice to  purchase shoes or clothing for their children or feed them dinner.  This is also true for senior citizens.   They can go to the Charities and get what they need and not worry about how they are going to pay for it.  Each new school year children get new clothes, backpacks, school supplies, at no cost to the family.  At Christmas time parents get food baskets and gifts for their children. When I'm there, everyone is treated with respect and dignity.  It makes me feel good knowing that, in a very small way, I'm helping others to have a better standard of life.

When I got out I felt like a complete failure until Work First hooked me up with Associated Charities to work for the cash money I received every month and when that ended they let me stay on to work off my court fines.  I like to help the holiday season so much joy when they see what they get for there children.  A lot of work goes into keeping this place going that people just don't see.
Associated Charities of Lenawee County	154488		/users/profile/205321	Tricia E.	Client Served	5	04/12/2013	I came to learn about the ACLC through Michigan Work First program.  I had never been here before and I am just amazed at what this charity does for our county.  Everything that goes out the door is free to qualified clients, which I also learned that I am.  They have provided me and my family with much needed clothing, food, and household items.  One year ago I never thought I would be in this position but I am so greatful that Associated Charities of Lenawee is around.  I enjoy working with all of my co workers there as well.  It's nice knowing I am going to a job that makes me feel like I am making a difference in this community.

Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	In December 2014 after retiring from a medical career of 39 years I walked into ACLC with the idea of "Giving Back". I began volunteering in January 2015 and look forward every week to spending Wednesday working with the the dedicated employees and volunteers at Associated Charities.  What we do for the community and those in need is SO important. To Delight,  Jean,  Michelle, Ricardo,  Ashley,  JoAnn and all of the others that I work with at ACLC, I am so proud to be a part of an organization that gives from the heart and treats every donor and recipient with gratitude, respect and dignity.
Associated Charities of Lenawee County	257843		/users/profile/346313	jo2014	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	I currently volunteer at Associated Charities. The reason I first came here was because, after much research, this was the only place that did not charge less fortunate people for the things they need to live everyday.  After being here almost a year, I found they are so much more than I thought.  The director, Delight, is the most caring person I have ever worked  for.  And the people I work with are the kindest people I have ever meet.  Everyone goes beyond what is ask of them.What they do for people is unbelievable. They have birthday gifts for the children, school clothes and supplies for back to school, baby gifts for newborns, coats and blankets to keep them warm and so much more.I plan to keep volunteering as long as possible and am thankful I found this place. A smile from our clients makes it all worthwhile.I'd also like to thank all the people who donate.  Without them they could not help as many people as they do.

I frequently volunteer for special distribution days and witness first-hand the way clients are treated with respect and dignity.  Each year our generous community seems to contribute more and higher quality items that low-income families can choose at no cost.  Along with the daily distribution, Associated Charities provides warm clothing for winter, Thanksgiving food baskets, Christmas gifts and back-to-school items.

Associated Charities of Lenawee County	256083		/users/profile/344474	srae	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	I was asked to be on the board last year and I have been more impressed knowing the inner workings of this organization than I even was with all the incredible things they did for me as a community member! I kept me connected with ACLC through both church and work. ACLC was instrumental in the Christmas Connection where they partnered with our local church to distribute over 250 filled Christmas stockings to local children. ACLC also partnered with a college student driven group to provide 25 children the first year, and 50 children this past year with $50 dollars worth of a special Christmas morning! This is a fantastic organization helping those in need in the local community through fulfilling some of the basic human needs and  provisions as well as their welcoming spirit, love and caring for so many people  that come through their doors!

Associated Charities of Lenawee County	217331		/users/profile/280855	Hezz	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	On a Sunday afternoon I had a woman and her two children approach me.  She and the girls and her husband were living out of their car, as money had run out and they no longer had a home or could afford a hotel.The Tecumseh Service Club was the first place I thought to call.  I know they provide food through a pantry, as well as financial help for those dealing with hard times.  Within 4 hours they had a hotel room for the woman and her family for the night, as well as a warm meal for everyone provided by Big Boy of Tecumseh.  In addition, they were able to provide the woman with additional resources where she could turn to for help. Considering this organization is completely run by volunteers and relies on the prompt reply of individuals from their homes I was very impressed.

I had very good used clothes and household items and they were treated with respect and not just thrown in a pile.  I had taken the time to clean them and iron them so that anyone receiving them would not have to worry about not using them right away.  The people are sincere and honest in their positions and the people that they serve do not feel that they are receiving charity.  The best part?  Anyone in need can receive what they need without cost.  A truly worthy organization worth supporting.

Their work is rather diverse, but one thing it all shares in common is the potential it has for encouraging a sense of personal dignity for their clients. This is, hands down, the thing I most admire about the organization. I also deeply appreciate how they go about their work, keeping overhead costs as low as possible to ensure that more proceeds go directly to benefiting their clients, and striving to collaborate with other local charities and not-for-profit organizations to reach the greatest number of people in need in our community.

Baldwin Center is like a family whether your employed here, a volunteer or are enrolled into their services/programs they treat you with the up most respect.  Not only am I  an intern here, I am also a parent who's child is involved in the summer program.  The summer program is a wonderful program that encourages, teaches, and empowers the kids involved.  It gives the parent and the kids a feeling of safety.  I have came to be a person that will tell anyone who will listen the great things that Baldwin Center offers and their contributions to the Pontiac area.  This is a program that should be duplicated in different cities.  If anyone has the time or the passion to make a change or make someone or themselves feel good Baldwin Center is the place to volunteer.  Also the food in the soup kitchen is wonderful.

In my time with the Baldwin Center I've done everything from going on bike rides with the youth to delivering food to the elderly to working in the gardens with developmentally challenged young adults. Its incredible how many and how varied the Baldwin Center's programs are.
Baldwin Center Inc	116050		/users/profile/158018	jere344	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	I have volunteered here numerous times and have been pleasantly met with kindness and lots of opportunity. The goal of the  staff at Baldwin Center is to create a positive environment and serve the people of Pontiac.

Baldwin Center Inc	115857	1	/users/profile/157771	Jennifer109	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/20/2012	I've worked with the staff at the Baldwin Center on a wide variety of initiatives including increasing the amount of physical activity the kids get in the after school and summer programs, improving the healthfulness of the foods served to families,and  increasing opportunities for physical activity in adults.   The Baldwin Center staff are some of the most dedicated and caring individuals I've met, and they know how to get things done effectively and efficiently to meet the needs of the community.  Their collaborations with other organizations in the community and Oakland University allow them to utilize resources and expertise to continuously improve their service to the families of Pontiac.  If you've got an idea, they're always willing to listen.  
Baldwin Center Inc	115571		/users/profile/157380	Sarah65	Volunteer	5	06/17/2012	The Baldwin Center focuses on the grassroots needs of Pontiac. Their comprehensive services and programs are designed to assist individuals of all ages. I have enjoyed working with the clients and learning about the Pontiac community. The staff and volunteers are caring, warm and compassionate people, and I look forward to working with them again. Keep up the great work !
Baldwin Center Inc	113894		/users/profile/154979	Michiganfan	Volunteer	5	06/05/2012	I'm a volunteer with the after-school physical activity program and have had the best experience!  The staff is terrific and very engaging to get the children active and participate in enrichment, academic and recreational activities.  I think the best thing that I have witnessed during the past year at the Baldwin Center is the relationships that the staff and volunteers have with the children.  The Baldwin Center provides a safe, friendly and loving environment for at-risk children living in poverty.

The  services and staff are invaluable to the people who need help, and, I believe that they are also invaluable to the people who volunteer. Sometimes hearts are healed by helping as much as by being helped. I love going to Baldwin and helping, everyone should have this experience.
Baldwin Center Inc	101532		/users/profile/130022	junior9713	Volunteer	5	12/02/2011	I went to the baldwin soup kitchen with my highschool- Avondale highschool. I helped pour the kool-aid into the people's cup that came into the soup for food and just to get out of the cold that day. Some ways that i made the people there feel comfortable was by them this about my school and what sports i play and just having a general conversation with them this made me feel happy and proud of myselof to see myself helping those who are in need. When i served them i called them mam and sir.Then said would you like some kool-aid. They responded yes. But there while i was in the soup kitchen people gave me complients on how in was doing they really liked my smile. They even asked me to comeback one day again. I really hope that i could get to see those people again to greet them and make their day with my smile and making laugh. It was a really good example of community service

Baldwin Center Inc	101229		/users/profile/128968	Jamie Jolicoeur	Volunteer	5	11/29/2011	I was looking for an organization in my area that I could volunteer at on a regular basis.  I went to a volunteer orientation meeting and was able to start volunteering that same week!  The Baldwin Center fills so many needs in the city of Pontiac.  No matter what you are interested in there is a way to help at the Baldwin center.  I currently have been helping in the office.  I get to hear and see how many people are helped by this organization.  The staff is very friendly and easy to work with.

Baldwin Center Inc	100911	1	/users/profile/125490	tallsrx	Volunteer	5	11/21/2011	I had been in search of a non-profit organization to volunteer my spare time to.  Fortunately, through work connections, I was able to learn about the Baldwin Center.  However, listening to a description of it doesn't do justice to what it feels like when you actually go see it and help.  That's when you truly understand the meaning and can't help but want to join in the effort to feed, clothe, and empower people.  The Baldwin Center is unique in that it not only helps those in need immediately, but is trying to help the youth avoid the notion that their current condition is the only situation they are capable of in the future.  Not every non-profit out there provides a free meal, and offers tutoring and after school activities to the youth.  How many non-profits are going "GREEN" and teaching gardening skills?  How many non-profits have a play room for the kids and teach arts and crafts?  Many people would stop at doing any one of these, yet the Baldwin Center is attempting to empower people who feel that they have absolutely nothing left with the skills and the tools to help them change their current situation.  The staff that works at the Baldwin Center explains it best.  When they give you a tour, they don't tell you where they need help or suggest what you can donate.  They walk you around, describe what their goals are, and tell you to keep an open mind and listen to your heart.  It's your heart that will tell you what difference you can make.  After spending just a few minutes in this facility, you cannot help but humbly "hear" what you can do.
Baldwin Center Inc	100775		/users/profile/124610	dmconn1227	Volunteer	5	11/17/2011	 I have watched the Baldwin Center grow to a non-profit organization that is serving the entire Pontiac community. It always amazes me when I see the extent the staff will go to to assist the clients.  They have showers for the homeless, washers & dryers for clients to use.  The Baldwin Center is there for those in need, whether its the clothes closet, or kids after school program, or assisting the abused or finding jobs and housing, etc. The Baldwin Center has activity from early morn until dusk.
Baldwin Center Inc	100770		/users/profile/124591	mblas	Volunteer	5	11/17/2011	I loved helping out the Baldwin Center! It is a place that helps the city of Pontiac so much, they Feed, Clothe, Educate and Empower the community. Helping out is a very important thing in my life, I feel that I have a commitment to help out even in the smallest way possible, because at  one point in our lives we have all needed someone's help and expected someone to be there for us. Helping the Baldwin Center just made me feel good, that my small contribution will help hundreds of families. :)
Baldwin Center Inc	100736		/users/profile/124414	BaldwinSupporter	Board Member	5	11/17/2011	The Baldwin Center is a wonderful resource in Pontiac, Michigan offering hope to those who need a little help. It is a place that welcomes people who need a warm meal, a warm coat, or a warm smile. Through the educational programs adults are earning their GED and children are beginning their education with added support from teachers at the center.
Baldwin Center Inc	100682	1	/users/profile/124010	rathmj	Donor	4	11/15/2011	Have been donating to this center for years - always very professional and friendly.  Always willing to tell you what the center is about, how you can help, where their greatest needs are, and up to date statistics about how they are making the community better.  Great teaching experience for the kids.  Baldwin staff was always willing to help unload our vehicles and show us how we were making a difference too. Baldwin made us feel very welcome, every time.

Their care & concern is felt by their clients & volunteers alike!   I once heard through a very casual conversation of a need for new socks simply so their clients would have a clean pair to put on their feet after they'd showered.  How APPRECIATIVE & PLEASED were the clients & stafffs to have recieved SOCKS, yes SOCKS!!!  (Little things CAN make a BIG difference!   I LOVE SERVING WITH THEIR TEAM AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY!!!  :  )    THANK YOU, BALDWIN CENTER!!!

I have heard of people getting help there numerous times in the past and it has always been a feel good stroy. Now I always turn to them when I know of somebody who has clothes to donate. Making sure the clothes get to the baldwin center asures me that they will be put to good use. The only thing I think they could do more of is make sure that more people were aware of the services they offer and how easy it is to get involved.
Baldwin Center Inc	87826		/users/profile/98606	Tiffany S.	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	The Baldwin Center is fabulous to work with. Volunteers are able to engage directly with the community through the soup kitchen, clothes closet and After School program. Volunteers also work in the office to help members of the community receive various resources from funding for eviction notification and utility shut off to assisting mothers to receive baby formula to engaging other people in volunteerism at the organization. I have personally volunteered to facilitate the After School Volunteer orientation, volunteered in the After School program, volunteered in the office to assist (by pre-screening via telephone) families with eviction notifications and utility shut offs. I've also recruited other community members to volunteer and have planned national days of service projects with the Baldwin Center.

I have seen first hand the commitment, compassion and dedication the Baldwin staff and its volunteers give to their clientele.  The Baldwin Center is more then a place where people can get three meals a day, counseling and financial assistance; but rather a place where people come to learn the skills to empower themselves to make a difference in their lives.
Baldwin Center Inc	57634		/users/profile/60985	BIDK	Board Member	5	11/22/2010	I am highly impressed at the number of services Baldwin Center provides for those who are under-served in the community of Pontiac, MI.Adults enjoy ESL and fitness classes.  They receive emergency funding when monies are available.  And, the homeless are provided opportunity to have showers, birthday gifts, layettes for new babies, and clothing from Baldwin's Clothing Closet.  Youth receive tutoring, day camp, trips, back-to-school backpacks, and special events among many educational and fun programs.  We have a connection with Oakland University that gives them vision into the future and hope for success.Meals are served to hundreds of people daily.  Lunches and breakfasts are hearty and generous.  Almost all programs on site include a meal.  Baldwin enjoys the services of thousands of volunteers from all walks of life.  When I retired two years ago, I left my heart with the people on staff and especially those we served.

I found myself in a situation with no money and bills waiting to pile up. This organization helped me when I needed it the most, not only did they help me, but within an hour of talking to an associate, I had enough money in my hand ready to pay my bills. Honestly, there are no words I can think of that would truly explain how greatful I am that this organization exist!

Homeless broke and left out to dry an Angel came into my life her name is Lynn and not even 24 hours later a huge weight was lifted and worries were gone! I really cannot give enough thanks to her and the fallen and wounded soldier fund! Only if our government was run by the fallen and wounded soldier fund only then our military branches would ever see how our veterans would actually now how they are appreciated and I could almost guarantee that the most awful number know to veterans would not be 22! Because they would know that someone is always there for them for what ever issue they might be trying to get though! God bless Lynn and The Fallen and Wounded Soldier Fund

I was deployed twice Irag 2007-2008, and Afghanistan 2010-2011. During those two combat deployments I got injured and hurt. Once I got out the Army in 2012. I filed my VA claim and it's now 2016. I haven't got anything yet from the VA. During my years being out of the Military. For the past couple of years this great organization, has been helping myself and my family out.

This is a wonderful organization who helps out a lot of wounded veterans. Before I asked Lynn for help, I asked the Wounded Warrior Project for help. Do you know what I got? Nothing they said they couldn't help me. So once again on behalf of my family and I. I would like to say again thank you!!!!!

I was medi-vaced from Afghanistan in 2012 where I ended up at Fort Knox.  My family lived in Michigan.  It was a 7 hour drive for my family to visit me.  My wife was still working and her income was very important to our financial situation.  Because I was from the National Guard, we were unable to get support from the Army to help my family move down to Fort Knox to help take care of me after surgery.  The Fallen and Wounded Soldiers Fund stepped up and helped my family with the move.  I had spent 21 months at Fort Knox.  The 6 months with my family was the best thing that could happen.  I was able to spend time with my daughter who was starting kindergarten.  I missed nearly 3 years of my daughters life.  The 6 months was a true blessing and only made possible by the Fallen and Wounded Soldiers Fund.
The Fallen & Wounded Soldiers Fund Inc	21122	3	/users/profile/22229	Richard Asztalos	Volunteer	5	11/01/2009	The primary purpose of the Fallen and Wounded Soldiers Fund (FWSF) is to help those veterans in Michigan who return from the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns and find themselves in need of support and assistance.  The FWSF is an all-volunteer organization, its members a diverse collection of concerned people from the business and private sectors. Since mid-2006 when the FWSF starting distributing funds to individual soldiers families, a lot has occurred.  The countrys view of these wars has changed and the fervor over fighting terrorism has diminished.  However, the needs of our soldiers have not dissipated, but have, in fact, increased.Over time we have seen the needs change from funds for travel of family members to the injured soldier, to addressing more basic needs of those who have been discharged, even down to the level of providing food for their families. When reviewing the individuals who have received grants from FWSF, it is telling that all are enlisted men who find themselves in tough financial straits.  Often times, what they need is help on the rent and other essential expenses, such as medical supplies.

Centro Multicultural La Familia Inc	183762	2	/users/profile/240673	brh0214	Board Member	5	10/28/2013	I have been a Board Member of Centro Multicultural La Familia (CMLF) since it began.  During that time, I have greatly enjoyed working with Dr. Acosta and her staff.  I first met Dr. Acosta in 1998 and recognized immediately that she is committed to serving the residents of Pontiac and surrounding communities. She and her staff provide a number of services in a friendly customer-focused environment.  This quality based service delivery system was developed by Dr. Acosta and the agency leadership.  They lead by example which is very effective in teaching the principles of quality customer service.  The major goal of CMLF is the service of all races and cultures in the area.  To make this happen, Dr. Acosta has assembled highly qualified employees that are fluent in English, Spanish, and other languages represented in this area. It is difficult to imagine the impact CMLF could have on social problems such as domestic violence, unemployment, infant mortality, and others.  However, due to a sagging economy, grants and donations have diminished slowing the agencys ability to address all of these social problems.  Yet, you can be assured that, CMLF will continue to provide a high degree of services to the public.

I cannot say enough to describe the dedication and passion that everyone who works there have for the people they serve.   The leadership that Dr. Sonia Acosta and Debra Ehrmann demonstrate is commendable.  CMLF is very crucial and valuable to the community  of which many  are underserved.  The organization is very active and involved in reaching out to many that are in need of help.  Their sympathetic, friendly and supportive approach not only educates but empowers the people they serve. I was very fortunate to have worked for such a great organization.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	319393		/users/profile/410846	MelaniaB	Volunteer	5	11/23/2016	I have had the best experience and it really matters as to how much you put into it yourself . Homefront Hugs reminds you that there are many ways to help no matter what you believe or your politics and everyone is included . There are several people who are upset because they could not choose the  religion of their soldier or did not like the inclusive nature . No one makes a penny . They are the real deal and took a break from their 501-3c because they needed one to mourn several losses in their family . They should have it by early 2017.But don't donate for postage or to help if it bothers you - look at all the ridiculous salaries though at other charities and overhead .This military family has no overhead - pays for supplies and overhead themselves and really cares . They brag about us as volunteers when they do so much themselves when no one helps when it's not the holidays . We have adopted 4x and love their work . We are friends still with some of our troops and it made our kids feel great giving back ! Remember the reason for the season and know this is a homegrown real org that is the real deal - supporting our troops,military families and wounded vets and every community with needs so you can give back helping anywhere as a teen and still be called a Homefront Hugs volunteer as long as you are giving thanks for your freedoms . Check out their Kids Page or Operations healing Angel ! And the CEO is so accessible - when does that happen these days ?! She does all the assignments herself and emails due to security and once she can hire staff she gets a break . She is disabled herself but hardly talks about it . I love Homefront Hugs! We need to unite more and stop all the complaining ...life is too short !  Email her President@HomefrontHugs.org 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	307522	4	/users/profile/398864	sara999	Volunteer	1	10/02/2016	This organization is poorly organized.  If you sign up to sponsor a soldier, you are given terms of commitment.  The organization bears none.  They get to applications on their own schedule and expect that you begin your sponsorship as soon as they ask.  The communications are mainly pleas for donations because they will be short in meeting their numbers.  The communications state  that no salaries are given and yet lacking any financial transparency there is no accountability for the funds that have been donated..  You will just have to take their word for it.  At one point, the organization was running a dual donation drive to include a moving and other expenses for the headquarters which also happened to be the directors home.  Financial conflict of interest.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	300378	1	/users/profile/391234	HomefrontHugsFan	Client Served	5	08/12/2016	I am a military spouse who can tell you that they are applying again for their non-profit now after taking time to deal with a tragedy and death  with their own family veteran . Family first and the son had a very tough time dealing with his father's death .  Yet they still continued missions including helping my husband and his whole team while deployed and me and my kids ! For 15 years almost they have been there for others and not making one dime for themselves . That's dedication! That's patriotism.  Thank you Homefront  Hugs USA . Thank you Alessandra Kellermann and son . You are heroes too . You helped me keep the faith and are always there for anyone in the military hurting . 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	294375	5	/users/profile/385112	Factcheck	General Member of the Public	1	06/30/2016	This "nonprofit" has lost it's non-profit status and failed to even file IRS forms and 990s for many years. DISGRACEFUL!It says so right on the main page here. But they are still soliciting funds from the public including television stations like CNN! In exchange for promotion. WHERE ARE THE FINANCIALS OF MONIES SPENT?? THEY ARE NOT ON THEIR WEBSITE.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	284433	1	/users/profile/374478	ElizabethN.	Volunteer	5	04/02/2016	I spent almost two years overseas. During this time I wanted to find support for the Soldiers in order to boost morale. I found Homefront Hugs online. When I spoke to Allesandra I could hardly believe people like her still existed. Not only did she take care of my Soldiers, she sent items to my son, mom and sister. Families adopted the three and continued to provide support until my return. Homefront Hugs provided an all expense paid trip to New York for my sister to say "thank you" as she was the primary caregiver for my son. I am eternally grateful to the organization, owner and her son. 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280646	4	/users/profile/370577	Ahess123	Donor	5	02/21/2016	Homefront Hugs USA Inc. is an outstanding organization for supporting our nation's troops and veterans.   The leader of this organization is a former military spouse raising a USAF dependent who lost his father to brain cancer.  She  founded this organization and has been volunteering her time and efforts for the last 15 years  to be an actual DOER of supporting our  military veterans and active-duty troops.   As a retired senior NCO,  I  personally donate to this organization and highly recommend you consider partnering with Homefront Hugs USA Inc.  so that they can continue their mission of #SOT and #SOV.  Thanks for all you do Alessandra and Ed!  
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280487	1	/users/profile/370378	homemama	Volunteer	5	02/18/2016	My family and I have enjoyed volunteering with Homefront Hugs over the past 8+ years.  There are so many different ways to bless service members and show our gratitude for the work they do.  Through having the kids help make cards, my older boys helping greet a returning "honor flight" full of WWII veterans, to making donations to help send care packages, there was always a way to help that fit our hectic and busy homeschool lifestyle at the time.  We know Alessandra personally, and are so impressed with how all donations go directly to getting the care packages shipped off to various destinations around the world.  It is her heart to see that no service member, or their families home-side, feel forgotten, and we are happy to come alongside Alessandra and help with this mission as we are able to.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280442	1	/users/profile/370320	Meghubb	Volunteer	5	02/17/2016	Homefront Hugs is hands down one the best nonprofit org's I've ever had the pleasure of working with! Their devotion to OUR troops is absolutely unmatched. When an orginazation is failing at their goal I will absolutely review it on social media. This is not the case with Homefront Hugs. I have donated many times to them & will continue to do so! They are angels! Thank you for doing so damn much for our troops Homefront Hugs!
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280410	1	/users/profile/370281	ljoneil63	Volunteer	5	02/17/2016	I have been with Homefront Hugs for quite awhile. It has been a life changing experience for me and I have made some lifelong friends. The wonderful lady who runs the organization works tirelessly to make sure that everyone is supported, and she is always available to answer any questions. I believe that working with Homefront Hugs has helped me as much as it has helped the hard working soldiers (and families) that I have supported. This is the least that we can do for the men and women who work so hard and unselfishly for our country. I am sharing a photo of the last family that I sponsored (with their permission, of course) when Dad returned home and surprised them! I plan to stay with Homefront Hugs for a very long time!
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280405		/users/profile/370275	Jess008	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2016	I am not a soldier fighting overseas to keep Americans and our allies safe. I am not a wounded warrior in need of support, comfort and healing. But if I was, I would want to know that Homefront Hugs was there for me. In a world suffering from a deficit of kindness, this organization shines as an example of how we should be. I am grateful that Homefront Hugs is there, looking out for our warriors, finding ways to make them feel loved and valued. It makes the world just a little bit better for all of us.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280403		/users/profile/370273	amyshah	Volunteer	5	02/17/2016	I was the co-founder of the Homefront Hugs Club at my high school. As I graduated and now in college, I realized I didn't want to stop being a volunteer for Homefront Hugs. That's when I became the University of Michigan ambassador for Homefront Hugs. I have been bringing clubs and people around campus together who are interested in helping the local Veterans. we have gone up to the VA Hospital to help out at Bingo Nights too. This is a great organization and I can't wait for more people to start what I have.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280390		/users/profile/370256	Paul716	Volunteer	5	02/16/2016	My wife and I have been volunteering with Homefront Hugs for over a year and have adopted 3 different deployed troops, as well as donated additional funds as we could for postage for other care packages sent out regularly by Homefront Hugs. The troops, and their teammates downrange, have been tremendously appreciative of everything we've sent, not only for the contents of the packages, but also for the concrete demonstration that somebody back in the Homeland knows something about their situation and cares about them. The letters and emails we've exchanged have been as important, if not more so, than the care packages themselves. Alessandra Kellerman, who is the energetic force behind Homefront Hugs, has consistently been the soul of kindness, respect, consideration and compassion toward us and the troops. She is a wonderful example of unselfish love expressed in action and has been a constant joy to work with. We shall continue to volunteer for this outstanding organization as long as there are troops downrange, or wounded anywhere that we can benefit.  Rock on Alessandra! Well done!  Friend, if you're reading this review and thinking about volunteering, do yourself a favor and sign up today. You won't regret it. 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	280109	1	/users/profile/369979	TeacherPride	Volunteer	5	02/13/2016	I have volunteered with Homefront Hugs for 13 years now and they are amazing!  It is unfortunate that some volunteers who broke confidentiality and other standards and had to be let go - then decided to bash the organization . It only hurts the troops and veterans in need . This is a stellar group that has never taken a penny for themselves. I have enjoyed my children's involvement and my own as a teacher adopting troops . Thank you for the experience and Alessandra is always available for support . 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	276385	5	/users/profile/366148	Writer	Volunteer	1	01/12/2016	After I adopted my soldier, I was contacted by Alessandra (owner and operator), who demanded I forward her all the emails I received from my soldier because my soldier was not responding to Alessandra's emails. Feeling threatened by her, I forwarded her only 1 of those emails. It was a huge violation of my soldier's trust, and I highly regret it to this day. Later, I found she had put some of the information from that email on her website as if it was written to her by that soldier. Now that my soldier is no longer deployed, Alessandra has attempted to intimidate me to receive my soldier's home address and phone number which she wrongly believes I have. She has used methods such as name-calling and belittling to get what she wants from me. She has prematurely released the names of our deceased military both on FB and Twitter. (That is not the job of any nonprofit organization. That is the responsibility of the DoD.) She has a number of CrowdSource attempts to get people to pay for her home repairs, purchase her a new vehicle, etc., with attempts to pull on heart strings because she is the owner of HH. If you read her website, you'll find a huge push to donate money...with adoption as a side note. Wouldn't it make more sense to push adoptions so the responsibility of filling care packages and providing postage twice a month rests on the adoptive family rather than Alessandra? Please, I urge you to do research on the company you work with. I strongly recommend SoldiersAngels as they do exactly what HH does with adoptions but they are a much larger organization, wonderful to work with, kind, generous, and most importantly have a verified nonprofit status with 5-stars on GuideStar.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	273031	2	/users/profile/27987	homefrontgator	Volunteer	5	11/28/2015	My wife and I have participated with Homefront Hugs for many years. It performs an important and much appreciated service. We have adopted many people in the service, whose names we receive through HFH. There is a tremendous gratification from assisting deployed service people, who need a "hug" from home.  Conversely, the person in the service feels less alone while deployed far away. This happens because of the hard work and effort of HFH. We heartily recommend it.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	26951	2	/users/profile/27987	homefrontgator	Volunteer	5	02/03/2010	My wife and I have been a part of Homefront Hugs for about 7 years. Alessandra Kellermann, the founder, continues to give superhuman effort on behalf of our military and their families. Her organization has given unconditional support to these people at a time when it is sorely needed. We have received numerous e-mails and letters from soldiers we have adopted through the years, and know how much this support means to them. This gives us incentive to continue our efforts supporting the organization and our service people. We enthusiastically give Homefront Hugs a 5 star rating.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	273014	1	/users/profile/362195	marlee2	Volunteer	5	11/28/2015	I woule rate this nonprofit a TEN star if I could. I've been with  Allesandra and her son Eddie thru the years and find what they do for the military and their families extroadinary. I'm very proud to have signed up, I myself have been married to a veteran and have sent packages and letters to these men and women  overseas for years  just to put a smile on their faces and a little laughter maybe. It makes me feel good too.  Allesandra and her son have worked hard  on this nonprofit for our military  and their families and I'm proud to part of it.  It's  a fun thing to do and very rewarding.  Have your family join us or your organization....KIDS LOVE IT!!! get them off the computers and texting !!!! .....and the streets....USA USA USA!!!! Remember our troops they remember us.  All you need is a piece of paper and a stamp.  Homefront Hugs is #1 in my books!!!!
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	273008	1	/users/profile/362185	Writer	Donor	5	11/28/2015	I have been involved with HomeFrontHugs virtually since it's inception 14 years ago. In search of a charity to donate to where I knew every penny was going directly to sending care packages and taking care of deployed troops both mentally and physically, I knew immediately this was the kind of organization for which I was looking. The founder, Alessandra Kellermann and a dedicated group of volunteers, as well as her son, work tirelessly without pay or need for acknowledgement, and assure that FOB deployed know they are not forgotten. Her adopt a soldier campaign gives comfort, thoughts , and prayers to an untold number of troops. Having been involved in many military volunteer groups, HFH is by far my favorite as I can personally feel and see the impact it has on the lives of personnel, their husbands or wives, and their children. I could not recommend HFH more highly, and I could not be more proud of being part of an organization. If you are looking, this is what you're looking for. 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	237899	9	/users/profile/322859	Lisa429	Volunteer	1	02/11/2015	I signed up with this organization to help support our troops.Being disabled there's not a lot I can do.When I saw the chance to adopt a soldier I was so exited.Helping the soldier was so uplifting but the experience with this organization left me in tears.And Im left wondering why I was treated so badly.Being new to this I had questions and recieved no responses. Then was told it was my fault.Even the soldier I adopted apologized about it and felt badly for me because I had to explain to him why I was no longer with HFH.The concept is great,but very disappointed and upset.I would  think that when someone volunteers with an organization your efforts would be appreciated by that organization.I will never recommend Homefront Hugs and am now apprehensive of joining another.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	58855	2	/users/profile/63012	doreen	Volunteer	5	12/16/2010	I am proud to be a part of HFH.  I admire Ms. Kellermann for her passion for all military.  I feel connected to the soldiers I have adopted, as if they are my own.  My goal is to bring a smile to the soldiers that receive.  Such a miniture sacrafice on my part for those that sacrafice everything to keep me and mine safe from harm.  I am forever in their debt.  May GOD BLESS AND BE WITH THEM ALWAYS.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	58619	2	/users/profile/62585	Texas Angel	Volunteer	5	12/09/2010	I joined HFH a few yrs ago, and I am amazed at how much they do for so many. Not only do they support the soldiers who are deployed, they help the families that are still here. I love the fact that almost anyone can adopt a soldier and send their support and thanks. I had a soldier I adopted a few yrs back and around christmas time I sent him a battery operated christmas tree for him and his troop. I recieved an email from him and all the others telling me thank you, and It would be one of the best christmases they would have being away from home. Then not only that I got pictures from him with the tree, and the smile that was on his face said it all. I recomend joining Homefront Hugs because there is a personal satisfaction to it. Not only do you do your part to support the soldiers, you get to corespond with them and get to know them, you get feedback and thanks for your part. I use to give my money to charities that helped others, but the satisfaction was not there in know who I was helping, that is not the case with HFH.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	58616	2	/users/profile/62573	SailorsMom	Volunteer	5	12/08/2010	I joined Homefront Hugs 5 years ago. Right from the start I was touched by the absolute devotion shown by Alessandra to the service members and their families she has chosen to serve.  I have seen quite a few nonprofits run by grand-standers, who are more interested in getting their picture in front of the public than helping anybody except themselves.  Ali won't do anything of that sort.  However, if there is a chance of telling everybSody about her dream of helping, she will shout it from the rooftops. 
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	58602	1	/users/profile/62548	Cilliangoo	Volunteer	4	12/08/2010	HFH seeks to support our soldiers and their families by having the public send cards, letters, care packages, etc.  You can donate items to HFH to send to our soldiers or families, you can donate money to HFH for postage to get those care packages sent, you can send letters/cards/packages direct to HFH to distribute, or you can adopt your own soldier or their family.  Thanks to HomeFront Hugs, you have one centralized organization to give what support you can!  Especially when our troops sacrifice so much for us.  Check them out at homefronthugs.org and not only will you see their dedication, you'll want to help just like I did!
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	23909	10	/users/profile/12718	Homefront Hugs Adoptive Friend	Volunteer	5	12/13/2009	Homefront Hugs has been superb in their tasks in both sorrow and joy. Alessandra and crew are very quick to respond to any measure or task put before them.We have had a terrific experience over the last 7 months with every encounter.We currently have two adopted troops that are currently overseas. The rewards of the bonding between initial complete strangers has brought me and my family great joy.Our service members are so grateful for so little we give compared to what they are giving to us.Our hearts do get broken when we hear about the needs of our fallen, wounded, veteran troops and their families.Homefront Hugs reaches out to so many different aspects of military life we wish we could address them all. We suggest you get involved.If you would spare a few hours a month or even a few cards here and there it may just spark up your life in a way that you really can not put into words. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND assisting these folks.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10813	10	/users/profile/12718	Homefront Hugs Adoptive Friend	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I just started this adventure. I read a message board from the troops and decided to help out. The response from Homefront Hugs was very quick. I understand that there are many more troops that need adoption. If I could I would adopt them all. My family like many are really financially strapped yet it doesn't cost a whole lot to show you care.I suggest we do what we can to help out our troops. They sacrifice more then we can imagine.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	23840	8	/users/profile/24977	Journey	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	My experience with Homefront Hugs and Alessandra have been truly wonderful.  This organization helps so many people, all the time.  I have loved being able to support our troops overseas.  I've made new friends and enjoyed hearing about all the wonderful things this organization does both overseas and here at home.My experience has made me proud of those who serve and those who volunteer to support them.  It feels truly amazing to know those men and women fighting in Iraq/Afghanistan know they are not alone and hearing it from them is something you will never forget.Homefront Hugs makes sure nobody is forgotten.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	23755	1	/users/profile/24886	d	Volunteer	4	12/11/2009	Outstanding organization with a great purpose. I only wish my efforts at generating interest and support helps out and I know I will continue to do what my family and I can do in support of their efforts.

Our troops are dedicating their time and service so we can live without fear, it's the least I can do . I write letters and send pkgs weekly and I would do it all over again if asked, I will remain a volunteer until I am no longer needed or able.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10699	7	/users/profile/12596	rosied51	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	I know how rewarding it has been to be a volunteer for HomefrontHugs USA. It has given me the opportunity to give back to our troops for what they do for us and our country.I try to spread the word about this great organization wherever I may be. We are volunteers we accept nothing in return except knowing we have helped another human being.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	12372	2	/users/profile/14402	Karen S	Volunteer	5	10/07/2009	HomefrontHugs is an amazing organization! I have been a volunteer for nearly two years now and I am still caught off guard by the remarkably unconditional, loving support provided to our service memebers, and their families, by this group.  Alessandra is a selfless woman who has inspired me, as well as my family, with her generous spirit, and we are looking forward to supporting this effort for years to come.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	11667	6	/users/profile/13603	Jim B	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	A great organization that pairs up people and/or families to adopt a soldier that never receive care packages from home. My brother-in-law served in the Navy for 20 years and he always commented how fortunate he was to receive care packs regularly and how many guys never got anything from family or friends from home. Please let them know we care.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	11361	9	/users/profile/13307	Flyloe	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I have been a member of Homefront Hugs since approximately 2004.  The number of projects provided have increased over the years as the needs of the troops, their families and the wounded have been made known.  It is truely an organization that works extremely hard to make sure no hero is forgotten.  As the needs grow, and more troops deploy, so grows the need for more volunteers and dontations.  This is an all volunteer organization with all monies being used for the projects.  Check out our web site and find a project to support to show your support an say think you to our heroes.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	11063	11	/users/profile/12992	Jeremy Pidgeon	Client Served	5	09/26/2009	A+++++++++++++. They go above and beyond their call of service. My entire platoon and I are most grateful for their service to us and helping us while we are currently deployed. They know what it means to help soldiers and not just current serving members. They even are very caring for out families at home. My wife is most grateful for the wonderful friendships she has made with them. With great respect, Platoon SGT Jeremy Pidgeon and Platoon, Afganistan 2009/2010
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10746	6	/users/profile/12654	Franzi	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	This is a great organization! Alessandra Kellermann, Homefront Hugs President is a wonderful role model as to putting your money and time where you heart is. Each time one of us can put a smile on the face of one of our troops and and/or their families we are blessed as are they! Not every service member has a family to support and care while they are deployed but HFH allows us to adopt and share our support! As an Army mom myself of a service member I am so pleased this organization allows me and others to "mother/befriend" these hard working guys and gals! It is an organization that is well run and true to its vision and goals of supporting our US military personnel.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10729	8	/users/profile/12639	J.D.	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	If you are ready to get involved to support our troops in a meaningful way, this is the organization for you.  There are a ton of ways you can get involved!  Getting involved to show your support for our military doesn't need to cost a lot of money.  The most important aspect of the volunteer experience is your time and kindness.  You can opt to "adopt" a deployed member, the military nurses and doctors who care for them, or our wounded heroes who are now home and could use some love.  You can simply be part of the campaign to write letters and send/make get well and thank you cards.  The cards are a great way to get children involved.  You may also choose to support their families back home.  Whatever you do, you will be making a difference...a true difference.  The organization is not politically affiliated and is completely volunteer run.  Our military and their families are counting on us.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10710	8	/users/profile/12613	anexson3	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	I am a volunteer for Homefront Hugs USA and am so blessed to have found this organization. Like so many people, I wanted to find a way to let our soldiers know how much we care and appreciate their service to this great nation. I have worked with other organizations that have not been as on top of things as Allessandra. It has been such a sure joy and pleasure to be able to work with such an outstanding and devoted woman. Her passion for the military goes above and beyond. She has inspired not only me but my daughter as well to go the extra mile and want to do as much as we can for our troops. I could not have picked a better organization to volunteer for. Thank you Allessandra for creating Homefront Hugs USA....
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10701	6	/users/profile/12598	karandtar	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	I have been a volunteer for Homefront Hugs for the last six months and have adopted two soldiers, one of whom is Afganistan and has lost men.  We can never do enough to thank these brave men and women who not only sacrifice their lives but sacrifice being away from family, friends, and the comforts of home.  Please, please volunteer so we can help as many folks as possible.  It just takes sending care packages and notes of encouragement.  You will find the experience most rewarding, and if you have children, it will be a valuable lesson on serving commuinity and volunteerism.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10700	7	/users/profile/12597	mdybal	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	This charity matches up ordinary people to provide support for our troops overseas. Whether it's to send care packages, or write letters and cards to help morale, this is a great way to reach out to our brave service men and women around the world. Through Homefront Hugs, our family sent a large package of cards to wounded troops in Iraq and we even received a personal e-mail reply from the chaplain who distributed the letters. This is a great organization that needs monetary donations as well as volunteers to send items to our military personnel.
Homefront Hugs USA Inc	10697	4	/users/profile/12595	terra	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	HomeFrontHugs is doing a job that is critical to any soldier when deployed away from home. This could also be adapted to new soldiers in the service during training, especially the young ones. I am glad that someone stood up and has said, "Give them our support", it was barely there when I was a soldier deployed overseas and I was happy to respond to all of the letters that I received. God Bless you each!

Community Prescription Support Program Inc	188790	1	/users/profile/246398	RLP1	Client Served	5	11/18/2013	I highly recommend Community Prescription Support Program!  This wonderful place saves my life every month, for I have no insurance and cannot afford my prescriptions due to being in a difficult life situation for the past 12 years.  I would literally not be here if it wasn't for Community Prescription Support Program.  CRxSP relies on grants, donations and volunteers to help those in need who are uninsured or underinsured and have a low income or no income.  They provide vital prescription medications for FREE.  I don't know what I would do if Saginaw did not have CRxSP.  I cannot say enough good things about Community Prescription Support Program.  They are saving lives every day.  The volunteers are absolutely wonderful and they are extremely hard workers.  CRxSP does anything and everything they can to help each and every person that comes through their doors the best they can.  Please spread the word of how great CRxSP is and that they can always use more volunteers because there are SO many people out there that need their help.  CRxSP helps SO many people that it'd be a shame if this place closed  due to a lack of funding or volunteers.  So, thank you, thank you, thank you, CRxSP, from the bottom of my heart, for all your dedication and hard work to helping those in need!!!  Keep up the great work!!

I went for the first time today. There might be a wait but the wait is worth it. It is run by volunteers and they provide free medicine to people who are uninsured or underinsured. I did not leave emptyhanded, my son got the medicine he needed.  They were so kind and respectful and I did not feel overwhelmed by paperwork like some agencys. So bring a bottle of water and stay and wait. Once they call your name they are there for you and concerned, they don't rush you. They make sure you get what you need. I do not know how they do what they do, it is amazing!  Thank You CRXSP.

While picking up my medication about three years ago the wait was extremely long that day.  The lady working at the sign in desk apologized for the long wait and said that they were very short of help so since I was unemployed and was able to help I signed up as a volunteer.  My experience helping at crxsp has been very rewarding.  Sure there are days when it becomes overwhelming and stressful but that is how I felt at work at times as well. Just seeing clients faces when you have helped them or hearing the gratitude in their voices is powerful.

Community Prescription Support Program Inc	161943	1	/users/profile/191842	BMTW	Volunteer	4	07/02/2013	Daily I pray that we continue to have the resources needed to continue this ministry. Rresources include dedicated volunteers with a variety of skills and the funding needed to keep this ministry open for those who come.  Some come once or twice because they can't afford their medications- help through a rough time, but others come monthly because they have no money nor insurance for medications.  It is blessing for those served, but it is also blessing to me.  I admire and respect those I meet through this ministry and  feel blessed that I am able to be a part of this important ministry in Saginaw. as volunteer and board member. 
Community Prescription Support Program Inc	145324		/users/profile/191842	BMTW	Board Member	4	11/30/2012	Though currently I am a Board member, I have been volunteering 20--30 hours weekly since the Fall of 2002 when Sr. Phyllis Klonowski, OP, who was urged to begin this ministry, invited me to join her in a tiny office located in the Marie Davis Senior Center.  Over the years I've done many tasks but my hoaned  specialty is Intake: interviewing new clients, collecting needed documents, referring individuals to other resources, and processing pharmeeutical company forms so on going medications are available each month.  Due to the generosity of others, clients usually receive medications on their first visit.  This is especially important for those coming from ER or as hospital discharges.   It has been a blessing to minister to so many individuals over the years.  As others have learned from me, I have learned so much during  our time together.  I believe that this working together builds, community and healthier individuals.

But there are many positive things that are happening today. People that are kind and friendly and they go above and beyond what was expected. I called and was told that if I could make it in they could help me. and help is what I received 10 fold. There was someone to answer my questions and to lend a hand in a tough situation just out of the hospital and no where to go. I think that this place is a jewel in our city and the people that work there share a mission of service to the people. You do not find that today very much, polite and treated with respect, no matter what the situation is or where you came from. CRxSP is the best!!! - John 
Community Prescription Support Program Inc	161018	1	/users/profile/213477	Khoa M.	Volunteer	4	06/19/2013	The Community Prescription program is really helpful to the community. There was a gentleman who had close to 20 prescriptions totaling some $4000/month. The staff painstakingly applied to different programs for each individual drug so this man could have his medications. I know that on his own, this man would neither be able to pay for nor know the individual programs and thus would most likely never take his medications. The program also helps other patients like a woman who was discharged from the hospital with no drugs. For her, the staff even went to the physician and obtained the prescription before obtaining the drugs for her. In short, this is a great program that helps anyone in the community who has problems affording their medications.

In the larger scope of things they contribute extensively to the community in ways that are immeasurable. Thank you CRxSP

Suffice it to say we can't go without our meds. The staff at CRxSP cut through the red tape and helped us get meds from the drug companies for free. And considering the number of meds we take, that was no mean feat. The staff has even helpedn us switch to medications that we could get for free when the patent would run out on the pills we were taking. Thanks to all the staff there.

The medications are shipped to CRxSP and I go there as needed to obtain my prescription at NO COST.

Opus Bono Sacerdotii	323783		/users/profile/418273	jimindc	Donor	5	02/25/2017	OBS is an amazing group helping the truly helpless.No one is more alone than a priest on whom the Church has turned its back. Trained for the ministry and having spent a lifetime in service to the Church it is a terrible thing to know of elderly former or retired priests, often ill or destitute, who are cast into the street while their former diocese acts as if it does not know them.Opus assists these men with a mercy the institutional Church preaches but does not practice.  
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	323691		/users/profile/418149	slow	Donor	5	02/23/2017	I have had negative experiences with some other Christian organizations. Not with Opus Bono Sacerdotii. I also know of a falsely accused priest who is unjustly in jail at the present time who speaks highly of this group. I trust him. If you are willing to pray for them and spare some money for a donation, you will be doing something very, very good.

Opus Bono Sacerdotii	323558		/users/profile/417951	Bloomspring	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2017	I strongly believe the Priests deserve better, no matter their circumstances and status. Nowadays, very few men would consider becoming a Catholic Priest. I am sure they all went in in good faith and made huge sacrifices for their vocations...albeit things did not turn out right. And we, as Catholics have the obligation to help (I am a new Catholic baptized about a year ago from the Mormon faith. I think Catholics can learn from the Latter-Day Saints who support their own members of the Church, lay Priests and leaders in good and bad times, ...and no matter how bad and ugly). Opus Bono Sacerdotii is an excellent example of this and better.  I will spread your organization's intent on my Facebook and in my parish, St Anthony in Edmonton, Canada. I will make a Novena for the priests.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	323523		/users/profile/417913	rmshane01	Advisor	5	02/21/2017	And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. (Matthew 25:40) Since 2002, the organization called Opus Bono SacerdotiiWork for the Good of the Priesthoodhas been caring for priests who have sinned and committed crimes, and who have been cast out by the bishops and religious superiors who educated and trained them. Opus Bono Sacerdotii was established to welcome these outcasts to help them begin new lives. These men might rightly be called the least of our brothers. The teaching and example of Pope Franciswith his emphasis on mercy and on caring for outcasts and marginalized peoplehas given Opus Bono Sacerdotii new insight into the nature and value of its ministry. The work of Opus Bono Sacerdotii can suggest some of the practical implications of the words and example of Pope Francis about mercy, forgiveness, and marginalized people. Some Catholics may even deny that the Sermon on the Mount applies to fallen priests. Opus Bono Sacerdotii, however, shares the ethos embodied in the slogan Love Thy Neighbor. No Exceptions. I have observed the ministry of Opus Bono Sacerdotii since I did some consulting with them during 2015. It is my own belief that the dioceses and religious communities to which these fallen priests formerly belonged have a clear obligation to help these men start over until they can support themselves. This is part of the call of the Gospel to be merciful, and its frankly also a matter of fundamental human decency. Opus Bono Sacerdotii ministers to these former priests whenever their bishops and religious superiors do notand it deserves financial assistance from men, women, and organizations who have been blessed with the resources to support its work. Some of the men Opus Bono ministers to represent a worst-case scenarioa perfect test case to see if there are Americans who accept what the Gospel tells us about our call to identify ourselves with Gods all-inclusive mercy and forgiveness.  Sadly, some Christians seem instead to insist on what they see as their personal right to continue judging some of these men. People who identify themselves as Christiansand who find that they want to exclude the men Opus Bono assistsshould think and pray about just what our tradition from the Sermon on the Mount to Pope Francis means when it explicitly says no exceptions. I submit that there is no room for a spirit of vengeance within the Christian tradition. I personally hope that bishops and religious superiorsand others with the means to helpwill consider making generous donations to Opus Bono Sacerdotii, which is the only organization that helps fallen priests. Whatever their sins, Opus Bono Sacerdotii refuses to allow former priests to become part of what Pope Francis calls our throw-away culture.

I think the most important thing I want to affirm is the personal relationship Joe and Pete establish with the the people they serve, and the deep respect they show for them.  They get to know the men they help, and the men feel respected and cared for.  Many people who come to Opus Bono have lost just about everything, and simply being received and treated with respect is life-affirming and, sometimes, nothing less than life-saving. I am deeply grateful to the Opus Bono family -- to the staff, donors and clients.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	323416		/users/profile/417749	priestling75	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/18/2017	Every day priests all over the world sit in the confessional and grant absolution  to their people for their sins.Yet, when it is the priest who falls, or who has even the appearance of falling, he meets so often with little or no forgiveness in return.  What a cruel irony."But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people."  (Ps. 22:6)Thank God for Opus Bono Sacerdotii and their courage to reach out to priests cast out of their rectories, their dioceses, and sadly even at times their very priesthood.  Justly or unjustly, guilty or innocent, they are still in need of help, hope, and forgiveness.It is truly a privilege for me to contribute to the work of this great organization! "Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all manner of evil against you, untruly, for my sake: Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you."God bless you, Joe!  Your reward in heaven shall be great indeed.

They remember priests who are in trouble in one way or another.  Many retired priests have no family to help them and struggle to meet their needs in our public society.  These are often people forgotten by others.  God Bless Them for helping those who were always helping us in times of sorrow and need.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	171384		/users/profile/226929	Father Phil	Donor	5	09/23/2013	I have been a regular donor to the work of Opus Bono Sacerdotii for some years now. I have spent my life seeking to help persons suffering physical and psychological pain in various medical setting. This gives me an opportunity to assist priests and former priests, some appropriately charged with wrongdoing and punished beyond any sense of decency, some completely innocent yet punished none the less, often by those who should be allies and supporters. Those who are on the front lines of this struggle for justice provide me and all of us with an opportunity not otherwise available to be of loving help to these poor tortured souls.

Almost unique in mission, OBS is run by a small  group of committed faithful.   They are exceptionally frugal operationally--I've seen their offices in Michigan--and while they don't rank with the big nonprofits, neither do they have their bureaucracy and overhead.   No corporate jets or 6 figure salaries here--far more of every dollar given goes to useful purpose.    They have modest means but outsized influence--and the direct blessings of the Holy See.

Opus Bono Sacerdotii	171358		/users/profile/226903	Alexis M.	Donor	5	09/23/2013	Our priests bring us the good news of Jesus Christ. They are there for us at our birth, at our marriage, at the birth of our children, and at our death. How can we give back to them? Opus Bono Sacerdotii makes it possible for me to help a priest who, because he is human, has made mistakes; or, through no fault of his own, has fallen on hard times. The Psalmist says: "How can I repay the Lord for all His goodness to me?" One way is to help His priests who need our help. This organization is made up of volunteers who turn no priest away.  It is my favorite charity. I only wish I had much, much more to give for the good work that they do.

Opus Bono Sacerdotii	171274	1	/users/profile/226821	bigotterwv	Donor	5	09/23/2013	This is a much needed charity in our times.  Priests accused of wrong whether guilty or not guilty are cut loose by their orders, their dioceses and left to sink or swim on their own.  Lets be reasonable - we all know many of these lawsuits are about money.  Also it is a satanic attack against our priests.  I'm not saying that some wrong has been done but I personally believe it has been blown way out of proportion.  Opus Bono Sacerdotii reaches out to help the priests in need to the best of their ability giving above and beyond.  Of the various charities out there this is the one which I would choose as a favorite.  We are seeing more and more Catholic Charities groups giving to groups who should not be included in our charities such as pro choice, pro contraceptive, etc.  I don't think I need to go any further - you all get the picture.In America the law was always 'you are innocent until proven guilty' but with our beloved priests it your guilty whether you are or not.  No one to help them.  Many are older and have no insurance for health needs.  This is were Opus Bono comes in.....They try to help these men to live, to feel some peace and also to offer them hope.  
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	210076	2	/users/profile/272818	Anne99	Donor	5	08/11/2014	Opus Bono Sacerdotii truly makes a difference in the lives of our Priests. Our Priests are so important in our lives; they bring us Christ in Eucharist and without them we would be lost. As Christians, we are not to judge. OBS treats our Priests with a great amount of respect and dignity.  This organization keeps in close contact with its donors, we are always kept up to date with what is happening and when and where we can be of help. We are able to help our Priests also as men, with sometimes their most basic needs. No person should have to suffer and not be afforded their most basic needs, which includes, for them, being able to celebrate the Mass. None of us are perfect and we will all need help at some point in our lives.  Thank God for an organization like this one.  In reply to the following questions: We do recurring donations monthly and keep in contact with them usually on a weekly basis by email and face book. They always respond and sometimes send info in the mail as well as facebook.    
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	210063	2	/users/profile/272804	Carl S.	Donor	5	08/11/2014	OBS is a truly edifying response to the horror of clerical sexual abuse. One often overlooked aspect of the sexual absue scandal that I find particularly disheartening is the way some accused priests are treated by their bishops. OBS helps ensure the accused are given a semblance of due process (helping to separate malicious, vindictive, false or mistaken accusations from true and actual ones, so as to proceed from the truth) and attending to the basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) of those who have no means.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	209872	2	/users/profile/272617	prolife4ever	Donor	5	08/10/2014	For God loved His priests unconditionally and He knew their hearts. And out of compassion for them, a tear fell from His eye. That tear fell in a small town in Michigan and changed into an ocean of His mercy known as Opus Bono Sacredotii. And it became a haven for priests all over who have lost hope.I pray their ministry continues to grow in God's love through the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	209871	1	/users/profile/272616	gerardoesuarez	General Member of the Public	4	08/10/2014	Opus Bono Sacerdotii has been a refreshing invitation and reminder to look at the priest in need as a person.  It is quite easy to judge and label the priest or the Church, to become incensed, irate, to rationalize the situation, to overlook the priest in need and walk away.  It is extremely rewarding and joyous to be merciful and to give, to serve, directly or through others, particularly those who serve or served others.   Opus Bono Sacerdotii has been as an inspiration in my journey of life to continue as a companion to a priest in need of friendship, prayers and economic assistance, as after leaving his diocese for fear of his life has not found acceptance by the local diocese.  Charities such as Opus Bono Sacerdotii whose members believe, commit to the charitys purpose and inspire others to serve have my respects and admiration.  
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	209868	1	/users/profile/272613	Sr.AM	General Member of the Public	5	08/10/2014	This great charity is a blessing from God in helping priests in need.   They display a true love and devotion to the sacred priesthood in each priest and do all they could to carry out this work in action.  They are a high example of how people should respect the sacred priesthood in giving the proper help individual priests need.  May God bless and reward this work in great abundances in graces and all they need!
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	172262	1	/users/profile/228005	rj_in2k	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2013	I know them 'from a distance.' They are known for their service to priests in difficult circumstances. And I'm reminded of that service when I read Pope Francis' interview - http://www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview - where he says: "...God is in every persons life. God is in everyones life. Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything elseGod is in this persons life. You can, you must try to seek God in every human life. Although the life of a person is a land full of thorns and weeds, there is always a space in which the good seed can grow. You have to trust God..."

He gave me his "business" card with the assurance that I could call anytime I might have need of their assistance.  Although I was not in need of their help at the time, within a year I was - and they were very polite and willing to help.  My need was different from that of most priests who approach them, but no less important to them.  I will be forever grateful to them!

Not only do they give financial assistance to priests in need, but they also give them emotional support too. I have benefited from their work by the news and spirituality that they continue to spread through their emails and website. As they encourage priests in their vocation, they encourage the laity, too.

Some have had their careers ruined unjustly by the media.   I have volunteered as a lawyer to help those I can, free of charge.  Opus Bono has provided basic needs for these men who have given their lives for others.   They do a great work and deserve any support they can get.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	171192		/users/profile/226746	Maginel	Donor	5	09/23/2013	I passionately believe in the mission of Opus Bono! They are the only organization of this kind in our country and perhaps in the world which is setup specifically to help priests in difficulty. I consider Pete and Joe, the founders to be heroic in the sacrifices they have made to keep this ministry operating under extremely difficult circumstances. I can personally testify that they aren't profiting themselves or wasting money on infrastructure in running this ministry. They have put no limits on their availability to serve the Church by helping priests. They are truly fulfilling the task which Pope Francis says is the primary one of the Church: being merciful in every way. We cannot afford to do without this ministry even if the confidentiality integral to their work keeps them hidden.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	171190		/users/profile/226742	totalinvolvement	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2013	There are plenty of non-profits who have competition, all doing great work in their specific field of help. However, OPUS BONO SACERDOTII, has NO competition, (that I'm aware of), or at least note that does the work that they do, to the extent that they do it!  And although they have no competition, they still put great effort in helping the people (Priests) that they serve.  I have worked with Joe Maher personally, and we have much in common in our desire to serve the Church and Her Priests.  Joe and I have spoken many times, about should there come a time in my current ministry where I will need to 'move on', it is to OPUS BONO that I shall go, and serve because I believe in what they do, helping our Priests!
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	169670		/users/profile/224860	Doming L.	Donor	5	09/13/2013	I saw this plea of a retired priest who had a broken car and could not get anywhere.  The repairs would amount to an easy grand and the poor Father is living on very humble means.  There was no way he could afford the repairs. Then entered Opus Bono Sacerdoti to the rescue.   While we see a lot of support for just anything ----- canine rescue, endangered toad, etc., there is really not much help to aging priests who have given their entire lives in service of others.  I am just thankful that there is such an organization which took the initiative to help a silent sector of the society that needs help.

While our Priest are Human they still have taken a vow  and have been called to be a representative of Christ. The balance of our faith hangs on the gift of our Parish Priest. I applaud Opus Bono Sacerdotii for all of their endeavors from providing the needs of numerous Priest to helping others to understand the plight of the Priest -to encouraging an increase in our personal Faith. Thank you ----Your Sister in Christ

Opus Bono Sacerdotii	169189	4	/users/profile/224229	Stephen17	Donor	5	09/11/2013	There are a number of non-profits I support; this is the only organization, when once I referred a priest to them for assistance, actually responded by calling me personally to say that they would help however they could if the priest himself called them.  I forwarded the message to that priest, he did call, and was assisted at a very trying time of his life.  Rarely does a non-profit take the time and the trouble to track down a donor's work phone number to call about a request for help. I have not stopped supporting Opus Bobo Sacerdotii since, and encourage others to support them also.
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	163416	3	/users/profile/216956	Mary186	Donor	5	07/24/2013	Every priest dedicates himself - his entire life - to serving the Church. But what happens after accusations (even false ones)? The priest is cut off. He needs financial, emotional, and spiritual support in order to find his footing again. Very often, it can take YEARS before a priest is acquitted and able to return to his ministry. The current climate of zero tolerance, designed to protect children, has sometimes been at the expense of priests who are eventually proven innocent. Opus Bono gives them the necessary support to get through such trying times. And even those who have fallen: they are still human beings, and need a roof over their heads, counseling, and support. We cannot abandon our priests when they needs us. God bless them!
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	163360	3	/users/profile/61123	Mary-Anne D.	Donor	5	07/23/2013	The staff at Opus Bono Sacerdotii lives out their faith everyday by helping priests in need.  They truly understand the concept of helping and serving others.  They live out the Lord's Prayer:  "forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."  May God continue to bless their work.  We are fortunate to be able to participate through donating our time, talent or treasure.  
Opus Bono Sacerdotii	163359	3	/users/profile/216865	Karen179	Donor	5	07/23/2013	This is a group that is so needed in society today. we have a plethora of priests who are in trouble as well as priests who have been falsely accused of sexual abuse. Opus Bono Sacerdotii is a godsend for these priests, supporting them, helping them with legal issues, visting them in prison, helping them to get jobs and helping to clear the names of the wrongly accuse. I highly recommend this organization.

Kids Without Cancer is unstoppable and becuase of all their hard work, they are making a difference in the lives of so many.  With out research, cancer will continue to touch the lives of so many.

This was the first time I had to deal with a death of a family member.  It was heartwrenching and needed to do something in Danny's honor. Everyone's SUPERMAN:=)  That's when KWC formerly LRL was formed.  Over the years I have been part of many fundraisers and events for cancer research and have raised $3.6 million for the cause.  No family should have to deal with the loss of a child and we need to find a cure.  This charity has given back so much over the years and will not stop until they find a cure for cancer.

Coming from a healthy family, it was important to me to give back and donate my time helping to raise funds for pediatric cancer research to find a cure. No child should have to endure the treatments and risk of dying from cancer.  Over the years its been exciting to see the progress in overall survival rate. However were still not there. Research needs to continue to find the ultimate cure. Lets all give back.  Do what you can to help.  Lets help kids to live a full and healthy life!
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12284	5	/users/profile/14317	nick2mary	Board Member	5	10/07/2009	I've been involved with Leukemia, Research, Life, INC. since 1995.  My husband Nick had told me about this wonderful organization and his involvement since its inception.  What I liked about the organization is that it raises funds for pediatric cancer research - searching for a cure, a family's greatest nightmare in which there may not be enough research dollars available to find the cure that's going to save their child. What happens then to their child? Its devastating to a family.  Nick and I have 3 healthy grandchildren. We appreciate and are thankful everyday that these young girls do not have to face painful treatments and proceduers. This is my chance to give back my time and effort to help raise funds for pediatric cancer espeically for those families who are overwhelmed and don't know what's coming next at them. If you've never experienced cancer directly you may have no idea what these familes are going through. This is their life everyday. Soccor, and other kid's events are placed in the background. Anyone with a healthy child, I know you are busy with your life and their activities, but thank God everyday that you don't have to spend time on the pediatric cancer unit. Perhaps you can give back some of your time too just to help another child.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	137668		/users/profile/183663	Mary Ellen Klein	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	My son was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 2 1/2 years old.  Less than a year later, Kids Without Cancer (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life) was founded.  Our goal has always been to find a cure for all childhood cancers through research at Children's Hospital of MI.  As a parent, you feel totally helpless when your child is so ill.  Raising awareness by fund raising gives a parent a little control back.  Since our inception, we have raised over $3.6 million dollars to fund research projects.  Sadly, we lost our precious son shortly before his 8th birthday.  Not a day goes by that we don't miss him terribly, but our family has found incredible strength from our friends at KWC who share our goal of finding a cure for children's cancer.  We continue to raise money in memory of the children we have lost, as well as in honor of other children who are still fighting this disease.  I am proud to be a small part of this incredible group of people.

The 3 months that my daughter fought the disease and the time without her was enough to know that I needed to do something to help find a cure  There are too many children who are affected and the research in underfunded.   Kids Without Cancer is dedicated to raise awareness and the much needed funds to find that cure.  
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	134036	1	/users/profile/179803	Christina37	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	I got involved with Kids Without Cancer because I was looking for a way to help raise awareness and research money for childhood cancer. As a mother of a childhood cancer survivor, I've learned first hand how important this research is, especially with so many kids in our community being diagnosed every year with this disease. KWC members impressed me with their level of commitment and dedication to the cause, and they've inspired me to want to do the same. As an organization, they've been around for over 30 years and have worked to raise over 3.5 million for cancer research at Children's Hospital of Michigan. I am proud to be affiliated with this wonderful organization. I hope that more people will share in our vision and want to help make our goal a reality - a world of Kids Without Cancer.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	131814	1	/users/profile/177401	ChrisandAudrey	Board Member	5	10/31/2012	I first learned about Kids Without Cancer from a member who's son was treated by the same doctor as my brother.  Happily, her son is a cancer survivor.  My brother passed away seven years ago.  But my brother did not die as a direct result of the cancer, he died of his treatment.  The treatments he received as a child caused brain tumors as an adult.  What I love about Kids Without Cancer is their goal of eradicating all childhood cancers by funding research.  These research projects that have been funded by the organization over the past thirty years HAVE made a difference in how childhood cancer is treated today.  The doctors and staff who perform the research are top notch and world class.  We have become a family at Kids Without Cancer with a common goal of helping our young people so they can become survivors and lead a long, healthy life.

Kids Without Cancer was formed by a group of parents with one thing in common - their children had cancer. As a founding memeber I believe by supporting cancer research at a local level we help our children, our families and our community in the fight against the #1 killer disease of children in our country. Early on we recognized the need for pediatric cancer research into the treatment, diagnosis, prevention and ultimate cure of cancer. We organized our efforts and incorporated as a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 1981. We remain the largest non-profit contributor solely dedicated to supporting pediatric cancer research at Children's Hospital of Michigan. For over 31 years, Kids Without Cancer has remained a volunteer-based organization committed to the belief that a few can make a huge difference. We have raised in excess of $3.6 million dollars and are proud of the fact that over 94% of every dollar raised is spent soley on pediatric cancer research. In 1983 when my best friends son succumbed to cancer one week after his 8th birthday I vowed to him that I would NEVER, EVER, give up his fight to find a cure. 31 years later I continue to carry his torch and will do so till I take my last breath.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	46624	4	/users/profile/47454	ecodave	Donor	5	06/29/2010	I came from Florida to attend LRL's Evening of Hope event this year.  What a wonderful night.  I was able to meet with the very doctors doing the actual cancer research and also met some of the childhood cancer survivors that are aligned with this charity.  A very emotional and touching experience to say the least. I love this organization and will continue to support it in the future.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	46408	5	/users/profile/47257	eric8	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	Leukemia Research Life is an exceptional organization which raises money for cancer research at Children's Hospital of Michigan. The organization gives back a very large percentage of their donations to cancer research, and over the years they have done a lot to fund specific cancer research projects that have undoubtedly saved many lives. I volunteer because my wife is involved in the organization, but also because I have come to appreciate the mission of the organization and have seen first-hand the dedication of the volunteers. When they show the slide show presentation at the Evening of Hope, I get tears in my eyes every time. No, it's not the largest charity that helps raise money for pediatric cancer research, but the people who volunteer for LRL do it because they want to see an end to childhood cancer. They also sponsor several other events besides the Evening of Hope, and the events are always worthwhile and fun to be involved in. If you're thinking of volunteering with LRL, you don't have to invest a lot of time... they could use the support, as much or as little as you're willing to give.

The company I work for sponsors this charity and our President is also the President of this organization.  Hearing the speeches from the wonderful doctors at Children's Hospital was so inspiring - and hearing the stories from the kids who survived cancer was incredibly emotional and touching.  I love what this charity is doing and plan on continuing to contribute tho their cause.

We are so pleased to be able to help fund research for finding a cure for childhood cancers.  I have met many of the amazing volunteers and board members and just wish I could do more to help them - what a great mission - the eradication of childhood cancer!  My greatest wish is that they are able to fulfill this mission.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	45604	5	/users/profile/46490	elizabeth-c	Client Served	5	06/25/2010	Our oldest son was treated for childhood leukemia two times and is a survivor.  He has just celebrated 15 years of being cancer free.  He is turning 23 in July. We attended the recent Evening of Hope in Michigan and it was a beautiful evening. LRL does wonderful work and we need organizations like this to continue the fight to find a cure for childhood cancer. The volunteers, board members, families of children who have cancer or who have been treated in the past all play a huge role and we truly loved the entire evening and what it represents.  LRL needs to continue to be supported.  Many thanks for all you offer.  Elizabeth C.

I recently attended a fund-raiser for LRL and met a mother who's son is currently receiving care and treatment because of LRL. As well I heard many other stories of survival and remission. I totally support this remarkable organization and its' mission.

As a nurse and volunteer myself I see far too many children suffering with life-threatening illnesses.  I love LRL's mission to eradicate pediatric cancers.  My brother sits on the board of directors and I know first-hand what an excellent organization this is.  I'm proud to be able to donate to LRL.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	43676	13	/users/profile/44565	susanne22	Volunteer	5	06/11/2010	LRL consists of a group of dedicated volunteers many who have remained involved for almost 30 years.  This group of volunteers works very hard year round on different events with the purpose of raising money to be used toward pediatric cancer research. Why? we do this in memory of the beautiful children we have  lost and in honor of the courageous children and their families who continue on through treatments, and remission and that they remain in remission. LRL plans to stay the course. We will not give up. We've seen improvements in treatment and outcomes and that keeps us going!
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	43487	12	/users/profile/44353	michiganchapter	General Member of the Public	5	06/10/2010	The family was absolutely astounded by the assistance and support they received from LRL. Originally I had heard about the organization from an old neighbor and although I never had any direct contact with them they were helpful to the people that I recommended to them. Truly an asset to the community.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	43423	11	/users/profile/44285	lrlsupporter	General Member of the Public	5	06/09/2010	My first exposure to LRL was during a discussion with one of the board members. When I asked why he became involved with this organization, the board member responded "it is an organization made up entirely of volunteers who help children with cancer...I can't think of anything I'd rather be involved with". This purely compassionate person says it all. Everyone in this organization has known a child with leukemia, and their purpose is to find a cure so not another child or another parent has to suffer with this illness. Our family friend's son was diagnosed with leukemia at age 2, and then again at age 6. Thankfully he is now a healthy 22 year old man. LRL has made it their business to fund the much needed research, with the hope of eradicating this illness.

Everyone is really nice to work with, easy to get along with, and most importantly, dedicated to what they do. I don't think there are many things that are more important than finding a cure for kids who have cancer. It's a great feeling to be a part of an organization that is doing exactly that.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	25656	6	/users/profile/26667	ericash	Volunteer	5	01/15/2010	I learned about LRL thru one of the founders and was very impressed with the passion this group shares to find a cure for Leukemia.  I have been involved with LRL for 4 years, and I can say that this group pours its heart and soul into their combined efforts!  With this group, it is all about the kids and the cure, no wasted money as they invest every penny back into the support for a cure.  You will not find a more deserving group that shares a single vision for what they want to help accomplish!
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12789	1	/users/profile/14805	shushu	Volunteer	5	10/09/2009	I have been entrusted with the job of creating a video presentation for an organization called "Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc." to be presented at their annual dinner-dance fundraiser. The group provides money for research in pediatric cancer. The recipients are dedicated physicians from DMC Children's Hospital of Michigan, and the subjects are patients who are presently fighting cancer and also those that have conquered the disease. I have had the privilege of working on this project for the past 3 years.  In order to garner the material for the movie, I have gone into the hospital to visit the young patients who are bravely fighting the disease and coping with the treatments.  Also, I have seen parents and grandparents who are masking their heartache with a smile in hopes of lifting the spirits of the young ones in their care.   I have interviewed health care workers who are on the frontline daily in their quest to deliver treatments, alleviate the pain, and help to find a cure for pediatric cancer.  And, happily, I have interviewed some children and parents who have "beat the beast" and are willing to share their story to offer hope to those that are still waging the fight of their lives.It has been a very humbling, yet rewarding experience.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12636	12	/users/profile/14673	sang	Donor	5	10/08/2009	Attending the Jack Zaffarno Golf Outing, a fundraising event for Leukemia Research Life, was my first experience in attending a charity event. Upon arrival, I was moved by the number of people. As i began mingling, one thing became apparent and that was everyone's passion for the cause. I am not a golfer so i rode the golf cart with other atendees and took pictures. One might not think I relish going to a golf tournament when I don't golf, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience due, in part, to the volunteer's attentiveness, thoughtfullness, and diligence. It was also great entertainment watching participants play golf and socialize. It touched my heart to witness cash recipient winners give their winnings back to Leukemia Research Life. The food was delicious. In fact, every aspect of the event was well-planned, extremely organized, and deligthful. The most important thing that I took with me from this event is the conveyed, impassioned belief of an ardent supporter of Leukemia Research Life: " One day children will no longer die of leukemia."
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12327	11	/users/profile/14359	sgeorge1978	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2009	I am from Dallas TX, I have attended the LRL "Evening of Hope" dinner dance and silent auction in MI for the past two years.  Both years have been an absolutely wonderful experience.  Most importantly, the people at LRL do a great job of not making people feel uncomfortable while raising money for kids with cancer.  LRL is not pushy at all, they show everyone a good time, if you can donate that is great, if you can't they are genuinely happy to have you there for your support, as LRL understands that raising awareness is just as important as raising money.  I have met some of the best doctors this country has to offer at this event, their continued support of LRL, to me, shows that the money raised is working.  I think LRL does a wonderful job of raising money for Leukemia research, and I will continue to give them as much support as I can for as long as I can.  Cancer touches every family in almost every part of the world in one way or another, organizations like LRL need more support.  Our doctors need more support.  In short, my experiences with LRL have been absolutely wonderful.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12287	13	/users/profile/14320	bobthefish	Board Member	5	10/07/2009	LRL is a fantastic, grass-roots organization engaged in raising funds for cancer research being conducted at Children's Hospital of Michigan.  I was drawn to this organization for several reasons but one of the most important is that it is run by volunteers.  LRL is so lean and efficient that it is able to pass on 90% of every dollar directly to Children's Hospital.  From my research it appears that most highly-ranked charities are only left with about 65% of every dollar once administrative and marketing costs are deducted.  LRL, on the other hand, if focused on keeping its costs to a bare minimum with the intent of forwarding as much money as possible to fund pediatric cancer research.
KIDS WITHOUT CANCER  (formerly Leukemia, Research, Life, Inc.)	12273	5	/users/profile/14302	Elizabeth Ann's	Volunteer	4	10/07/2009	Wonderful experience.  Eveyone on the team is caring and thoughtful.  Nick and Susane Consiglio are the most dedicated couple I have ever worked with on a particular non-profit project.  Most folks do not realize nor comprehend the tedious work (outside present jobs and family) that goes into keeping a program going.  The annual Silent Auction Dinner is an extraordinary event and humbling experience. Just the effort to ask people to donate is difficult let alone getting it all together from all over lower Michigan.  Personally I have seen a variety of cancer in my immediate family including losing a 13 year old brother 45 years ago to bone cancer. Therefore I have seen first hand how cancer research for children is so very important - my brother may have lived and not have suffered so severely had research funds and wonderful dedicated doctors and scientists been able to use this so long ago.  We've come a long way and it MUST keep going.  Please come on board to keep this train moving.

Do-All, Inc.	108104		/users/profile/147115	Donna Gray	General Member of the Public	1	03/21/2012	I have  been going to the thrift shops in town for many years and I find the Cats Meow one of the most unprofessional places I have shopped.  So I will tell you what I had to deal with because of the color of my skin, I buy the bag of clothing for 5 dollars and only put clothing in the bags but once I get to the counter one of the Managers name Marge, tells me we have check your bag to make sure nothing other than clothing is in there and each time they do they find only clothing.   One of the other managers name Colleen, is the one who I was told to complain about this to and after I tell her about how I am singled out she tells me if I dont like the way I am treated then dont come back to the store,  I have filed a complaint with civil rights.  This is a public place.  I have been accused of stealing but they have never proved it thats because I dont steal and I feel I am helping a good cause by spending lots of money there.   I get alot of feed back about the store on center and its mostly negative when it comes to how they treat people of color or income.  And for all who my feel this is unfounded I can prove its all facts and should be stopped and the  people who work there should be accountable for there actions because my personal experience was not a good one so now I am left to taking my money elsewhere because I can no longer support a organization that supports this kind of treatment of myself and others;
Do-All, Inc.	84326	1	/users/profile/93511	Christie G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2011	I had the pleasure of being able to be an employee with this wonderful organization.  I live in a town with the same type of organization but the heart of Do-All tends to stand out more than anything.  I worked directly with the employee group that is in training.  I tell you what, they should NOT be called disabled in any shape or form.  They are people with heart and soul like you and me that are VERY ABLE and just may need some guidance and closer instruction at times.  But don't we all at one time or another?  I never felt more loved or accepted at a place of employment or more comfortable than the way the trainees made me feel.  I had so much fun and learned so much with this employer to last me forever.  I made a great group of friends and collegues that I have the total utmost respect for this company.  There may have been a couple of bad apples, but this company is all about making LIFE better for everyone in this world.  It deserves the best and they continue to strive to do more everyday!!  Thank you Do-All!!!!
Do-All, Inc.	54387		/users/profile/55772	mrsfamilymom5	General Member of the Public	4	10/04/2010	My husband and I have had the opportunity to help a person that is a client and employee at Do All. He is mentally challenge in a way that he would not be able to have the opportunities he has if it were not for Do All. They saw his strengths that allow him to hold a job, which in return allows him to live on his own. I thank God that we have an organization that helps so many like this man and his wife that would never be able to function in society other wise without these services. Thank you Do All for all you do. You truly live up to your name!

The collaborative mind set and creativity of the staff and administration lead to contuinuous improvement and enhanced positive outcomes for persons with disabilities.
Do-All, Inc.	26294	1	/users/profile/27329	WendyA	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2010	Several years ago I was fortunate to work with many people who were employed by Do-All.At the time I was a Support Service Director for one of their Competitors.  Together, we joined together to help educate the community on the services we provided.  We formed an informal panel to answer questions on how we could improve our services.  I visited Do-All on many occations. I was impressed with the Admin. and Staff of Do-All. Always stepping up to the plate to better serve their clients.  Even though that was 5 years ago and I live outside of the area.  I keep in touch with past clients and co-workers and providers who currently work for/with D0-All.  It seems they still strive to find the perfect job matches, job skills, evaluations, and bonified care that the industry has to offer.  I have seen first hand how services are delivered in other States as well as those in Western and Southern Michigan.  It's apparent that Do-All has overcome  some of the more difficult areas in which many of their competitors across the Nation struggle. For example, Transition Services, Transportation, Creating Community Awareness, Bonified Evaluation  and Outcomes and last but not least, It seems that Do-All  continues to learn from their consumers and their providers/families. Bay County is Lucky to have them.

The economy has been tough on many organizations - and yet this is one which continues to thrive.  This has to do with the attitudes and contributions of the Do-All Team.  My interactions with them have always left me inspired and motivated.  They are continously focused on "what's next" and take the action to follow it up.  Our community is stronger because of Do-All's commitment!
Do-All, Inc.	25882	1	/users/profile/26214	Christopher	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/20/2010	I am writing this letter in hope that you will somehow receive wider recognition for the valuable work you have done in the community particularly with the physically and developmentally handicapped.  I have witnessed first hand the difference that Do-All is making in the community and in peoples lives. The two Cats Meow locations are a tremendous success providing much needed relief for folks in need and a charitable portal for those able to give. In short, it is clear that your programs are exceptional and have blossomed over the years as a direct result of the commitment you, your staff, and your board tirelessly provide.  I have seen many organizations come and go over the years, but I have never seen one have the positive lasting impact on a community more than Do-All has had on Bay City and the surrounding region.

I have been associated with Do All Inc. for 23 years. During that time I have been impressed with the ability of Do All Inc. to work with their clients to encourage and train them to become fully integrated within the community. They have also worked with the community, namely, the Chamber of Commerce, United Way, Intermediate School District, local Boards of Education and other community organizations to develop programs and policies that allowed persons with disabilities to participate fully in all aspects of the community. As a result, many of their clients have had enriched educational experiences, are gainfully employed and living independent lives. Others who need a more structured environment, have work and living programs that are more supervised.I look back on my working relationship with Do All as a rewarding experience. Sincerely, George Heron

DO Foundation, Inc.	126163	3	/users/profile/59511	Tere	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	The DO Foundation is an organization that is dedicated particularly to giving homeless individuals hope by supplying their immediate needs. The workers of the DO Foundation go "to the streets" to communicate directly with homeless individuals to assess, then meet these needs. The founder, Brian O'Neal; Co-founder, Kelly Adolph and a myriad of hardworking volunteers work tirelessly to abolish homelessness in and around the Detroit area. "Team DO" of The DO Foundation also spreads awareness to across the country about the misconceptions that many have regarding homeless individuals. I have become more sensitive to the needs of homeless individuals through the knowledge that I have  received from the DO Foundation.  I am honored to be a part of such an amazing group of individuals who truly care about the people they serve.  Even after several hardships befell the organization, the response is always the same, "The Mission must continue". I salute the DO Foundation for their hard work and dedication. They are truly a top rated Non Profit in my eyes. For more information about the DO Foundation or to donate, please go to www.dofoundation.net 
DO Foundation, Inc.	56804	1	/users/profile/59511	Tere	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I initially started supporting the DO Foundation (DOF), because of its founder Brian O'Neal. He has a passion for helping those in need.  It gives me great pleasure to know that there is an organization that is truly interested in helping those in need. The DOF's commitment in helping end homelessness can set a standard that other organizations can follow, by going  in the communities where help is needed;  be visible and talk to individuals to determine their need and just show people that you genuinely care.  Mr. ONeal not only goes into the areas where the help is needed, but he also informs DOF supporters of the need that is greatly among us. That's why I will continue to support Brian ONeal and the DOF.
DO Foundation, Inc.	57954	1	/users/profile/61442	jazzhope	General Member of the Public	5	11/27/2010	The DO Foundation is doing a tremendous amount of work to help the homeless.  Continue to support this outstanding organization!

By hitting the streets and providing for the immediate needs.  We are working diligently to open our first of many resource centers to aid and assist with the specific needs of the homeless.  We have had tremendous success and many success stories.  
DO Foundation, Inc.	57506	1	/users/profile/60794	Suman J.	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2010	I live in Nepal which is very far away from USA. But from face book & from some source I come to know that do Foundation working for humanitarian & when I check out yes really Do Foundation doing it. & Brain is real human who is spending his time/ money for shake of basic human need. & aware other too to be good human. There R lot Social Organization opened by people to earn name/fame/money but Do is doing as they talk (really social motive). Keep it up >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
DO Foundation, Inc.	57474	1	/users/profile/60748	Karol K.	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2010	DO Foundation is a wonderful organization simply by the fact that they go out on the streets to help homeless people. The founder is very compassionate and it shows by his actions. I truly believe he wants to make a difference. They go out of their way to help as many people as they can. Less talk and more action is what they believe in.  If we had more organizations like DO Foundation I believe we really could eradicate homelessness in our country and possibly around the world.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56947	1	/users/profile/59712	Levon	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2010	There are charities, foundations, and groups that talk about how to deal with alcoholism, substance abuse, mental illness, and of course homelessness. There are people who regale you with stories of how much they gave to this disaster, or such and such cause - after all, "every little bit helps" - well, I think that is only the beginning. Sure, money helps, however, in my book, it is WHAT YOU DO that matters...talking is just blah blah, money can sometimes be mis-managed, and checkbook-charity is just that - one facet of giving. The DO Foundation is about ACTION - stopping in the middle of your busy day to help someone in need...giving up a hotel room for an elderly person because you can. Providing "DO Bags", helping with transitional housing, 24-hour access to laundry facilities, treatment program referrals, on-the-spot emergency asistance - this is REAL ACTON. I completely support the DO Foundation for what they DO.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56939	1	/users/profile/59704	Marque Todarrio	Volunteer	5	11/14/2010	I truly believe in this charity, I love what the Do Foundation stands for. I will do anything I can to help this foundation succeed at its mission.  I ve been homeless once and so this cause is very dear to my heart.  The founder Brian O Neal is a great person and humanitarian.  He actually live as a homeless man himself for two week so that he would personally know what it was like. He gives his celebrity status and his time to make this cause a great one.  He is honest and dedicated to what he believes in......  I do too..!

DO Foundation, Inc.	56908	1	/users/profile/59662	Cheray Y.	General Member of the Public	4	11/13/2010	I have watched Brian Oneal from a distance exhibit his passion for wanting to extend love and what he has been blessed with with those less fortunate.  How better to fulfill this passion than to have an organization such as (DO).  This Foundation is giving back to those who have in many cases "given much" themselves, and now because of circumstances find themselves in a position where they have hit their "bottom."  This Foundation and those like it need everyone's support because truly, a little bit goes a very long way. Continued success to this organization and what and who it represents.

DO Foundation, Inc.	56881		/users/profile/59626	Inger W.	Client Served	5	11/13/2010	I was recently helped by the Do Foundation after a month unsuccessfully trying to get help from over 20 organizations in the state of Florida.   Everyone I spoke to at the foundation were extremely kind, and showed great concern for my daughters and my well being.  While we waited for transportation back home to Canada, (which they arranged) they made sure we had a comfortable place to stay and food.  I am forever grateful to everyone in the organization for their genuine concern and kindness they showed to my family.  
DO Foundation, Inc.	56873		/users/profile/59609	Bettie Boop	Donor	5	11/12/2010	I give to several organizations via my workplace but I never really know if my contributions are helpful. I was amazed by Brian's talent as an artist. However, as I got to know more about the DO Foundation's role and the work that Brian and his amazing team are performing to abolish homelessness, I am truly in awe. I rallied additional pennies in my budget to aid the DO Foundation in its endeavors. I've never personally been homeless but I watched my mother struggle for years trying to prevent us from being homeless and hungry. If we were growing up now I'm not sure if she would have been as successful. God has given us a simple but powerful message. LOVE ONE ANOTHER!!!! The DO Foundation is doing this for us.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56850		/users/profile/59570	Terra	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I follow this organization because I know the organizers really care.  As someone who is among the less fortunate, I give back where I live through time and deeds because as a graduate studentI do not have a lot of money.  This organization continuously inspires me to do what I can where I am  When I graduate, outside of science education, my research focus will be on studying and mapping (via GIS) issues (policy, perceptions, community networks) related to poverty and social justice.  This is a great organization.

DO Foundation, Inc.	56839		/users/profile/59558	Donna C.	General Member of the Public	4	11/12/2010	The DO Foundation is a grassroots organization that gets to the heart of the plight of homelessness.  It's founder not only talks the talk, but walks the walk in order to best serve his constituents.  By living the life, he can better assess the needs of the population being served.  Kudos to the DO Foundation for working so tirelessly with the homeless population.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56838		/users/profile/59557	renovatio06	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	As the name says, this organization is not about talking about things, but DOING something to better the issue of homelessness. As the global and Stateside economy suffer from a decline too complex to go into details about, the DO Foundation is right where help is needed: In the streets, shelters, WITH the people in need. If there was proof for "Walk the talk", the DO Foundation is it. The hosts of the American Smooth Jazz Awards must have felt the same way, when giving their founder Brian O'Neal the Humanitarian Award of the Year.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56830		/users/profile/59547	Monique R.	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I HAVE DONE LOTS OF VOLENTEER WORK MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DO FOUNDATION.

Brian O'Neal and his staff of volunteers have a solid, selfless mission to work with the homeless and they are champions beyond measure.  They are to be highly commended for going directly to those on the streets to find out what is needed most.  They're goal of having a "one stop shop" to provide resources for those in need is very innovative.  I have spoken personally to Brian and know that his passion is genuine and far-reaching.

DO Foundation, Inc.	56813		/users/profile/59524	Nikki W.	Donor	5	11/12/2010	I donated to the "Do Foundation" because I believe whole heartedly in their mission to irradicate homelessness in our country.  Dr Cornel West once said, "In order to lead the people, you have to serve the people."  The Do Foundation is committed to leading people out of their state of homelessness by helping to serve their needs.  What a GREAT humanitiarian organization.  Too often we get caught up in our own lives, desires and wants that we often give no consideration to those less forturnate.  What a sad sate of mind to live in.  I tip my hat to  Brian ONeal and the Do Foundaton for taking a stand and not just "talking the talk" but "walking the walk."
DO Foundation, Inc.	56807		/users/profile/59517	John D.

DO Foundation, Inc.	56798		/users/profile/59502	Jackiewr	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I support the DO Foundation, because the founder is a man who REALLY cares about homelessness and the homeless.  He and his organization go above and beyond what most people do for the homeless.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56789		/users/profile/59488	Terese R.

And the DO Foundation does this on a regular basis, not just once in awhile. They make a REAL difference.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56788		/users/profile/59487	Tally J.	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2010	I support this organization because the Founder believes enough in what he is doing that he put himself in situations to experience homelessness first hand. How amazing is it that a man in his position would do that and more than once.I believe that one should try to help those less fortunate than themselves. This organization is the result of someone who saw a need and was willing to put forth the initiative to try do that.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56784		/users/profile/59480	zooky4	Donor	5	11/11/2010	The  DO Foundation is great, because the response is immediate.   You don't have to submit essays, stand in line, be question or drilled.   The DO Foundation is about helping where they are when they needed.  ZERO Red Tape.
DO Foundation, Inc.	56033		/users/profile/58314	Lynda	Volunteer	5	10/31/2010	I love the DO Foundation and what they do to combat and end homelessness! They inspire me so.  They don't just talk the talk.  They walk the walk and DO for others in need. Brian O'Neal the founder along with Kellly Adolph, co-founder go out of their way to help others.  Behind the scene are other strong warriors too contributing with paperwork, phone calls and long hours! All playing a KEY PART!!  Brian also donates his shows to help others and made a song "Dreams In Color" which is AWESOME!!  I believe we are here on earth to help one another especially those in need.  The DO Foundation prepares DO Bags, through donated funds, with essential items for those in need to survive with for the day!  They go out in full force with helping others.  Sending out awareness to all who will listen in hopes that they will feel the need to help others. The Documentaries and videos are straight and to the point!  The Cause is GREAT and many are joining it.  Its All About HUMANS HELPING HUMANS!!  Something this great can't go unnoticed! It inspires me to go out and DO! I give to the DO Foundation and to those in my local area!  I feel good when I go out and help others!  You don't have to be rich to contribute.  A smile, a hug or a conversation to those in need goes a long way!  Become a team member www.dofoundation.net I love the website! There's Room For Many OR More!!

The Diaper Alliance	256152	2	/users/profile/344548	missbrittanywalter	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	It was many years ago when I was home on break that my mom and I went to the grocery store. You could tell that she was thinking really hard about something, and she finally just said, " I really want to pay for someones diapers and groceries. If we see someone who seems to be struggling, I want to help them, and bless them." Thinking only of myself, and my ego at the time, I told her how mortified I would be if a stranger at the store thought I needed help. I told her she shouldn't do it, and on that shopping trip, she didn't.  Flash forward, and my mom, Debi Keyes, founded The Diaper Alliance. You see, her helping people wasn't just a passing whim where she wanted to do something good for one day. It is a defining part of her character, who she is. She hasn't always had the easiest of life, and instead of making her jaded to the world, it filled her with more compassion than most people I know.  Another thing I didn't realize the day when she first mentioned to me that she wanted to help someone out, was the huge need in our community. Living in Chicago now, I always used to joke to people that Midland was basically a gated community. I was blessed that I never went without anything growing up, so I couldn't even imagine, or see what was right in front of me.  Since starting The Diaper Alliance, I've heard stories of people who had to let their child sit in a used diaper all day because they couldn't afford more to change it. People who had to let their child go without diapers, and they would just have to clean up after them when they went to the bathroom. Seniors would wet themselves in public, and just have to manage, because Depends were a luxury they couldn't afford. Things a lot people couldn't even imagine were others realities. The Diaper Alliance has made it possible for thousands of families to obtain crucial items for survival. Things most people take for granted are a Godsend when The Diaper Alliance supplied them to other non-profit agencies for distribution.  I've seen my mom go through business classes to learn how to run a non-profit, work for years without ever being paid, and I have even helped her fill up her car to overflow with diapers to move to a different location.  I have seen her work countless hours a day to make sure that The Diaper Alliance can continue supplying local families, even when she's tired, sick, having dinner, on the other line... it doesn't matter. She found a need, she heard a call to action, and she has risen. The Diaper Alliance has done more than just be a supplier of a much-needed product. It has opened a communities eyes who viewed Midland much like I used to. It is absolutely mind-boggling that people so close to home could be in such need. Well, unfortunately, they are. The Diaper Alliance continues to need the support of the community in order to function, and be able to help the families in our community that need assistance. I am proud of my mom, and the fact that The Diaper Alliance has been helping to change families, one diaper at a time.

I've had the opportunity of working with Debi, the Founder and Executive Director, on a college civic engagement project. She's one of the most wonderful people I've ever met and she really cares about her community. I earned 110% on my project and TDA collected about 500 diapers. It was a win, win and I'm so glad I chose TDA for my project. I look forward to volunteering for them in the future!

The stories I have heard about what this wonderful organization does  for babies in need are incredible.

Many do not have laundry facilities, so cloth diapers aren't an option and because we receive more diapers from the Diaper Alliance than we would usually have donated, the help we give is increased.  Debi's dedication and hard work for this cause and the free help it provides make the Diaper Alliance worthy of support, both in dollars and in volunteer hours.

In just 13 months, over 90,000 diapers have been delivered to the agencies and provided to the clients they serve, in financial crisis!   The Diaper Bank does not give diapers to individuals; only to agencies that have partnered with us.  Our partner agencies are:  DHS, Salvation Army, Caregiving Network, Cancer Services, Head Start, all the Midland Family Centers, Emergency Food Pantry Network, Early On, Senior Services, Pregnancy Resource Center, Pregnancy Aid and Shelterhouse. It has been a pleasure to work with our partner agencies and their staff.  They work daily, with servant hearts,  providing for those who are less fortunate.   It has also been very humbling to find out that diapers ARE an unmet need, and to hear stories of how families get by without an adequate supply of diapers.  (Scraping waste out of diapers and taping them back on, drying out wet diapers to re-use them, and using rags and plastic wrap are only a few stories I have heard.) I would like to thank all of our donors, either named or anonymous.  Without you, the Diaper Bank would not have survived our first full year!

Now Hairy Houdini . We had lost our loved family member Charlie (a 17 year old Husky) six month before and we wanted another Husky.  We first saw Maverick on their web sight standing on a picnic table. That's all it took, we were in love.  After we contacted the rescue and gave them our information and story. Cherie called our Vet to check us out and arranged a home visit.   When he arrived we knew he was the one, he adopted us. He stayed. We have had a great time for the last ten years since that day. He loves going to the field and stretching his legs and going to Grandmas farm where he can run free. He now owns everything. We own nothing everything is his. Looking forward to many years ahead with him. I would recommend this origination to anyone. Their love for their job is evident in everything.

After doing a little research and recommendations we looked through HHSHR. We spoke to the foster who gave us detailed information about this handsome boy. We instantly fell in love. Our boy who we have given the new name of Gambit is everything we have hoped for and more. We were informed how HHSHR takes the incoming dogs and works with them to know what type of personality and love that they need to have in their new homes. The communication was great, the information was clear and they love every single one that comes through their rescue. It's no exaggeration when people say " who rescued who" when it comes to bringing a 4 legged love into your life. We owe it to Hairy Houdini for helping us complete our family. 
Hairy Houdini Siberian Husky Rescue	285455		/users/profile/375444	Roger38	Client Served	5	04/10/2016	My wife and I adopted Leprechaun. We loved Leppie, but she knew something was missing. Leppie then went to a foster who had other Siberia and she started to show her kinship for her own breed. As a family of adopters and fosters, HHSHR has saved the lives of numerous huskies. As Leppie's kinship for huskies began to truly show, Cheri remember the one husky Leppi was always close to. Today, Leppi is with her life long friend and both huskies are truly happy. This is how a real RESCUE works. It's not one who adopts out a husky and forgets. The intimate and continuing love of the dog and the breed continues for the life of the dog. My wife and I now have a beautiful boy. No he did not come from HHSHR, but another rescue who saves huskies from kill shelters. You bet that is important. Our Red/White boy was just shy of being euthanized when he was rescued and we have him and he's become family. Family to us and HHSHR as well who answers all our Newby questions.Finally I must say that whenever a HHSHR adopter sees a husky who's in dire straights, HHSHR works with us to save as many as we can.

Hairy Houdini Siberian Husky Rescue	285449	1	/users/profile/375440	Susan452	Client Served	5	04/10/2016	We have adopted two dogs from HHSHR. Our first Stryder came from another home that had previously adopted from HHSHR but circumstances in the home changed and that person could no longer care for the dog. HHSHR has a very loyal supportive community that at its foundation wants what is best for the rescue dog. I saw a posting and made an appt. to go see the dog at the previous adopters house and we fell in love with the dog. HHSHR checks out every adopter so I had every confidence that this adopter who was having to give up his dog was a great person and wanted the best for the dog. We did and still do share pictures with this previous adopter.  Our second rescue adoption came one year after the first and I was seeking a second dog, a female, to keep our first dog company. Fit was important so we met up at the park with one of the foster families and met the dog I was certain would be the perfect addition to our family. On Father's Day 2015 we welcomed our second HHSHR dog, Luna, home.  I can't say enough about how well the organization and the fosters evaluate the dogs and the prospective adopters. I am not even sure how and when that happens but the important thing is that it does happen. It is why HHSHR has so many successful placements and such a welcoming community. We love our dogs and they are very happy in our home. We are sad they had to go through so much prior to coming to our home but are grateful to HHSHR for saving them and allowing us to adopt them.

Hairy Houdini Siberian Husky Rescue	273551		/users/profile/362794	Colleen65	Volunteer	5	12/02/2015	I rescued one amazing dog from this group and am fostering (forever) another amazing dog. They are a wonderful group of people and extremely caring and dedicated to helping these fine huskies find forever homes! 
Hairy Houdini Siberian Husky Rescue	273529		/users/profile/362769	TJ B.	Volunteer	5	12/02/2015	We foster for HHSHR and love it.  It is such a rewarding experience and all we have to do is share time and love with some much deserving Huskies.The amount of dogs this group has helped and the care/concern they have for these dogs is overwhelming.

Humble Design Inc	312540	1	/users/profile/403914	Kim_246	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	Amazingly talented women who take donated items and turn them into a home full of treasure for people all over the Detroit area. I can tell that  everyone involved in the organization really want to improve lives of others. And they do it with smiles and warmth!! 
Humble Design Inc	312528	1	/users/profile/403901	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I recently volunteered with Humble Design to decorate a home using a paid volunteer day provided by my company. This was by far my best volunteer experience I've had. It not only utilized my design skills, but also provided a very rewarding opportunity as we were able to stay and witness the reveal of the house to the family (very emotional). The day began with us learning a little about the family and their situation, which was humbling to say the least. We then packed up the items the designers had picked out and headed to the house. There was a light amount of cleaning involved before we started decorating. From there we were given almost free rein to decorate a room as we saw fit, granted the designers had already picked out the items, but we were still able to decide the placement. It also served as a great team bonding experience. I would recommend this opportunity to anyone who has an eye for aesthetics and loves to make people happy. You will leave feeling like you truly made a difference.  
Humble Design Inc	308664	3	/users/profile/400038	Lisa582	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	Being new to Detroit, I was greatly saddened to see the conditions in which some of our families live. I was introduced to Humble Design a few years ago and they still never fail to amaze me in how they transform the lives of the families that they touch. Imagine being a child having to sleep on the floor or in car- now imagine that child not only in their own bed, but in a bedroom decorated with their personal needs and likes in mind. I have had the honor of volunteering in their warehouse on numerous occasions and it is a fun, well organized charity. The leadership is really smart, down to earth, and most of all-   they really care. Do not hesitate to help.
Humble Design Inc	308230	2	/users/profile/399622	Kristin77	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I volunteered, organizing the warehouse and everyone there was warm and caring.  This is an organization that leads with the heart.  I loved helping out and look forward to doing it again. 
Humble Design Inc	307795	1	/users/profile/399141	Lovelyrita9	Volunteer	5	10/03/2016	I was looking for a volunteer position where I could use my Interior Design experience while giving back to those in need. I found it!! Tregar & her staff are amazing. Such a simple concept to help families in need of a home. My first deco day was overwhelming. Nothing was left out. Furniture, rugs, lighting, & accessories., The finished house was truly a home. I am proud to be a little part of Humble Design.
Humble Design Inc	307748	2	/users/profile/399092	Gil L.	Volunteer	5	10/03/2016	My daughter introduced me to Humble Design a couple of years ago. She currently works there as one of the designers. I really was moved by their vision of helping families transition out of homeless shelters by providing furnishings and design services.One of my favorite parts is when I help out on "deco days" and experience the transformation from an empty house into a clean, dignified and welcoming home. The look on the families' faces is just priceless.It's a very simple idea that really can change a family's future.
Humble Design Inc	307716	1	/users/profile/235305	anne.lefere	Volunteer	5	10/03/2016	Humble Design is an incredible organization!!  I have watched first hand the many lives they have changed.  The staff at Humble is so unbelievably organized and work so very hard for something they dearly love...helping people in need.  I can't say enough about Humble and their mission to help families transitioning out of homeless shelters by providing furnishings for their new homes.   The tears of hopelessness turns to tears of joy after these clients walk into their furnished homes for the first time!!  
Humble Design Inc	178679	1	/users/profile/235305	anne.lefere	Donor	5	10/17/2013	I have personally witnessed the hard work and dedication of the employees and volunteers that work for Humble Design.  This is an amazing organization!!!  So nice to see that there is hope for families that have nothing and for them to experience the simple joys of life that we all take for granted...a bed to sleep in, a couch to sit on and a table to sit at and gather for a family dinner.  
Humble Design Inc	305895	1	/users/profile/397167	jgeiringer	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	Volunteering with humble design has been a fun, moving, and truly humbling experience.  It's an awesome feeling to be part of something so special. The families we help are so deserving and great-full. It's a great way to give back and help others. 
Humble Design Inc	305879	1	/users/profile/397151	ChelseaGirl	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	It is a joy to volunteer with Humble Design - a life changing non-profit that brings furnishings and hope to families that have neither.  With dignity and style, lives and homes are transformed.    Humble Design is run with sincerity and a big heart for both it's families and it's volunteers.   
Humble Design Inc	305792	1	/users/profile/397068	mlr6675	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	As I grew up in a family where "giving back" was taught to me at an early age, I found myself now as an adult in a situation where It was time for me to find an organization that could fulfill my personal need to "give back".  A selfless act that can help fill a void for someone else and in the process fill my heart knowing my time has made a difference for someone.   After learning about Humble Design I knew in an instant this was where my time needed to be spent as this charity tugged at my heartstrings. We are all in this journey we call life together. We all depend on each other's participation in society for our well-being. Humble Design gives those who need an opportunity to get back on their feet and an amazing head start. We can all have a house or a form of shelter but there is no place like "home". Home is where bonds are formed, memories are made and mostly should be a peaceful safe place. I'm proud to be a part of such an incredible organization. 
Humble Design Inc	305744	1	/users/profile/397020	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	My experience with Humble has been one of amazement!  Every time I volunteer, and mean every time, I see a deep commitment by everyone present, which I feel is a reflection of the management.  There is a "can-do" attitude that is encouraged with joy and true love for the families that are served!
Humble Design Inc	272017	2	/users/profile/360958	SkyKingLQ	Volunteer	5	11/13/2015	Worked as part of Chrysler's Motor City Volunteers.  Hauled household items to a house on Beaconsfield in Detroit.  I ended up raking the yard that hadn't been cleaned in some time. Having the family see the cleaned up and setup house with nice looking furniture, well designed layout, and functional items was very rewarding. They do three houses/families a week and I don't know how they handle it to date. A worthwhile organization to donate money, furniture, and household items
Humble Design Inc	227149	4	/users/profile/290879	david.g	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	This is the most rewarding experience I've had with a non profit. You get to go directly to the families in need and help. For those who do not want  to go to the houses, they have great opportunity to organize the warehouse. 
Humble Design Inc	180010	3	/users/profile/236660	Juli2	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	You leave  at the end of the work day knowing you have extraordinarily impacted a family's life.  Humble Design has everything set up - you shop for the client's home in the donation warehouse, and then you set everything up. These homes look good when we finish- the designer touch is awesome!  I often see people cry from sheer joy and relief knowing they have a furnished, finished home.  It's a beautiful thing.  
Humble Design Inc	179882	3	/users/profile/236531	Malak S.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	Volunteering for Humble Design was an extremely rewarding experience. I left knowing that I helped a family by giving them a dinner table to eat at and getting the kids off the floor and into a bed. I believe that providing them with these necessities that so many of us take for granted will help the parents find a job, will help the kids in school and in their social lives. Humble Design believes in Detroit. 
Humble Design Inc	179569	4	/users/profile/236216	vainmi	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I have volunteered for many different kinds of organizations in the past, and my experiences at Humble Design make it the most rewarding  of all of them.  The work they do is so special: turning an empty house into a welcoming and warm home in just a couple of days. They are giving a gift not only to their clients, but also the volunteers who get to witness this transformation.  Humble is Awesome!  I love working there.
Humble Design Inc	179346	1	/users/profile/235992	Suzy123	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I have had the pleasure of volunteering for Humble on several occassions.  The work they do is really extraordinary-transforming houses into homes in a matter of hours.  The look on the family's faces when they see the magic that is weaved by this organization is simply priceless!  Humble is a huge asset to our community.  An incredibly simple concept that is brilliantly executerd by this amazing group of open hearted people.
Humble Design Inc	178988		/users/profile/235618	Krista8	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	Humble Design is a wonderful organization!!!!  They helped my family and I when we needed it the most. The organization is class A!  And is ran by some of the most caring, amazing women that you will EVER met.  When I first moved into my home I had a bed and a couch and I knew that it would be a LONG time before I would be able to furnish my home....let along decorate it.  The lord literally brought these women into my life!!  I was very uncomfortable asking for anything, I couldn't believe that strangers cared so much for my children and I.  All they asked was "what else do you need"  "are you sure that's it"?  It was like a dream come true.  I felt like I was on a home make over show.   I can't explain the joy and LOVE that I felt from these ladies. "Humble Design" is the perfect name for this organization because these ladies are so humble!  They never, ever made me fell bad for needing the help.  To be able to keep my dignity though the process was important for me.... not only did I feel dignified, I felt special!!  I love these women so much!  They are such ambassadors for the City of Detroit.  For anyone who has ever volunteered or donated funds... you don't know just how much you have impacted someone's life...for those of you who have never donated, there's no time like the present :-).A special Thank You to Treger, Ana and all the staff, volunteers and Board members that make Humble....well so humble :-)!  I love you all!!!!!  THANK YOU!!! and keep up the GREAT work!
Humble Design Inc	178981		/users/profile/235611	d8newton	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Humble Designs is a truly amazing organization that provides assistance to those in need.  The employees and volunteers of this organization truly work hard and are very dedicated.  It is amazing how much we take for granted in our day to day lives and how some of the most basic and simple things brings such joy to others who are without.  I have volunteered on several occasions and have found this to be very rewarding.
Humble Design Inc	178964		/users/profile/235592	Muriel C.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I helped Humble Design decorate the house of a woman who had been homeless with three young children. The staff was right there, directing and helping the volunteers, and they clearly loved what they were doing. When we were done, we showed the woman what we had done with her house, and then the staff asked her to talk about what she had gone through and how Humble Design had made a difference for her. She talked about being in the shelter, having to stay with friends and family, and how being in her own house and having something as simple as a kitchen table to sit at with her family so they could eat meals and talk about their day, meant so much to them. I teared up a few times while she was talking about what she had been through, and even more when she started talking about that table. It's amazing what something like having furniture and hanging a few pictures can do to make a family feel like they're home. What Humble Design does is huge. I will definitely be volunteering there again.
Humble Design Inc	178959		/users/profile/235585	Alayna L.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	This non-profit has a heart of gold.  Using gently used items to set up an interior designed interior for those less forunate is not only fun and creative for the volunteer but also gives the family a place of diginity and some place to be proud to call home.
Humble Design Inc	178531		/users/profile/235161	tlefere	Donor	5	10/17/2013	Humble Design is an amazing non-profit organization benefiting individuals and families in the metro Detroit area by giving them a new safe home to live in.  I have seen first hand the hard work and dedication that goes into the whole process.  Humble Design not only gives help to those in need, it gives them the hope of a new and better future with a home they can call their own.  Seeing the appreciation and smiles  on these families is very gratifying, great work Humble Design!!!!
Humble Design Inc	178528		/users/profile/235158	manford	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	Humble Design is helping people who escape homelessness get off the floor.  When clients leave a homeless shelter they usually have a bag of clothes and nothing else.  These wonderful people are trying to make a better life for their family by looking for work, schooling and housing.  Humble design puts them in a bed and fully furnishes their entire home.  After Humble Design leaves they can get a good night sleep and focus on what is really important for their family.  They can also cook a meal and not have to worry about saving money for sofas, beds and miscellaneous household items that are needed to live our every day lives. Humble Design is literally getting the people of Detroit up off the floor and in a better state of mind.  Thank you Humble for making our city a better place to live.
Humble Design Inc	178523		/users/profile/235154	Avak	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Humble Design goes above and beyond to create a space for their clients to call home. Gifting them with a houseful of furniture is a huge stepping stone towards success! 
Humble Design Inc	170508		/users/profile/225949	laurabe	Client Served	5	09/19/2013	My parents were moving out of their home of 40 years and wanted to help another family begin a new life.  Humble Design returned phone calls, arranged for pickup, and arrived when they said they would.  Although we didn't see the next part of the story, we were thrilled to see Humble Design's donor side operating at such a topnotch level. 
Humble Design Inc	146405		/users/profile/193221	Loren W.	Volunteer	5	12/11/2012	I had volunteered for Humble on a small scale here and there in the past but recently decided to get more involved and with every small contribution I make whether it be juuujjing (decorating)  a home , refinishing furniture or spreading the word I become more and more addicted to the cause. It warms my heart to see the faces on the deserving people that just need a little bit of help to get their lives on a happy roll. I feel so grateful to have found a cause that gives me such instant gratification!  
Humble Design Inc	135274		/users/profile/181137	kristen0967	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	Humble Design helps families turn a house into a home.  Meeting each family in person and learning about their goals is how Humble establishes their needs.  Each family is unique.  Humble respects the moment to moment anxiety of moving and change and provides the essential basics for home and family life.  The in and out process is a key to the success of furnishing over 100 homes in merely a few years.  Donated gently used furniture and household items are collected by our movers, cleaned up and reconditioned and are delivered immediately to the family.  Making a difference in Detroit, one home at a time, neighborhood, and community.
Humble Design Inc	135229	1	/users/profile/181092	Kdub	General Member of the Public	4	11/07/2012	This organization is such an asset to the metro Detroit areas where there are women and children exiting shelters all the time without a clue most times how they are going to get the things necessary to add to their new homes. Feelings of despair and hopelessness set in while watching their children sleep on a hard floor and eat meals on crates. This organization is able to step in with 100% donated goods and provide each family with the necessities needed to make their house a home. What's so unique about this organization is that they don't just stop at providing the furniture for these families, they go many steps further in taking time to decorate each room according to the client's taste.  They are the only organization known of in this area doing this awesome work. Way to go Humble Design. Keep up the GREAT WORK!!!
Humble Design Inc	127293		/users/profile/172340	lak12	Volunteer	5	10/19/2012	Can't even explain the feeling of a move day and getting clients settled into their "new" home!  All the hard work pays off when seeing the smiles on their faces, and the children not wanting to leave their beds! 
Humble Design Inc	127139		/users/profile/151661	smtreger	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	Please watch this https://vimeo.com/51461464 and see first hand how Humble Design changes lives and is uplifting Detroit. They help homeless families get back on their feet and start again. I challenge you to watch the video and NOT cry.
Humble Design Inc	111380		/users/profile/151661	smtreger	Donor	5	05/04/2012	These are the greatest group of working moms. They make sure all your donations go directly to the family. The end result is a beautiful home for deserving families. The people I helped were sleeping on the floor. I was so happy to see my things delivered to them for free and designed as well. Excellent work.

From a blanket drive  to assist those in need after the Tsunami in Japan, to helping the LOPD provide Christmas shopping trips to needy Lake Orion Families, Provideinc is the first to step to the plate, and always hits a homerun.

ProvideInc	270502		/users/profile/359221	Writer	Donor	5	10/31/2015	I have know Lori her entire life.  She has a very kind and giving heart especially when it comes to helping anyone!   This has been exemplified in her own family with the way she has involved and instilled these same values to all of her children as well.  How she accomplishes all she does pretty much says it all.  She has GIVEN Providinc her ALL and it shows.  I wish I lived closer so i could help her.You and your family certainly deserve alot of recognition for all you have done for those in this country and all over the world...Karen Buskirk
ProvideInc	269283	1	/users/profile/325697	bighelp	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	What Provide  and Lori do for others and the community is beyond measure. She truly does make a difference through mentoring and giving back. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to volunteer through some of Provides many charitable activities.
ProvideInc	239767		/users/profile/325697	bighelp	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	My family and especially my daughter has worked with provideInc over the past three years.  I am always amazed at how much good work Lori and ProvideInc does with resources she has.  From working at Gleaners a local food bank to packing care packages for our soldiers, collecting soccer balls, toiletries, backpacks, new or gently used bras all to donate to help the needy.  ProvideInc helps both local and far wherever there is a need.  This is truly a charity that makes a difference.   
ProvideInc	268965		/users/profile/357692	Writer	Board Member	5	10/29/2015	It's been an honor to serve on the board of Provideinc.

ProvideInc	268252	1	/users/profile/356985	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	I have had the pleasure of working with Lori and Steve this last year and have been awed by all the things that Provide Inc is involved with.  Not only do they help the local community they expand their outreach to include other countries as well.  Lori and Steve exude a love of helping others and it shows in their passion to help others.  I have enjoyed working with them and will continue to in the future.  They are a wonderful asset to the community!!
ProvideInc	268092	1	/users/profile/356819	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	We are privileged to work with Providence Inc and Lori Naseef.  We know that the contributions go to great causes, that we strongly believe in as a family. It has also helped opened my teenage daughters eyes to many local and global issues. This non-profit organization is making a difference one small step at a time.
ProvideInc	268003	1	/users/profile/356734	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2015	Provideinc has done so much in the community and abroad. We have been privileged to be a part of their various missions: feeding the hungry, clothing the homeless, helping those who have escaped from domestic violence and praying for peace just a few things that have been done over the years. We encourage others to take part in supporting Provideinc thru service, prayers and donations. Our family is excited to be able to continue to work with them and share their service. This is teaching our children the importance of sharing, caring, empathy, responsibility and love. It is so important to spend time doing for others and being truly grateful for all that you have.  
ProvideInc	267793	1	/users/profile/356518	Writer	Donor	5	10/27/2015	I am pretty particular who I support and who I give money to, if I am being honest.   ProvideInc., is very different from other local, grass roots non-profit organizations.   First of all, the diretor is a woman of honesty and integrity.  Her yes is a yes, and her no is usually a "let me see how we can help in the future".What started as a way to help teach a young group of girls how to serve their local community, has blossomed into a larger organization that partners with a diverse group of folks who are trying to better their community or bless those around them in the name of Jesus.  What Lori and her every growing team do to support others -  inspires me.  Through them, I have been a part of serving the greater community where needs exist, that I never knew were there.  It is my joy to support ProvideInc.
ProvideInc	145569	1	/users/profile/192071	Dwells12	Volunteer	5	12/01/2012	I have worked with Provide Inc. on more than one occasion and all my experiences have been fantastic. The company truly does whatever they can to help people and does so in some pretty unique ways. I appreciate what they do in our local community and world wide. Provide is very quick to work with other organizations and groups in order to put together the best plan of action and assist the needy. Overall, my experiences with Provide Inc have exceeded my expectations. 
ProvideInc	144337	1	/users/profile/190861	kgarry	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	For my senior Capstone project at Oakland University I donated 70 community service hours to a non-profit organization of my choice.  I was able to help Lori, the president of ProvideInc with anything she needed assistance with.  Her passion was honorable and I admire her work in the community so much.  I look up to her and have continued working with her throughout the year.  Provide is a great tool for students to use in high school to gain community service hours, there is a variety of projects they gear their focus on, and anyone is encouraged to help in any way possible.  I have watched Provide be built from the basement of a home moving quickly into their own building space.  It is incredible what they do and where they have come.  I can only hope they continue to grow as an organization. 
ProvideInc	144149	1	/users/profile/190658	Chris103	Donor	5	11/29/2012	ProvideInc was birthed in the home of my friend Lori Naseef.  She saw various needs in the community and the world on one hand.  She saw various groups and individuals who wanted to make a difference, but could not figure out how to connect to make any significant impact on the other.  ProvideInc matches the one hand with the other: local volunteers with local and/or global projects.  A donation as small as dollar makes a huge impact on the life of real people (or animals) in need when matched with a project and team of volunteers who can donate some time and or donation dollars.  ProvideInc operated out of a basement for years so that every dollar donated could be used to help volunteers work on their projects: clothing for the needy, simple necessities/treats to support our military personnel, assistance for animal shelters.  The list has grown as the volunteers have described their vision and Lori has crafted and guided their projects to success.  More people can make more impact through ProvideInc.  I think this charity could and should be replicated in every community!

ProvideInc	143319	1	/users/profile/189766	marciamcgee	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	Being involved in Provide Inc has been a blessing in my life.  I first started collecting items for the various wish lists and then became involved with the stockings for soldiers project.  I have met some wonderful people, including the founder, Lori Naseef. I love how she involves teens in the projects, thereby hopefully inspiring them to volunteer during their lives. Some volunteering I have done gets old -- you get burned out by doing the same thing over and over again. With Provide, there is always a variety of choices.
ProvideInc	143198	1	/users/profile/189629	Penny6	Donor	5	11/27/2012	Thank you Provide Inc. for meeting the needs of so many people and agencies!  Provide Inc. has established themselves as a reliable non profit agency in our community and I highly recommend them to others in need.  I love how they knit the community together and invite us to join in their efforts to collect, assemble, and distribute to those in need.

ProvideInc	143188	1	/users/profile/189616	jackethoops	Client Served	5	11/27/2012	Provide Inc has been a real blessing to my mission teams to Haiti, over the past couple years.  They have blessed us with soccer balls, baby formula, new dresses, soccer uniforms, and other miscellaneous items that we have been able to share with the Haitian people.  I usually take teams of 15-20 people, and Provide Inc is always there to lend a hand with meeting the needs of our teams.  They lighten our burden and enable us to bless the children of Haiti.  I always have so many things to take care of before we go, so Provide Inc's role collecting necessary supplies is a great relief.

Lori was willing to drive a long way, and she was amazingly organized and thorough. She even brought scissors and irons. The ladies who participated enjoyed  using their skills, or not! We had a couple who had never sewn, but Lori had jobs for every skill level and age. I highly recommend Provide, Inc. for any community group, church, or even elementary school class looking for a fun and worthwhile volunteer opportunity.

I had the idea, but had no idea where to take it and how to reach my community on a larger scale.  Lori was so generous with her time, speaking with me on the phone about my strategy and some directions in which I could take my idea.  Then, she hosted several sew-ins with her amazing volunteers and they contributed their time and talents to sewing capes for us.  They then mailed the capes to me for distribution at my local children's hospital.  I am so grateful to Lori for the work that she does and I know that I am just one of many recipients of the good efforts at ProvideInc.

NED Scholars	302545		/users/profile/393679	alisabina11	Volunteer	5	09/04/2016	NED Scholars is a light of hope and motivation in darkness. It is a reliable helping hand for students with high aims but scarce resources. This organization does not seek to make students dependent on the monetary help; rather, along with financial assistance, it trains and assists them through individualized mentorship program and by conducting training sessions on diverse scopes of knowledge. It facilitates students of NED, who are potential engineers of tomorrow, in grooming to become self-reliant and motivated individuals.  I am pursuing a BE degree program in Food Engineering at NED University of Engineering and Technology and is a beneficiary of NED Scholars Scholarship since 2013. As Pakistan houses a growing food industry, I believed that this field would open up multiple horizons of learning and professional success when I selected this program. Unfortunately, when the program officially began, I was disappointed to know that my department has under-developed faculty with no counselor to seek help from. At this time, it was NED Scholars who gave me a boost by providing assistance, through a mentor in the relevant field, who not only supported me academically, but also led me to gain professional and industrial exposure. It has indeed served as a valuable foundation stone for my future endeavors.  Thank you NED Scholars! Regards, Sabina Anwer Ali

NED Scholars	302489	2	/users/profile/393625	RaisBadshah	Volunteer	5	09/03/2016	       My name is Rais Badshah and I am a student of First Year Electrical Engineering at NED UET Karachi. I belong to backward area of Pakistan, FATA, and currently residing in a house of rent in Karachi. My father is paralysed on right side after stroke and is unable to speak. I am the sole earning member of the family. I have 12 dependent family members. My three brothers are studying. I had to work part time and teach students to earn bread for my family, continuing education for my brothers and treatment of my father.        I have passed NED UETs entrance test in 2013 but I was unable to pay my admission fees at that time. In-spite of having 86% of marks in intermediate, I have wasted 02 years after intermediate. I worked in a factory to earn my livings and save money for admission. However, later on, through NED SCHOLARS SCHOLARSHIP, with their help and support through their scholarship; I am now able to handle all these problems.        Here, I want to clear the point that this is not only a financial support program, but a direct deep insight into the genuine problems (the issues refraining from getting education) of the students. Resolving those problems, sitting thousands of miles away from us is indeed blessings of Almighty Allah, wonderful, admirable and beyond the expectations. They feel your pain and pangs as you feel it and teach you what the term humanity stands for? Hence, I can say that "The scholarship program with a heart and soul".        Besides all, they conduct seminars and webinars for career development, provide mentors & laptops to help in studies directly, internships for practical skills development, and projects funds to the students to be successful professional Engineers and bring them equal to the level of other students(classmates). After selection in NED Scholars; one feels confident and kicks of inferiority complex.        Finally, their kind and benevolent conduct especially Dr. Sohail Ahmed, cannot be expressed in words. The words, "REMEMBER, ALL PROBLEMS ARE SHORT LIVED...", are un-forgetably soothing. I recall those words whenever facing problems. NED Scholars has helped me in various aspects and now, feeling as light as a feather, for most of my burdens are shaken off my shoulders. I can easily concentrate on my studies many times greater than previous semester. When I think about my higher studies without NED Scholars, I get the sign: "Impossible".        By the Grace of Lord Almighty I have got 3.57 GPA in my first semester. InshaALLAH! with the help of support, encouragement, and with special guidance and training under NED SCHOLARs I will try my best to improve further.         I am the luckiest student having such a Scholarship at such a perilous period of my life, enabling to stand on my own feet in future and be a human like them.

I have been associated with NED scholars from 2013 and would like to share my views with this brilliant organization.This organization not only supports the students financially to meet their academic needs but also conducts different seminars and webinars for the improvement of our techincal,presentation and communication skills by participating in these activities. Furthermore,they offer internships to their students to have industrial exposure which is quite necessary thing for the students. I am amazed and happy to see that despite all these things,NED SCHOLARS also work for the techincal improvement of the students by offering different techincal projects to their students alongwith their funding and expenditure. I am extremely happy to see them working for their scholars without any motive. By observing the members/mentors of NED Scholars,specially Dr.Sohail,the one who always remains in contact  regarding our academics and routine on approximately daily basis and solving our queries by assigning different mentors and making our contact with different professionals within our range and access. It's my pledge from 2013 that I will be the part of this organization in future and will make possible efforts for the help and need of the students. A salute to each and every member of NED Scholars and specially for Dr. Sohail who is my teacher,my senior,my mentor,the most respectable and honourable for me.I wish a best of luck to this organization and I always pray for the betterment and more improvement of this organiation.May Allah bless you all and give power and strength to continue this noble purpose,aameen :)

It was with their tremendous support that trained me to a successful engineer. I lost my father when I was only 12 years old. My mom raised me by teaching in a local muhalla school. It was NED SCHOLARS scholarship (at that time it was called  NED Alumni MECH 80-81 scholarship) that helped me to pay my fee. I also got support with laptop and several trainings in various engineering tools. Thank you all especially Dr Sohail. It would be very difficult to make through NED without their support.

The mind blowing services of the Scholars, Organizers and Sponsors of NED Scholars can't be described into a single word. They are providing different funds, scholarship, laptops to the needy and deserving students, so that their education needs and financial strains are fulfilled and their studies are completed without any hurdles.                I'm highly appreciated these marvellous services of NED Scholars with my heart and soul.
NED Scholars	301667	4	/users/profile/392601	Jasir	Volunteer	5	08/27/2016	I am a sophomore of Mechanical Engineering and a recipient of NED SCHOLARS scholarship. This scholarship has made a lot of difference in my studies. I want to thank the alumni of NED SCHOLARS for paying back the community. It is a dedicated organization supporting their scholars financially and academically. They have arranged different programs including mentorship , training sessions  helping the students to develop professional career.

One great feature is that they don't just award the scholarship but hold the hands of students till graduation helping out with academic and personal issues. The net work supports kids to find  internships as well. Not your ordinary non profit org but a real helping hand! Keep up the good work guys
NED Scholars	301626	5	/users/profile/392606	Syed2	Volunteer	5	08/27/2016	I would like to thank NED scholars for providing me support in finance and education. The services provided by this organization can't be transformed into words. They're providing laptops, career counseling programs, mentor-ship program as  well as scholarship funds to the needy students.They're really sharing the worries of mankind. Their efforts are marvelous with real zeal to serve the helpless people. Thank you so much NED Scholars ! 
NED Scholars	301608	4	/users/profile/392576	GlobalSports	Volunteer	5	08/26/2016	The charity has worked in Pakistan to promote education by providing scholarships and mentorships. Hours spent by their mentors has improved the skill set of several students. 
NED Scholars	301765	4	/users/profile/392758	Tabish A.,	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	The urge and enthusiasm of hunting true talent throughout NED University, cultivating that true talent throughout the student's journey and then transforming it into a complete successful independent identity which is now ready to become another helping hand for another emerging talent in the community, are just some of the many exceptional qualities possessed by NED Scholars. They have infrastructural level struggles for this purpose and they pursue these goals by conducting seminars, mentor-ship programs and highly skilled training on practical subjects like interview guides, OOPs and Six Sigma Certifications. I'm a proud beneficiary of this honored non-profit organization.Regards,Tabish Anis
NED Scholars	301605	4	/users/profile/392580	shamswk	Volunteer	5	08/26/2016	The wonderful way of paying back. I have been associated with this organization for quite few years. Their support to the needy and deserving is commendable. Besides monetary help, providing mentorship, arranging seminars/webinars are few to list down. Remarkable growth in preparing world class scholars proves untiring efforts of organizers and confidence of supporters. 
Global Village Ministries Inc	311203		/users/profile/320768	Deborah116	Volunteer	5	10/16/2016	Global Village Ministries mission trips have a lasting impact on all who travel to Kenya with this group.  I have so many wonderful memories, but my favorites are the time we spent at The Olmalaika Home, one of GVM's long term projects.  The Home provides a safe, loving environment for young girls who would otherwise be subject to Female Genital Mutilation and/or Early Childhood Marriage.  The girls receive their education and so much more.  Despite sometimes traumatic beginnings, the girls who live at The Olmalaika Home are always smiling.  They know they are loved and it shows.  I can't say enough about the impact this makes in their lives (and those who visit).  These girls are going to change  these outdated traditions and they will have an impact on other girls they meet in ending FGM and Early Childhood Marriage.  I strongly suggest you consider a donation, or better yet, travel to Kenya with GVM and see The Olmalaika Home for yourself!!
Global Village Ministries Inc	255672	5	/users/profile/320768	Deborah116	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	I first traveled to Kenya with Global Village Ministries in 2013. One of our stops was The Olmalaika Home which is their largest long term project. Olmalaika is a Home for young girls who would otherwise be subject to Female Genital Mutilation or early childhood marriage.  The girls, ages  5 to 16 are able to continue their education in a safe, loving environment. They have a Maasai matron which allows them to grow up with all of the positive aspects of their culture. On our visit, the girls all welcomed us with huge smiles and proudly showed us their rooms. We were able to play with them and talk to them while they did the laundry outside. Many of the older girls expressed the desire to become teachers or doctors. It is amazing to see the happy faces of these children who came from such frightening situations. The President of GVM (Kim DeWitt) is one of the most caring people I have ever met. She was raised in Kenya for part of her childhood and has a real heart for these girls. I have continued to do what I can to help The Olmalaika Home since my visit, and fully intend to go back there on a future GVM trip. This place is changing lives!!
Global Village Ministries Inc	236711	6	/users/profile/320768	Deborah116	Volunteer	5	01/12/2015	i traveled to Kenya with a friend who is a nurse in October 2013 with Global Village Ministries, knowing very little about the organization. The entire trip was far better than i hoped it would be.  The main purpose of GVM's trips are to provide medical and dental care to outlying areas of Kenya where it is desperately needed.  I am not in the medical profession, but was able to help in other ways.  The President of GVM grew up in Kenya and has many contacts there, and I felt like I was in good hands the entire time.  One of their main projects is The Olmalaika Home (see www.theolmalaikahome.org) which is a home for young Maasai girls who have been or will be victims of Female Genital Mutilation or early childhood marriage.  I was so impressed with the facility and the girls, and it is evident that their lives have changed for the better by living there.  They are safe and able to continue their education.  I fully intend to support them financially and hope to go back to Kenya some time this year with GVM. 
Global Village Ministries Inc	297553		/users/profile/388355	PatrickEngle	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	I have just returned from my 5th July mission trip with GVM and Kim and Kamunge. I must say that the highlight of the trip is always the visit to the O-Home. My family and I feel so very blessed to have connected with Kim 5 years ago and have enjoyed partnering with her and the girls at the home. We have chosen to sponsor two girls and have seen tremendous growth in them as young women and students. We are excited for what the future holds for these young ladies and we know that their lives have been changed as a result of Kim and Kamunge's efforts to make a difference. We look forward to many more trips and serving along side them and shinning for Jesus.
Global Village Ministries Inc	271268	1	/users/profile/360081	rossclan	Donor	5	11/05/2015	My family went to Kenya in 2015 with Global Village Ministries and our lives have been changed forever.   The ministry conducts medical, dental and optical clinics in underserved areas of Kenya.  Additionally, they operate the Olmalaika Home in Sekenani Kenya.  This home serves at a safe home for young girls who are at risk of early marriage and female genital mutilation. The girls are loved and cared for, but, most importantly, they are also educated.  We sponsor a young woman through this ministry and are more than confident that the money we send for the home, ministry and support are wisely spent.  In fact, they seem to have an amazing ability to stretch a dollar.  
Global Village Ministries Inc	261088	2	/users/profile/195288	Tracy38	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	In September 2015, Pastors David Ole Letitia & Josephat Ole Mashati of Enduata Naishu in Loita, Kenya identified a young, disabled girl named Kironua. She is 7, orphaned and had lost both of her feet in a fire.  Through the compassion and care of Kim DeWitt and the pastors, Kironua got the medical attention needed, was fitted for prosthetic feet, and now happily resides in the Olmalaika Home in Kenya, a boarding school for ask-risk girls.  I thank God every day for people like Kim DeWitt and her staff that reach out and expediently help these children in need.  They are truly making a difference, one child at a time. 
Global Village Ministries Inc	260395	2	/users/profile/348981	CoachR	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	I was able to travel with GVM in July 2015 on a medical/dental missions trip. It was an amazing experience and highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested. A once in a lifetime experience. We provided medical care to people in very remote Kenya that rarely receive that kind of care.  Outside of that we had a special projects group that installed a solar panel system to put lights in to a local school.  GVM is also connected to the Olmaliaka Home that helps young women in the community escape childhood marriages.  Rest assured that giving money to GVM is a good decision and the money is going to truly help people.  Kim is a wonderful person that is making a difference in hundreds of lives. And you can help!
Global Village Ministries Inc	259765	2	/users/profile/348287	Ed__37	Donor	5	09/26/2015	I'm in the medical field as an ICU nurse with 33 yrs of experience.  My mother and father were missionaries back in the 70's.  My mom has always had a passion for helping others, but especially other women.  I've had the pleasure of going on 2 trips with GVM.  The first trip was back before the Olmalaika Home had been built.  The 2nd trip was in 2014 but due to my work schedule I had to leave early and did not get to visit the Olmalaika Home.  My mother recently passed away and we asked to have money sent to help finish the inside of the Olmalaika Home instead of sending flowers.  We had enough donations sent to finish off one of the last remaining rooms at the home.  We got a picture of the plaque that will be on the wall in that room in honor of my mom and also received a super nice book with pictures of the girls and the home.  I have donated on different occasions to GVM and would highly recommend them as they make very good use of the funds donated to them.  Also, Kim is a very high octane lady who has a passion for the people of Kenya and the Kenyan girls who are at risk for female genital mutilation and early childhood marriage.  She leads a very highly organized trip providing free medical and dental assistance to the people of Kenya who might not otherwise be able to receive or afford it.  I would highly recommend you to go on a mission trip with Global Village Ministries which includes a visit to the Olmalaika home and or also consider them for your donation if you are unable to travel for whatever reason.  The reward of serving and or helping others will be highly satisfying for you and you can be sure that whatever help you give, whether personal or financial, will be highly appreciated and put to good use.  
Global Village Ministries Inc	257073	2	/users/profile/345477	Katp1	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2015	After seeing Kim's enthusiasm for helping the young girls of Kenya, we decided to sponsor through Global Village Ministries. Best decision ever! We have seen a young orphaned girl who was to be married at age eight because her grandmother could not afford to feed her go from an unsmiling hopeless child, to a beautiful beaming young lady. She is so full of love. We get her picture at least three times a year, along with handwritten personal letters. We are able to send small packages to her.  Kim does an amazing job helping us help these precious children. Our African daughter now has hope! Something she would never would have had without Global Village Ministries. 
Global Village Ministries Inc	257021	2	/users/profile/345427	DanaeC	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I went on the July 2014 and March 2015 trips and spent a considerable amount of time at The Olmalaika Home in 2014. This is a top notch organization and Kim is a fearless loader who will do her absolute best to put together a meaningful and well executed visit to Kenya. Having lived in Kenya for a year, I couldn't recommend a better organization to guide you in missions or through Kenya.
Global Village Ministries Inc	257018	2	/users/profile/345424	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I had the awesome privilege to serve on a trip in 2013 through GVM. This was my first trip off the east coast of the U.S., much less my first mission trip. I must say GVM truly has a heart to serve the people of Kenya, especially the young girls who are at high risk of FGM and childhood marriage. Everything is so well planned and every detail covered. Kim and her support staff are amazing. I still laugh because I had gone on this trip thinking I could make a difference what I did not anticipate is how deeply this trip would impact and make a difference in me. It was honestly life changing to say the least. So I challenge you if you are contemplating a trip with GVM don't hesitate, just go!!! You will be so glad you did!! Just know that when you return home afterward  you will be missing a part of your heart which will forever stay in Kenya and with the people you had the privilege of serving there. Angie Miller

Global Village Ministries Inc	256647	3	/users/profile/345040	Ramona R.	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	My husband and I went on the October 2014 trip, and had a wonderful time.  The team was so marvelous I feel blessed just to know all of them. So little amount of money helps so many over there.  If you donate you will  save a little child from FGM and give her an opportunity to live a self directed life.  You could help some one have a medical or dental issue resolved that would otherwise suffer. What could be better than that?  
Global Village Ministries Inc	256492	5	/users/profile/344886	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	My experiences with Global Village Ministries have been truly life-changing.  GVM is making a difference in Kenya both by the services that they provide as well as through the spreading of the Word among the rural villagers in Kenya.  I have been on other mission trips, but my trip to Kenya in 2013 was by far the best led and orchestrated mission trip I have been on.  When you think about going on a mission trip, you should definitely think about the GVM opportunities.
Global Village Ministries Inc	256430	6	/users/profile/344828	WinK	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	The work that Global Village Ministries does with the girls of the Olmalaika Home is very moving.  These girls have endured a horrible event in their lives (FGM), and yet to see their smiles and joyous excitement at the Olmalaika Home will bring tears to your eyes - tears of joy!  One life at a time, and we can change the world.
Global Village Ministries Inc	256426	6	/users/profile/344824	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I am heading out on my third consecutive GVM October trip this year.  This is by far the best Mission Program with which I have been associated.   Some may be apprehensive about joining a medical/dental mission trip if they have no medical/dental experience, but  the trip coordinator does a splendid job of finding valuable contributions for all who participate.  October in Kenya is a wonderful time of year, and I encourage all to consider this as their choice for missionary work.
Global Village Ministries Inc	256381	5	/users/profile/344784	JannaVan	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I participated in a life-changing missions trip with GVM in March 2015. Global Village Ministries gave me an incredible opportunity to see the beauty of Kenya as well as witness the ways that God is actively working there. One of those ways included The Olmalaika Home, which provides food, shelter, and purpose to girls that were otherwise destined for torture and exploitation. The need for more places of refuge and more people like Kim DeWitt (president of GVM, founder of the Olmalaika Home) is overwhelming. Her love and passion for people was evident immediately. I can't wait to visit again with GVM!
Global Village Ministries Inc	256235	4	/users/profile/344629	Ray_27	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I have served on many Medical and Dental mission trips that are very well organized by Kim Dewitt and they have helped many needy people, they have started Olmalaika, a home for girls to give them a safe and healthy home.They have given many medications to the needy. I  have enjoyed helping on these trips.  Ray Mayor MD
Global Village Ministries Inc	256102	5	/users/profile/344495	trvlDeb	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I have personally gone on a trip to Kenya with GVM & it was a truly wonderful experience. Because the GVM president grew up in Kenya she is able to know the real needs of the people & tailor the experience so that you are really able to provide essential services to the people you meet & as the volunteer you come away enriched by the experience.  The mission experiences were wonderful & the Safari & sightseeing time was icing on the cake. I came back interested in continuing to help & after the Olmalaika Home was opened began sponsoring a little girl. Nothing is more rewarding to see someone blossom to their full potential while knowing you are helping them avoid the emotional & physical scars of FGM. I am so happy & proud to be involved with this nonprofit because I can help so personally & not just send money (although sending money isn't bad!) & know that it is truly being used for the people it is intended for & not inflated administrative expenses. 
Global Village Ministries Inc	256028	6	/users/profile/344417	nschwer	Advisor	5	09/10/2015	If you had only one organization to support and donate to, make it this one. Having been part of the GVM team on many occasions and seeing the need first hand made it easy to see that real needs of really needy girls in the Maasai Community are being met by real people, who all benefit in one way or another from this exchange. Most of all the girls who get to chose a much better path for their lives than the one forced on them by their own culture. All this helping is being done respectful of the local value system, which is a feat in and of itself. Please continue to help so more lives can be impacted in such a positive way!
Global Village Ministries Inc	255925	7	/users/profile/344309	Writer	Donor	5	09/10/2015	As a woman who cares about the suffering of others & often feeling so helpless to do anything Global Village Ministries is a womderful organization where I have been able to help save a young woman from going through the barbaric procedure of female genital mutilation & as still a child be married off against her will  to an older man, arranged by her brother.  In addition to providing her a safe place to live & she was able to get some education that will help her as she grows up & needs to support herself.  Very gratifing to me that I could help her as well as having a organization that supports her & many other young women in her condition.  Thank you Global Village.  Also grateful for the new home that they built.

Global Village Ministries Inc	255778	7	/users/profile/344165	Deborah2015	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	In 2011, I participated in a Missions trip through Global Village Ministries.  The personal growth that I gained from this trip was life changing.  Kim Dewitt, the President of Global Village Ministry has such a genuine caring heart for Kenya and the Maasai people. I will never forget the conversations that we had with the young ladies at the Olmalaika Home.  The life stories of these young rescued ladies show the strength of character of these little ones. Their desire for education and opportunities that will enable them to serve their people.  I was so impressed with the difference that Kim and her team is making in these peoples lives. Not only in rescuing these young girls from Female Genital Mutilation, but the impact that the medical and dental clinics are having in the lives of the villagers. I still tell people of the effect this trip had on me.  I look forward to going again.

And I had the opportunity to visit the Olmalaika Home and meet all the beautiful girls there and spend some time to speak with them about there life and dreams they are so interesting and inspiring. I had the opportunity to here them sing. WOW What voices little Angels. If you ever have a opportunity to go to Kenya Please contact Kim it will be the best trip you will Ever take in your life.
Global Village Ministries Inc	255753	5	/users/profile/344137	Jtengle7	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Global village ministries and the olmalaika home do an incredible work within the Maasai community in Kenya. Having gone on two july trips in a row, I have seen the amazing things Kim and her team do to provide care for areas that desperately need it. The medical care these people receive is essential to their well being and provides a substantial help for the community. The areas we go to are very remote and access to medical facilities is difficult if not impossible to get to. The people are far more gracious, kind, generous, genuine, and hospitable than you could find anywhere in the world. This is an incredible place, and global village ministries and the olmalaika home do an incredible work.
Global Village Ministries Inc	255752	4	/users/profile/344136	Lyndel D.	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I have made three trips to Kenya with Global Village Ministries....what a life changing experience.  I went with the idea of helping others, but found that I gained more in personal growth and personal satisfaction than I could conceive of giving (although we provided a lot of medical care to under served populations).  My wife and I have also sponsored a child at the Olmalaika Home for the past few years.  Also had the joy of meeting our sponsored girl on our trip last year....what an experience! Lyndel Dickerson
Global Village Ministries Inc	255739	6	/users/profile/344123	Sheri18	Donor	5	09/10/2015	 My daughter and I recently became aware of the opportunity to sponsor a nine-year-old girl Just saved  by the Olmalaika Home from the horrific fate of circumcision (FGM -  female genital mutilation) & early childhood marriage being arranged by the father who had abandoned the family. The 36 girls  presently living there have all been rescued from a similar fate. At Olmakaika Home,  these girls find a safe and loving environment, educational opportunities they otherwise would not have, and all their needs are met.    There is also opportunity to become home sponsors, providing funds to help keep the home running smoothly.   Kim DeWitt,  founder and president of Global Villiage Ministries,  was raised in Kenya and pours her heart and soul into this ministry.  She takes teams of volunteers to the outlying villages to provide free medical, dental, and other care to those in need.  GVM provides many ongoing opportunities to make a difference in so many lives in a personal, tangible way.

We couldn't have been more impressed by every aspect of this organization - from the initial presentation at the hospital, to the nurses who were available at all hours to answer questions, to my husband's nurse and social worker who visited him at home. My husband was wary of starting hospice care, but after the early visits he looked forward to them and knew that they were helping him live the best life he could.  I will be forever grateful for the amazing care he received from Angela.

She had no regard that my father was being over medicated and under hydrated.  Martha just said "he will die when his body is ready".  She should have said, "your father is going to die of lack of hydration, starvation, and acidosis from over medication."  Angela Hospice, or at least this nurse, was very uncaring and not completely fulfilling my fathers request to stay hydrated.

Angela Hospice Home Care Inc	179759	2	/users/profile/236395	jleffy	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	My aunt spent a little over a year at Angela Hospice.  The staff took amazing care of her and made her as comfortable as possible during that time.   The religious and spiritual support and services are so beneficial as well. This spring we thought it was the end and I could not believe how wonderful the staff was to her and the family.  The priest and one of the sisters came and performed the sacrament of the sick and prayed with the family.   Many staff members came by to see her, ones that were not involved in her care that day, to say goodbye. Miraculously she came out of it and again the immediate attention and care she received was exceptional.   She passed away yesterday and although I was not able to be there I am confident that she passed as peacefully as possible thanks to this amazing facility and its staff.  I would recommend Angela Hospice to anyone in need of its services.
Angela Hospice Home Care Inc	178765	1	/users/profile/235391	Sheila MM	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	 I knew immediately upon entering the Care Center for an informational meeting, that this was where my father needed to be, and by the grace of God, a space opened for him.  My father spent his last days in the care of the wonderful people at Angela's Hospice. Words cannot express my family's gratitude for the compassionate, dignified care that he, and the rest of us, received during his time at Angela's.  Staff treated him with kindness, respect and love and for that our family is eternally grateful. Every single person with whom we had contact was considerate of our dad and also of our family's feelings and needs. The housekeeping staff asking if we minded the room being dusted; a Nurses Aide noticing us using electronics for writing and bringing us a journal to write in so that we could share our thoughts as we sat with our father; volunteers arranging flowers for the rooms, bringing a snack cart around, or providing a warm meal. These things may seem minor but they make such a big difference to a family facing the loss of a loved one.  Nobody plans to need Hospice for a loved one but if it becomes necessary for your family as it did for mine, I would give Angela Hospice the highest possible recommendation.
Angela Hospice Home Care Inc	178641	1	/users/profile/235270	chsary720	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	My aunt was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer in April 2010.  It was devastating to us as her family, and we supported her through two rounds of chemotherapy. When it became obvious that chemotherapy wasn't working she wanted Angela hospice to take care of her at this end of her life. She was able to stay in her apartment and lived out her last 5 weeks in her familiar surroundings. The social worker, nurses, and really the entire staff were nothing short of a blessing.  No question was ever unanswered.  After her passing I was able to receive counseling free of charge.  This is how I believe I managed to endure my grief and loss.  It was so comforting to be able to talk with someone who understood all my emotions.  I will always have a place in my heart for Angela hospice and will never hesitate to whole heartedly refer others to their care!
Angela Hospice Home Care Inc	178519	1	/users/profile/235150	tae2859	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	My mom died from cancer in June of 2009 at the age of 61.  As you can never prepare yourself for losing a loved one so young., Angela  Hospice went above and beyond to make this period of time more bearable.  My mom died at home and the nurse from Angela Hospice came and bathed her, changed her clothes and even brushed her teeth prior to the funeral home picking her up.  We thanked her for doing that and she responded with, " everyone deserves to go with dignity"  The social worker then came to our home and immediately set up bereavement services for my then 4 year old daughter who spent every day with her grandma.  Within two days, she met with Sally.  Sally was amazing with my daughter.  I was so distraught over losing my mom and then to see my young child so hurt and angry was unbearable.  Sally has forever changed our lives.  Her caring and compassionate ways are beyond words.  She would send letters to my daughter in the mail (which every 4 year old loves to get mail!)  I attended the "Getting through the Holidays", "Lift you up in Laughter" event and the children's Christmas event the first year.  It was exactly what my family and I needed.  We participate  in the Walk of Remembrance each year.  I cannot say enough good things about Angela Hospice.  The people that work there are truly amazing people that will forever have a special place in my heart.

My mother battled COPD for as long as I can remember. Finally the meds were no longer able to manage her breathing and hospice care was recommended. Mom was moved to Angela Hospice where she passed within a few days. The staff at Angela worked diligently to keep her pain free and they all took such tender loving care of her needs. But beyond that they took care of me and my family and three months after her passing they still continue to care for us. Every single staff member from the doctors to the nurses to the aides and volunteers are angels in human form and I hope Angela Hospice gets all the recognition they deserve.

High quality, state-of-the-art care for families dealing with the toughest times of life.  Knowing that such an organization is available, in a beautiful facility, offering compassionate care and support to patients and families.  For anyone that is not aware of the benefit of hospice services, when dealing with end of life issues, families would benefit greatly from contacting Angela Hospice for support - the sooner, the better.  Knowing what to expect, how to best help the loved one who is dying and, after, utilizing the grief support groups that the center hosts.  SO helpful ....

My sister and I took care of her.  Angela Hospice far exceeded our expectations and the expectations of my family.  They were there for us through every step of the process, including panicked 3am phone calls from my sister and I.  They even sent nurses to the house in the middle of the night to help us if we could not handle a situation. This organization is made up of the most compassionate people I have ever met.  It is worthy of every cent that it receives from donations.  We are so grateful to them for allowing us to deliver our Mother to heaven in peace and at home while we held her hand.  I believe it is one of the greatest gifts we were ever able to give to her.

Words can not describe the support, professionalism and compassion of the agency and their staff. They are a lifeline to the transition to death for friends and family coping with the process. When we first arrived at the residential facility, chocolate chips cookies were baking, a harpist was playing and beautiful nuns seemed to float by with the sweetest smiles...mom and I laughed and said we were in "heaven" and we were as close as possible on this earth. Angela Hospice had a great influence on my daughter; today she is a hospice social worker paying it forward.

This organization puts patient care and their mission of providing compassionate, Christ-like care to all who need it as the top priority.  Their facility is beyond compare:  beautiful, state-of-the-art equipment and filled with compassionate and expert care givers.  Many people do not understand how helpful hospice services are to the family of the loved one as well.  My one message would be to contact Angela Hospice earlier rather than later to learn about all of the support that is available.  Even if you do not use Angela's hospice services, you can take advantage of superior grief counseling after the loss of your loved one.  Can't say enough good things about this organization.

Whenever I have friends come into town to visit, the Heidelberg Project is on the list of places I'm sure to take them to get a feel for Detroit.  They are always amazed!  Once, a friend was visiting from Sweden and I took here there. Tyree was there working on a project and asked us to help- very memorable!

The language of art surpasses all barriers and speaks volumes about life and the way we live it.  The Heidelberg Project challenges each of us who engage in it to rethink our social and economical judgements.  It validates our varied cultures and backgrounds and asks us to consider and rethink our priorities.  It invites those of all ages and levels of understanding to see that we each have a job to do, we are important as individuals and our comments and actions do matter.  Here is a project that has thoughtfully provoked and engaged a world audience...and it started with a kid, a paint brush and some paint.

The H.P. is the first place that I had visited in D and then it s one of my favourite place around the world. Education, understanding, openmind, arts, music, colors, people, creation, improvement of man...all these things mean a lot to me. I found a lot of things in H.P. that I couldn't experienced in France in meeting people. For all these things H.P., Tyree Guyton and his works, Jenenne Whitfield and more generally Detroit changed my life and help me to keep faith in what I believe for so long!!

The Heidelberg Project	28297	6	/users/profile/29357	terri1	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2010	A visit to the Project on a Saturday is a pure pleasure and an artistic experience. Artist Tyree Guyton is very approachable and kind to visitors and is very often on site to meet guests. The block and surrounding areas are a continuously evolving canvas that takes everyday objects and juxtaposes them in the context of local, national and global events and situations. It is folk art both unique to Detroit and universal in scope. My hope is that the Heidelberg Project continues to grow and evolve as not just an installation and experience but as an inspiration to scores of young artists worldwide.
The Heidelberg Project	28248	4	/users/profile/29314	kitosho	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2010	I was introduced to the Heidelberg project by my older sister.  She showed me a piece that she bought in a heidelberg auction:  A clay pot with a blue shoe in it.  It didn't make any sense to me at the time, but when she took me there for the first time it all clicked.  Converting dilapidated houses, the things that other people had thrown away, into something beautiful - and LOUD.  Tyree Guyton isn't simply speaking to the denizens of Detroit - he's calling out nation-wide class divide without subtlety or pretense.  The Heidelberg Project is, to me, the most important piece of art in the world, because it has completely transformed my view of humanity.  I make it a point to go there every few months, just to remind myself what real art is all about.

The Heidelberg Project	27984	6	/users/profile/29046	katibridge	Donor	5	02/11/2010	I have been paying attention to the Heidelberg project ever since I heard of and visited it during an art gallery event. I believe it is a great potential model of the way that art can strengthen communities, and of how healthy and empowering a consistent "grass roots" effort can be.  The "dot" theme is sheer genius and deceptively simple.  The dots unify the project and seem to me to become/symbolize creative and communicative particles that open doors to expansive experience wherever you stand, as well as creating pathways to link you with the world.  They take on life and become encouraging friends in a challenging time.  This reflects the project as a whole.

It is powerful and amazing as art and education.

He actually invited me to participate and paint some dots on some of the projects! That was my highlight of visiting Detroit. I absolutely LOVE all of the creativity and out of the ordinary things within this project.  Mr. Guyton takes everyday things that people would throw away and makes them into a beautiful artwork with a purpose.  He is extremely talented and has such a great idea and goal.  If you have not experienced the Heidelberg project yet, you are missing out.  I highly recommend it to ANYONE.
The Heidelberg Project	27918	4	/users/profile/28989	germ415	Donor	5	02/11/2010	My fiance and I had traveled out to Detroit for a wedding. It was our first visit to Detroit and the groom told me to check out The Heidelberg Project. As we approached the neighborhood, we parked and started wandering around the exhibit. My fiance noticed a man sweeping the streets and performing some yard maintenance so she went over to ask a few questions. Well, the person was Tyree Guyton and he spent the next few hours of his day walking around with us explaining details of the exhibit and answering every question she and I had for him. He was a very impressive person from the way he carried himself to the ideas and artistic expressions he had created in such a desolate area. We met other volunteers around the neighborhood that were just as friendly and helpful as Tyree. The exhibit to me was amazing, to see someone put that much time and effort into their own neighborhood so that the people of the area had something to be proud of was simply awesome. Detroit is struggling and the area around the exhibit is as poor and desolate as I have seen in the U.S.A., but the exhibit brought an aura to the area that puts visitors at ease and is a beacon of hope in a city that is desperate for optimism. As we left the area I could tell that my fiance had just taken her first walk through a poverty stricken area and she was amazed at the kindness of the locals and how one idea could provide so much life to area that would normally seem dead to a visitor like ourselves. The attitude and ideas expressed in the exhibit are the type of ideals the USA needs right now in order to pull itself out of this economic crisis. Tyree Guyton is one solid man running one incredible non-profit.

So often, money is poured into artful expression that only hangs in museums that are frequented by members of a privileged  part of our society, and therefore only serves to entertain this privileged class.  The Heidelberg Project, however, has not only in some ways redefines the concept of breathtaking artwork, but has simultaneously transformed an entire community in Detroit.

It is my "go to place" when out of town company visits our city. During Thanksgiving 2009 weekend, I scheduled a fun Detroit day and again brought down my family. After a visit to the Avalon Bakery, we drove to HP. Tyree greeted us warmly and invited my son, Zak to paint a polka dot on his house. Huge honor! We took lots of photos and felt like it was a real big honor to be present during this historical opportunity. My guests were blown away by the experience of visiting this living and breathing tribute to creativity. As much as I love it and appreciate the artful and political statements he makes, I have to say, having my son be part of this Detroit legacy will never leave my soul. Thank you to Tyree, Sharon and all the other artists who are inspired by outsider art...Heidelberg is a gift our city gives to everyone who takes the time to really see Detroit.

It is a place of greatbeauty in a broad and worldly sense.  Indeed,Tyree Guyton and Heidelberg is known and respected internationally.Heidelberg is both a symbol and reality of what can emerge from the ordinary to the extraordinary when talent, energy and purposecombine.  The Heidelberg Project has given hope and a new concept of beauty to the City of Detroit. It has inspired many, young and oldto see their surroundings and their city in anew and creative way.

The Heidelberg Project	27828	4	/users/profile/28910	techne-art	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2010	Detroit is an area that is overrun by so much crime and community detachment. The Heidelberg Project allows for community members to use creative skills to make connections with others, solve problems, and help construct not destruct their own environment. The process of using objects that have been disposed of and bringing them back to life in a completely new form could be used as a metaphor for lessons that the participants could be learning in society.

The fellow volunteers are so sweet and kind and the clients are very appreciative. I have worked in other nonprofit establishments, and rarely do you get to interact directly with the clients like you do at Yad Ezra. It is a very rewarding experience.

We  impressed  by the way this non-profit  branch operated. All  staff and volunteers are treated us with respect and dignity at most friendly manner and very helpful in choosing for us one particular kind product from what is available on a shelves. And there are always some "extras" like fresh vegetables and fruits etc. and other "goodies". The place is always clean and the whole process is well organised even in most crowded evenings before Holidays. And there is always some thing special (including information about particular Holidays). We feel privileged to be under care of such a thoughtful people at a time when we in need.We wishing them all the best in their life.Zarema and Valeriy Sandler

They seem to be very financially responsible, in that there is a limited number of paid staff.

The volunteers work to make every clients experience one of dignity.  When circumstances are reversed, several clients become new volunteers themselves.  It is a smooth process and the clients help themselves to groceries, fresh fruits and vegetable, basics such as sugar and flour, and even fresh poultry when it is available.  The Executive Director  and the Board make efficient use of resources and are well regarded in the  communities they serve.

Yad Ezra does it with respect to dignity, while preserving the age long culture and tradition of Kashrut.  It achieves it by mobilizing the community in support of such an honorable cause though giving and volunteer participation second to none.  For twenty years we have consistently increased the level and amount of support to those in need, while improving our own fiscal stability and operational efficiency.
Yad Ezra Inc	175319		/users/profile/231659	vgreen	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	Wonderful group, well organized, innovative, and effective in setting and meeting goals.  They're very good about using monetary gifts wisely, and their physical warehouse is beautifully kept.  It's not easy to run a food program, and it's even tougher when the laws of kashrut must be observed in addition to ordinary governmental regulations.  Yad Ezra does a great job of following both sets of rules.

The organization has expanded its services from primarily a food bank to providing school breakfasts and lunches while teaching good nutrition to the students its serves.  These meals include fresh fruits and vegetables not normally a part of the students' diets. Yad Ezra has also provided toiletries and other goods in insure a healthy environment for its clients.  I am amazed that Yad Ezra continues to increase its services to its ever-growing numbers of clients through the use of countless volunteers.

The clientel are treated with respect and as a person who deals with them regularly, they become like your friends.  The volunteers are caring and the staff are generous with their time.  My wife and I are also regular donors and supporters.  This has to be one of the best forms of tikun olam.
Yad Ezra Inc	23254	9	/users/profile/24325	srkalt	Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	As a volunteer and a long-time donor to Yad Ezra I have found it to be one of the most successful organizations I have encountered.  They treat their clients with dignity and respect; they secure the best values so they maximize the purchasing power of donations; and they involve all levels of their community - children, adults and seniors - in their activities.  I started as a twice weekly volunteer in 2001 when my business was adversely impacted by 9/11 and had plenty of "empty" time and since then it has been one sense of fullfilment after another.

The organization is run by amazing professionals and a dedicated board.  All of which focus completely altruistically on feeding the hungry in the metropolitan Detroit community ... a community that is unfortunately growing.

Please think of Yad Ezra and third party donations, as we did! I gave money from my successful moving sale also! They let me send one check for many cards and they keep tabs as I request tributes!  That is user friendly to do via email! They do a great job of sending tribute cards with the donations.Lea and the others understand this.

As Detroit suffers through high unemployment I have witnessed first-hand the wonderful way Yad Ezra distributes food in an organized manner while helping to build the self esteem of the recipients as well. Yad Ezra also encourages students and their parents throughout the community to participate in fund raising and food distribution activites -- making Yad Ezra a community building organization as well.

Brain Injury Association of Michigan, Inc.	58946		/users/profile/63204	Grateful	Volunteer	5	12/19/2010	I would like to share the many positive things that our done by the Brain Injury Assoc. of Michigan.  I have been with the association for 10 years as a caregiver for a survivor plus in leadership for a local chapter.  In the ten years that I have dealt with the main office and the national office, I have been very impressed with their committment that each and very one of them put forth.  You will never be able to please everyone, especially people who have trouble with TBI's, caregivers and family members that are also going through rough times.  There is not an organization in this world that doesn't have overhead costs to run them.  I have dealt with several over my life time and can tell you that BIAMI does a marvelous job using their funds.  As for all that politicial stuff that others complain about,  you don't really understand the importance of making sure the world realizes what a TBI is and the seriousness of needing help for those people.  In Michigan, if we lose No-Fault Car Insurance everyone will suffer, so its extremely important that you have someone fighting for it daily.  BIAMI needs to be congradulated for lobbying for it, daily.If it hadn't been for BIAMI,  we would not have come this far.  We had never heard of traumatic brain injuries and will never be able to thank them enough for all the detailed  literature and vast amounts of materials that our made available.If you feel that enough is not being done, then get involved and help the rest of us, who try daily to make other people lives better.

Not gonna blather on about it - our story is but one of literally millions of TBI stories out there across the country. I just want to say "thank you" for everything you've done.
Brain Injury Association of Michigan, Inc.	45840	1	/users/profile/46719	darkhorseski	Donor	1	06/26/2010	After joining and donating, I also became an early member on the Facebook page.  After researching and asking questions I realized that the organization did not really have anybody tracking or relating current research.  The paltry amount they actually spent on research sent no money in a direction that would actually help resolve current TBI victims.  Further questioning, no matter how polite, instead resulted in the typical treatment given to whistleblowers which was immediate censorship once it became clear that they could not address the problems nor make the facts fit what they were stating and promising.  From the 2009 annual report, they show overhead costs being over 50% (most of that being personnel costs).

Upon returning I started getting really bad headaches. I first went to the Ann Arbor VA, they kept telling me that I just had post concussive syndrome and the only treatment I would receive from them was medicine. I became frustrated and felt that the VA was missing something. During that time period I went to the "Tips-Up for the troops" fishing tournament which was set up by the BIAMI. While at the tournament I was able to briefly talk with Rick Briggs and he became very intterested in my situation. The next week he contacted me and asked if there was anything he could do to help me, I explained the situation to him and within two weeks he had gotten me into see one of the best neurologists in the state of Michigan. The neurologist diagnosed me with TBI and I began getting physical therapy and this has helped me tremendously. To this day I still receive e-mails from Rick asking how I am doing. I am very thankful that Rick and the BIAMI reached out and helped me like they have to many other troops.

They made sure that my dogs were a proper "fit" for my household, and that we had time to bond with each other. If I had any questions, someone got back to me immediately. No one, from the executive director on down, receives any monetary compensation for their time or work. This dedicated group lives up to their mission statement of finding each animal in their care a forever home.  I can't praise them enough for all they do!
Paws For Life Rescue	175401	4	/users/profile/231749	Shelly19	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I have been involved with Paws For Life for seven years now, first as an adopter, now as a volunteer.  The compassionon and committment that this group shows for animals is phenominal. This is a group that has repeatedly gone beyond the norm to help our furry friends find forever homes, including receiving necessary medical treatment  for some horrific conditions.  I can't emphasize enough the determination and tenacity that Paws For Life shows for helping to change existing legislation that will benefit all of our animals. I plan on continuing my association with Paws For Life for many years to come!
Paws For Life Rescue	305319	1	/users/profile/396559	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	I have volunteer when I can with PFL, and the volunteers only have the dogs and cats best interest at heart. They work so hard to find these dogs foster/ forever homes to get them out of the shelter and into safe and loving homes. I was grateful to be able to foster a dog through PFL , in which ended up being a foster fail. This organization only does their best to protect and save animals. I am glad do to be a part of it!
Paws For Life Rescue	305317	1	/users/profile/194238	kkup	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	I've been a volunteer foster mom with this group for quite a few years.  I was amazed at the extremes they will go to, to help an injured or sick animal.  The post by AdopterBeware4Paws is NOT talking about this group.  We have no cages.  We are totally foster based.   This group does not take in owned animals. We take animals from high kill shelters that are overflowing.  All animals are totally vetted before being adopted out.   We are always available to our adopters to help with any questions they may have.   Definitely a FIVE STAR organization!
Paws For Life Rescue	305313	1	/users/profile/396554	jackieboy	Client Served	5	09/18/2016	This is a wonderful organization with dedicated volunteers caring for the animals. Animals receive all needed medical care plus the love and care from the foster families. We have 2 rescue dogs from PFL and they bring much joy to our lives. Jackie boy and Molly have enriched our lives. That is Jackie being a couch potato on his own personal love seat. One of the most professionally operated rescues I know.
Paws For Life Rescue	305309	1	/users/profile/396549	Amanda245	Client Served	5	09/18/2016	We had an absolutely wonderful experience with this rescue. We went to consider adopting a pet and the volunteer who was cleaning the cats' cages was so friendly and knowledgable that we ended up reducing a kitty that day. It was clear that the volunteer who helped us that day as well as the woman who dropped our kitty off to us the next day had the animals' best interest in mind. Everything was very organized and steps were taken to ensure that this kitty was getting a safe and loving home. I would highly recommend this rescue to anyone adopting a pet and would consider a donation to make sure that they are able to get more animals to their forever homes. 
Paws For Life Rescue	305305	5	/users/profile/396545	ajsulliv	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	I have been volunteering for PFL since February and have been floored with how outstanding this organization is. I saw a post on here that was written about a DIFFERENT organization and reflected negatively on us, so I wanted to set the record straight:*All of our dogs and cats are fully vetted before adoption. *We are a 5-star, certified rescue organization that receives no government funding and we have no paid staff. *We do not believe in nor practice euthanasia for any reason other than irreparable suffering. Period. We pay whatever needs to be paid to help all of the animals in our care. The volunteers at PFL work so hard, and PFL makes it easy to do so. I spend the majority of my free time trying to save animals in need alongside a huge support system that is trying to do the same. Our director is one the kindest, most compassionate, and driven people I have had the pleasure of working with, and she has built an incredible team of volunteers who work hard to save as many animals as possible. My two favorite things about PFL are:1. The animals come first at PFL - always. 2. When times are tough or overwhelming as they often are in the rescue world, there is always an entire network of people supporting you at PFL. This is the best and most professional organization with which I've come in contact. Please fill out an application at www.pawsforliferescue.org :)
Paws For Life Rescue	305303	5	/users/profile/396543	keaston22	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	 I have been volunteering with Paws For Life for five years now. This is one of the most hard-working organizations I have ever come across. It is difficult to sum up what everyone does on a regular basis to keep this rescue moving forward each day. It's stressful, daunting and heart breaking to say the least; and completely fulfilling and loaded with things like love, genuine care, pride in the organization as well as our foster dogs and cats and sometimes hope - for the future ahead of us. And then...along with all that...  somehow Paws For Life finds the saddest, loneliest and most heart wrenching cases every week and seems to respond to more than I feel that we are capable of handling. Sometimes we win those battles; but not always. Our dogs and cats are healthy,  our adopters are screened and then educated, and our volunteers are mentored until they feel confident in their abilities. Not all non-profits can say that.  I am not sure that everyone realizes how much work goes into an organization like this but I have to say that this has to be one of the best. Certainly not the biggest, but one of the best. If you are ever interested in learning about a world that you may never have known existed...a volunteer application is waiting for you;)Kelly 
Paws For Life Rescue	305300	2	/users/profile/396540	Writer	Client Served	5	09/18/2016	We adopted our Captain Kirk, aka "Moose," dog from Paws for Life. He has been amazing! He's doing so well. He's a quick learner, too. A very healthy boy weighing in now at 75ish pounds, gets snuggles all the time and is very spoiled. Moose has calmed down quite a bit since being at the shelter and learned some more commands. He is still an upbeat pup, but for the most part, loves to be lazy and sleep. Thank you for our boy,Liz and family
Paws For Life Rescue	294859	2	/users/profile/385625	AdopterBeware4Paws	Volunteer	1	07/07/2016	I write this as a past volunteer to let you know first hand to STAY AWAY and not adopt from this SCAM of an organization!!! This person adopts sick and unhealthy animals that are not fully vet checked. She makes huge profit gains on all these dogs, because they are already fully vaccinated prior and spayed and neutered from the other shelters which she pulls from.   Many dogs they adopt out have all types of medical issues including: Coccidia and Giardia and she knows it, and doesn't let the adopter know the full medical. Many of her animals are not spayed or neutered prior to adoption either.  They also will take a dog from an owner and say they are a No-kill but when that dog does something not to the founders liking, you bet she will PUT THE DOG TO SLEEP! That's right she euthanizes animals too! it is so devastating. I went there and couldn't believe she rescued a pitt bull and the next thing I knew because the dog was scared and showed teeth, she had the dog euthanized and didn't think twice! What kind of rescue is this I was shocked to discover that she agrees with putting dogs down!  Isn't it a rescues job to save an animal and get the animal rehabilitation? the dog wasn't even sick I was horrified. This isn't the first dog either she has put down. I highly suggest if you need to surrender your pet STAY FAR FAR away! she will put the animal down she deems unadoptable, and keeps this hidden from the public. She is not a rescuer in my opinion, she is as bad as any shelter that euthanizes healthy animals!  Also she is very prejudice. I witnessed first hand that she refuses to adopt to a black or ethnic family, or anyone living in Detroit area. It doesn't matter if they are successful, have good vet checks, are kind people, she will turn people away based on appearance and first impression.  This place is horrible! all her animals are stuck in tight living quarters of cages, and she only does rescue to make money and PROFITS.  Please don't let false impressions get the best of you, her intentions at first may have been in the very beginning, but in the end: why rescue an innocent animal from death when your the one ultimately putting them down, isn't that being  convoluted? You are no better and in fact worse in my opinion!  Please do yourself a favor and go to other rescues who truly care about the animals, and people.  The people here can put on a good face at petsmarts and other places they show the animals, but these innocent lives deserve better! The public and your volunteers who dedicate their time deserve better too, and to know the whole truth you keep secret.  This is why I no longer can volunteer for a rescue that lies and claims they are a No-Kill when I know the whole truth. YOU ARE NOT A NO-KILL if you put dogs down. Shame on you! and you should stop what your doing, Adopters beware!
Paws For Life Rescue	225883	3	/users/profile/289635	Snoopytann	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I love animals. Right now I foster cats. PFL save as many cats that have nowhere else to go. We, as volunteers, take really good care of the animals. If there's any problems, they go right to the vet. I'm proud to be a volunteer for Pfl!
Paws For Life Rescue	225764	6	/users/profile/289519	Doug37	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	Paws for Life Animal Rescue should be a role model for other rescue groups. They not only make rescued pets available for adoption, but they're there to support you afterwards with their knowledge, compassion and steady backing. We have two rescue dogs from PfL and the relationship with the dogs and the rescue has enhanced our lives tremendously.
Paws For Life Rescue	225642	3	/users/profile/96419	Yellowfang Greystream	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I've been involved in animal care since 1991, first at a big shelter but also several smaller non profit groups.  Paws for Life commits to each and every animal they take in and treat it as if it was their own.  Each animal is fully vetted and emergency needs are taken care of immediately.  Foster home volunteers are provided with anything needed and reminders are sent for foster animals vetting as well as adopted animals.   They provide all medical records to the new owners and provide all information available about the adopted animal.  They take animals from high kill, over crowded shelters where they would be euthanized due to lack of space.   Having seen several aspects at various rescues, I would definitely rate PFL a 5 star rescue.
Paws For Life Rescue	225541	2	/users/profile/230044	Sandy57	Client Served	5	10/23/2014	I have 2 rescue dogs from PFL. This organization goes well beyond caring and placing rescued animals. All animals are properly vetted, assessed behaviorally, and all adopters are provided with all necessary information they need for decisions. Follow up checks are made and reminder medical calls are made so these adopted animals continue receiving necessary vaccinations. Professional in their dealings with the public and animals in their care. 
Paws For Life Rescue	173891	2	/users/profile/230044	Sandy57	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	This organization, Paws for Life,  is committed to helping animals in need. Every member helps in many ways. Transporting, vet appointments, fostering, can drives to earn money for vet bills, etc. Friendly  caring people volunteer their time to reach out to needy animals. Trap and release for feral cats has been very successful. People opening their homes to give animals a safe loving environment is wonderful. This organization is a wonderful group of people working for the betterment of animals.

Paws For Life Rescue	176777	2	/users/profile/233232	Carrie54	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	I have been in animal rescue for 15+ years.  I have seen animal rescue done right, wrong and everything in between.  PFL does it right.  Not only does Paws for Life work to save the individual animals in need of rescue, but PFL works in the trenches working to change legislation and policies that protect animals.  PFL keeps up-to-date on animal welfare issues and best practices.  They are all about working with people to make the lives of animals better.  They make it a priority to educate their volunteers.  I run a small independent rescue and volunteer with PFL so I can take what I learn from them and apply it to my group and my personal mission.

Paws For Life Rescue	174352	2	/users/profile/230621	Papadog	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	I began volunteering with animal rescue organizations around 2001.  I have been with Paws for Life Rescue and Adoption since its inception.  This organization has more passionate and long-term dedicated volunteers than any other organization I have worked with in the past.  Their mission is clear and concise.  Every animal that comes to us is treated with respect, dignity and of course like family.  The screening policies Paws for Life has in place help to make sure that potential adopter is a good fit for the animal and the new family.  Paws for Life is involved with the community through its TNR feral cat program and community education on the well being of animals.  Education is key to the success of this organization as we are offered to attend many local and national animal conferences regarding animal welfare.  I am very pleased to have found such a great organization to volunteer with.  It all begins with leadership.

And, many have come to volunteer, to show their love and appreciation to this wonderful rescue.
Paws For Life Rescue	173437	1	/users/profile/229580	Kate Pearce	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I became involved with Paws for Life when they helped us adopt our cats.  I was impressed with the time and attention paid to finding the right homes for their rescued animals as well as ensuring the proper match for the prospective families.   It is clear they are are a compassionate and committed organization - working hard to ensure the welfare of all animals.  I have worked with other organizations in the past and have never experienced this level of dedication and commitment to their cause.   Since adopting, I have become a volunteer, working adoption events and helping wherever I can.  Paws for Life is deeply involved in all aspects of animal welfare, not just adoption.  They are committed to pet advocacy and education as well.  I always surprised by the level of knowledge I gain from the organization and its volunteers.   I feel confident when I work with the organization and its team that my time is well spent and my donations are going to worthwhile programs as I see directly the fruits of their labor.
Paws For Life Rescue	173395	1	/users/profile/229538	Courtney31	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I have volunteered in animal rescue for most of my life. I have worked at animal shelters and volunteered with various animal rescues. It took a long time for me to find a rescue that felt right, that did things the way they should be done, that sacrifices for the animals' best interest and that operates on the philosophy of do no harm while moving mountains to save innocent lives. I was even more pleased with Paws for Life when I learned how much they value continuing education for their volunteers and how tirelessly they work beyond the rescue to advocate for animals, to educate and to make big-picture changes for animals in our state. I am proud to be a Paws for Life volunteer and to know that through my participation in their efforts, I have saved lives and changed lives - of both animals and people - for the better.

Alex Whitney has a insight and ability to help in ways most would not think of or even go out of their way to do, even if they had the means or insight.  She is a jewel in the animal rescue community.  For the animals welfare and for all Alex does, I support GFA wholeheartedly and with passion.  She has a passion that she puts into full action for the animals in a very positive way.  What would the little animals do without GFA and Alex?  I profoundly feel that GFA needs to be supported and continue on so Alex and GFA can continue their good work for all the animals.  Put ourselves in the animals place.....wouldn't we want a wonderful advocate like this if we were in need.  We would cherish it for our survival.  It is such for the animals now.

We were a group of 5 very passionate women for doing rescue the "right way". GFA, sharing our compassion for animals in need, gave us the chance we needed to get our feet off the ground. GFA was (and still is!) always willing to help when we need it. We continue to participate in various annual events and fundraiser, as well as our monthly adoptions at Petco - another valued relationship that GFA helped us establish. Being a non-profit animal rescue, financials can be a constant battle. Our partnership with GFA has played a big role in helping us to keep our heads above water so we can continue to save fur babies in need! We are proud to be able to say that we have saved over 1,000 canines and felines that may have otherwise faced a much different fate. Thank you GFA!! You helped us start and continue to support something that we think is pretty darn special : )
Guardians for Animals	163607		/users/profile/217279	larain	Client Served	5	07/26/2013	MotorCity Greyhound Rescue has been affiliated with Guardians for almost two years.  We participate in adoption events organized by Guardians.  On every occasion we've found them to be professional and devoted to seeing that every animal receives the care and kindness they deserve.
Guardians for Animals	163574		/users/profile/217213	Melanie W.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/25/2013	Three years ago I began my very own rescue.  To be honest it was not much of a rescue, we had two dogs and four cats.  As a rescue just starting out there are so many start up expenses that you do not even realize and if I had to do it all alone A Hopeful Heart Animal Rescue would not exist today.  GFA was able to help our rescue organization by providing us with cages and crates to use during our adoption events, they helped us pay for our start up vet expenses so that our animals would be ready to go home, and she provided us with much needed food and flea preventative for our rescued animals.  Often times I have spent hours on the phone with the head of GFA and she has counseled me and advised me on critical rescue issues.  I know that if there is a time that I have a need GFA will do everything in their power to fulfill that need.  GFA helped our rescue go from those two dogs and four cats to a rescue organization that has between 35-50 dogs and 50-60 cats at any time.  With GFA's help we have taken over 250 animals a year from high kill animal shelters and turned them into loving family pets.  If GFA did not exist those loving animals would have never left the shelter.  We will for ever be eternally grateful for GFA and so will our rescued pets!  
Washtenaw Literacy	232491		/users/profile/296031	Pat_57	Volunteer	5	11/01/2014	I've been a tutor with Washtenaw Literacy for 3 1/2 years both as an ESL tutor and, most recently, as a tutor in the literacy program with the county jail. Washtenaw Literacy is excellent in its preparation and continued education for its volunteers. It makes it nice for those of us who are retired and are undertaking a new role that may be different from our life long career. I especially like the fact that Washtenaw Literacy truly engages in meeting the needs of those with the most need.
Washtenaw Literacy	232175	2	/users/profile/295723	UM_retiree	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been a tutor for a little over eight months.   The tutoring that I did with my first learner, who had a brain injury, was challenging, but I learned a lot and had a sense of having helped the learner make progress.  I had great support from staff, beyond my initial training and some additional workshops.  After six months that tutoring relationship ended by mutual agreement, and for the past two months I've been part of Washtenaw Literacy's Washtenaw County Jail program.  Again, I'm learning a lot and most definitely having the enjoyable and rewarding sense of making a difference in the lives of the learners.  The experience has touched me deeply.  I would highly recommend becoming a volunteer tutor (or a volunteer in some other capacity), or contributing to the organization.  It is a no-nonsense, lean and mean, friendly and helpful organization that is truly making a difference in our community.
Washtenaw Literacy	232135		/users/profile/295684	Retiree	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been volunteering for Washtenaw Literacy for about two and a half years, working with ESL learners in a drop-in group, and with basic learners, doing both GED preparation and basic math and reading literacy.  As a retiree, I find this a valuable use of my time in a way that makes a big difference in my life and the lives of the people I serve.  
Washtenaw Literacy	231742	1	/users/profile/295310	Miship	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been with WL since 2006.  I have had the honor of helping learners become American citizens, learn to read, learn to do basic math, and learn to speak English.  The staff is amazing, and I really enjoy working with them.  I have enjoyed being a mentor and working with other tutors as well.  I love WL because I can make a difference in the lives of others, and also because I'm needed, wanted, and valued.  I get to teach people how to do things I take for granted, like reading my bills, filling out forms, and asking questions at the doctor.  While I'm teaching, I'm also learning, about my community, my country, and the world.  Deciding to join WL is the best choice I've ever made.
Washtenaw Literacy	231289	1	/users/profile/294889	vandersypen	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have been a volunteer tutor with Washtenaw Literacy since 1997, working both with individual ESL learners and with groups. My first one-on-one learner earned her U.S. citizenship on the second try when she was about 80 years old. One of my current ESL learners, an extremely focused self-starter, has made incredible strides in speaking and comprehension in the past several years. Working with ESL groups teaches me as much as I teach them. The generous and timely support that volunteer tutors and mentors receive from the Washtenaw Literacy staff creates a core of faithful volunteers who continue their association with the organization year after year. The excellent 15-hour training for new tutors, which WL devised and continues to refine, plus workshops on teaching methods, lesson planning, learning styles, local resources, etc., make them the premier literacy agency in Michigan.
Washtenaw Literacy	230867	1	/users/profile/294484	Angiers	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I've been volunteering with WL for many years, and have found it to be the most rewarding volunteer experience I've had.  The number of people who benefit from the organization, as well as the vast range of their needs and abilities, is amazing.  Working with ESL learners, I've encountered everything from post-doctoral students to illiterate folks from depressed countries, and without exception all are provided the best possible learning situation as well as complete respect.  Tutors and staff are exceptional, dedicated people.
Washtenaw Literacy	230343	1	/users/profile/293984	Carol179	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I've been a tutor with Washtenaw Literacy for 6 years.  In 2008 I assisted my 50 year old learner to prepare to vote in a presidential election.  This was the first time in his life that he had ever voted, because he had never been able to read the ballot.  He was so happy and proud to be able to participate in this basic civil right.  An adult who cannot read is restricted from participating in so many everyday activities that most of us take for granted.  Washtenaw Literacy is an incredible organization, using hundreds of volunteer tutors to reach out and make a difference in thousands of lives.  The training, staff support and mentoring services provided to tutors are outstanding.  The staff are continuously providing educational opportunities and encouraging tutors to grow and be the most effective possible.  Because of their dedication and superb use of resources, this organization has made great strides in decreasing illiteracy in Washtenaw County one learner at a time.    
Washtenaw Literacy	230275		/users/profile/293920	Indy45	Volunteer	4	10/30/2014	This is a great organization that has served hundreds of learners over the years. It not only helps adults with basic literacy skills but also has a large ESL program. The organization has remained strong through hard economic times when funding has been scarce. It utilizes it's large tutor base well especially when times are tough. It provides a wonderful traing program, great tutor support and continuing education for it's tutors.  .
Washtenaw Literacy	230262		/users/profile/178284	megmcg	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Washtenaw Literacy changes lives by increasing adults' abilities to read and write. I've been a volunteer tutor with Washtenaw Literacy for 4 years - as a tutor, you get to work directly with learners and see the changes in their abilities. The staff goes above and beyond to support volunteers, including offering development and leadership opportunities.
Washtenaw Literacy	132635		/users/profile/178284	megmcg	Volunteer	5	11/02/2012	Washtenaw Literacy fosters an exceptional volunteer experience. The work (helping adults learn to read and write English) is so important, and a unique service. I see every week the direct life-changing impact that learning how to read has for learners. Moreover, the agency keeps volunteers connected with frequent training and social opportunities.
Washtenaw Literacy	228603	1	/users/profile/292290	RondaG	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	When I became a tutor with Washtenaw Literacy, I was and still am thoroughly impressed with the training provided to new and seasoned tutors. The organization constantly provides tools and resources relevant to learners and the actual environment we live in. It is also a pleasure when you see other tutors jump in to help their fellow tutors. The relationships built and meeting new people is a secondary benefit to helping someone improve their literacy skills.
Washtenaw Literacy	227986	1	/users/profile/291695	Schuler	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have been a tutor with Washtenaw Literacy for 10 years. I usually tutor three days a week helping Literacy learners improve their reading and writing skills and/or obtain their GED and also helping ESL learners acquire the English skills necessary to become productive residents/citizens. I used to tutor for Literacy agencies in Chicago and in Plymouth, MI. Washtenaw Literacy has been the most organized and most effective organization of all.  Their training program is excellent and provides the tutors with all the tools necessary. I find Washtenaw Literacy's staff exceptional. They are very helpful in all regards; they are receptive to new ideas and continuously strive for improvements. The programs are learner oriented. All the learners I have known over the years have been very happy with the program. Tutoring for Washtenaw Literacy has been the most rewarding experience for me, and I plan to tutor for this organization for many more years.
Washtenaw Literacy	227721		/users/profile/176688	Harry Marsden	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have tutored with them since 2008, subsequently became a mentor, and now I occasionally am asked to help with training of tutors.  There are something over 800 of us volunteers, and the professional (paid) staff is, I believe, 4.  Yet the organization works quite well.  EVERYONE is dedicated, and hard-working, and smart.  ALL the effort is directed toward the learners, their needs and their goals.  My learners, in terms of their educations, have ranged from a PhD from Korea who badly needed English conversation skills, to native English speakers lacking a high school diploma and needing the credential and the supporting  skills to get a job.  All these learners want independence, success in work, and a sense of community.   It is such a treat to work with them---definitely the most fun I've ever had at work.  
Washtenaw Literacy	131143	1	/users/profile/176688	Harry Marsden	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I retired after 40 years working at the University of Michigan and immediately volunteered with Washtenaw Literacy.  It is about the best thing I ever did.   The agency has a small paid staff and then hundreds of volunteers.  The staff train everybody and then rely on experienced tutors to help the new ones.  The staff provide continuing professional development opportunities, and the collaboration between volunteers and staff is wonderful.  I tutor both ESL and native-English-user folks, and on either side they can be young adults or senior citizens or anyone in between.   Many of us have had the experience of a learner saying "you have changed my life."  What could be more satisfying than that?
Washtenaw Literacy	227598		/users/profile/177382	Laurie24	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I tried to volunteer with other orgs in the area doing the same work, but I found the people involved with WL to be more dedicated to volunteers and their learners.  Not only did they entice me w/ (free) training throughout the years, but also as a great support system resource-wise & socially as well.  The learners involved with WL are invested in the community, not just passing through necessarily like some of the other orgs. So to have an organization available in the capacity that WL is run, makes it a very enriching experience for both volunteer and learner. I continue to help as an ESL group coordinator and Auction committee member. 
Washtenaw Literacy	131798	1	/users/profile/177382	Laurie24	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Not only do I volunteer,  I donate and help recruit/advertise as well.  I started about 4 or 5 yrs. ago with tutoring ESL after trying some other local language schools.  I just didn't find the same vibe, training & learner participation that I have with Washtenaw Literacy.  Despite the great training they put me through, I also applaud how they run the nonprofit with such a small paid staff. They are very eager to be there for us, and really appreciate what our volunteers do to help to keep us going! The often have tutor socials, workshops, picnics, a recognition ceremony, a mentor program (which I'm now a part of!) and of course wonderful resources to use with our learners! Our fundraisers are exciting and give volunteers and learners the opportunity to really delve into the operation and gain experience - and they're fun! They deserve any and all recognition possible! 
Washtenaw Literacy	140335	1	/users/profile/186508	jeffwilensky	Board Member	5	11/15/2012	I joined the board of Washtenaw Literacy three years ago, and have seen the personal impact it has made on so many lives in our community.  A learner once told me, "you can't just touch one life, because when you help someone, you're helping their whole family and the lives of those around them".   I continue to be amazed by  the courage and commitment of the learners, the dedication of the volunteer network of tutors, and the passion of the Washtenaw Literacy staff.  The organization punches-above-it's-weight by leveraging a volunteer network and in-kind gifts so that every dollar donated is turned into 4 dollars worth of services.  
Washtenaw Literacy	139880	1	/users/profile/186027	ffionagray	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Everyone at Washtenaw Literacy, staff and volunteers, show tremendous dedication and commitment to the learners in the area.   Their training programs are outstanding and their fundraisers are fun and successful.  They use their resources in an extremely fiscally responsible way.  The organization touches the lives of hundreds of people every year, enriching all those who serve and are served.
Washtenaw Literacy	139494	1	/users/profile/185614	Liina	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Washtenaw Literacy is a great organization. It offers free tutoring in basic literacy as well as in learning English as  a Second Language. I have been a tutor in both areas and have seen first hand what a difference these services have made in the learners lives  They have increased confidence, self esteem and job prospects. The staff is dedicated and work many extra hours in support of both learners and tutors. They also provide ongoing training to upgrade tutor skills. 
Washtenaw Literacy	136500		/users/profile/182425	sara_m	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	Washtenaw Literacy provides an essential service to the learners it serves - free tutoring for adults in reading, writing, and/or speaking English.  As a tutor, I have seen first hand how much difference it makes in someone's life to become more independent through improved reading skills.  Washtenaw Literacy also provides a great experience for volunteers. There are many ways to help -  I have tutored one-on-one, worked with small groups, mentored  other tutors, and helped at programs.  The training for tutors is thorough and practical, and there are many opportunities to continue to learn more through updated workshops.  The staff are very professional, and they have helped me find different ways to volunteer when I needed to change my schedule. I have always felt that my time and contributions have been valued by Washtenaw Literacy. 
Washtenaw Literacy	132206		/users/profile/177819	sblacklaw	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	When I came to town two years ago, I immediately began looking for an organization to which I could contribute my time and talents. Within a few months, I was introduced to dozens of worthy organizations. Washtenaw Literacy stood out among so many great nonprofits because of its exceptional (and well deserved) reputation for changing so many people's lives. The network of WL volunteers have my unwaivering respect and admiration. I am proud to be associated with this truly great nonprofit organization.  
Washtenaw Literacy	131120		/users/profile/176661	vickieb	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I have been a volunteer tutor with Washtenaw Literacy for 3 1/2 years, it's a tremendous experience.  As a voracious reader and wanting to support local a philanthropic agency; it's been the perfect fit.  We touch so many lives, connecting people from differing socio-economic and educational strata.  I have learned so much more about my community and the people who live here that I would never have known otherwise.  Washtenaw Literacy provides excellent training and resources to the tutors, and always has a waiting list of potential learners.   I'm proud to be affiliated with such a wonderful organization.
Washtenaw Literacy	131112		/users/profile/176653	Erica15	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Volunteering with Washtenaw Literacy is the best part of my week.  I tutor English as a Second Language and look forward to each Wednesday night, when I get to help my learner improve her language skills while also teaching her about American culture.  Washtenaw Literacy offers an opportunity to volunteer in a meaningful way on an ongoing basis while working in a fun, creative and thoughtful setting.  The organization's staff is communicative, supportive and passionate about increasing literacy in our community.  Whether you're a learner or someone who would like to volunteer, I would highly recommend becoming involved with this nonprofit organization.
Washtenaw Literacy	129640		/users/profile/175025	ekimball002	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	Washtenaw Literacy does a great service to the people of Washtenaw County, Michigan. Not only do they help the many adults in the county who struggle to read at the level of a high-school graduate, they also help the many non-native speakers and their families who come here attracted by the excellent universities here. Volunteering for them is a pleasure. They provide outstanding training and support to volunteers. In fact they have the most supportive people of any organization I know -- with the possible exception of my family!
Washtenaw Literacy	129323	2	/users/profile/174692	Michael120	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	In doing some surfing I came across a startling statistic. 27000 (twenty seven thousand) people do not read or write at grade level. UM, EMU, WCC, MSU, WSU, etc... are all within an hour's driving distance. WL provides free service to anyone. Basic Literacy, GED prep, job applications, newspapers, and ordinary computer user skills are available. I signed up as a BL tutor. WL provides a fantastic volunteer support network of training, retraining, and information sharing. Tutors are assigned a mentor as a guide through the process of helping individuals. It is said that doing something for someone that they can never repay is the best deed. WL has given me the opportunity to prove the truth of that sentiment.
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	307091		/users/profile/329377	Mary339	Volunteer	5	09/29/2016	This is a great Organization. They go above and beyond to get you the help you need.
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	242830	5	/users/profile/329377	Mary339	Board Member	5	05/11/2015	This organization is doing good in the community. Striving to reach out to people that are in need due to an abusive relationship.  They are always searching for ways to bring awareness to these awful circumstances. To make a way for a victim to become a survivor is the goal! This is a great Charity, Natasha could have just buried her head in the sand like so many other do, instead she came out fighting for all the victims and she wont' stop until she has reached her goals.   
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	307075	1	/users/profile/398399	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2016	A wonderful organization! Natasha is a very inspirational person!!!

Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249732	3	/users/profile/337463	Kimjones326	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	This foundation is helping to raise awareness about a problem that is not openly talked about.  The more  people who are aware of this foundation, the  more that innocent people can be helped.  The leader of this foundation is someone whom I have known since she was a little girl and she has truly grown to be my hero.

A place they can come to and get immediate supplies and even clothing and counseling. Being able to come to the foundation means having the security move forward.

Natasha is an amazing woman who puts her heart and soul into this cause. The world needs more people like this!!!
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	293589	1	/users/profile/384208	cyndi1030	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/22/2016	Natasha has taken this tragedy and created a voice not only for her daughter, but all the children and families that are crying out internally for help. I commend her for her strength, and can't wait to see what other amazing things that are to come from this incredible, strong foundation. Well done!
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249916	3	/users/profile/337762	Amanda190	General Member of the Public	5	07/24/2015	This is an amazing cause that I fully support! One thing I know for sure is it takes a strong woman to go through what she has and still live day to day with what happened and still  have the strength to get out there to raise awareness on a topic that is just heartbreaking! No one should ever have to go through what she has, and I want to thank her for what she is doing with this foundation to help so many others that has had to go through similar experiences! God bless you and everyone else that has helped along the way!
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249886	3	/users/profile/337729	MHeck	General Member of the Public	5	07/24/2015	I have known the founder of this foundation for about 10 years. She is a very compassionate, trustworthy, dedicated, strong and extremely hardworking woman, and she brings all of that and more to this foundation and it shows. This is a fantastic foundation focusing on serving anyone that is or has been a victim of abuse and getting them the help they need and deserve while showing support with understanding and sympathy. Break the chains of abuse with this great foundation!
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249756	3	/users/profile/337592	Sbernard	General Member of the Public	5	07/24/2015	I've known the father of founder, Natasha, for years. I always remembered her as the little girl of my friend. Flash forward to now and that little girl has grown into an amazing and strong woman. When I first started talking to Natasha, I had no idea what had happened to her baby girl. As I read online one night the details of the horrific loss of Evelynne, I cried and my heart broke for her. I am constantly amazed at how strong Natasha is despite everything that's happened. This situation would have crushed a weaker person.  The fact that she has taken her experiences and uses them to help others get out of dangerous and unhealthy situations speaks volumes of her character. Natasha is constantly trying to get the word out about her foundation and the help that they can offer others through community events, meet and greets, etc.  If there's anyone that will make a difference in someone's life, I believe it will be Natasha. 
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249736	3	/users/profile/337572	Jessica231	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	This is a great organization to help woman and children from all backgrounds with different forms of abuse!

Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249721	4	/users/profile/337551	NFuller	Board Member	5	07/23/2015	We are still a small Organization, but what we lack in size we make up for with compassion. Our goal is to help as many Victims of Abuse become Survivors as possible. We are actively working on unique events to raise awareness for abuse as well as for the Organization. As the President of the Evelynne Aimee Foundation and a Survivor of Domestic Abuse myself, each Survivor I help, helps me. Even though it has been 4 years since I lost Evelynne and got out of my situation, I still have hard days, and being able to think about the proactive steps we are taking with the Foundation helps me clear my mind of the bad.
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249697	4	/users/profile/337532	Aimee14	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	This unique to victims foundation is a must have in our community.

We need these souls and ministry in our community.
Evelynne Aimee Foundation	249684	5	/users/profile/337518	Marakai	Board Member	5	07/23/2015	This foundation has already helped some people in our community.

Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	47529	5	/users/profile/48250	caminitis	Client Served	5	07/01/2010	MPDCI has provided amazing services to our two children with cystic fibrois, who are now young adults.  Summer after summer our family has been the beneficiaries of their generosity in providing tickets to places such as Michigan Adventure and Frankenmuth.  For the past couple of summers, my youngest daughter Jamie has been able to attend cross country training camp.  We are not a family of means, and thee activities are luxuries we most likely would have forgone otherwise. Casandra, our older daughter, has benefited semester after semester from the educational grant that MPDCI has provided for her. The people at MPDCI have such great hearts.  Whenever we apply for a grant or scholarship, they communicate so professionally, and yet so compassionately.  They have been patient when we have erred and they helped us to know what we needed to do in order to receive the grant/scholarship we were applying for. I guess, in a nutshell, it is obvious that they are passionate about assisting the CF community in as many ways as possible, and are delighted each time that they do just that.  Because of distance, we do not actively engage in social activities they provide, and have participated in very little of their fundraising events. Yet, anyone I have ever talked to in that organization has treated me wonderfully.  They are whole hearted, to be sure.  It would be wonderful to see this organization recieve this grant, to encourage them for their great heart/efforts, and enable them to do even more.  Children and young adults with CF often appear rather "normal" to most people, but to those of us who live with someone with CF, we know their daily challenges. But although we love them and seek to help them in everyway possible, we can never entirely understand what they go through.  How grateful we are for an organization like MPDCI who heeps encouragement on these dear invididual.

With CF the patients are not to be near each other so often you feel like you are alone.  MPDCI just reinforces that this is not something that he is the only one going thru.
Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	46228	4	/users/profile/47103	megan14	Client Served	5	06/28/2010	Every summer when I was younger I would receive wonderful care packages from MPDCI. They were always full of fun toys from McDonalds gift certificates to craft kits. They were a great way to start the summer.Another thing about MPDCI I love is the family trips to Frankenmuth or Michigan Adventures Water Park. My family enjoyed taking these trips and having a break for the six of us was always nice. The digital cameras MPDCI provided were great for capturing the days memories.Now that I'm older, I receive grants from MPDCI for college. They come in handy, especially in this economy. I also look forward to joining MPDCI in some of the great opportunities they have for (young) adults with CF.MPDCI has been a great support for me personally and I love to wear my Beaver shirt!
Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	46204	1	/users/profile/47082	thespian	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2010	MPDCI helped a very dear friend of mine receive a grant for transplant and is now living a more full life.  I have watched this girl suffer since childhood and I don't think she could have survived without their help.  We live in rural Michigan where health care is basic and patients with special needs have a more difficult road to go.  She also speaks often about the connections she has made with other patients through your community.  These connections have aided her in coping with her trials.  All in all MPCDI needs to continue to operate.

We have enjoyed summer adventures and next month will be going to Chicago's Shedd's Aquarium, as we are attending orientation at Columbia College where Brian will be a freshman this fall. Over the years, MPDCI has sent care packages with gifts that brighten up the day. Their newsletters and personal connection with Brian has been a huge support for us all. I'm grateful for all their kindness and generosity as they help those families with a child with cystic fibrosis.
Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	45868	8	/users/profile/46744	miraclelandfarm	Client Served	5	06/26/2010	Michigan Pulmonary Disease Community Inc. is a great organization that brings smiles to faces of children who spend each day facing a life-threatening disease, and often find themselves undergoing proceedures, surgeries, treatments or hospital stays.  My grand-daughter spends an average of three hours per day having medical treatments, and another chunk of time trying to eat enough  high calorie food to maintain her weight and strength to face the next crisis.  MPDCI encourages the kids with gift cards when they comply with their medical regimen, and a few times a  year they send out care packages plus tickets to help them enjoy a summer family outing.  It means a lot to know that someone understands and cares.
Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	44729	7	/users/profile/45643	ruth9	Client Served	5	06/21/2010	OUTSTANDING. This organization was founded by a small group to meet the needs of a few kids with CF to have a summer camp experience. It grew into a camp that met the needs of over 100 campers and as many volunteers. The only funds were those raised by the volunteers until a local group donated golf outing proceeds. When the camp closed, due to CDC policies, this group re-invented itself to meet the needs of kids with CF. Its many activities include Care Packages to younger children, outings for adults with CF, education and a Summer Adeventure for CF families, just to name a few.

He had the best time of his life there with the projects, camp themes and friends and peers just like him. The only thing he looked forward to every year was camp and even when he passed away in June of "96" he was packed and planning his week away from us.
Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	44623	7	/users/profile/45531	donna13	Volunteer	5	06/20/2010	I was invited to particate in the MPDCI Camp Onkoi Benek in 1977. I never expected to develop some of the most important friendships I would have for the rest of my life.  It led to 15 years of providing care in a CF Foundation approved Center that provided and continues to provide care for military dependents affected by Cystic Fibrosis.  Some of the most profound relationships with patients and their families who have become friends have directed my patient care in many parts of my life.  I met some of the most insightful young people I can imagine meeting because of my involvement with care of patients and families affected by Cystic Fibrosis.  MPDCI and Camp Onkoi Benek have had a profound effect on my life and my profession.

They offer a community of people who really know just what you're going through.When my daughter receives a package in the mail from MPDCI it brings the best smile to her face. To receive the newsletter in the mail, is AWESOME! That gives you a glimpse into the lives of the other people living and coping with this devastating illness.  The staff here should be commended for the joy and happiness they bring to the cystic fibrosis community.

Whether it was ALL the awareness that they bring to all with CF cope with it, or the Camperships to help fund a CFer the "opportunity" to attend a camp, a chance to just be a "kid" for a moment and a family not overwhelmed by the expense of a camp along with the countless bills for hospital visits, medications,etc. For these kids that camp experience is priceless..I knwo for both my boys, who live with CF, they have so many memories of this each year! Then it dirving force and the love and compassion that makes MPDCI what it is ..They have always been a GREAT resource of wonderful people that come from ALL different aspects of the CF world, whether they are a caregiver, parent,nurse,therapist,or even a CFer themsevles.

Immediately, half of our numbers agreed and went on to experience one of the most phenomenol weeks of our lives.  As rookies at the the Clear Lake venue, Camp Onkoi Benek (to conquer tomorrow), we were taught the ropes, teased, tricked and experienced tender moments that for me, anyway, have remained with me to this day.

We always have boxes lined up in our living room to send out to children in the hospital or for their birthdays. My mom said besides trying to make the life of a cf patient, the thing that keeps her going is the letters she gets back from the kids (in their hand writing). One fall back I believe this organization is they don't have a lot of funding. Trying to portion out the money to each group. Giving donations to parents needs of needing help with bills. To giving kids adventures.

Cystic Fibrosis Support Network Of Michigan	43877	9	/users/profile/44786	mary34	Volunteer	5	06/14/2010	MPDCI used to provide a camping experience for children with cystic fibrosis who were not able to attened "normal" camps due to their therapy/treatment needs. Due to potential spread of infection, the camping experience for them as a group (we had 125 campers with 100 all volunteer staff at one point) we had to come up with other ways for them to support each other and have "normal" experiences. Now MPDCI provides special activities for adults with CF and also provides CARE packages for up to 220 children with CF. These packages brighten their day, let them know they are not alone and provide means to connect with others with CF. "Scholarships" are provided for education, recreation, and even for lung transplant children since so many expenses are not covered by insurance. In addition, a newsletter provides latest updates on CF treatments and acknowledges birthdays and unfortunately, deaths of MPDCI children. This organization provides so much for children and adults with CF, and continuously works very hard to raise the funds to support all these activies. It is composed of all volunteers, including some board members who have CF. There is so much it does that a short review cannot begin to capture the support and positive outlook it brings to these children (and their families)!

You can't imagine the surprise I experienced when I noticed workmen coming in and out one day.  I stopped and walked in and met Tate Osten.  She told me of her plans to create an art venue devoted entirely to light media/video.  We chatted for some time.   I was most impressed not only with her vision, but also with her courage and fortitude in coming to Detriot and choosing that location. Since that first visit I have gone back to see exhibitions and to participate in discussions.  Detroit is  fortunate to have Kunsthalle.  No other non-profit in Detroit, no other museum, is doing what Kunsthalle is doing for Detroit.  No other arts institution in the city provides as much space for viewing these types of installations.  Kunsthalle has brought work from around the world by some of the most outstanding artists working with video and light to Detroit.  Kunsthalle is an exceptionally valuable addition to the Detroit art community because it is unique both in its vision and execution.  What Dia:Beacon is to minimalism, Kunshalle is to video and light based art forms.

I love this museum because it is about beliefs, the past, the present, the future, creativity, difference, and charisma. Kunsthalle Detroit creates light-bulb moments and allows space for thinking and experimenting; it connects, explains, allows comparisons, contrasts, juxtapositions that wouldnt make sense anywhere else. I love Kunsthalle Detroit because in todays world of high speed it allows my own imagination to create virtual worlds, rather than rely on someone elses program. It is not a shopping mall or amusement park or video arcade. I love the challenge of trying to use the medium of a museum to communicate a story or an idea.

I started WTFSS's program not long after they opened their new location in Belleville.  WTFSS has given me the inspiration that things will get better, by providing me with any resource that is available.  I have 4 children and their mother is MIA, without a job It is so hard to provide for them.  WTFSS has allowed me to visit their clothing closet which was awesome to be able to get my kids some decent clothes and shoes.  WTFSS taught me how to use a computer and create a proper resume.  I am now employed and I cannot thank WTFSS enough.  Without WTFSS, I don't know what I would have done.  So I want to give Kudos to Tonia & Deanna for running such a great program.
Building Families First Community Organization	128871	3	/users/profile/174144	Deanna J	Client Served	5	10/25/2012	Ways to Family Self-Suffciency is a great program for low-income individuals like myself.  I have visited WTFSS's Belleville location several times.  The girls in the office are so helpful as far as teaching those of us  that are not computer literate how to create a great resume and job search.  The most important thing about WTFSS is that they are so personable, they don't treat you like a number and you can clearly see their passion for helping others.  WTFSS also has awesome case management, the staff their actually calls me on a monthly basis to do a follow-up so they know the status or progression I have made, it's nice to know that WTFSS cares so much about their clients.  I don't know where I would be without WTFSS's program.  I just want to thank the staff for all they have assisted me with.  Thank you so much.

Building Families First Community Organization	127995	1	/users/profile/173124	Fidelity Bonding Program	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2012	Ways to Family Self-Sufficiency, Inc. is a bright shining star that sheds relentless positive light into the dark and gloomy outlook of Ex-offenders!  Its mission of ...empowering people to "break the cycle of poverty" with a clear vision in the success of our participants through self-sufficiency... allows their committed professionals to incorporate programs and services outside of their realm to bring hope and employment self-sufficiency to their participants.  One professional, Ms. Tonia Cramier, contacted the State of Michigan Fidelity Bonding Coordinator.  She researched and inquired about the Fidelity Bonding Program (FBP) of Michigan, which led to an invitation for me to conduct a FBP presentation and a Question & Answer session.  The FBP bonds employers who hire high-risk job seekers who have a troubled background such as ex-offenders.  Tonia explained that Ways to Family Self-Sufficiency, Inc. assists ex-offenders to interview with employers in order to obtain a job.  The interview process is one of the most critical stages for ex-offenders because it will determine if they succeed or fails to rejoin society as productive tax-paying workers.  Tonia wanted to offer a resource that would alleviate employers concerns about hiring and employing high-risk job seekers, eliminate a barrier to employment and help break the cycle of poverty.  The more ex-offenders who are successfully employed, the less chance they will return to prison; therefore, the recidivism rate declines and society is safer.  The organization truly has made an active commitment to empowering people in order to break the cycle of poverty.  Ways to Family Self-Sufficiency, Inc. provided me with an outstanding facility for the FBP presentation to an audience of ex-offenders.  I am extremely pleased that Tonia took the initiative to contact me so that I was able to provide free FBP informational materials and to conduct the free FBP presentation including the Question & Answer session.  This action demonstrates that the organization utilizes funds frugally because the free FBP presentation equated to no additional costs to Ways to Family Self-Sufficiency, Inc.  I am also grateful to the organization for providing the wonderful facility where one can actually experience the tremendous effort that is made to help transform ex-offenders into successes.  Please endorse Ways to Family Self-Sufficiency, Inc. to shine even brighter as it continues to "break the cycle of poverty."

The mission of WTFSS is  empowering people to become self-sufficient, this is  accomplished through the various programs and wrap around support services they provide which remove barriers to success. Their programs are highly monitored and adjusted to keep up with the job market to assure successful employment.  WTFSS  participants  are determined to become self-sufficient and help get themselves off government assistance and WTFSS offers such successful programs. It has touched my heart to have witnessed the  many success stories and those currently in process. This is an organization that cares very much for the individual with a passion to see the success of their participants. I would highly recommend those who are in need to enroll in the WTFSS program.  Everyone deserves a way out of poverty and Ways to Family Sufficiency provides a way to a successful living.

This breaks the cycle of poverty within that family. Teaching the children to work hard at school to become self-sufficient when they grow up. The client works with WTFSS for a period of four years, they further their education, clean their credit, them become employed in a career, when they graduate they get an escrow account that was started for them at the beginning  of  employment. They use the escrow funds to buy a house, start a small business or further their education. It increases economic development and asset building in the community.

The organization is making a positive impact on people's lives in our community through clothing drives and various fundraisers. They provide quality human services and training programs to help the unemployed become self sufficient.  From my own personal experience, I can say the nice thing about this organization is since they are local you can see and feel the impact you can make on someones life, and it is a truly gratifying humbling feeling.  When you donate to the large non profits your just a number and never see or feel the people you give to.  You too can experience the same feelings I did by volunteering your skills, donate funds or become a sponsor, either way your life will be change in a positive way and you will feel good.  If you feel the need to help other I recommend you contact WTFSS, you will be greeted with friendliness and begin feeling  the love of helping others help themselves the moment to you contact them.

I was disappointed in how the management interacts with volunteers and staff. It is unclear how time and money are managed. 
La Isla Foundation	183294		/users/profile/240206	bkuhn	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	La Isla popped up on my radar when a good friend versed in Latin American politics recommended it. The Foundation is both super professional and very down to Earth. It's just as welcoming an environment as it is fast-paced and goal-oriented, and I think that makes a winning combination. 
La Isla Foundation	180935		/users/profile/237648	KatrineSkjelten	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I first learned about La Isla through a local friend who worked there and said they did a good job and was a wonderfull place to be. So when I needed a break in my law studies I contacted them and offered my help. They were very proffesional, and I had two skype interviews, first with the head of law at the organisation, to review my abilities in the field, and then with the head of spanish to see if my spanish was good enough. And luckily they offered me an internship in the law department.  Most people at La Isla have experience in public health or similar, so the law department is really smal. But this only means you get a lot of responsability and lots of relevant work. So far my stay has been qute hectick, but such a great experience. Lots of interesting work, super friendly coworkers and quite a bit of fun in between all the work.  So far my stay has defenately lived up to my rather high expectations, and it is great to feel part of all the amazing work that goes on here. 
La Isla Foundation	180749		/users/profile/237442	LizzieUhl	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I started an internship at La Isla Foundation in September and it has been a fantastic experience so far!  Everyone on staff is super friendly, as are all my fellow interns and volunteers.  La Isla Foundation does amazing work and it's inspiring to be a part of such an important organization.  I was pretty unfamiliar with public health and human rights issues (I'm a grant writing intern), but everyone I've gotten a chance to work with has been great with explaining the ins and outs to me and I feel like I've gained an amazing education in the time I've been here so far. Another huge plus -  I get to do actual work.  It's not the kind of place where interns spend their time filing or going for coffee runs.  This is a fantastic organization to intern for!
La Isla Foundation	177761		/users/profile/234342	patel.purvi.p	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	I originally came to La Isla in early 2013 to intern with the Legal Department on a field study for three months.  I was going through a rough time at that time, but the people I met at LIF were so friendly that I was quickly able to create a strong supportive network.  The work the organization does is inspiring, and you can still volunteer while taking Spanish classes or going on excursions in the region if that's what you are looking for.  The ties I made at LIF were so strong that I was asked to join the Board of Directors later in the year.  I have really enjoyed my time on the Board so far, helping with top-level planning and getting a big-picture view of the organization's future.
La Isla Foundation	177585		/users/profile/234149	Dorien F.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2013	I first got to know La Isla Foundation a year and a half ago when I came to this organisation to fulfil my final requirements for my master degree in public health. It was such a powerful experience, and I knew that there was so much more interesting work that needed to be done in this field that I decided to come back to continue to work with this organisation. It is a challenging job, but it is so exciting to be part of this fight to help to end the epidemic CKDu that affects poor agricultural workers in Nicaragua, and eventually will have its effects in many other countries in the world that experience similar problems.  More and more informations becomes available about the cause of this devastating disease and more large international organisations are starting to pay attention to this epidemic. This strengthens my belief that this epidemic can be stopped, and that is what keeps me going, and keeps me here in Nicaragua working for this wonderful organisation with dedicated people to get this job done!

The La Isla staff was an incredible team: they listened to what I wanted to do and learn and gave me projects that were educational and enjoyable.

La Isla Foundation	144491		/users/profile/191024	lindsmar	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	Volunteering as a Public Health Intern with La Isla Foundation for a month in Leon was an incredible experience. The staff is extremely motivated and welcoming. There is never a loss for something to do, whether it is doing work for the organization, taking a Salsa class or practicing your Spanish with one of La Isla's fantastic tutors. Finally, this organization taught me much more about the Nicaraguan culture than any textbook or traditional tour could have. I would strongly recommend volunteering with La Isla Foundation if you are staying in Leon. 
La Isla Foundation	143601		/users/profile/190061	sesusa	General Member of the Public	5	11/27/2012	They say that some things are such that words do not do them justice.  Such is the case with my stay in Leon with La Isla Foundation.  The following however, comes as close to how I feel as I can put into words.        There is no doubt in my mind that La Isla Foundation's "raison d'tre" is among the noblest of human endeavors.  And that is to exist solely to serve others. In this instance that service is a race against time trying to find a cause and possible solution or cure to the health problem plaguing a small Nicaraguan community. Young men, in the sugar cane industry, are dying at early ages from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).  To say that this is devastating to the community should come as no surprise.  Fortunately, La Isla has many dedicated volunteers who are attempting to eliminate this problem. In addition, others are assisting by donating to the cause.  There are several ways to do so.  One can simply make a donation, or go there in person and experience a variety of activities suited to the adventurous soul.  They include: learning Spanish and/or how to salsa; visiting Leon or other cities; visiting natural reserves or one of the several nearby volcanoes.  Do these and assist La Isla and its worthy cause In doing so, you will step into a world far different from our own.  And be sure to savor the friendship of the volunteers, for such as these, saints are made.  
La Isla Foundation	143049		/users/profile/189472	aussietom	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	when I walked in off the street 3 months ago looking for some volunteer work I had no idea about the chronic kidney epidemic of sugar cane cutters in chichgalpa, but I'm happy to know that there is an organisation like La Isla Foundation working to fix it. I really do feel their approach to the problem is working and will bring great results to the health, wellbeing, education and job prospects of this community. personally I have loved volunteering with the foundation an I feel the work of the volunteers does directly benefit the  community. My work at the foundations has included teaching English, organising and helping sports and art with schoolkids in the community, returning test results in the community and translation. I would thoroughly recommend volunteering here, you will learn a lot,work with a fantastic  commited team and meet some great people, both from the foundation abbeys communities.
La Isla Foundation	143046		/users/profile/189473	Kathleen36	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2012	My daughter spent her high school years developing a love of service to the under-served and a command of the Spanish language; then her college years developing interests in sustainable agriculture and public health.  To complete her degree requirements she chose an internship with La Isla Foundation.  The three months spent as an intern germinated a passion in her for the work of this organization and upon completion, she accepted a position on their full-time staff.  My interest began by following Katie's blog and continued as I followed the links and learned more about the issues that so drive her.  Her passion and her absense from home inspired her Dad and I to visit.  I saw for myself the devastation that CKDu has on the sugar cane harverters, their communities and families.  A young man (son, husband and father) no longer able to work - stopped by an illnes sure to be fatal.  LIF is involved in demographic study and other research to determine the cause of this specific CKDu and to recommend change.  Further, they are teaching the children of the community skills to enable their future employment to be in healthier occupations.  LIF is also raising awareness of the issues in the larger community and world.  They are advocating for a population unable to advocate for themselves.  To raise some of the money needed for this mission, LIF is present in the community teaching English and Spanish, guiding tours and teaching Salsa Dance.  We stayed in their hostel.  They were most welcoming, instructive, passionate and fun.  I am proud that my daughter works for such an important organization and would welcome the opportunity to visit LIF again.
La Isla Foundation	142551		/users/profile/189032	Hollyb3	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I first learned about La Isla Foundation and Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Aetiology (CKDu) while looking for public health and geographic information system volunteer opportunities abroad.  That was 6 months ago and since then I have packed my bags, made my way down to Lon, and begun working with the La Isla`s public health team.   Being here it is hard not to be inspired by the commitment and passion that all of the staff and volunteers have for this issue.   I have also been very impressed at how multi-faceted La Isla`s approach to this issue is:  it works with affected communities to provide education through english classes, computer lessons, art, and sports, it also raises awareness and promotes partnerships and collaborations between stakeholders for improved communication and research, and raises funds by offering spanish, yoga, and salsa classes to visitors.   Lon has been a beautiful place to live, and La Isla, an inspiring place to work.   I would recommend this organization to anyone!  
La Isla Foundation	142446		/users/profile/188918	RRS2283	Board Member	5	11/25/2012	Since forming, La Isla Foundation has been committed to addressing the epidemic of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unkown Aetiology (CKDu) in northwest Nicaragua, an epidemic at the fault lines of major global issues.  By coordinating and conducting research on the ground, as well as raising awareness around the world about both the epidemic and disease, La Isla Foundation has played a fundamental role in addressing an emerging chronic disease while helping a beleaguered community.  As an advocate, I have watched CKDu transition from a relatively unheard of disease to a prime-time news story in under 5 years; as a volunteer, I have witnessed first-hand the positive effect La Isla Foundation has in the local communities and those affected by CKDu; and, as a board member I strived to uphold our commitment  to transparency and good governance, ensuring as much of our budget reaches those in direct need as possible.  
La Isla Foundation	142419		/users/profile/188888	melissa113	Board Member	5	11/25/2012	La Isla Foundation is committed not only to providing relief to the families and communities devastated by Chronic Kidney Disease, but also to understanding the systemic failures that lead to the crisis, and advocating for policy level change to end it once and for all.  I have worked with several development organizations and non-profits in Central America, but never have I found one as committed to creating a model for long-term systemic level change as LIF.  As a volunteer, I can say that  LIF puts volunteers, interns, and students to work in meaningful ways to challenge and expand their skill set as few other organizations can.  As a board member, I am proud to say that we hold ourselves to the highest standards of transparency, organization and management at every level.  I can attest to the dedication and commitment of each of the staff who work tirelessly for very little compensation to put as much of every dollar raised as possible back into the community.  We hope that the lessons we are learning will serve as a model for addressing similar problems in the future. 
La Isla Foundation	142382		/users/profile/188849	Tom_36	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	While living and working in Leon, Nicaragua I was introduced to the CKDu epidemic while doing a video report with a journalist there.  We were both so equally impressed by the dedication and strategy of the La Isla Foundation team that we decided to hand over all of our work to them to use for the cause.  A year later I find myself working with LIF on a documentary film to expose the issue.  The team we have is like a family and many volunteers and interns leave only to pursue further studies or work directly related to what's happening here.  
La Isla Foundation	141936		/users/profile/188357	melaniew14	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	I came to La Isla Foundation as an intern for my senior internship at Temple University. I am a Sport and Recreation Management major and I was excited to use my knowledge to gain more experience with working in community relations and with a Non-Governmental Organization. I go to the community in Chichigalpa three times a week to do sports and arts, computer classes and English lessons with the kids in Guanacastal Sur whose fathers and some mothers are most likely suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease. Aside from my community work I also created and implemented the yoga program for the organization. My supervisors felt confident in me and allowed me to run and coordinate the entire program. To be able to be creative and express myself has never been an issue with LIF. The disease is a very real and heartbreaking thing, but being able to work with amazing people makes the situation easier to cope with. I do not regret doing this experience and I will never forget the memories of not only my staff, but working to help a very important cause.
La Isla Foundation	141615		/users/profile/187983	Steven28	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	I was so impressed with La Isla Foundation that I joined the board of directors as a volunteer member.  The employees work hard, the volunteers are inspired, the cause is righteous, there is little to no waste in this organization.   When I met Jason Glaser, I saw his passion and commitment to help the people in this forgotten corner of a forgotten country.  The more I learn about La Isla, the more impressed I am.  Doing so much for so many with so little.  In short, it's what a non-profit should be!
La Isla Foundation	141229		/users/profile/187492	BeccyMalloi	Donor	5	11/19/2012	I first stumbled across the website for La Isla foundation purely by accident when researching my round the world trip in May 2010, as I wanted to learn some Spanish in Nicaragua and maybe climb a volcano or two. I read about the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemic they are working to eradicate for the first time on their website and was shocked to read about what is going on there that I gave them a donation through a paypal link on their website. After that I started thinking about how I could raise some more money so I put on an afternoon of bands in my local pub where I live in Suffolk, England. We managed to raise about 1,000 GBP on the day, and, when I actually made it out there 6 months later, I got to see where my money went; they bought some computers for the school in the La Isla community about an hour away from Lon where I got to then go and volunteer at. The kids there are so clever and they all excelled on their computer course- it was amazing to see. It was such an experience to see first-hand the amazing work that is so vitally needed in the community there. I taught English and after school sports and arts club there and just loved hanging out with such clever kids- each and every one of them was such a character. From the minute I set foot in the Foundation's HQ in Lon I was welcomed with open arms into an organisation full of some of the most energetic, friendliest, engaging and inspiring people I have ever met. Every day was a blast there whether I was working in the community, learning Spanish, dancing salsa, going to 'quiz night' at the local bar in Lon, playing 'cerro escondido' (aka hide and seek) with the kids at the school or jamming with a Nica rock-band!  I was only going to stay for 4 weeks and I ended up staying for 9 as I made so many friends for life. Had I have had more time I would have stayed longer as it was so hard to leave. La Isla Foundation is now a major part of my life and it changed me forever; knowing the amazing work they are doing and so hard they are working to get to the bottom of the CKDu epidemic and to be a part of it is more inspirational than anything I have ever done before. I would recommend La Isla Foundation to anyone wanting to make a difference; you will be welcomed with open arms. 
La Isla Foundation	140680		/users/profile/186886	geekwithin	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I am an intern with La Isla Foundation doing public relations.  It has been an amazing experience.  La Isla is doing great work, and I am learning so much, and more than I could have ever hoped to.  I joined as an independent study for university and it has been above and beyond what I expected of an internship.  This is not just running errands, I have been doing a lot of work, and really made to feel as if I'm making a difference and helping the organization.  This is an immensely important cause, and La Isla is working so hard to make changes, and it is so gratifying to see change happening, with the events and the welding school and with other projects.  La Isla Foundation is a great nonprofit, and everyone should support them.  -Jessica Bucklin, Public Relations Intern
La Isla Foundation	140632		/users/profile/186833	Mrossp	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I recently spent 5 weeks in Leon, Nicaragua. The original public health-related volunteer work that I had signed up for fell through. Luckily I stumbled upon La Isla Foundation, where I was warmly greeted the minute I walked in the door. I ended up working as a volunteer with their Public Health team for a month, which ended up being one of the highlights of my time in Nicaragua. The people I worked with at La Isla were fun, smart, and dedicated, and I gained valuable insight into the public health field.  I also took part in various of their tours, took Spanish lessons at the foundation, and lived in their dormitory for my last week in Leon- All were very positive experiences!

I can't speak more highly of this organization, anyone with the mildest interest in public health, human rights, international aid, or community development will find themselves totally changed by La Isla Foundation and the people of Guanacastal Sur, Nicaragua.  A huge advance in professional development aside, my time with LIF has been integral in my young adulthood.

I was blow away by the learning opportunity and connections I made with other students and professors. Finally, a cross denominational christian and science institution; taking two of my personal loves and showing the world that yes, they can thrive together.And I kept coming back, because what better way to learn than with small, hands on classes taught by excellent professors that can teach you things far beyond their field of specialty. And you living along side these professors and their families, along with your new found friends who how else would you ever have them. It really is a one in a million type of interaction.

Working with the staff and hearing about AuSable alumni provided me with potential pathways.  My environmental education internship with Patricia was the keystone that the rest of my working life has been build upon.  The knowledge and skills that I gained during those 10 weeks provided me with the experience I needed to aquire my first job.  Today, I still use the tools and even some of the lesson plans exactly.  Thank you AuSable!

The classes were challenging but I learned a wealth of knowledge. The professors were dedicated and fun. The staff were great people. The other students became like family. The settings are inspiring. The experiences, the people, and the knowledge I gained from being a student, a staff member, and an intern will always remain with me.
Au Sable Institute	37955	8	/users/profile/38739	wendelberry	Client Served	5	05/04/2010	My experience at AuSable changed my life!  The very first course I took was about the natural history of the great lakes region in spring, and it was intense.  I learned about so many things, from how to sit quietly at dawn and identify bird calls, to how to sneak up and watch a spring peeper call at dusk.  The community there was so supportive and had a wonderful attitude of awe and caretaking towards the creation--even though my education branched off into agriculture, that sense of wonder and responsibility has stayed with me.One of the very best benefits of being a student at AuSable is getting the chance to see that sincere Christians can be serious and respected scientists.  Getting to know those people personally was an incredible benefit as I continued my education in secular universities.
Au Sable Institute	37928	8	/users/profile/38707	jamessnyder3vagov	Former staff	5	05/04/2010	Environmental education has to do with a persons lifestyle and world view. It is difficult to change a persons lifestyle and or world view without intense interpersonal interaction with other people of conviction and relative experience and knowledge. AuSable provides this kind of interaction with these kinds of leaders. Students have a rare opportunity to have their lives and minds shaped by caring,intelligent professionals. This empowers them in a unique way to change their world. The world is changed one person at a time. AuSable is committed to this mission and has proven it's methods to be effective over many years of committed effort by people of conviction, passion and service.

Au Sable Institute	37909	2	/users/profile/38661	scott6	Client Served	5	05/04/2010	Au Sable has proven to be a wonderful place for our students to enjoy nature in ways they don't get to in their everyday lives. It's a place where we can experience creation through play (snow shoeing, cross country skiing) while learning about how our everyday lives can effect what that experience will look like in the future as we care for creation in our own backyards. One great part of it is that this learning happens as the students simply experience all that Au Sable has to offer.
Au Sable Institute	36293	4	/users/profile/37085	Noah	Client Served	5	04/21/2010	Au Sable was not only a place for academic learning (which was fantastic) but it was a community of Christians dedicated to serving God and loving the world God created. It provided a vision for Kingdom building alongside brothers and sisters in Christ. I learned so much from everyone there: from the faculty to my peers to the kitchen staff. Mealtime is one of my fondest recollections, it was one way that Au Sable demonstrated how caring for creation takes intentionality in every area of life.
Au Sable Institute	35903	4	/users/profile/36693	neb	Former staff	5	04/15/2010	The years I spent at Au Sable were life transformational for me.  The depth of relationships formed there have led to lifelong friendships, and I even met my future spouse at Au Sable!  In addition, being able to share the wonder of nature with others and being able to teach the importance of being good stewards of creation was truly a joy.  Even though I never enrolled in any college courses at Au Sable, the evironment on campus was one that fostered continued learning and growth for me (through the combination of faculty and student and visiting guest interactions, lectures, field trips, library resources, opportunities to explore the natural environment through a variety of means, modeling of stewardship practices, and practicing teaching skills.)

The practical, hands on experiences Au Sable offers far surpass anything one learns from textbooks or the typical classroom experience. The class Au Sable offers in Florida at ECHO (Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization) was especially important in my life direction. This course introduced me to sustainable agriculture used to solve many of the problems facing our world and I went on to the internship program at ECHO.

The classes that Au Sable offers are incredible for getting hand on experience and for shaping future directions of the rest of your life.  A few years later I came back to Au Sable as an environmental education intern.  This experience has made me fall even more in love with the values and goals of Au Sable.  Environmental stewardship, field research, and environmental education are among my passions today and Au Sable continues to help shape my future through the Au Sable graduate fellows program.

These classes were key to my ability to complete my self-made major, since courses in my environmental concentration were not offered at my school.  The professors provided me and other students with a positive, but challenging academic experience that both equipped and inspired us.  The Au Sable program truly succeeds in inspiring young adults to embrace environmental themes in their career paths, whether in traditional science or in business or in social justice ventures.

Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency	75792	1	/users/profile/82786	certified	Volunteer	5	02/25/2011	I am on the board for the OLHSA Walk for Warmth project. I am amazed at the efforts put forth by so many to raise money to heat the homes of those in need. Corporations, small businesses, and individuals team up together to raise thousands of dollars for the cause. This year the demand is greater than ever and contributions are much harder to get. Through the efforts of so many who believe in the charitable work done by OLHSA, they've  been very successful in meeting all of their goals.     The day of " The Walk" held in February each year is truly enjoyable, It is usually attended by 700 or more and it is a real fun day while raising contributions for home  heating costs.     The sale of the little stuffed animals like bears or the current penguins has always increased donations. They've become a dated collectors item and this sale starts months before the actual day of the walk.     OLHSA always makes their volunteers feel special for every effort they make on their behalf. They are always thanking everyone for whatever help they give. They always make you feel very wanted and needed. People with delinquent heating bills are not the only project being done at OLHSA. This is only one out of 90 Projects!                                       Great group, well run, great leadership and very succesful.                                                                   Sincerely,                                                                            SM

The staff at the Howell office is exceptional in their caring and empathy.  Rather than being put out on the street after my landlord's house was being re-claimed by the bank, I was able to choose a wonderful house to rent through the HPRP housing program.  Knowing that I was a single mother with three children, un-employed for over 7 months, and my savings exhausted, the housing coordinators were able to offer the right assistance at the right time.  While receiving services, I was given financial planning guidance, created goals that would be tracked with OLHSA's assistance, and pursued my dream of returning to school for my Masters Degree in Psychology.  I have received nothing but recognition and support for my volunteer services, personal accomplishments and continual struggles.

When the Michigan economy sank to its lowest, we had countless employees in danger losing their homes and unable to pay for utlities. OLHSA came immediately when we invited them to speak to our associates, and offered individual counseling as well as group presentations. We know of at least one home that was saved from foreclosure by OLHSA's help, and have heard from so many others who are so grateful for the counseling they received. OLHSA has never said "no." They may say, "No, we don't do that," but when that is the case, they refer us to whomever can provide us with what we need.

The event is well planned and fun. We recruited some young volunteers to participate. The following summer, the OLHSA staff welcomed our young people to their office to learn more about how they can help others through volunteering. Every child got the message - and hopefully will decide to "give back" to others as they grow older. Our young people have visual impairments and often are not asked for help.

Her father and I as well as our daughter knew nothing about this cancer. All we heard was that it was very rare and survival would be limited to many variables. I immediately went to the NLMSF website where I learned about this cancer that few knew about,, as well as doctors who never even treated it.MIy husband and I received so much support and understanding about LMS when we attended our first Hugfest in Branson, MO. From then on we became very active in the process of fund raising and spreading the word.It is amazing how much progress the researchers searching for a cure have made. The support and funds for research given in grants has increased the movement for the CURE Together. Fortunately, our daughter had excellent doctors who watched her closely and today still remains in remission. Thank you NLMSF. I can't stress enough how much NLMSF needs lay people to volunteer to be Ambassadors for the Foundation. Go to nlmsf.org.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301457		/users/profile/392389	Writer	Donor	5	08/24/2016	I knew nothing about the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation until a dear friend was diagnosed with this rare disease.   This affected the entire family and still does.   I have seen this family volunteer many hours in helping promote this foundation.   Without the dedication and volunteers like them, there would not be community awareness and the needed research funding for the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation.  As a result, I have come involved with this foundation.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301262		/users/profile/392163	Writer	Donor	5	08/22/2016	My wife was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in 2014. We have been delighted with the information and support provided to us by the NLMSF. The volunteers are so helpful and friendly and understand what I am going through because most of them are or have a family member diagnosed with LMS. I will always support them and thank them.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301261	1	/users/profile/392162	NLMSF treasurer	Board Member	5	08/22/2016	I was diagnosed with LMS in 2014 and went in search of information about this very rare and terrible disease. The first thing I did was to check online for a support group. I came across NLMSF and was so pleased with the information and support they provide. I soon realized that they were in need of a treasurer and, having done that for many non-profits and boards in my career, applied to do that. I am so glad I did. The board members are wonderful, caring, and supportive people who know what I am going through. I make a monthly donation and always will. Thank you NLMSF!
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301226	2	/users/profile/392122	Play9	Donor	5	08/22/2016	Where does one go or turn to for support when learning about leiomyosarcoma. It can be a very unsettling experience when even your doctor has never heard of it, seen a case of it, or treated it. It's that rare of a disease (cancer) so it's not surprising to learn that leiomyosarcoma (LMS) doesn't get a lot of attention from researchers or support for research funding or just raising awareness in the medical field and community. UNTIL NOW!!!  The NLMSF is a dedicated, passionate group of people that are working together to find a cure. This Foundation raises money to fund LMS specific research, help educate the medical community and public about LMS, and has become a valuable resource to raise the level of awareness through it's website (NLMSF.org) and informational forums. If you truly want to make a difference in the life of others affected by LMS, this is the organization that deserves your involvement.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301141	3	/users/profile/392024	Writer	Donor	5	08/20/2016	I lost my 43 year old brother to Leiomyosarcoma last year. When he was diagnosed six years ago we turned to the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation for information. They provided that and so much more: COMPASSION and a group of volunteers who were always there to help through the tough times of this rare disease. NMLSF provides outreach to those families affected by NMLSF as well as money to those doctors and researchers who work vigorously to find a cure for this insidious cancer that does not get the resources and funding needed to find a cure.  God Bless all of the wonderful volunteers of this organization and everyone affected by this cancer.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301131	3	/users/profile/392014	denicar	Volunteer	5	08/20/2016	NLMSF has worked tirelessly to create a foundation that personally reaches patients in need of a community that is there for them.  NLMSF is always available through phone calls or the internet to personally assist patients with their treatment plans or to just have someone to talk to.  Recently a chat room was set up for patients to exchange thoughts and feelings with each other which was very successful. NLMSF is truly dedicated and committed to finding innovative ways to find funding for a cure for this truly underfunded rare form of cancer.  They have also been able to bring top scientists, clinicians and researchers onboard to interact with each other as well as the sarcoma community at various conferences around the country. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301078	3	/users/profile/391955	Writer	Donor	5	08/19/2016	This foundation does a great job raising money for a disease that gets very little recognition and I am proud to be a part of it. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	301069	3	/users/profile/391945	Kim_233	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	I had the privilege of getting to know the hardworking and dedicated individuals that are giving their time and talent to the Leio-myo cause volunteering for the 5K races held in Cincinnati, Ohio. I am not a stranger to volunteering my time; however, working with the Leiomyosarcoma Foundation, opened my eyes to the urgent need to find a cure for this group of potentially devastating cancers.  I was unfamiliar with the term "orphan cancer"  until my best friend's daughter was diagnosis with Leiomyosarcoma. If you can imagine a Mother and Father's tiger-like will to do anything to help one of their children, that energy and will to keep going on is evident in all of the hard working individuals that make up the Leiomyosarcoma Foundation.It is my privilege to be associated with such a diligent and unfailing group of people. Let's slay the Dragon together.  
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300923	3	/users/profile/391794	jilymich	General Member of the Public	5	08/18/2016	National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation is working hard to help patients and their families get the best treatment for leiomyosarcoma. We lost my mother-in-law to this type of cancer, and unfortunately many people are not familiar with it. The work done by National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation is so important and can help save lives. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300904	3	/users/profile/391777	Linda432	General Member of the Public	5	08/18/2016	I have a friend who lost his mother to this dreaded disease. Without dedication and fundraising, the research necarsary to help find treatment and a cure for this rare form of cancer is stalled leaving patients and families waiting. Through this nonprofit fundraising foundation you can help advance hope and real solutions to find the cause, treatment and possible cure for this devastating form of cancer.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300831	4	/users/profile/391703	Marcy2016	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/17/2016	NLMSF is my first call whenever I have any sarcoma patient cases to discuss.  This is an absolutely wonderful sarcoma foundation that reaches out personally to patients via personal phone calls, helping sarcoma patients navigate their treatment plans.  NLMSF has impressive leadership in Annie Achee and Mitchell Achee, MD who have a passion for helping sarcoma patients access the top resources to battle this very challenging and terribly under-served disease.  NLMSF makes a real difference in the funding of sarcoma research.  They revere their researchers, and they understand the importance of collaboration throughout the US and abroad.  Having seen Annie Achee and Dr. Mitchell Achee in action at major cancer conferences, I marvel at how adept they both are at interacting with clinicians, scientists, and the patient community. They, and members of their board, are intent on building a major foundation.  And they are already major in terms of impact!  Everyone needs to financially support this unique sarcoma charity that truly cares about transparency, accountability, and responsive patient services.  The NLMSF booth at the recent ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago was one of the most active booths of all patient organizations.  Dr. Achee and Annie work tirelessly for sarcoma patients and researchers.  This organization deserves massive public support.
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300739	4	/users/profile/391627	Writer	Donor	5	08/17/2016	The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation is dedicated to raising funds for this rare disease. The volunteers in charge are so compassionate and unrelenting on finding a cure.  We have raised money every year for the past 4 years for NLMSF as this disease has touched us personally. A dear friend of ours mother passed away when this little girl was only 3 years old.  My daughter and her raised money by Trick or Treating for donations instead of candy! It was a great experience for them, one they will never forget. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300726	4	/users/profile/391610	Roberto5	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2016	Leiomyosarcoma is such a rare disease that without organizations like the NLMSF, many patients would be without any form of information on how to deal with the disease without it. Most doctors are not well versed on this form of cancer and finding doctors who are experts without sources like the NLMSF is exceedingly difficult. But ultimately the information is secondary compared to the human part of the equation. The people who run the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation are dedicated and tireless in their service to people in need of the support and resources they provide. I cannot recommend them enough. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300693	4	/users/profile/391572	remission	Client Served	5	08/16/2016	NLMSF works tirelessly to fund life-saving research and bring valuable information to patients with leiomyosarcoma. 95% of all incoming donations go to LMS Research. I attended their national symposium in Columbus, OH, in 2015 and learned a great deal about the research and patient care efforts underway by sarcoma specialists working on this rare illness. The beauty of this organization is its personal nature; people know each other and freely share what they are learning to assist other patients. Regional symposiums bring researchers and physicians directly to patients so they can meet and get questions answered. Monthly phone chats provide more personal support. The website offers the latest news in research efforts to find treatments for this relentless disease. 
National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation	300659	3	/users/profile/391535	Robin156	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2016	Patients and their families search desperately for reliable information and proper treatment for LMS, a rare and often life-threatening cancer. The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation provides accurate information at every stage of the journey. Resources include the NLMSF website, patient education meetings with expert physicians and researchers, internet forums like ACOR and Smart Patients, Facebook, and most important of all, caring personal contact. NLMSF promotes and funds vital research. It is a warm, superbly informed, active and involved organization. During the hardest time of their lives, patients and their families find a safe harbor at NLMSF.
Journalism And Women Symposium	80743		/users/profile/88119	bettymedsger	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2011	JAWS is indispensable as a source of positive connection and support for women journalists. That support comes in many vital forms -- sharing experiences, stimulating intellectual exchange and creating bonds  based on shared professional interests and friendship. It is a group that is a vital core for women journalists of many ages and from many types of journalism.
Journalism And Women Symposium	80364		/users/profile/87730	margaretengel	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	JAWS fills the huge gaps in education and training for women in journalism. Most newsrooms do not have the capacity or time to do training. JAWS does nuts and bolts training on using new media, digital equipment, editing, reporting, shooting stories, upgrading and improving one's skills, etc. This community of helps continues on a day to day basis through its daily email alerts, information sharing and help to individuals. It has extremely low administrative expenses and is a labor of love AND achievement.
Journalism And Women Symposium	80318		/users/profile/87682	Susys200	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	Even in this economy, I would not miss the annual JAWS meeting. This group not only provides education, information and mentoring to members, it also keeps me up to date on issues and opportunities within the industry. It gives us training that helps us do our jobs better and allows us to learn practical dos and don'ts from people who have done it all. I put together my first video online at JAWS, loaded up my tweetdeck and started a Facebook page. 
Journalism And Women Symposium	80257		/users/profile/87620	pegamiga	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	JAWS is a valuable connector of writers and reporters of many generations, with a growing base of younger members who teach others the intricacies of social media networking techniques. It also offers techno workshops for members in sessions across the country to raise the skills of journalists in this very difficult transition. And it is a formidable force for networking, which remains important decades after the lawsuits have been resolved seeking to get more women in the door. It also goes well beyond the mega-white girls in drawing in reporters and editors of different races and ethnicities -- never enough but enough so that it seems natural and is a base to build on.
Journalism And Women Symposium	80249		/users/profile/87612	ejgraff	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	JAWS is an amazing organization of female journalists--simultaneously dead-serious and raucously funny, immensely supportive and highly challenging. From the very first time I attended "camp," the annual symposium, I was more than welcomed. People roped me into conversations and meals, offered their guest rooms if I ever traveled to their cities, were generous with their time and connections, and urged me to aim high and higher. These profound friends have asked me to double-check my sources, given me phone numbers and inside knowledge, and let me help them when I could. Give! Join! Come make new friends and connections, and change journalism into a field that better supports women!

In doing so, JAWS members share common experiences and learn from one another. This organization elevates the profession.
Journalism And Women Symposium	73156		/users/profile/79963	nbjnyc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	From its start in 1985, JAWS has been an organization for women unlike any other. It isn't a club or a sorority. It is a symposium where women in journalism meet once a year at a "camp," not a staid convention, to examine the role women play in journalism, find inspiration in their professional lives and commune with each other  in great places like Fishkill, Montana. Its earliest members--like Betsy Wade of the New York Times -- were some of the best in the business. I hesitated to join them until I went to camp and found that everyone was equal regardless of title or experience. An incredibly accessible, supportive group. Today as journalism struggles for relevancy, JAWS empowers the next generation of women to find solutions. Between camps, the website and list serv keep everyone alerted to issues, job/fellowship opportunities and the special events members hold around the country
Journalism And Women Symposium	73117		/users/profile/79923	andreastonez	Board Member	4	02/22/2011	I have met the most amazing, inspirational women since I joined JAWS. As a veteran journalist, I have learned so much from younger members about the changes taking place in our profession and in return have been able to mentor some of the profession's future stars.  But JAWS is getting even better as it aims to expand its horizons to offer cutting-edge training to women both starting out in their careers and those needing new skills to stay in the business.
Journalism And Women Symposium	73082		/users/profile/79888	sgcomm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	JAWS brings together women in media who have excelled in their work, who want to reach higher and go farther, and who also want to bring younger women along in the news and information business, which hasn't always appreciated its female employees. JAWS camps and mini-camps offer intellectual and professional development and opportunities to build relationships with trailblazers.  Membership provides peer-to-peer interaction and support.  All of these are critical for female journalists' advancement -- particularly at a time when news-gathering techniques and the economic model for journalism are changing faster than we ever could have imagined.

Journalism And Women Symposium	72954		/users/profile/79751	Megan K	Board Member	5	02/22/2011	JAWS has been the most amazing organization because the women in JAWS believed in my leadership capabilities much more than I did myself. I first came to the annual conference on a fellowship in 1998. I served on the board for two years, helping re-write the strategic plan and fundraise for two challenge grants. When I was asked to stand as president, I never thought I could do it, but these women made me trust in my own abilities. I can always turn to them for professional guidance and personal encouragement. And each conference is an amazing learning experience that I find very empowering. In a chaotic media landscape where diversity is endangered more than ever, JAWS helps women advance in their careers and encourages them to help other women advance as well.

I am also a victim of Dr. Fata and was mistreated by him for 5 years. When I was diagnosed for the 3rd time with an agressive form of breast cancer called Triple Negative I was in shock and scared. Cancer not only affects your health,it affects your finaces. When I was diagnosed the first 2 times me and my husband didn't have help with our bills because we couldn't find help and he had to work 2 and 3 jobs to take care of me and our 4 kids. I am a state licensed daycare owner and I had to close my doors so I could begin treatment. My cancer support group leader referred me to The New Day Foundation and my life changed. Instead of being terrified of not being able to pay our bills I could concentrate on getting better. Gina the founder came out to my house personally, talked with me and was so kind and understanding. It was like talking to a friend. She offered to pay our house payments for 3 months and gave us 3 months of grocery gift cards. The foundation also included us  in their Christmas Giving Program and our 2 younger kids got wonderful gifts from their sponsors. Me and my family have been through such a horrible ordeal these past 8 years with my 3 diagnosis of breast cancer and also being a victim of Dr.Fata who went to prison for harming his patients. New Day Foundation made our life easier and made me have peace of mind that my kids wouldn't go without and we wouldn't lose our home.

What New Day Foundation has done for our family could never be fully explained.  When my husband was diagnosed with cancer our heads were spinning!  We were so overwhelmed with the diagnosis itself, but also the stress of "every day life" was overwhelming.  New Day swooped down like angels from the sky and wrapped their wings around our family.  There are just no words to describe the help that they gave our family.  They took such burden off of our shoulders by paying our house payment for several months along with several other bills and also sent gift cards to help with groceries and to help buy school clothes for my daughter.Thank you New Day!

I was overwhelmed and a mother of a one year old wondering how I would make it through. New day was not only there with financial support but amazing people to listen, which is hard to find when you are going through such a difficult battle

New Day Foundation For Families	280532		/users/profile/370430	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/19/2016	While so many worthwhile cancer support organizations exist, few have the face-to-face presence of New Day.  Meeting with the patient and their families, providing support, counseling and short term financial assistance is truly meeting hurting families "where they're at."    I am so proud to be affiliated with this organization and the good work it does.
New Day Foundation For Families	280433	1	/users/profile/370310	lbeaugreece	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2016	This wonderful organization is helping the Regan family as Kathy, the mom of five school age children, struggles with double rare appendix cancer. The dad lost his job mid year 2015. Without New Day's help, it's likely that all seven of them would be homeless. Mom faces another major surgery later this year due to her cancer's recurrence.  I am so grateful there are groups like this one to help families focus on the war against cancer and not worry about a roof over their heads and empty stomachs. God bless New Day and its donors for shouldering some of the burdens. Hope is such a powerful force at times like this.

The New Day is the perfect name for this organization because thats exactly what it felt like, a brand new day we have never seen before.  The Montgomery family is so ever grateful and humbled by this experience. We thank our sponsors and the foundation a thousand times over.

New Day Foundation For Families	279729	1	/users/profile/369693	Tina95,	Client Served	5	02/10/2016	I found out I was diagnosed with my 3rd but of breast cancer on September 4,2015. I am also a victim of Dr. Fata and was mistreated by him for 5 years. When I was diagnosed for the 3rd time with an agressive form of breast cancer called Triple Negative I was in shock and scared. Cancer not only affects your health,it affects your finaces. When I was diagnosed the first 2 times me and my husband didn't have help with our bills because we couldn't find help and he had to work 2 and 3 jobs to take care of me and our 4 kids. I am a state licensed daycare owner and I had to close my doors so I could begin treatment. My cancer support group leader referred me to The New Day Foundation and my life changed. Instead of being terrified of not being able to pay our bills I could concentrate on getting better. Gina the founder came out to my house personally, talked with me and was so kind and understanding. It was like talking to a friend. She offered to pay our house payments for 3 months and gave us 3 months of grocery gift cards. The foundation also included us  in their Christmas Giving Program and our 2 younger kids got wonderful gifts from their sponsors. Me and my family have been through such a horrible ordeal these past 8 years with my 3 diagnosis of breast cancer and also being a victim of Dr.Fata who went to prison for harming his patients. New Day Foundation made our life easier and made me have peace of mind that my kids wouldn't go without and we wouldn't lose our home. I recommend them to all my Pink Breast Cancer Sisters and I am thankful every day that they helped us.

When I was first diagnosed, New Day helped our family.  My husband and I have five children, all at home and in school.  Last spring, I needed to resign from my position due to my treatments.  In June, my husband lost his job.  He is back in school, and though we have been ok, we really needed help to get us through the next couple of months until he gets a position.  New Day came through for us again, going above and beyond to make sure that not only our physical needs were met, but our emotional needs as well.  I cannot speak highly enough of this organization.

This is my second season playing, and I have to say, i wouldn't stop for anything. I really don't know what to say. they're very good at placing you on a team and getting you in right away (not in the middle of a season, mind you). there are many ways to adapt your handicapped child (or adult) to using their stick, and very flexable rules for doing that. Back to the main point....this place has been life changing for me, giving me the ability to play sports and to interact socially with many people, contrary to many handicapped children's social, but limited, lifestyle.  
The WCHL	94025		/users/profile/107150	lzo	Volunteer	5	07/19/2011	The WCHL is an amazing organization that offers every challenged athlete a chance to play hockey, no matter what their ability level.  I remember when I was driving my then 10 year old son to his first practice, he was so nervous, but when we got there everyone welcomed him and made him feel so comfortable that he couldnt wait to go back and play again.  He has now been playing for the league for 10 years, and is the Captain of his current team, a mentor to the younger player and has received numerous awards for his ability, and sportsmanship. He owes all of this to the amazing players and families within the WCHL. They have offered him opportunities that no one else could. I consider every player, every family member and every volunteer within the WCHL a member of my family and look forward to every game.  
The WCHL	93161	1	/users/profile/106951	Penny C.	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2011	The WCHL is a well organized sports league that provides a team that's fun and competitive and gives players and families an opportunity tobe a part of something where they can learn, support one another, cheer one another on or just hang out with each other and enjoy watching some fabulous hockey. The Wheelchair Hockey League gives players a reason to get healthy - to play hockey and see their friends! 
The WCHL	92738		/users/profile/106435	sim0n2947	Volunteer	4	06/29/2011	I was introduced to the WCHL through a friend and participant when I was 16. I refereed my first game the following week and volunteered countless hours to the league for five years. Although I was not given a wage for my time and effort, I never would have accepted one if I had the option because I believe in the WCHL and  support what the league stands for and provides. Knowing that my actions helped to keep such a great organization running more smoothly is more rewarding than any amount of money could ever be.

The group is extremely welcoming and ensures that everyone has the opportunity to compete (not just participate, but actively compete).  We drive over 180 miles each weekend to participate, because the experience is so valuable.  From the league administrators, to the parents, to the other participants, this is simply a first class organization. 
The WCHL	92680		/users/profile/106345	billwayland	Client Served	5	06/28/2011	My son James has Cerebral Palsy. We have tried Challenger Baseball, Wheelchair Basketball and Sled Hockey. All good sports if it is a match, but some were impossible or he out grew the age group or it did not hold his interest. Wheelchair Hockey can adapt to most any wheelchair disability and allow the player to be truly competitive in a REAL sport. It is played by a wide range of ages and allows players to stay involved, develop friendships and confidence. What more could you ask for. 
The WCHL	92665		/users/profile/104755	Brenda D.	Volunteer	5	06/28/2011	My son was in the hospital for the 5th time with pnemonia and he was telling the nurses how much he loved hockey and wished he could be a player and one nurse told him about a wheelchair hockey league she knew about and gave him imformation about the league. He was very excited and after being released from the hospital soon went to his first practice, it opened a whole new world for him. In school he could not participate in sports and did not even have a gym class, when he told the school about the hockey league and how much he loved playing they got the stuff and he was then able to have a gym class, somedays they would let his friends from class play with him and some days he practiced on his own. He was able to make a lot of new friends at school by talking about his hockey and intrest in sports. He always still looks forward to Wheelchair hockey on the weekend. He practiced and became a good player and one year his dream of making the travel team came ture and now he can look forward to Hockey all year because the travel team plays on the off season. Its just been such a benefit for him to be part of a team, the league has become like extended family.There are many health related experiences with the physically challenged players all share and they tell each other what they have tired that has worked and what doesn't work. Its just good overall fun, watching them compete for the cup and how many of them are fierce competitors on the court and best of friends off. We have people walking by just stop and watch, they love the excitement and how the fans really cheer for the teams.
The WCHL	92664		/users/profile/106338	mary	Board Member	4	06/28/2011	I started with the wheelchair hockey league in 2001 as an adult looking for a recreation outlet.   It became much more to me than a recreation outlet, it helped me grow as a person and helped me  work on my leadership roles on and off the court.    When I started I really didn't know that much about hockey, but was eager to learn.  The seasoned players helped me learn and grow as a player.      
The WCHL	92622		/users/profile/106289	Dean O.	Board Member	5	06/28/2011	For the past ten years I've been a part of the WCHL. The WCHL provides a great experience for both young kids and adult hockey fans who are physically handicapped. It allows them a chance to be a normal individual and have fun while learning the game of hockey. I know for a fact that without the WCHL my life would be much worse. It has given me something to work for in life and is something I hope everyone can experience.
The WCHL	92616		/users/profile/106281	Anthony N.	Board Member	5	06/28/2011	I became aware of the WCHL through other disabled kids at my school who were involved with it. I was nervous to come and check it out at first, because I feared it was just another sport for kids with disabilities that was not of the competitive nature. However when I was 12 I finally decided to come and watch a game and fell in love ever since. Both my brothers play hockey and for years I sat in the stands wishing so bad that I could play, but because I was born with Osteogenisis Imperfecta and bound to a wheelchair, I was never able. When I found the WCHL I was able to play hockey just like my brothers, in a competitive league where everyone can play. Over the years I made so many friends and became much more involved, it has become like my second family.
The WCHL	92564		/users/profile/106223	Jason F.	Volunteer	5	06/28/2011	     I first got introduced to the WCHL through my brother Mike, who has been an active player for ten years now. As a fan, I always enjoyed the exciting games, support and comradery of the families and players alike. Last season I started volunteering as a DJ, and this season I have also taken on refereeing. Being involved in the WCHL is personally an amazing experience everytime. I admire the players  immensely for their skill, motivation and courage alike.      To any parents of disabled/ wheelchair bound children who are interested in joining, I greatly incourage you to do so. The enjoyment on the players faces, and the lasting friendships alone to me are priceless.     The WCHL is a very special organization where children and adults alike with similar backgrounds and challanges can be competitive, make friends, and more than anything simply have fun. 
The WCHL	92406		/users/profile/106026	Meaghan K.	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	I have been involved with the WCHL for the past three years reffing games and have been attending games since 2007. This league has developed a sense of sportsmanship in me that I had never experienced before. Having gotten to know the players, parents and volunteers over the years, I have learned a lot about teamwork, endurance and dependability. The Wheelchair Hockey League is home to not only the enthusiastic players who are physically disabled, but to all who participate and spectate. This sport and its members rely on those who help to allow this organization to flourish.  We are like a family if anything. We all lean on each other and appreciate what everyone is there for.  My favorite parts of the sport include the reactions from the crowd when a team scores or gets called on.. how methodical the players can be and the intensity of each team's drive to win. Having reffed for the past three years, I am able to look at the players and understand their goals and habits. Every team is unique and driven.  Over all, the WCHL provides a safe, entertaining and athletic release for all of those involved. I look forward to it every week and am proud and honored to be apart of such a great community of people. 
The WCHL	92073		/users/profile/105500	Beth L.	Volunteer	5	06/25/2011	I have been volunteering for the Wheelchair Hockey League (WCHL) for eight years as the statistician for the games.  My responsibilities during the games include scorekeeping, recording penalties, and keeping track of players' switches in and out of the game.  Outside the game, I assist with running the voting for the annual All-Star Game and Awards Banquet.   I also travel with the Michigan Mustangs (WCHL's travel team) each summer and take pictures at their tournaments.   Why do I do all of this as a volunteer?  Because the WCHL is one of the most amazing organizations I have encountered.  The league is run entirely by the players with the assistance of family members and volunteers.  I love helping to keep the league true to their vision of an organization that is not only competitive, but supportive of players of all abilities.   The WCHL is an organization worthy of notice.  The members are not only part of a team within the league, but they are also part of the larger WCHL family.  
The WCHL	91802		/users/profile/105131	babsy4969	Volunteer	5	06/23/2011	My name is Barbara Ulewicz, and my son, Brian, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, has been a member of the WCHL since 1998.  He's played mostly Defense and as Goalie, his preferred position. Over the years, he's been voted as Goalie of the Year several times. He joined the league in it's beginning years, at the age of 14. He is now 27 years old, and he's played on the league 13 years straight. He was quite surprised when he was first joining the league, to be able to pick out the number 19 as his official playing number, after his hero, Steve Yzerman. But his greatest joy ever was to discover that there was even a sport that was available and adapted for wheelchair users to begin with. The fact that it was hockey, his favorite sport, just made it all the more exciting for him! And what a fulfilling and heartwarming feeling, as a parent, to know that my child can finally participate playing in a sport, in an organization that will accept him exactly the way he is! Success....my son can experience and enjoy playing a sport he truly loves! To give a little more insight into the general make up of the WCHL, both manual and power wheelchair players are accepted, beginning at the age of 10 years old. There are both females and males alike on the 4 teams formed at the present time. There is also a diverse area of physical impairments among the players, such as several forms of muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and others. Anyone and everyone who meets the criteria of being a wheelchair user with a legitimate physical impairment, and at least 10 years old, can join our league. And of course, all are welcome to come out during our active season (Sept. - June) to see for themselves just what our WCHL is all about, and how they too can join our organization. Anyone interested in our league can also check out our website at www.thewchl.com, or they can contact our commissioner, Chris Lemieux, at chris@thewchl.com. Besides all the freedom and fun a league such as the WCHL can provide, so much more can come out of our organization to benefit everyone involved.  Most importantly, there's lasting friendships to be made amongst the players, as well as with the parents. In time, with this comes communication and mutual support and concern for each other. With this then, there is growth to exchange and discuss similar thoughts and ideas which ultimately helps to form a bond between so many  persons.  The WCHL can and does do all this, just as if we've formed our own caring family.

Since joining the Wheelchair Hockey League (WCHL) in 1998, I have made many friends and teammates, as well as, having some of the most enjoyable experiences of my life, both physically and emotionally. The WCHL is a floor hockey league where persons with any disability can play and enjoy the sport of hockey. The league has 40+ members, split up into 4 teams and we play a 12 game season each year plus playoffs all for the chance at a league championship and the right to raise the Wheelers Cup. Along with the league, I am also part of a traveling tournament team known as the Michigan Mustangs. We are comprised of members of the WCHL and each year we travel to different cities and states all in the goal of competing in the sport of elite power hockey. We have competed in 6 tournaments since 2000, including winning the U.S. Power Hockey Championship in 2009 and finishing with the silver medal at the Power Hockey Cup in 2010. We are currently planning for our next tournament which will take place in Philadelphia, PA in August 2011. Joining the WCHL has been one of the best decisions of my life and has enriched my life in countless ways. If you want to join a happy family type atmosphere, where sportsmenship and teamwork are daily staples.

I will never forget the first time he ever played and the first time he ever scored, it brought tears to my eyes. The look on his face is the look that every parent loves the look of excitement, of accomplishment, and happiness, and that look on a child that is disable is priceless.  He found a place where he is not different but just like every other team mate, he found a place where he belongs.  The WCHL is so organized and runs it like a true hockey league.  It is so much fun to watch, it is a truelly  undescribable feeling.

Since moving to the Detroit area in 1998, he has been playing in the WCHL.  This has been a great opportunity for him, as well as my wife and I.  It gives us a family of people outside of our own family.  It has helped him grow into a man during the last 13 years playing competitive wheelchair hockey and interacting with others who may come out to participate.  He now is the Commissioner and runs the league on a daily basis.  It takes a lot of his time and energy, and he loves every minute of it.

Art Road Non Profit Corporation	249284	1	/users/profile/337116	acparks	Volunteer	5	07/22/2015	I have visited the Art Road Non Profit art classes in action. This is an amazing program. I am a teacher and I am so grateful to have art classes still available in my art district. My students have multiple and severe disabilities and I see the joy on the faces of my students each time they go to art class. Art allows them to express themselves in alternative ways that they do not have access to during the rest of the school day. I was able to witness this with a classroom of children with disabilities at Edison Elementary, as an Art Road Non Profit volunteer. The Art Road staff and volunteers embraced all of the children in art class that day and let them express themselves in their art and encouraged individuality. As a teacher and a parent, I am always inspired by organizations that can reach students and help them build confidence.  I have witnessed first hand how utilizing arts and creativity can  help children overcome insecurities, and challenges. This is what Art Road is all about. We have to keep the arts in schools for those students that need encouragement to remain engaged in school. Art Road helps all children but especially touches children at risk. I have witnessed the passion of the staff and volunteers and know that they are truly dedicated to each child they work with.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	247356	1	/users/profile/334881	Chimere	Volunteer	5	07/03/2015	Art Road Non Profit Corporation  is a very creative and productive corporation. All of Detroit Public Schools (if any) no longer have art classes in the daily curriculum. While interning for Art Road Non Profit Corporation it was one of the most humbling experiences that confirmed my goal that I set forth to become a social worker. The art classes start off with an educational aspect first. The art students are educated about the history of prolific artists and their form(s) of what art was/is to them. The students were encouraged to express themselves artistically through colors, drawings and several other different forms of artistry. The Hofgartner's and all their staff would engage the student talk to them and become very animated in their art and conversation with the students. The students looked forward to learning and showing off their skills. Stephen and Carol Hofgartner are two amazing, kind hearted, gifted and driven individuals that I am very thankful to have met and worked with. I wish them and every student that comes in contact with all the success in the world.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245859		/users/profile/287485	Christos R.	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I honestly could not imagine an educational experience without art. ART is what Art Road brings to the schools they effect, the DPSS schools without ART. Without Art Road there would be so many DPSS elementary students with very little, if any, creativity to look forward to during their school week. Isn't creativity what keeps so many of us going? Creating 2D and 3D objects from scratch, and exercising your problem-solving skills to get the job done? Art Road is essential to all of the right-brained young people out there (and there are so many...) who need to apply their abilities to creative and problem-solving pursuits.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245466	1	/users/profile/332633	SBat	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	I have known about Art Road since 2008 or 09 when I first started volunteering to get artwork to auction off at their annual event to help the students of Detroit. Since art classes were taken out of the curriculum in Detroit, Art Road has been able to help so many kids find their artistic sides back in the classroom. I have been a volunteer in the classrooms and you can see the light in their eyes when they are coming in to the classroom to take their seats and get ready to start getting creative. It is like  you can see the thought bubbles above the kids heads once they get to start creating the lesson of the day. I think Art Road has made an impact in and out of the classrooms of Detroit. Kids take their learning and imaginations with them and use it in their everyday lives.

The students have gained a sense of pride in their art projects and the freedom to feel a sense of success outside of the academic setting.  Also, the students look forward to all Friday sessions and the opportunity to express themselves in the most creative nature within the art classes.  In addition, the Art Road program allows the teachers to be an active observer in the class due to the fact that all lessons are led by energetic, motivated, and innovative instructors.  Lastly, the Art Road program has increased my student's overall exposure to a wide range of life experiences and future careers.

Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245371		/users/profile/332521	cathianderson96	Board Member	5	06/16/2015	Art Road brings world class art projects to Detroit Public School children who do not have art as a part of their curriculum.  It is an amazing nonprofit that allows professionals in all walks of artistic fields such as: automotive design, architecture, etc...to come and work with the children and mentor them through art, developing a love of art in our future work force.  Carol, the founder, is full of heart and works successfully and tirelessly to bring art to hundreds of DPS students each and every week with her teaching artists.  Attendance has gone up on art days at school and the children know what it feels like to create and to have the sense of accomplishment and recognition that goes along with that.  Carol is the real deal.  You can't help but to want to help her see her dream come to fruition.  Amazing and important work being done here!!!
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245335		/users/profile/332475	Caitlin8	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	Art Road has not only been an amazing goal-oriented group, but they have truly transformed art education and community strength.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245333		/users/profile/332471	JasonHoc	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	I have volunteered for Art Road several times and there is no greater reward than making a difference in the lives of young children in our community.  I have had the unique opportunity to volunteer assisting kids with their art projects in their elementary school art classes, helping to build an art installation at the incredible Heidelberg Project in Detroit and collecting art supplies at numerous Detroit Tigers Opening Day celebrations.  All of these opportunities offered a unique chance to interact with some amazing children (and adults) and I am forever grateful.  Art Road does some incredible things and I wish them continued success.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245322		/users/profile/332459	Tweed	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	I have volunteered for quite a few non profits but Art Road really stands out from the rest. They provide art class to students that have lost it in their curriculum due to budget cuts. Seeing how happy the kids are to be able to freely express themselves through artistic expression is a gift in itself. Art Road has kept me coming back to volunteer since 2009 because they are such passionate, caring, all around good people. They genuinely care about their non profit, the children's lives they enrich, and the people that volunteer for them. 
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245321		/users/profile/332458	laurieten	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	Artroad is an amazing non profit! From the minute I was introduced to the concept of bringing Art back into schools I knew I had to get involved. My children are in school in their curriculum includes so little art that I had to go outside the public school system and pay for the classes that I knew would round their education and fulfill their creative minds.  I am an artist and make a living from my photography. I love my career and can't imagine what I would be doing If I hadn't had amazing teachers and exposure to the arts. I love to volunteer for Artroad and watch the excitement and joy the kids have about art class! They come running down the halls and never want to leave. Art starts conversation, it allows space for imagination and dreams. It is an essential building block to individuality. Let's face it , art is fun and an extremely important part of life. Like the bumper sticker says.. Life without art is stupid!
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245314		/users/profile/332445	Doug Z.	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	Art Road is the most genuine, sincere, and caring nonprofit organization that I have ever volunteered for. The leadership team is dedicated to offering art to elementary school-aged students who may not have this exposure otherwise. Art enables these children to express themselves in a unique way. Each volunteer experience is rewarding with Art Road, and I walk away richer from being a part of it. 
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245311		/users/profile/332442	jkorman79	Volunteer	4	06/15/2015	Art Road is all about providing great experiences for young students.  Their art classes allow children an opportunity for artistic expression, a place to relax and have fun, and a way to open their eyes to other worlds.  Art Road isn't just for students, but they're also great at engaging volunteers.  There are regular opportunities to work one-on-one with students on their art projects, which is always a lot of fun.  
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245303		/users/profile/332436	Robotics1	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	I visited an ArtRoad classroom at the Charles Wright Academy in Detroit a few months ago.  I can't begin to tell you how impressed I was by the level of instruction, student engagement, and school support for this program.  Instruction in the arts is critical to the future success of our country, as not every student will be attracted to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).   We can't afford to leave any students behind, and ArtRoad is clearly attracting student interest.  As a nation, we need to start supporting STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math).  I wish ArtRoad programs were offered in every school in Detroit and across the country where art classes have been eliminated.  
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245297		/users/profile/332427	JRice1245	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	Art Road is beautiful!  The students are so excited about art and need it.  Volunteering with my sons in the art room makes us feel good and often with larger organizations you are not working side by side with the students.  Seeing the students' smiles and their pride in their art is really rewarding.  My sons enjoy making art and talk on the way home from volunteering about how lucky they are to have art at their school.  
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245294		/users/profile/332424	MIchaelKee	Volunteer	5	06/15/2015	A lot of the students were really happy with their art project and really enjoyed doing it.  I thought being with all the kids, it was pretty cool being a volunteer as a high school student.  The kids could definitely relate to me because I am younger.  I was there very recently at their age.
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245291		/users/profile/332422	MHotchkiss	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/15/2015	Inspiring the love for learning and teaching students the skills to succeed are very rewarding aspects of my job as a Montessori school teacher.  Art Road's art program gives the students the chance to learn critical thinking by making art, enhances large and fine motor skills and opens them up to a new world of famous artists, art terms and art history.  I have seen Art Road first hand in the art rooms as a volunteer and at numerous events.  Congratulations Art Road in making art class happen for the students that would not orherwise have the opportunity to have fun making art!
Art Road Non Profit Corporation	245289		/users/profile/332419	ToddPatrick	Board Member	5	06/15/2015	As a  home designer and builder, art has been a big part of my life.  I had art classes at Parkman Elementary School in Detroit and those classes were the Foubdation of my love for art and career in the arts.  As a guest artist with Art Road, together we create Signature Art Prijects with the students and additional volunteers at a sophisticated level.  We challenge the students and the students rise to the challenge.  My artistic work and being a board member with Art Road are extremely rewarding knowing we are providing art classes at a high level.

Over the years both my daughter and myself have found the entire school staff to be very accommodating and available.  The staff realizes teenagers don't always inform parents of upcoming events and thus a school wide weekly newsletter is emailed as well as teachers informing parents of upcoming major assignments/tests.  Do not let the cost factor scare you away as the school provides many scholarships for anyone interested can attend.

Jesus our Lord and Savior must come first and what better way than to receive the Holy Eucharist.  God Bless and have a nice day..... 
St Mary Catholic Central High School	222211		/users/profile/285906	Nicole104	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	St. Mary Catholic Central is a wonderful school. They provide an educational experience beyond just the normal everyday classroom. SMCC offers a well rounded high school experience offering a three tiered educational opportunity, a successful athletic program, fine arts, and many other social clubs and organizations. All this encompassed in a safe, Christ-centered, private school atmosphere. Offering opportunities to every student no matter what their personal interests may be. I see a higher level of tolerance and appreciation for diversity from the students at SMCC. These young men and women have a greater sense of acceptance of others because of the administrators, teachers and staff members of St. Mary Catholic Central. I do not look at the tuition as paying for an education. I look at the tuition as an investment in a young person's future and at SMCC you are investing in the brightest futures of all because of the investment in the development of the whole student, mind body and soul.

Students are expected to look, speak and act in respectful and professional manners and yet the atmosphere is one of family and fun.  The grading scale is tough.  The handbook is thorough.  This is not a school to skate through.  But the rewards are so gratifying to see, in the young women and men who graduate.
St Mary Catholic Central High School	182233		/users/profile/239001	stjoeacademy	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	SMCC is a Catholic High School with a rigorous academic program, VERY strong college preparation (starting in ninth grade!) and an authentic Catholic identity.  Class sizes are small, teachers are excellent, and curriculum is cutting edge.  i-Pads are used in all classes. Students consistently score above the local public school students on standardized tests.  Besides strong academics, SMCC has an extensive and competitive athletic program, as well as many extra-curricular clubs.  Service opportunities  are an integral part of the well-rounded experience of students, including on-going service projects, domestic mission trips during school breaks, and an international mission trip annually. Each class also has an annual spiritual retreat.  Parents are an integral part of the school- I have never seen better parent-school communication!  Parent volunteers supplement and support staff both in school and during extra-curricular activities.  Parent-led fundraising allows for an extensive scholarship program, so that economic status need not prevent any student from attending.

Mercy Education Project	168677		/users/profile/223617	MimiX3	Volunteer	4	09/09/2013	Respect. Challenge. Support. Team work. Four action words that keep me volunteering at Mercy Education Project.  These words interplay among the staff and the women students we teach and tutor.For some of our students, they are experiencing these concepts for the first time.  As they follow their studies at MEP, the women not only learn to respect themselves but others.  They not only challenge themselves but challenge and support each other.  Teachers, volunteers, and students work together.  Diversity naturally happens at MEP.  Appreciating everyone's unique gifts is a learning experience. My favorite moments at MEP have been the mornings our students receive the news that  classmates have succeeded on a GED test.  There is cheering, tears, and congratulations from all.  That is teamwork and the MEP family enjoying success.
Mercy Education Project	168578		/users/profile/223508	dpoterek	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I volunteered the last two years at MEP.  I have seen the amazing difference this organization makes on the student's life (both academically and personally).   MEP provides a clean, safe and comfortable environment for students to learn.  The curriculum is tailored to each individual based on entrance tests.  The student is challenged just enough to continue to learn at a slow and steady pace.  This method builds a students self-esteem.  There are computers for the students to use as well as many books and learning games.   The students eat together which gives them a sense of family with their fellow students.  They get some play time to blow off steam before their tutor session.  They are bused to and from their tutor session.  MEP does everything possible to position the student for success.  The staff is great and genuinely care about each student.  It's easy to tell they put their heart and soul into what they do each and every day.   Students that need tutoring are lucky to be enrolled at MEP.

It is an outstanding charity that makes a very real difference for the women and girls they help.  What is so important and impressive about this organization is the energy they spend on each individual student; they make sure that her needs are being met as she goes through the program and does not get left behind.  I volunteer with the Women's Program whenever I can because I feel like I help them make a difference in people's lives each and every day.  The women in the program are amazing.  They work so hard for the goals they have set for themselves; they are truly inspiring. And the sense of community and camaraderie throughout Mercy Ed is contagious!

One mother told me she was at Mercy Education Project, or MEP, because she was too embarrassed to talk with her child's teacher. Because I was able to work with just 4 students at a time, I could give them a lot of individual attention.  That's what these women needed to gain--not only the vocabulary--but the self-esteem they gained as their vocabulary grew.

Enjoying participation in walks. parades and safe school routes.  We have become a close knit group  that we can count on for many things.  I call us a family.  We do many things together we eat well and enjoy each others company. Mr. Colbert is a blessing to all who get involved with him, always giving and sharing whenever needed.  He's always doing something for the children in and around the community.  He's very involved in many things.  We have enjoyed Steve Harvey's mentoring program, Stevie Wonder's music, and lots of baseball. When you're involved with a group like Detroit Impact it teaches you to be selfless.  You begin to practice what you have learned from the center in your own neighborhoods.  It's a continuation of growth and development personally as well as professionally for all person's  involved.  We passed out book bags for students, summer programs for children with lots of trips to museums and science centers and many more places. There is always something to do, First aid training just to name some of the things that goes on in this community center.  You become a life long volunteer working in your own neighborhoods staying involved and connected.  Making it a better place for children and adults.  I give Detroit Impact a five star I have learned many things being involve with the center, and will continue to stay involve for years to come.  W. Redding

Detroit Impact Inc	308830		/users/profile/400208	Jbryant718	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I have been apart of the the Detroit Impact "Family" for the last twenty years. My origins are in the After-School and Saturday Kids' Club program(s) facilitated here. The time I spent being mentored, guided, and educated about the "right paths in life" have instilled the value of Community Service and "giving back" in my personality. Without an organization like this one, Many more of my peers, as well as myself, would have surely fell victim to the pitfalls and self-destruction associated with growing up below the poverty level.  The relationships I've forged here have stood the test of time, distance, worth, etc. I've gained some really insightful mentors thru out the years, and am thankful for a pillar of the community to exist like this one.

We not only try to provide an creative and safe outlet for the children but we also try to sneak and teach them some viable life skills along the way. I say sneak because by the time they figured out they learned something, it's too late!!  Our mission is to change the world, one child at a time.

Wildlife Recovery Association	245582	2	/users/profile/332763	Russ_1,	Client Served	5	06/18/2015	In my experience the Wildlife Recovery Association has a long and distinguished track record of extremely responsible and knowledgeable raptor education. They have presented at our Audubon club several times in the past 25 or so years, presenting to over a hundred people each time. No one has ever expressed anything but praise for the organization and its program. Having seen many raptor presentations over the years, only one other organization Te raptor programs of The World Bird Sanctuary located in St. Louis, MO, is in the class of Joe Rodgers and the Wildlife Recovery Association. It is obvious that both organizations display great regard for their birds and are extremely knowledgeable about raptors and their care.I want to add that the perspective of videos can easily be slanted to make things look different than the reality of an in person experience. If someone with a camera has an "agenda" to show what they want the viewer to see and not what is actually taking place, a wrong impression can be created. So, it seems to me that those relying on videos may be unknowingly deceived.
Wildlife Recovery Association	311121	1	/users/profile/402460	jc2014	Volunteer	5	10/16/2016	I worked with this group for years--they love their birds and take great care of them. The birds are healthy and go through a lot of preparation before becoming educational birds. There is a divide between the WRA's methods and those of falconers, and this has led to an online attack of falconers on this group, most of whom have never actually seen the programs themselves. Please don't let a few angry people on the internet with a grudge persuade you away from this incredible group. 
Wildlife Recovery Association	247636	1	/users/profile/335225	dogedays	General Member of the Public	1	07/06/2015	Anyone that is familiar with falconry, rehabilitation, conservation education with birds of prey knows that almost every other raptor-related individual and organization keeps their birds on falconry equipment! Falconry equipment (anklets, jesses, swivel, leash, etc.) allows the bird to stand, rouse, slice (defecate) and be comfortable-- all of which is not allowed by the upper leg hold (which, should only be used in temporary cases, such as medical examinations). This "upper leg hold" method SHOULD NOT be utilized long-term for resident program birds! This terrible method induces stress, which can clearly be seen in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa77maiU3y0 - raised hackles, stress chittering, gaping mouth/panting, learned helplessness, spread/flapping wings, etc. 
Wildlife Recovery Association	247494	3	/users/profile/335039	RtKes2010	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/05/2015	After seeing the letter this group posted to Facebook recently I was shocked and appalled that they still feel they are handling bird "correctly" especially compared to the traditional methods that have been used in falconry, education, and rehab for centuries. I work with birds of prey professionally and with proper handling, all of my birds are happy and content to sit on my glove for extended periods of time without being forced to. The birds I have seen in this company's pictures and videos all show signs that I am trained to associate with birds that are highly stressed and uncomfortable. I feel that for this company to retain their licenses they need to observe and work with properly handled birds and work with those handlers to retrain their own birds to be handled properly to increase the well being and comfort of those birds.
Wildlife Recovery Association	247480	5	/users/profile/335021	redtailflyhigh	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/04/2015	This organization has recently put out a letter asking for positive reviews and defending what they call their "safe hold" method. This safe hold method is used in research and for banding when a bird is meant to be in hand for a short amount of time and then released. The videos that have been around of these birds being swung around in front of groups to get them to flap their wings and appear "wild" is just apalling. As a licensed falconer and a professional for 15 years in the zoological field and who also works in raptor rehabilitation, I am very disappointed in this organization. I am even more saddened that after USFWS stepped in and asked them to start handling their birds differently with the use of jesses, they are still trying to defend their methods! Also, in this carefully worded letter they have stated while wearing the jesses and anklets the birds are falling off the glove and hanging from the gloves where they can injure their legs. Now, the job of the educator/trainer is to guide and teach that bird on how to stand on the glove. Their birds had never had this training obviously and a bird that has been trained using positive reinforcement can find a gloved hand a very positive and comfortable place to be. Which is why at ANY other zoological facility or other bird of prey rehab centers train their raptors to stand comfortably on a glove. You will see these birds stretch their wings and legs on the glove, rouse (when they shake and fluff up their feathers) and even preen their feathers (grooming). These are all comfort behaviors in birds. Behaviors they only show when they feel safe and content with their environment. If after all this time their birds are STILL bating off of the glove and not standing comfortably, they are not understanding the basics of positive reinforcement training and need to seek help from other professionals. Many of us in this field are constantly working on our professional development and seeking knowledge from others in our field. This group does not want to seek advice and knowledge from other professionals in their line of work and also state other professionals as being their competitors. Now, I guess I have always felt we all need to work together because we all are in this for the same reasons. We arent making lots of money here, we are doing this for the welfare of these birds. We should not see ourselves as competitors. This organization also states it doesn't like having the birds on a glove because it gives the general public the idea it is acceptable to have these birds as pets. This is ridiculous and as good educators they should be able to teach the general public the difference. These people are very entertaining and charismatic and it is easy for many to believe what they are doing is acceptable. Please do your research before supporting this organization. If they can't be willing to seek help with the training of their raptors and are attempting to go back to their previous methods all their licenses need to be revoked.
Wildlife Recovery Association	247475	8	/users/profile/335017	Marlone	General Member of the Public	1	07/04/2015	WRA has recently put out a carefully-worded flyer requesting positive reviews and support. They claim to have received "overwhelming" support -- which was obviously not overwhelming enough to keep USFWS from ordering them to change their methods or else lose their license.  WRA continues to defend their method of holding raptors by the legs during presentations, calling it the "safe" hold and implying the standard "falconry" method of jesses and leashes (which they have been forced to adopt) means the birds are "continuously hanging upside down by their toes."  The so-called "safe" hold is intended for very short periods, just  enough to band a bird and gather samples before releasing it. When used in much longer presentations it causes undue stress -- panting, collapsing birds. Photos and videos of WRA in action has shown them swinging birds around dramatically to force them to flap their wings and look "wild," which they think is a real crowd-pleaser. Their birds look exhausted: open mouths, closed eyes, drooping wings. WRA boasts about the long time they have had some of their birds; I see it as having put their birds through this kind of torture for years, even *decades.* This is what they were ordered to stop doing, and yet they continue to defend it. Educational programs using the falconry method results in birds standing calmly on the glove, wings folded, looking strong as they would be in the wild. At first, completely wild birds do jump off the glove and may hang briefly, but the job of the educator is to place the bird back on the glove immediately to prevent stress to the legs, and reward it for not jumping. It doesn't take long for the bird to learn to stay standing -- training  typically takes a few hours a day for a few days at most.  In the flyer WRA says they are preventing bids from jumping off the glove using their "own method of training. " Honestly, I shudder to think what this is, and do not understand why they find it so difficult to use the falconry methods used by nearly every other educational program throughout the country and the world.
Wildlife Recovery Association	247472	6	/users/profile/335008	FalcoSparverius	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/04/2015	I wish it were possible to leave no stars because this facility doesn't deserve any. Their public display of the cruelty they inflict on these raptors, while purporting to admire and respect them, is reprehensible. The uneducated public has no way to know that the methods WRA prefers to use are detrimental to the birds' health, and they blindly defend this facility's practices because the people are charismatic and friendly. Go to any other zoo or respectable rehab center's educational show and you will see birds standing calmly on handlers' gloves with their wings comfortably folded. Their feathers are clean and tidy, the ends of their tail feathers perfectly shaped--not bent or broken. They are free to scratch an itch if they want to, free to look wherever they choose, able to defecate if they have to. They stand on the glove at ease, just as they would stand on a branch or stone in the wild. Anklets and jesses are no different to a trained raptor than a collar and leash is to a dog, or a halter and lead rope to a horse. This method has been in use worldwide, virtually unchanged for literally thousands of years, because it WORKS.  Go to WRA, and see something else, something despicable. See birds with broken and mussed feathers--birds stressed beyond the capacity to cope, being carried about by their thighs, unable to move, unable to close their wings, their mouths gaping wide in fear and stress. Some are stressed to the point that they close their eyes to the world. Videos WRA has posted for public view show a bird (an owl, if I recall correctly) being handled bodily like a doll; one handler holding a kestrel by the legs flings it gleefully through the air like a child with a paper airplane, causing unimaginable mental stress to the bird as well as physical stress on its tiny bones and joints. How can anyone watch this happen and not be disgusted? If you were that kestrel in front of a crowd of squealing children, would you want to be treated that way? As a licensed falconer who has volunteered countless hours for rehab facilities and a major zoo, I am appalled to see people being so willfully stubborn and callous even after having been educated in the proper handling methods. They should be ashamed of themselves and their permits should be revoked. The birds would be better off anywhere else, and the public would be better off seeing birds of prey handled respectfully by people who genuinely care.

Please do your research into proper raptor handling techniques and stress indicators before you give this place a review. These animals should be treated with the respect they deserve.
Wildlife Recovery Association	247457	11	/users/profile/334996	ButeoJamaicensis	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/04/2015	If their 'upper leg hold' technique is so 'safe', then why does ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ELSE - you can check every major zoological organization in the world's raptor programs for examples of this - use it? Might it be because it is a completely unethical handling technique, to be used only when no other restraints are available, and only for short periods of time? These people actually believe that something called 'learned helplessness' is a viable training method (ie, when they carry raptors around by their legs and they 'lay down on the glove'). The animal has learned that over time, it cannot escape, so it lies down in stressful defeat. They never show signs of comfort or low stress, like rousing (shaking off all of the feathers at once), preening (grooming and rearranging the feathers), or even pooping (raptors cannot defecate when held by the legs, they have to stand up and lift their tails to do so). Please do your research on basic raptor and animal training techniques before supporting this terrible, inhumane organization. 
Wildlife Recovery Association	247449	9	/users/profile/334986	eichenluft	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/04/2015	I wish there was a way to leave zero stars as a rating for this organization.  As a licensed falconer I am horrified at the handling of the birds by this organization.  Every video I have watched and photo I have seen showing them handling their raptors clearly shows use of rough, callus and outdated methods of raptor handling, "tossing" birds through the air to demonstrate flight, swinging them around by their legs - the birds are CLEARLY shocked, stressed, uncomfortable, upset, overheated, and unhappy.  They are also in terrible feather and condition.   Eyes closed, beak gaping, wings sagging are not signs of a healthy unstressed bird!!   Why not demonstrate a calm, relaxed, happy bird and if flight demonstrations are needed - train them to fly to the glove?   The "upper leg hold" method should only be used for very short durations of restraint, such as for banding, vet care or measuring wild birds before release.  I hope the authorities in charge keeps a close eye on these people so they don't return to their abusive handling of their educational birds.  If they are continuing to use these methods their license should be revoked and never renewed.
Wildlife Recovery Association	247421	10	/users/profile/334954	Peregrinus	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/03/2015	As someone who is a licensed falconer, has completed an internship at the World Bird Sanctuary in MO, has acquired a degree in a wildlife-related field, and has participated in various other related activities, such as raptor-related research, wildlife education volunteering and the like, it astounds me that the method of handling utilized and the lack of concern for the stress of the birds by WRA occurred for so long. For the birds' sake, I hope the newly implemented usage of leather falconry equipment (anklets, jesses, etc.) will provide the staff with better tools to address this issue, and that the educational birds will be able to be handled in a much safer, and less stressful manner.   Almost all facilities that utilize captive educational raptors in their programs maintain them on leather falconry equipment-- although the upper leg hold is a recognized safe way to temporarily hold birds of prey, (such as in the manner of trapping/banding for research or conducting a medical examination) this upper leg hold is NOT meant to be a long-term go-to, and certainly isn't as safe or comfortable for the birds as leather falconry equipment is.  From my experience, a bird would much prefer standing on its own feet as opposed to being held for long durations at the upper legs, and the videos that surfaced of WRA's programs unfortunately showcased the stress caused by the hold itself and the maneuvers the birds were put into ("zooming through the air" American Kestrel, etc.).  These stress indicators include stress-chittering, flapping/wriggling, gaping mouth/panting, and the like. Leather straps do not indicate these birds are "pets," and all of the facilities I am familiar with have never had a problem when it came to explaining why these resident birds were being kept on leather falconry equipment; all it takes is a simple explanation to clear up any misunderstandings. How anyone can condone this form of long-term upper-leg hold handling that produces such stress on these program birds, when there's a safer, better alternative called falconry equipment, is beyond my comprehension. 
Wildlife Recovery Association	245582	2	/users/profile/332763	Russ_1,	Client Served	5	06/18/2015	In my experience the Wildlife Recovery Association has a long and distinguished track record of extremely responsible and knowledgeable raptor education. They have presented at our Audubon club several times in the past 25 or so years, presenting to over a hundred people each time. No one has ever expressed anything but praise for the organization and its program. Having seen many raptor presentations over the years, only one other organization Te raptor programs of The World Bird Sanctuary located in St. Louis, MO, is in the class of Joe Rodgers and the Wildlife Recovery Association. It is obvious that both organizations display great regard for their birds and are extremely knowledgeable about raptors and their care.I want to add that the perspective of videos can easily be slanted to make things look different than the reality of an in person experience. If someone with a camera has an "agenda" to show what they want the viewer to see and not what is actually taking place, a wrong impression can be created. So, it seems to me that those relying on videos may be unknowingly deceived.
Wildlife Recovery Association	245005	1	/users/profile/332084	Diane_B	Donor	5	06/10/2015	I have enjoyed presentations by the Wildlife Recovery Association many times.  I can't imagine what the people who wrote these negative reviews could have ever seen that would be considered disrespectful or harmful to the birds.  Joe Rogers and the rest of the team at WRA are completely respectful and kind to animals.  They have rehabilitated and released as many of the birds they have helped as possible.   Joe and the other presenters make the programs educational and entertaining for people of all ages.  I have been a member of the organization for many years just because I think it is a great group.  I do not know any of the volunteers or board members personally.
Wildlife Recovery Association	244975	2	/users/profile/332048	Zitz	General Member of the Public	5	06/10/2015	For many years, my husband and I have attended Joes demonstrations whenever he has been within 80 miles of us, and invited others to attend with us.  I am constantly amazed at the feeling of respect he shows his birds, the awe he passes on to his audience in his words and actions, as he teaches us that same respect in his unique manner.  I am 83 years old and have been a nature lover all of my life, and I have never had a more interesting teacher than Joe Rogers.  (And I certainly never had an opportunity to get up close and personal with so many raptors!)   I have seen the reaction of children and seniors, whether a new experience or a renewal of the love of our natural resources, when viewing this program, and I sincerely  hope more folks can have the privilege of learning these lessons for years to come.   Reading other reviews claiming inhumane treatment:  they must be talking about a different organization.  These demonstrations use birds which cannot fly or be returned to their natural lives, and they are properly handled in order to give the audience a love for them in as natural a way as possible. 
Wildlife Recovery Association	244829	2	/users/profile/331847	ibis	Donor	5	06/08/2015	The Wildlife Recovery Association is an outstanding organization.  Over the past several years I have attended several programs presented by them at nature centers and Audubon meetings and enjoyed them immensely.  The presentations are fun, but much more than that.  They're also educational, providing lots of information about their birds.   And, most importantly, the birds are invariably handled very humanely.  I've never noticed any improper handling on the part of the WRA people toward their animals.   And every program I've attended was received with much delight by everyone, including, especially, the many children who were present.  I look forward to many more enjoyable presentations by the WRA.
Wildlife Recovery Association	233941	3	/users/profile/297979	bo3bg	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2014	I have seen WRA's presentations for over 20 years, visited their location many times while my son did his Eagle Scout project there. These reviewers obviously have never seen an actual presentation, know nothing of WRA's love, sacrifices or efforts over all these years for the birds within their care.They will never admit to the sacrifices their family has made to do the wonderful work they do, but I know, from many years of seeing their work results that they LOVE these animals, put the welfare of the birds WELL before their own personal comforts and sacrificed more than any of these people know from simply watching a video.If you want to see how these birds are loved and respected, VISIT them, ATTEND their events and just talk to them about these wonderful creatures they have rescued and when possible, rehabilitated.No one there has ever mistreated an animal.  They know and understand them.  I can tell you these birds are family to the WRA.I would much rather have someone hold my leg than put leg irons on me.Before you condemn them, ask why they do what they do and research the many years of excellent work they have accomplished.I attended the release of an eagle a few years ago and Joe, as he carried the female to the release point, spoke softly and reassuringly to her.  She was as calm as could be.  When he was ready to release her, she didn't "escape" from him as if she'd been a prisoner.  In fact, she hesitated even leaving.  It took a few minutes but she did, then, fly to a nearby tree, got her bearings and flew away.  Joe, Barb and the staff had tears in their eyes, happy to have been able to return her to the wild.Walk in their shoes, visit and volunteer and THEN, let's see what you think of this organization.I am proud to see the fruits of their efforts and KNOW they are the best of people.
Wildlife Recovery Association	205544	13	/users/profile/267731	ianrupp	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/09/2014	The birds are put into positions where they have no control over anything and are not able to comfortably sit on the glove.  Every video I watch the birds have their wings spread out and mouths open panting- they look absolutely terrified.  I'm around raptors and handlers a lot and I know how they should be properly handled.  Very saddening that the birds are probably beyond repair and will never learn to step up on a glove without being forced (at least with these people anyways).  How these people still have a permit, I don't know.  Just horrible
Wildlife Recovery Association	197426	15	/users/profile/258090	Anne89	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/10/2014	I have watched several videos and seen numerous pictures of their educational programs and I am absolutely appalled by how these people treat their educational birds. They grab them by the legs, essentially disabling them, and then toss and jerk them around the room to make them flap their wings and show off their feathers. These are living, breathing, wild animals and they are being treated like toy airplanes. Every single image I have seen of the birds shows stressed and fearful body language; open-mouth breathing, hackles raised up, quick and jerky head movements as they are moved around people they do not know. These birds are terrified! Training a bird to jess and sit on the glove via their own free will takes time. Acclimating that bird to be comfortable in front of an audience takes even longer. But if these people are not willing to take the time and effort it takes to give these birds the quality of life they deserve than they have no business working with them.
Wildlife Recovery Association	197423	14	/users/profile/258087	Jessica150	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/10/2014	After seeing educational programs provided by this organization, I am appalled at the treatment of the birds. They are handled with disregard for their own safety and comfort. They are treated as a prop rather than a living creature. As a raptor rehabilitation and educator, I know what constitutes quality care and WAS does not do this. The birds are clearly stressed out, unhappy, and frightened. They are manhandled by the educators, shoved into the faces of people, and hurled about by their legs in an unsafe manner. The disrespect and obvious lack of understanding of safe handling techniques makes me sad for those birds and for the people who now believe this is how they should be treated. This program needs to be shut down.

Michigan Humane Society	147079	2	/users/profile/194238	kkup	General Member of the Public	1	12/20/2012	As a former volunteer I know for a fact they kill many health animals, or ones that might need more than the usual cost of just antibiotics...they use the city of Detroit as the reason for their high kill rate which has remained pretty much the same for years, I have tracked it on the Dept of Ag reports.  As soon as you turn in your owned animal, they can kill it in a second if they need room.  Strays have to be held 4 days, so if it's too crowded, the owned animals go first.  They will always advertise a rescued animal at some point for the publicity, and if it's already gone public, that animal will likely be treated for whatever it needs to gain sympathy and donations.  They DO do a lot of GOOD, but they are very convincing and manipulative with the public and what they very carefully say to the public,  In 2013 you will need an appointment to turn in your owned animal.    they already charge for it.  Not sure what happens if you bring in a stray.  the CEO gets about $20,000 raises each year in spite of the economy.  check that info at Dept of Ag.    They do NOT take in 100,000 animals a year as someone stated, it's more like 25 - 27,000 depending on the year  I'm saying they have a lot of impact but not necessarily in a good way.
Michigan Humane Society	146519	2	/users/profile/193421	Cissy	Volunteer	1	12/12/2012	MHS kills 7 out of 10 animals that enter their facility, year after year.  Go view their reports on the Michigan Department of Agriculture website.  The entire organization needs a sweep!  They refused a COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT of their shelter, WHY?  Now, you must make an appointment to surrender an animal...people will drop the poor animal on the side of the road, or worse!    This is not the answer to improve their save rate!   No transparency here!  Four board members resigned in 2011 due to the HORRIFIC kill rate, excuse after excuse and their refusal to undergo a COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT.  LEADERSHIP MUST CHANGE TO SAVE THE ANIMALS! DEMAND a LEADERSHIP CHANGE!
Michigan Humane Society	124253	3	/users/profile/169084	Kenny25	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/02/2012	How terrible that so little improvement has been made!  One year after losing four board members over its euthanasia rate, the Michigan Humane Society has hired people to evaluate shelter practices and has become more transparent, but its critics said little has changed with regard to saving animals' lives.A clarifying statement to donors identifies MHS as a stand-alone charity, rather than a statewide umbrella organization that funds other humane societies. But not all information is available.The Free Press requested copies of the full reports from the Cornell team and another consultant, as the summaries lack full findings. Last year, the Free Press requested multiple times to view animal records, to better understand euthanasia decisions. All requests were denied.But that statistic belies other numbers: From 2007-11, MHS reported to the state a euthanasia rate between 67% and 70% for dogs and cats, deeming those animals unhealthy and often taken for a fee. Another criticism of the organization is of fund-raising stories of sick and severely injured animals nursed back to health by MHS. The ads are misleading, the critics said, because donors believe such lifesaving measures are standard, even as the euthanasia numbers do not support that message. There's been no improvement." Such criticisms were the basis of three charity fraud complaints filed in the last year against MHS with the Michigan attorney general, including one that referenced a similar case in Pennsylvania.Yet, MHS has designed its treatment protocol to transfer to other shelters and animal welfare groups those animals that it decides not to treat.Former board member Cheryl Phillips said MHS has the largest veterinary budget of any Michigan shelter, so to transfer animals rather than treat them is shifting the burden to those with fewer resources. The Michigan Pet Fund Alliance said in a statement that the humane society's decision to disregard the intake recommendation is tantamount to animal cruelty. "Why would MHS cling to this failed model?" the group asked in a statement. "If individuals or rescue groups were taking in more animals than they could care for, so much so that more than two-thirds of them ended up dead every year, wouldn't we call that animal cruelty?"
Michigan Humane Society	116296	2	/users/profile/158327	MartyMan	General Member of the Public	1	06/23/2012	Yes, MHS does bash others. In fact, it looks like MHS leadership is willing to pay to bash others.  The full post is at:  http://www.nathanwinograd.com/?p=6990     It was just a matter of time before someone got desperate enough and lacked the ethics to do it. And it looks like it is the Michigan Humane Society. Today, I was informed that the leadership of MHS attempted to hire a public relations firm in Michigan to engage in a full blown smear campaign against me. The Michigan Humane Society indicated that it was willing to pay for private investigators. At least one firm declined, stating that doing so was unethical. It may also be illegal, amounting to a misuse of donor funds and conspiracy to commit fraud. Ive already hired an attorney, who is working on both a cease and desist letter to the Michigan Humane Society Board, as well as asking the Attorney General of Michigan to open up an investigation.       Donors are giving [them] money to save lives. Not to kill them. And certainly not to hire private investigators and public relations firms in order to engage in a smear campaign.    This is a shame.   What a terrible use of donor funds. 
Michigan Humane Society	115586	3	/users/profile/157401	brendastarr	General Member of the Public	1	06/17/2012	I do not understand why MHS has such a high rating when they kill 7 out of every 10 animals they take in - 9.6 pets EVERY HOUR as they themselves have reported to the Michigan Dept. of Agriculture. They are one of the 8 worst animal shelter in the state of Michigan. Please direct your donations to animal welfare groups who will use it to actually save adoptable and treatable dogs and cats, puppies and kittens.  A question below asks if they are life-changing. They sure are for all the animal thery kill every day.
Michigan Humane Society	115087	1	/users/profile/156787	Daniel Moni	Volunteer	1	06/13/2012	Don't think people don't see the good things that go on at MHS either.  Even those of us who question leadership and think the organization is headed in the wrong direction see the good.  There is a lot of good going on there as well.  We all know that.   Once again, this is an issue of leadership and direction of the organization, and transparency.There are a number of us who have tried to bring our issues to those at MHS who do have the authority to address  our concerns.  Each time we came forward with our issues, management has always been "unavailable" and board members generally don't respond. With no alternative left,  a growing number of us are now speaking out about our concerns.  Asking legitimate questions and posting truthful information that gives insight into how MHS operates is not what I consider to be bashing or a personal vendetta.  Ultimately,   MHS is the people's charity.  The public has a right to know what goes on, how resources are used, and what oversight is in place.  The public deserves to hear the truth.  Period.Speaking of the truth, the 2011 Individual Michigan Shelter Statistics are in from the Michigan Department of Agriculture:Dogs and cats25668 Received17265 euthanized = 67.26% euth rate dogs and cats8403 = 32.74% save rate dogs and cats.Yet, on the MHS Website, it's stated that,"MHS worked diligently to achieve its goal of 100% adoption for adoptable animals, which was reached two years ago and the organization is now working to attain that same goal for animals deemed to be as treatable."So if MHS has achieved it's goal of a 100% adoption rate for adoptable animals, that means that MHS deemed all 17265 dogs and cats as not adoptable.  It is incomprehensible that that number of animals are beyond redemption.  "Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth."
Michigan Humane Society	114562	5	/users/profile/156103	heatherpauli	Volunteer	5	06/11/2012	MHS does so much with so little, in large part due to their great volunteers, and they are able to help over 100,000 animals a year without turning anyone away because of cost or space. If people wanted to really help animals, they would simply take their arguments up with the individuals whom which they have issues and stop pasting duplicates of their personal vendettas on review boards meant for constructive feedback of an organization. MHS doesn't bash others, continuing to work with groups that dump their unwanted cases on MHS so they can keep up the appearance of being "no-kill," the philosophical tenets of which one finds that MHS closely follows if they know the definition of the term.

Wills resigned from MHS when the board began inquiring into the disappearance of $1.6 million. A bookkeeper, Denise Hopkins, was eventually convicted of embezzling $56,000 of the missing sum. Wills next founded the National Society for Animal Protection, only to dissolve it when he joined HSUS.  Recovery from Misuse of Funds Takes Years  At MHS, Been there, Done That. South of Santa Cruz, on the far side of Monterey Bay, SPCA of Monterey County executive director Gary Tiscornia could testify from direct experience about the difficulties that the Santa Cruz SPCA, Sevierville Huame Society, LA/SPCA, et al can expect to meet ahead. Tiscornia headed the Michigan Humane Society for a decade after predecessor David Wills departed, leaving an unexplained deficit of $1.6 million. Bookkeeper Denise Hopkins was successfully prosecuted for allegedly embezzling a small portion of it. Wills was successfully sued in 1994 for taking money under false pretenses at his next stop, the defunct National Society for Animal Protection, and was in 1997 convicted of embezzling from the Humane Society of the U.S., where he was vice president for investigations, 1991-1994. Wills was never brought to account for any of the missing Michigan Humane money, however, and although Tiscornia was credited with impressively rebuilding the organization, the losses had a ripple effect evident even 10 years afterward, when Michigan Humane cut back a discount pet sterilization program because tight funding inhibited hiring enough veterinarians to keep it operating at all three of the MHS shelters. 
Michigan Humane Society	114266	4	/users/profile/155494	Keith L.	Client Served	5	06/07/2012	I was working all day and came home that night to find my cat was having trouble breathing. I called the Westland clinic and told them of my findings, they were concerned and made a great effort to get her in right away at the last minute so she could be treated and start medications to start her on the road to recovery. The staff was very compassionate and the veterinarian even stayed past closing time to make sure I understood what was wrong with my cat, what the medicine was treating and what symptoms on which I should keep a close watch. These folks work so hard to care for the animals and provide great service to folks who have nowhere else to turn. People who complain about some of the Michigan Humane Society policies should try and get similar quality services from another organization in Michigan; I think they will find that no other nonprofit meets their high standards, if they can even get another group to help them!
Michigan Humane Society	113760	2	/users/profile/154782	Maya D	Volunteer	1	06/04/2012	I'm not sure that I know what "Open Admission" means anymore. This article represents a turning point when employees and volunteers began to notice a shift in focus from helping animals to numbers and money.  Critics: Humane Society goes astray Fees, limits on dropoffs lead some to question if organization is losing its focus John Wisely / The Detroit News Wednesday April 12, 2006 Has the Michigan Humane Society lost touch with its original animal welfare mission? ROCHESTER HILLS -- The Michigan Humane Society promotes its mission with pictures of cats and dogs and the slogan "Someone here needs you." But many critics, including some former staffers and volunteers, say the state's largest animal welfare group is retreating from a mission it has pursued for more than 100 years: caring for stray animals. "I would ask them what the mission statement is now," said Linda Gardiner of Shelby Township, who worked for four years as an administrative assistant at the Humane Society's Rochester Hills shelter before leaving last year. The group's leader said the Michigan Humane Society remains committed to homeless animals, but in response to Detroit News questions, he acknowledges it has sent mixed messages and even instituted a fee to people who repeatedly drop off strays. He also reiterated to his staff that they must accept any animal in need. But questions over the fate of strays loom large in the animal welfare community. More than 240,000 stray animals land in Michigan shelters each year and about 55 percent are euthanized. Some animal advocates say care of strays is best left to government-run shelters. Others say the independent, privately funded humane societies have historically offered strays a second chance and now may be drifting from that work. Group gives mixed messages The Michigan Humane Society, the state's largest, operates three shelters in Wayne and Oakland counties on a $12 million annual budget. Officials there insist they still take strays and if any were turned away, it was a staff mistake. But executive director Cal Morgan acknowledged his group has contributed to the confusion. "That message has been mixed in terms of how we handle people that come up to the counter," Morgan said. Sue McNeary said the kitten that wandered over to her Pontiac home last fall had matted fur, a famished frame and a case of fleas. But she said the staff at the Humane Society's Rochester Hills shelter turned it away. "They said it was too sick," said McNeary, who eventually gave the cat to a rescue group. "They suggested I take it to Oakland County." Morgan clarified the policy for staffers and volunteers in an April 6 memo. "It is the policy of the Michigan Humane Society to accept any and all animals in need during regular business hours," Morgan wrote. Morgan said the Michigan Humane Society hasn't even discussed closing its doors to strays. However, since mid-September, it has been urging people to take stray animals to local animal control facilities, to increase the odds of reuniting them with their owners by limiting the places pet owners must search, Morgan said. Larry Olbrecht, manager of county animal control, said since October, monthly animal intakes to his facility are up 15 percent over the same months a year earlier. A former Humane Society adoption counselor said the Humane Society previously asked people to take animals to the animal control office only when they had bitten someone. "They may be saying it's not a change, but that's a change," said Brian Stouffer, 45, of Troy, who volunteered for eight years before quitting in August. He and others worry that forcing animal Samaritans to navigate multiple animal control jurisdictions may make them give up on homeless critters. "If someone brings in a stray and we tell them put it back in your car and take it over here, that's a real pain," he said. Under Michigan law, shelter operators who accept strays must keep them at least four business days to allow owners a chance to reclaim them. In addition to its shelters, the Michigan Humane Society operates clinics, conducts education seminars and cruelty investigations and lobbies for animal rights. Except those under contract, humane societies are not legally obligated to accept strays. Most do, but some have stopped. The Capital Area Humane Society, which serves Ingham, Clinton and Eaton counties, quit taking them four years ago, said chief executive officer Stephen Heaven. "They are doing the right thing" by referring people to animal control, Heaven said. People who lose pets need a simple way to find them, he said. Stray fee alienates some The stray fee adopted last fall irked animal advocates. An internal memo obtained by The News dated Sept. 15, 2005, applies to private individuals who surrender more than three strays in 12 months. "After an individual has surrendered three animals to MHS, a sliding scale fee in $10 increments will be assessed for subsequent animals surrendered to the MHS," said the memo from Steve Horn, chief administrative officer. Critics argue the fee discourages people from helping strays. "I don't think the solution is to charge people $10 per cat," said Chad Gilchrist, 34, of Hazel Park, a former shelter staff supervisor for MHS who quit last year. Other Humane Society officials said fees could discourage people from dropping off animals. "We know that people will dump it on the side of the road," said Tanya Hilgendorf, executive director of the Humane Society of Huron Valley in Washtenaw County, which levies no fee. "Our whole job is about giving these animals a second chance." Morgan himself seemed confused about the fee policy. "I'm not aware of anything that says there's a fee," Morgan said in an interview last week. But when asked about the September memo, Morgan said the policy was aimed at people who were known to drop dozens of animals at a time, even though another section of the memo addresses "placement groups." He said he doesn't believe the fee has ever been levied. "We're always going to be committed to animal welfare on every level, strays, owner surrenders, etc," Morgan said. Some animal welfare advocates disagree. "I don't think they should be charging people to drop off strays," said Sherry Wozniak, 34, of Livonia, who said she donates about $100 to MHS in a typical year. She said the Humane Society is synonymous with investigating animal cruelty and caring for strays and it risks misleading people if it doesn't accept stray animals. "With the impression they are giving, if they are changing that policy, they should let people know," she said. Others are more skeptical. "They have lost touch with the animals," said former staffer Linda Gardiner. "They have lost sight of what it's supposed to be." 
Michigan Humane Society	113543	4	/users/profile/154498	Pam_8	Volunteer	5	06/01/2012	I have been a volunteer with, and  a donor to, the Michigan Humane Society for 20 years.  I type '20 years' with a smile on my face because I have so much pride in being affiliated with such a wonderful organization.  I have had numerous opportunities to volunteer in different areas with MHS; animal care, fostering, fundraising, pet education, animal welfare conferences, numerous special events, and have participated in many training sessions.  The Michigan Humane Society is consistent (and constant) about the homeless animals in their care being their Number 1 priority.  I am constantly amazed at their willingness to try new ways to help the animals, whether it be with events, training, etc.   What is important to remember is that MHS does not turn away any animals that come through their doors and MHS has so many opportunities to give animals the additional opportunities to find a loving home through various pet adoption events, not to mention the many, many foster 'parents' that take the animals in until a loving home is found.  People need to remember that it is through donations and fundraising that this is possible.  
Michigan Humane Society	113542	1	/users/profile/154497	AwesomeK9	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/01/2012	I think the problems at MHS are a reflection of their leadership.  The people in the trenches and even in to lower levels of management are mostly very sincere and hard working.  But, this is all about leadership and I speak not of any one person when I say that, but leadership as a whole.  It's very hard to get questions like these answered, or even asked, when an organization like MHS has close ties to the media and even elected officials.   MHS has quite a PR machine.   I don't think anyone is trying to "bash" MHS.  I think people want to know answers to questions.  And, the public has a right to know.                                                           We feel answers to some basic questions are due to the tri-county residents and contributors -not to mention answers and changes are needed so that another 17,000 cats and dogs are not killed again by MHS. 1. Why when it is required by law to report statistics by shelter does MHS combine all three shelters to report their numbers? Combined numbers make it impossible to determine performance of each of the three shelters - suburban Oakland and Wayne County shelters and the city of Detroit shelter. 2. Why did 4 members of the MHS board resign this year? 3. Why did MHS not undertake the complete organization assessment especially since a donor volunteered to subsidize the cost - with one of the most renowned teams in animal sheltering in the U.S. - to learn how to save more lives? 4. Why has the MHS Board of Directors never adopted an annual policy document called the Asilomar key or matrix which defines what is healthy, treatable and unhealthy/untreatable animals and determines what animals live and which are killed. 5. Why has the largest and most wealthy cat and dog animal welfare organization in Michigan not improved saving lives for the last four years and has consistently killed 7 out of 10 animals that come in the door? 6. Why did MHS refuse to join the Oakland County coalition resulting in the coalition missing out in over a million dollars in Maddies grants - the only requirement was to publish the statistics for the Rochester Hills shelter according to the Asilomar definitions of healthy, treatable, and unhealthy/untreatable? 7. Why would MHS not want to be totally transparent to their donors and the general public? 8. Why does MHS think comparison of MHS and the Humane Society of Huron Valley (HSHV) unreasonable? Both are open admission shelters. MHS has a save rate of less than 30%. HSHV has a save rate of more than 80%. MHS has 14.8% of individuals living in poverty if their service area is defined as Wayne (including Detroit) and Oakland County (where they have their three shelters) or 12.8 percent of households living in poverty  if their service area is defined as Wayne (including Detroit), Oakland and Macomb County. HSHV has 14.6% of the individuals living in poverty in their service area defined as Washtenaw County. MHS has about 5% of their total intake from outside of Wayne (including Detroit), Oakland and Macomb Counties. HSHV has bout 15% of their intake from outside Washtenaw County. If poverty is not the primary factor that MHS uses as their claim for animals being in "bad shape" in the City of Detroit  what is? How can HSHV do so much better when they have about the same or even a higher percentage of individuals living in poverty? 9. MHS is the wealthiest animal organization in the state of Michigan with an annual budget of $13.9 million dollars, 6 employees who make over $100,000 per year in salary and a CEO with nearly $185,000 in salary alone on an annual basis. Why with such high paid management is improvement not being made? 10. Why is it O.K. to accept a "save rate of less than 30% from MHS when save rates around the U.S. are double or triple this figure - New York City (almost 70%), Denver (over 90%) , Austin (90%), and even poverty stricken Reno, Nevada (Washoe County is 93%). The homeless cats and dogs in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties need MHS to improve. MHS has provided no definition to what is an adoptable or "healthy" animal. It is unfathomable to us why the status quo of killing 17,000 cats and dogs a year is acceptable to anyone especially any animal lover. Do you think they will do better if we dont point out their poor performance? Why is MHS not improving and saving more lives? What is to hide by publishing their performance by shelter? MHS is not a good "representative" of shelters or rescue organizations in the state because of both their performance but also their lack of transparency and unwillingness to post their numbers by shelter (Detroit and two suburban) Citizens believe that they are the MHS for all humane societies and often support MHS with the expectation that they funnel money to their local humane societies and they do NOTHING to correct this misconception There are other leaders in the state when it comes to sheltering that the legislature needs to consult but unfortunately they dont have the resources to be in Lansing but would gladly make themselves available to give front line assessments.
Michigan Humane Society	113510	3	/users/profile/154454	griffiam	Donor	5	06/01/2012	I grew up in Detroit and now live in a near suburb, and I have been familiar with MHS my whole life.  I have always known and respected MHS for its untiring work in support of its mission to help animals and people in our community.  I have adopted several animals from MHS, and I have been a long-time donor.  I was also on staff from 2008-2010. Although I returned to my prior employer for professional reasons, I continue to be involved with MHS as a volunteer.  To be honest, before I started working at MHS, I was afraid that working there would be like visiting the kitchen in your favorite restaurant - I might not like what I saw from the inside.  It turns out my fears were completely baseless.  Based on what I learned through my first-hand experiences with the organization, I know that MHS consists of the most dedicated, selfless, talented, and professional animal welfare people I have met anywhere.  I have never known anyone in the organization to engage in bashing another animal welfare group, which I see as grossly unprofessional and a complete waste of time.  They keep their eyes on the mission and goal of helping as many animals as possible.  To a person and as an organization, they  face tremendous challenges with creativity, grace under pressure, and fortitutde.  They are constantly challenging themselves and others to do what's best for animals and people.  MHS is a leader and an innovator.  They have earned my undying support.
Michigan Humane Society	113376	3	/users/profile/154285	TrooperRocks	Volunteer	4	05/31/2012	Being of that certain age group that has not only the maturity that comes with a 40+ year work history and all the exposures and experiences that were "fringe benefits" to that, two things stand out in my experience as a long-time volunteer with the Michigan Humane Society: 1. the unbelievable abuse and cruelty that continues to be inflicted on animals by society's underbelly, and 2. the non-stop efforts of the staff and management of MHS to their mission of promoting humane values, care and compassion towards the animals entrusted to their care and ending animal homelessness. MHS is truly a dynamic organization in the animal welfare world - continually evaluating processes and practices to bring the best possible outcomes for every animal that comes through their doors, furred, feathered or otherwise. Their open admissions policy means no animal is turned away, period. Until one actually sees the conditions of so many animals that come through the Detroit shelter's doors on a depressingly regular basis, one should not be so quick to criticize or condemn their work.
Michigan Humane Society	112827	3	/users/profile/153560	Joey2012	Donor	5	05/23/2012	For over a decade I have been a donor to MHS. I have also adopted from MHS and am a veterinary client of MHS. As a donor I have every confidence that my donations are used fully in support of an extraordinary and complex mission. I see more community outreach, animal adoptions, preventive care, and family assistance from MHS than any other organization. I know my contributions are having significant impact every day and I trust in the expertise of the MHS staff based on my experience as an adopter and veterinary client. Great job MHS!
Michigan Humane Society	108475	1	/users/profile/147644	Animal Lover	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/28/2012	An effective evaluation of an organization is how well are they doing in achieving their mission and that is not reflected in the three stars provided by Charity Navigator.  The MHS mission is to: To end companion animal homelessness, to provide the highest quality service and compassion to the animals entrusted to our care, and to be a leader in promoting humane values.  Ending homelessness should never be equated with killing those in your care - however MHS kills 7 out of 10 homeless cats and dogs that come in their door according to their 2010 annual statistics reported to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  over 17,000 cats and dogs that year alone.  They provide their contributors and supporters with excuses ....open admission, poor animal condition in Detroit, etc.  But they fail to mention that they have three shelters, one in one of the nations wealthiest counties, a second in a middle class suburban community and only one in the inner city.  MHS is NOT animal control bringing in the worst of the worst; they are the best funded animal welfare organization in Michigan.  They refuse to be transparent and publish their animal statistics by shelter - - - hidings under the umbrella called."things are so bad in Detroit."  Other open admission shelters around the county in poor communities are saving 70%, 80%, and even 90% of the animals in their care.  There is a proven formula for saving 90% of all shelter homeless cats and dogs but MHS refuses to embrace the formula.  Bottom line - - - this organization although well-funded, lacks leadership and is a total failure in meeting their core mission.
Handbags Of Hope	304106		/users/profile/395277	Darleen O.	Donor	5	09/13/2016	A wonderful nonprofit that has helped many women and children in need.  As a victim of domestic abuse, you flee your home w/ barely the shirt on your back.  Some of the most basic day to day stuff you don't think about having or needed you flee w/ out.  Handbags provides a purse w/ items you wouldn't think you'd need but once you had back in your possession you were grateful for.  Men may think a purse is something we lug crap around in, but for most women it has personal items, cherished items, and sometimes much needed items.  I for one was very thankful that I found out about Handbags, and had a chance to help them a few times.  They branched out to help teens and children who had become w/o means as well.  We need more people and charities like this.

Handbags Of Hope	296711		/users/profile/387489	Rose40	Donor	5	07/15/2016	Jackie Bobcean, the founder is an amazing woman who works tirelessly to care and love women who need a voice.  She is a defender of the weak.  Handbags of Hope comes in when the whole world has walked out and makes these dear women in need feel special and worthwhile.  
Handbags Of Hope	296442		/users/profile/387218	kbieke	General Member of the Public	5	07/14/2016	I first heard about this gem of a charity when it was run out of the founder's basement. Jackie has worked tirelessly for years to bring hope to women in crisis . I believe almost all the core group of women volunteers are all survivors of abuse and continue to try and make a difference in others lives. Their two big projects are delivering filled handbags to women in shelters all over the state of Michigan. They do this at Christmas and Mother's Day. And even when the weather isn't great they deliver these special gifts to women who think they have been forgotten. A lot of the recipients are homeless  moms with kids. Moms want to be sure their child has something for Christmas. Well HOH remembers the moms too. I have helped collect purses but especially filler items-the most needed items by far!- and attended her great fundraising activities. Things haven't always been easy but the one constant is HandBags of Hope's commitment to helping others. Kindness goes a long way and these fantastic ladies just keep truckin' on... Proud to know and support them.

Handbags Of Hope	179169	2	/users/profile/235809	Kathy136	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2013	I've worked with many non-profits over the years . . . sometimes as an adviser, sometimes as a volunteer,  sometimes just as a member of the community, occasionally as a board member or staff, or as a recipient of services. Never have I known an organization that's grown and stayed so true to its mission of helping empower victims and survivors of domestic abuse, nor one that's run entirely top to bottom by volunteers, including that of the two co-founders, Jackie Bobcean, who first had the vision, along with her best friend, Lisa Kaufmann, whom I'm proud to admit (and for transparent disclosure) is my half-sister. What the two have achieved to bring attention, awareness and education about domestic violence, while also providing practical resources and emotional support to victims and survivors is truly amazing. HandBags of Hope is a stellar example of a successful and committed grass-roots organization.
Handbags Of Hope	178639		/users/profile/235268	colesarabeth	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I learned about Handbags of Hope through a friend who has worked with them in the past and continues to support their cause.  I find it relieving that this organization focuses mainly on not only helping those who are victims of domestic violence, but also about creating awareness that this is a real problem that affects more people than most of us realize.  Their efforts toward this cause are never-ending and I often see their activity in the community, stretching their reach as far as it can go, and then pushing it further.
Handbags Of Hope	178515		/users/profile/235146	Lynn60	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	The amount of work these ladies do is commendable.

Since finding out about this charity, I have volunteered for an afternoon and given some "filler"donations and handbags.  The honest and hardworking devotion of this team is unsurpassed in hands on work for the women of our community and beyond.

Handbags Of Hope	48579	2	/users/profile/49686	shelter10	Volunteer	5	07/22/2010	If you look non profit up in the dictionary you should find Handbags of Hope. This organization managed to deveolp itself solely on donations of handbags and filler items. While holding small fundraisers to cover the cost of their deliveries across the State. Volunteers are responsible for everything from pick-ups of items, cooking for events to raffle prizes. These ladies managed to develop this beautiful charity while waiting on their 501(c)(3). Now that it's been approved their hoping for a few Company sponsors to help them open their 1st Donation Boutique. Allowing the Cause a place to work from and to except donations of purses and filler items. It's common to have 450 filled handbags donated from just one company. The President, Jackie Bobcean is as dedicated as they come, spending thousands of dollars personally to assure all documents were in place. Everyday this lady works 12 to 14 hours developing this organization. It's truly amazing what she has accomplished with no money. Many groups could learn a thing or two from her. Women love this project and with economy in Michigan so bad it's a wondeful inexpensive way to give back. I hope someone will read this release and find a way to help these great ladies continue a beautiful Cause. Turning a gently used purse into a Handbag of Hope.
Handbags Of Hope	43064	7	/users/profile/43825	kathy21	Donor	5	06/05/2010	I met Jackie via an e-mail appeal.  She had  toiletry items too large for handbags and was looking for an organization that could use them.  I told her about Hope's House a ministry through my  church that gives out health and hygiene products to those in need.  Jackie happily delivered the items to the church.  Later, we we were able to give her boxes of smaller sized products that were perfect for the handbags she distributes.  Handbags of Hope is to be commended for their thriftiness, keeping overhead costs very low.  They are very resourceful, getting donations from many individuals and organizations.Jackie and her helpers are a blessing to our community!
Handbags Of Hope	42984	8	/users/profile/43741	ggorko	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	I saw a flyer at my hair salon, JCola (a sponsor!) in November 2008 and thought what a great idea to gather purses and fill them for womens' shelters. Not knowing exactly what to expect when I got there, I brought my purses and at the Elks Club in Mt. Clemens the place was decked out for the holidays, items to buy, great items for raffles and a full buffet meal! The place was packed, full of excitement and positive energy. Jackie, Debi, and Lisa are wonder-women! Its incredible to fathom all that they do. Handbags of Hope has worked tirelessly from its inception to bring forth the goal of reaching women and teens in need. With each meeting with Jackie she seems to bring a new goal to reach out to more women in more creative ways. If ever a grass-root organization deserves support, its Handbags of Hope!

Some are abused, either physically or emotionally, homeless, or just in need of some help.  Handbags of Hope makes these women feel empowered, independent and most importantly loved.  What a great idea and mission to help spread the love and hope to others. Keep up the great work!  Maria DeKimpe

They work year-round to gather and deliver handbags all over the state of Michigan.  All on their own time and all at their own expense.

My daughter has been going to this camp for several years now, and asks when she can go back she has so much fun. I feel very comfortable and am confident in the care she receives there. i have recommended this camp to many others.
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	93949	1	/users/profile/108405	janet	General Member of the Public	5	07/16/2011	My Daughter Amy tarted going to St. Francis Camp on the Lake two years ago. It was such a fantastic camp experience for her, that from the time she returns home, until the next years camp session, she talks in excitement and anticipation of returning.  They offer a non pressured fun week filled with activities, socializing, and skill building.  For me as a parent, I am comfortable with this particular camp because they are a respite care provider, which means we I can use respite dollars to send Amy there,. If one is out of respite dollars, in my opinion the price for the week is very affordable.  They have councilors that are trained  in dealing with a variety of disabilities, and I also like the three to one ratio of campers to councilor. The grounds are beautiful, clean, and bring a certain amount of peace and serenity into the campers week. I cant say enough about St. Francis Camp! I am grateful Amy has had the privilege of enjoying the camp experience there, and we look forward to returning every year. Janet SidesAmy's Mother

It was a week of swimming, fishing, hiking and making memories that last even till today.  Donating to St Francis Camp and being on the board,  thinking about those kids enjoying themselves the same way brings on a "warm and fuzzy" feeling had to explain.  Especially  knowing that it was made possible, in a small way, my my time donations.

Even as a member of the Board I was unaware of the total dedication of the counselors and the group of totally dedicated volunteers that assist at Camp! As a result of the above, I will become more involved with the daily operation of our Camp to get then what they need to better fulfill our mission!

Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	55985		/users/profile/58258	Jill	Volunteer	5	10/30/2010	I have been involved with St. Francis Camp since 1994 both as a paid staff and as a volunteer. I have watched campers over the years blossom and grow in the nurturing environment provided at camp, under the watchful eyes of trained staff who care a great deal about the campers we serve. Being a small camp can be both a blessing and a curse. A curse because there never seems to be enough money to go around~! However, we are blessed by our small size because it allows for a much more personal experience for our campers. Our activities are camper-led and inspired. Ideas for camp programs and activities come from our campers themselves and their families. I have been blessed to be a part of this wonderful organization~!

I learned so much from the other staff and the campers during my years there. It was also one of the hardest, challenging, and rewarding jobs i have ever had. I still keep in contact with the camp and some of the staff. It has been almost 20 yrs ago since my first summer there and I have made some life long friends and memories from working at St. Francis Camp. I Love you guys and what you represent. Thank You for allowing me to have the greatest work experience of my life, I will never forget my time, friends, campers, or family from St. Francis Camp.

It provides an opportunity to experience the thrill of camping in a beautiful environment.  When I was young I got to experience the fun of going to camp and this is something that most people with cognitive disabilities do not have an opportunity to experience.  At St. Francis Camp people of all ages are able to enjoy campfires, boat rides, and all the other fun that goes along with camping. 
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	89410		/users/profile/101611	groux12345	Board Member	5	06/01/2011	I have been involved with St. Francis from its inception in 1984.  That year, we had to replace the roof on one of the buildings, a roof we replaced again last year.  For the past 12 years I have been very active in updating and providing leadership for capital improvement projects which have included replacing the siding on Alhambra Lodge, building a new deck, rebuilding the screened porch and this year, building a new pole barn for the camps use.  I tell you this because I love St. Francis Camp.  With up to 350 campers yearly St. Francis provides a safe fun environment for those who society has pushed aside the cognitively impaired.  To see the smiles on our campers faces, to have a camper give you the biggest bear hug you can imagine is the greatest reward I will ever receive in life.  I know that St. Francis Camp makes a difference in these campers lives, and I am proud to be a part of that difference.  
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	89199		/users/profile/101123	favoriate cousin russell	Board Member	5	05/25/2011	I am new to this but just fell in love with the camp so much that I got 20 new campers from Ionia County to come to camp this summer.    I know these "kids" are excited cause they worked hard at fundraising to help pay for camp.  I can't wait to see there reaction!
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	89197		/users/profile/101121	CONNIE	Volunteer	5	05/25/2011	I recommended the camp to a friend who has a Cognitively Impaired son. He said ,"I  had the best time. I caught 2 fish; everyone was so friendly and helpful. We had a bonfire and sang songs." The best part about the Camp are the Staff and  Counselors.Each Camper has input on the activities he or she participates in.There is a special program for Autistic Campers. 
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	55559		/users/profile/57756	mdepodesta	Board Member	5	10/27/2010	I have been associated with St. Francis Camp since it was conceived. The place is run by an Organizatiopn whose main charity is God's Special People , ths developmently disabled. The changes made over the years to the camp has been to better serve our special friends. There is a totally dedicated group of advisors, workers, volunteers, staff spirtual leaders and civic minded peole that continue to make St. Francis Camp a loving and friendly haven for God's Special people.
Alhambra St. Francis Camp on the Lake	55543		/users/profile/57725	mikecarp	Board Member	5	10/27/2010	I have been involved with St. Francis Camp since 1991 and have seen many campers throughout the years having so much fun.  The staff and counselors that dedicate their time each summer make sure that all campers receive as much care as humanly possible along with adding in all the fun that summer is supposed to be.  There are plenty of activities that are geared towards the cognitively impaired campers that attend to include boating, fishing, swimming, hiking, arts and crafts and the joy of singing songs at the campfire.  Each camper leaves very happy and wanting to return the following year.  Unfortunately the economy as it is right now sometimes requires help from agencies, when they can help.  I do know personally that St. Francis Camp will not turn any camper away just because they can't pay.

I have seen EquallyAble grow and make several changes for the better, such as the change of the name in 2009, and the decision to work in the US as well as in India simultaneously. I feel a deep sense of pride now that I know that EquallyAble is one of the top rated Disabilty Awareness Campaigns in the US, having seeing it grow since the beginning. Keep it up, EquallyAble!

The program is very focus on maximizing the ability of those with disabilities.   
HelpHandicap Foundation	55327	1	/users/profile/57409	azeemsa	Volunteer	4	10/25/2010	This is one of the dedicated organization for helping disabilities to aquire their fullest capabilities to support themselves. I believe by giving money for the needy and walk away from that is easy but to know their pains help them and get disabled peoples on their way to achieve success happiness will be difficult and this is what this organization is doing. Also I would go to any extent to help this organization and I wish God grant all the success to this organization.

HelpHandicap Foundation	55283		/users/profile/57345	mzy2zk	Volunteer	4	10/24/2010	This organization has a clear focus. It is applicant centered and does its utmost to ensure that deserving candidates get all the help possible.  The fundamental philosophy here is not to generate sympathy for the cause . Instead the idea is to ensure that people with special needs  who are willing  to do their best , get all the encouragement.  Economic independence of the individual applicant is identified as the solution to the issue. The organization uses all means at its disposal to help the individual achieve this goal.

HelpHandicap Foundation	55221		/users/profile/57253	minizam	Donor	5	10/23/2010	There are  very few organizations working for this specific cause. Taking up this cause to help less able people is a result of determination and huge/sincere commitment. The organization does this with zeal and is present in many community events that helps the deserving and also organize funds.

Needless to say 2 months latter I was in more pain than I was before I went in there! Horrible bad pain, swellings up the butt, and I went in there again for the last time and got every one of my teeth pulled, and 8 weeks latter got my dentures, to my surprise they did not fit, went back and got them readjusted and then they fit even worse, won't stay in for anything,no matter how much applicator you use and no matter the kind. Went back in and both nurse and dentist both said "there plastic, there not ment to stay in!" Extremely rudely. Now I'm stuck with junk that won't stay in and that are causing me a world of pain!

My 3 year old has had a small problem with his front teeth since he was about 1 1/2 or so. Other dentists referred me to a pediatric dentist in TC and they were good but wanted to fix the teeth. My son of course was scared and wouldn't cooperate. He cried at every dentist we went to until I went here. The hygenist was amazing with him! He didn't cry once and she was able to check his teeth out. Her and the dentist here were shocked at what the other place was talking about doing for my son and are making things so much easier on all of us. I'm so happy I took the chance to take him in there.

I was genuinely worried that I would have false teeth by 30.  I first heard about the MCDC when they opened a clinic in Mt. Pleasant.  I got in almost immediately (not so lucky these days in Mt. Pleasant because it is SO popular).  The staff was AMAZING and remained amazing throughout every visit I was able to afford with them.  When I moved to Ypsilanti, the Mt. Pleasant clinic recommended I transfer to the Detroit East Side Dental Clinic (also part of MCDC).  Again, the staff has been amazing and compassionate, never judgemental and always happy to help you get your oral health back.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you MCDC!

I can only say positive things about the clinic. We are so grateful to have this clinic! Today Dr. Kevin and hygentist Amanda were amazing. I told them when I left, that I think it was the first time I ever had a "good time" at the dentist office.  Amanda greeted me at the front waiting area with a warm smile and put me at ease right away. Dr. Kevin had great chairside manor and made sure I was comfortable the entire time.  The attention to detail was obvious the entire time. What great teamwork as well. I noticed Amanda anticipated Dr. Kevin's needs and he made sure to thank her for handing him exactly what he needed. I don't think there was a time he forgot to ask please either; if there was something else he requested.There were also other employees that I saw interacting in a very positive/helpful way with each other. All of this may seem simple in nature but to me it made a huge differance to how my day started. Thank you for the friendly, prompt and kind service! It is people like Dr. Kevin and Amanda who belong in healthcare and make a big differance in small ways!

Michigan Community Dental Clinics	139850		/users/profile/185994	Berens	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2012	There are so many positive words to tell about our Michigan Community Dental Clinic.    They are considerate right from the first phone call you make in.   The dentist themselves take time to make you feel totally comfortable before procedures of any kind take place.   The nurses are there with service of any kind you need whether it be questions about procedures, answers to questions about dental work or to how to handle teeth concerns after the procedures.  And kindness.  Oh boy, kindness and respect reigns within this whole office.   On a more personal note.   I am a 56 year old woman.   I have had terrible experiences with dentists so I went 26 years before I even went back to one.   Then it was too late.   The detist had to remove all my teeth.   But then the dentist that was preparing my dentures was very mean and yelled at every patient.  So I did not go back.   Ten years later I heard about our local Michigan Community Dental Clinic.   From my first phone call they treated with so much kindness and respect.   From there my treatment only went upward.   The dentist even came in and held my hand until I was able to be calm and relaxed.   I no longer fear going to the dentist I enjoy it and want to go back again.
Michigan Community Dental Clinics	139827		/users/profile/185968	Kim_59	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2012	I have been around to see many terrible ways to run a dental practice. In most companies, patients are treated like sources of income, and not as individual people who just need a little help. The staff is wonderful, and the doctors don't talk down to anyone like some are prone to do. It's really wonderful to have such compassionate dental care available to the people who really need it!

The mountains get really high and extremely difficult to climb, in our journey my son's condition is the mountain and all the added obstacles associated with this condition is the different altitudes. He was born with Stickler Syndrome, being born with a cleft palate is one of the struggles.(Among other things...this condition affects everything in the body with collagen in it.)  One thing that isn't ever explained to you in great detail is how important it is to find people who you can relate to. People who understand your struggles with one little thought shared. This is where the Cleft Lip and Palate Foundation of Smiles comes in. They are those people, every single one of them. Their ability to reach out and draw you in with love and support astounds me. I wish that we would have found them sooner in life. My son is only 5 years old, but it feels as if we've gone through so much more in those short 5 years than most people do in 20. The unconditional love & support received from my cleft family is amazing. Even now, 3 years after his palate repair. Any question I have, any question someone else has. We learn together, love together and overcome our mountains together. The drive Rachel (Milinda & so many others) has for this organization is amazing.  Many great things will be accomplished here. I am glad to be a part of it, too.  I cannot thank them enough.

My son is thriving due to the enormous amount of help the organization and it's family of members share.   I don't know where Zachary and I would be today without the help and support.  It is vital to the well-being of our babies.  They are the best there is out there.  Period.

BUT, not only are they educated, there is a feeling of community - a true sense of love and compassion that you feel not only with the executives but the community as a whole. I found this group when I was pregnant with my first. It was a great place for me to express my feelings and ask questions to others that I didn't necessarily want my family or friends to know about. Sometimes it is tough to talk about what it feels like to know your children will be born differently. This group allows you to open up and openly discuss with others. They are totally accepting. It's a great group to be a part of!

I was terrified and felt so isolated. I found the foundation in an online search and joined their facebook page. They had not only a WONDERFUL webpage with all the resources and information, but programs like Weimer Bottle program who help moms get special needs nipples and bottles if we need them and can no afford them. With all that said, the GREATEST part of this foundation is their actual support network. The administrators are personally active and outright offer support as well as hundreds of other cleft parents. I have never gone more than 15 minutes without a response to a question or concern. Also, the support I have gotten from the group was the biggest factor in me staying calm through my son's surgeries. This group is truly amazing and definately one of a kind!

Parents to parents reaching out to offer support, encouragement and eduction.  I enjoy meeting other parents but finding a cleft adult who can share their childhood experiences is invaluable. And meeting teenagers with clefts who are willing to speak honestly about their lives.  We have the title of non-profit because all the money donated goes to support our families. But in my heart it is definitely not a non-profit because I am blessed everyday by the families I meet.  Please consider donating to the foundation so we can continue to provide for our families through the programs we have available.
Cleft Lip and Palate Foundation of Smiles	108240	2	/users/profile/147317	JoAnn6	General Member of the Public	5	03/23/2012	This Foundation is a blessing for all who are members of it.  I was born with a cleft lip back in 1970 and my parents had no real means of support back then.  I only wish that they had had something even remotely close to this Foundation back then for support and education for me and my family.  This Foundation provides the education and the knowledge, but most importantly it provides much-needed support.  I can't say enough good things about them.  I have come to think of this organization as not just friends, but as family.
Cleft Lip and Palate Foundation of Smiles	108216	3	/users/profile/147281	Meredith F.	General Member of the Public	5	03/23/2012	When you are given (or not) the diagnosis of cleft lip and palate, what are you supposed to do, so many questions, etc. Thankfully the Cleft Lip and Palate Foundation of Smiles is there to help. There are so many families affected with some sort of craniofacial issue. You can ask a strange question and you'll get a response of someone having gone through that issue or having the same issue as you. I can't thank them enough for doing such a great job! 
Ann Arbor Art Association	32834	9	/users/profile/33667	cezart	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/09/2010	For my entire life as a painter, 50 years, Ive benefited enormously from the Art  Association - as a student, member, board member, teacher, and exhibitor.  What a splendid connection to have, associating with other artists and art lovers of all ages in the ambience of an organization devoted entirely to the visual arts!  After studying at the University of Michigan School of Art and Design (MFA69), I had my first exhibition at the Art Center and have had two others since then along with work in the gallery shop and in group shows.    (A retrospective is scheduled for June 18-Aug 8.)Many staff members and artists Ive met there have become dear friends.  The organization has progressed through a remarkable evolution in the effort to assist artists and townfolk in the pursuit of art.  I can testify that this is a vibrantly active and creative non-profit  exploring what art in the community can mean for citizens.  Im eternally grateful for what it has done for me.
Ann Arbor Art Association	32036	4	/users/profile/32844	raymond1	Board Member	5	03/01/2010	The few staff that work regularly at the Art Center do a great job handling a wide range of visual arts activities:educational classes, outreach to youth/disadvantaged populations, exhibition space, retail, youth camps, clay/jewelry studio,etc. The result is a a wide-ranging impact felt at many levels in the community. AND they have fun doing it. Visitors and students can feel the creative juices flowing. Would that all non-profits have such a lean, energetic, and positive impact. Kudos!!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31753	4	/users/profile/32605	agatha	Volunteer	4	02/27/2010	I participated in the 30/30 art exhibit.  It was a well designed program and staff was helpful and friendly through every step of the process.  The exhibit space was perfect for a large collection of work and volunteers provided name tags, tax forms, and refreshments to artists in a low-key but efficient manner.  I would definitely like to be involved in this organization in the future!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31706	4	/users/profile/32569	slf5373	Former staff	4	02/27/2010	I have been associated with the Ann Arbor Art Assocation for about 35 years. I started out as a volunteer helping to decide on which exhibits would be in the gallery, I was on the Board and then I was the Exhibit Gallery Director for about 7 years. I loved that job because I was doing exactly what I wanted to do, support the visual arts and artists in my community. I went on to other work but continued to be a member, promoter and user of their services. I believe the arts can change lives and my community is much richer by having the Art Association in our downtown. I have just become more active as a volunteer by joining the Board of Directors. It is great to have been part of a vibrant community organization for so long and I am excited about becoming a more active volunteer for the organization again.
Ann Arbor Art Association	31690	4	/users/profile/32549	carrie2	Board Member	5	02/27/2010	When I was at art school thirteen years ago at the University of Michigan, I volunteered at the Ann Arbor Art Center where I worked with children in the drop-in studio. It was so fun to see those kids lose themselves in their projects. Once an 8 year old girl came into the studio bickering at her 6 year old brother, and as soon as she started swirling colorful paint across an African mask, she forgot all about her gripe with her sibling.Today I run a creative web development firm in downtown Ann Arbor. Luckily, most of my days are full of color, art, and fun. Im a member of the Board of Directors at the Art Center where its my goal to make sure there is a place downtown Ann Arbor where people of all ages can find, make, and experience art. Many years ago art helped me find myself, and if I can help others find art, Ill feel right with the world.
Ann Arbor Art Association	31527	3	/users/profile/32398	jgriffin138	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	My experience interning with Marsha Chamberlin and the Ann Arbor Art Center staff was truly enriching, and I felt that what tasks were assigned to me actually made a difference in pulling the entire show together. I was a part of the project from conception to exhibition, and the evolution of ideas and plans of action were met with enthusiasm and extraordinary collaboration between the Center's members, with the out come being a beautifully orchestrated and successful fundraiser show. Organizing and directing gallery exhibitions is exactly the line of work I plan to be in in my future, and my internship at the Ann Arbor Art Center was a wonderful opportunity to get a personalized, hands on experience.
Ann Arbor Art Association	31379	2	/users/profile/32277	barbara12	Board Member	5	02/26/2010	14 years ago, I learned drawing techniques in a class at the Art Center that I still use today.  For years, I've brought smiles to the faces of friends and family when they open the wrapping paper on a gift and saw a package from the Art Center store (such unique and beautiful gifts).  I recently watched a classroom of children get completely engaged in an art project.  And now I am on the Board of Directors and hope to see all the above get repeated many times!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31098	7	/users/profile/32026	brian6	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	I have been involved with the Art Center since I was in college and it's a wonderful place for people interested the arts.  The Art Center's classes, exhibitions, and shop are a great addition to downtown Ann Arbor!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31086	2	/users/profile/32017	rita1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2010	I was an artist participant in the 30X30 benefit show at the Ann Arbor Art Association. 30 artists each brought 30 works of art, and half of the proceeds went to benefit youth programs. I sold 18 of my paintings. It was an extremely positive experience- tons of artists and shoppers stormed the building last Saturday- three of my works were gone before I even saw them on the wall. There were crowds all day, refreshments, media coverage, and helpful staff. It was a very convivial atmosphere, and involved the entire community.
Ann Arbor Art Association	31047	2	/users/profile/31977	katie9	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	I recently volunteered at the 30x30 sale to benefit Art For Kids. There were people lined up around the corner to get in and it was very exciting.  I got a special Art For Kids t-shirt for helping out that day. The event was set up well and I felt prepared to handle any question that came my way.
Ann Arbor Art Association	31042	2	/users/profile/31974	kelsey2	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	The Art Center is one of the keys to the success of downtown Ann Arbor.  I have been involved with the Art Center since I moved here over 2 years ago - it is a great place to work and play!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31021	11	/users/profile/31958	lorenzocri	Donor	5	02/25/2010	The AAAC has always been the most encouraging gallery with whom I've had the pleasure of working.  Their clientele is wide and deep and sophisticated.  I was very happy to have been able to contribute to the Children's Art Programs in this manner.  Their staff, both volunteer and professional, are superb!
Ann Arbor Art Association	31014	5	/users/profile/31952	ellenpvaughan	Board Member	5	02/25/2010	The Ann Arbor Art Center is a buzzing hub of a wide range of activities for young children, teens, and adults. From one day workshops to semester length classes from pots to paints to silk fabric dying! Something for the artist in all of us plus a gallery shop for those of us who are better suited to be art patrons! The recent 30+30  gr8artportunity. An event where 30 artists created more than 700 pieces that were available during a one day sale to raise funds for the Art of Kids Scholarship Fund; coupled with the recent 2nd annual Artini.  Both  are fine examples of the organization's vibrancy and energy.
Ann Arbor Art Association	30100	2	/users/profile/31093	courtney3	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	The Ann Arbor Art Center is one of a kind!  From the unique events and fundraisers to the caring and kind staff, they truly make the Ann Arbor Community a better place!  I feel blessed to be involved and associated with them.
Ann Arbor Art Association	28960	2	/users/profile/30003	clay	Board Member	5	02/18/2010	I have to say that as a Volunteer, Donor, Patron, and Board Member, I have never had so much fun being involved with a non-profit in my community.  The Art Center "gets it" when community members get involved and invest their time, money or resources to help out.  Everyone always smiles, and with programs for at-risk youth, art projects in the community, exhibitions and artist promotion, the Art Center does far more good in the than many people realize.  The Greater Ann Arbor area is a far richer place to live thanks to the Ann Arbor Art Center.
Ann Arbor Art Association	28915	6	/users/profile/29960	johnchamberlingmailcom	Donor	5	02/18/2010	I love the atmosphere--informal, friendly and helpful.  The selection of art is great and the courses are very interesting.  The exhibitions are professionally presented and have sufficient variety to keep me coming back.
Guiding Light Mission, Inc.	119465	2	/users/profile/162441	Johnny B.	Client Served	1	07/28/2012	While I was there at the mission I watched this organization have a policy of telling the people who wanted to get in their addiction program that if they had debt that they couldn't enter that program. I watched them turn a man away for that reason. The director himself lost his burger king buisnesses owing money to his suppliers. It seems to me that they really don't want to help some of the very people they appear to be helping. I also watched as a man named paul be very rude.
Guiding Light Mission, Inc.	58660	1	/users/profile/62660	Claire	Board Member	5	12/10/2010	Guiding Light Mission is an excellent organization.  I've been a Board Member, Volunteer (primarily as a Mentor) and a donor over the years.  All of the programs are Christ centered and are designed to help the men get re-engaged back in to their families/work/community.    People are fed, have a place to stay overnight, and the Addiction Recovery Program is where the men have the most life changing experience. Alumni come back to help.

The facility is always neat and clean and the men well kept and attentive.

The staff at Guiding Light are engaged, hard working people, who seem to genuinly care about the people in our community. They, along with their volunteers, have worked hard to provide not only  food and shelter, but professional level services to men in need. These services provide an effective and practicle way to change lives and to help build a better world.
Guiding Light Mission, Inc.	56917		/users/profile/59671	Jessica T.

For almost a year, I have worked with the people who benefit from the services provided by Guiding Light Mission.  I have heard stories that have touched my heart and changed me forever.  People are truly grateful for having this haven...this place to go for help, hope, and love.  I am grateful for the opportunity to grow and reach out to others.  Guiding Light is a catalyst for change in the hearts and minds of the people it touches, whether they may be a volunteer, a board member, or a patron.  Thank you for all you do GLM :)

They empower and encourage their patrons to be the best that each individual can be and provide them the tools to do so. The mission ensures non duplication of services within the community and that donations are spent on necessities. All around, they are doing wonderful work for our community and I am glad to have been a part of such a great organization.

Guiding Light Mission, Inc.	4715	12	/users/profile/6461	Guided Unright	Volunteer	1	05/26/2009	There is only so much branding, marketing, and PR one can do. You can put lipstick on a pig but at the end of the day it is still a pig. The Guiding Light Mission has tried hard to revamp its image from the outside - now all it has to do is worry about the minor business of entirely restructuring the organization internally. From my experience as a former volunteer, the board at Guiding Light Mission is corrupt and the leadership is corrupt. Obviously these are strong words but just do a Google search of Guiding Light Mission, dig a little, and you'll see an organization constantly covering up negative activities and trying to put a positive spin on it. If you need further proof I encourage you to follow these links: http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/target_8/Target_8_Beat_down_near_Guiding_Light http://www.topix.com/forum/city/grand-rapids-mi/TMR9GH936M5JFTFIQ http://www.topix.com/forum/source/wood/TASJB4V365MIN8EJF Many of the folks commenting at these sites have intimate knowledge of that organization - they are staff members, board members, past volunteers, ex-donors, and most importantly residence of the facility. There are so many more worthwhile causes in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area - that help the homeless, that provide food and clothing and shelter - and all do so in a God-honoring manor  Degage Ministries , Mel Trotter Ministries, Salvation Army, Safe Haven Ministries, the Well House, the Open Door - the list goes on an on - and absolutely none of these places have long and sordid histories where time and again stories of corruption and fraud come to light. This economy will leave some places still standing and others in the dust. This community would do just as well without the Guiding Light Mission.

I was welcomed and allowed to first detox, a process to get some sleep, and food during the initial phase of recovery. I then was given a responsibility. I became the morning cook at the mission.I began to serve god threw the mission, feeding his sheep. as time went on and I attended the classes, groups, and meetings offered I began to receive some self respect that I had lost in the process on my addictive lifestyle. the guiding light mission has helped me by allowing me the time and resources to get out of my self and allow God to work in and through me. I am currently attending cornerstone college, working on my business degree. I thank God for the donors, and the people at guiding light who have made this all possible.

They are not only planting value in the hearts of little girls around the world, they are restoring a sense of value in the hearts of those who serve alongside them.

Little Dresses for Africa	301974		/users/profile/393085	Betty57	Donor	5	08/31/2016	I love Little Dresses for Africa! I began sewing and donating the dresses  to your organization approximately 8 years ago. Your organization has influenced our local missionaries to also organize, collect and distribute little dresses. I have sewed literally thousands of little dresses and am now leading a sewing group of ladies at our church. Your influence reaches far beyond  your own organization, telling young girls they are worthy and they are loved! Thank you !
Little Dresses for Africa	295542	1	/users/profile/327326	nancylewis25	Donor	5	07/12/2016	After suffering two small strokes , I was sitting home feeling sorry for my self. I came across a story about a woman, Miss Lillian, who was 99 years old at the time. She sewed a dress a day for LDFA and hoped to reach 1000 dresses by her 100th birthday. I thought if she could do it, I could do that. So I saved for a sewing machine and watched sewing videos on YouTube to try and remember what the strokes had robbed me of. That first dress took me hours to complete, but I did it!  I proudly posted it on Facebook. My friends and family have all joined in with fabric, thread, elastic etc. to make sure I finish 30 dresses and now 30 shorts as well , a month. Just as I get low on fabric, a box  of fabric always seems to arrive in the mail. Sometimes from friends I haven't seen in over 50 years.  All because of the dream of one woman. Planting in the hearts of little girls, that they are worthy.

It asked if one was inclined to take a packet and sew it up and return it to the store.  All in all I did about maybe 25 dresses.  It was there I met Susan Chandler, who coordinates for Dress a girl around the world.  I've been sewing with her and the girls for about three years now.  We have send dresses all over the world.  In effect, doing what Little Dresses does for the poor girls and boys (shorts) of the world!

The dresses don't last forever, but hopefully the memory of love and compassion will stay with a child for a lifetime. I went from a situation with no supplies, not even a sewing machine or scrap of fabric, to being blessed with many stacks of fabric, and multiple machines. God has helped me to do a very good work for others!

This non-profit, since 2008, has sent more than 4 million dresses all over the Continent of Africa and 31 countries beyond.  The dresses are used as little Ambassadors to get into the Villages and Communities to teach simple lessons on clean water, sanitation and nutrition as well as to encourage widows and child-headed families.  As relationships are formed, we identify a village that we can partner with for our 1,2,3...GO program.  One: Clean water.  Save lives now.  TWO: a Primary school.  Education changes tomorrow. Three:  Multi-purpose building, for community gathering, exchange of information and worship.

We would love to have your help.  Some sew.  Some donate.  Some organize the dresses for shipping.  Some help with fund raisers.  But, it takes us all1  Little Dresses for Africa is a christian non profit 501c3 organization dedicated to providing relief to the most vulnerable of God's children: little girls. We collect home made dresses, made of brightly colored pillow cases, and distribute them all over the continent of Africa, to plant in the hearts of little girls that they are worthy. We supply them by sending them with mission teams, mailing them to NGO's and taking them ourselves on short term mission trips. During distribution, we conduct simple lessons on nutrition, clean water and sanitation. Donations have been received from all 50 states as well as Canada, Australia and the UK and have been distributed in 46 countries of Africa as well as other countries in crisis such as The Philippines, Haiti, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Guatamala. We believe that lives are changed here and across the ocean as gender, age and denominational lines are crossed as we help others. Groups can work independently of each other and send the donated dresses and now also shorts for boys, to Michigan for packaging and distribution. Mission groups can request as many dresses as they are able to distribute. We like to say, "We're not just sending dresses, we're sending hope."

First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	175281		/users/profile/231616	Meaghan M.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	First Step is a wonderful place to volunteer.  The staff are very supportive and you're never given a task until you are confident, through training, that you can handle it.  I spent two years as an advocate and the care and concern the advocate team provides for volunteers is excellent.  The volunteers are truly appreciated and respected.  The variety of opportunities to provide support, care or  talent is endless.  I highly recommend First Step as a place to invest your volunteer hours.  You will be helping people who truly need it and you will be supported and appreciated.  Lastly, you will feel very good about your contribution.  It's a great experience.
First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	173285		/users/profile/229423	WRob	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	In 2011, I visited the First Step facility and instantly fell in love with the people that ran the organization.  The compassion the staff displays for victim's of domestic and sexual violence was humbling.  They work tirelessly to create fundraising opportunities, complete grant submissions and manage their budget as if it was their own money in order to provide the best possible care for the special people that ask of First Step's assistance.  I was honored to become a Board Member in January 2012.  This organization is critically needed in this community and deserves the best possible chance to grow funding and gain increased support.  This organization isn't trying to put a band-aid on the problem, they are attacking it at the root  for long term change by providing counseling services, safe environments, education and victim advocacy.  
First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	107392		/users/profile/88195	DDD1	Volunteer	3	03/01/2012	First Step is a wonderful organization filled with altruistic people who have changed our society by subtly educating communities on the negative effect of sexual violence and other types of intimate terrorism.  Many of the counselors are gifted people in heart and counseling.   However, the organization should see the protection of its volunteers as its number one priority.  Perhaps the organization should align themselves with Attorneys who understand and defend victims.  As First Step has already put forth the concept that Victims are often re-traumatized by the legal system and its processes and formal procedures.  Advocacy groups should avoid permeating re-traumatization implicitly or explicitly through its processes and procedures respectively.

First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	80957		/users/profile/88407	Cheryl	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2011	Good Morning! I have been affiliated with Frist Step for six years.  The organization is dedicated to assisting women and children during a most difficult time in their life and empowering them to a life of peace and independence.   I have visited the shelter many times and each time I am overwhelmed by the need in our communities. I  am grateful that First Step is there, as it is often the only option for women to get out of an abusive situation and get the guidance and emotional support they need to change their lives.  First Step  is a wonderful organization that has made a difference in the lives of many women and children. Sincerely, Cheryl Phillips    
First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	80948		/users/profile/88397	Linda	Volunteer	5	03/02/2011	I have been a volunteer with First Step for nearly 5 years.  This wonderful organization provides help to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, and works to promote peaceful homes and families and healthy relationships.  It is staffed with some of the most dedicated, caring individuals I have ever had the honor to meet.  I cannot praise this organization, its people, or its vital work too highly. First Step is tireless in supporting its mission.  In addition to their "regular" work of running a 24-hour help-line for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, counseling and advocating for victims, providing temporary shelter and assistance, and educating the community, they have undertake several huge projects in the past few years.  They recently completed a capital campaign to finance a new "Family Center", a shelter to safely house victims of domestic violence and their children who are trying to leave their abusive environments.  They have also instituted a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program, which allows rape victims to have professional forensic exams at a First Step facility.  This provides a caring, supportive environment after the trauma of a sexual assault, while facilitating the collection of evidence to prosecute the attacker. The miracle of First Step is that it manages to provide all these services with such limited full-time staff and funding.  By actively and effectively engaging the community, it manages to stretch its limited resources and provide an amazing level of service.  It  runs a well-organized volunteer program, whereby volunteers are trained and utilized to supplement its full-time workforce by staffing the 24-hour hotline, responding to crisis calls, nurturing children from abusive households, staffing information booths, etc..  It also coordinates a number of community fundraising activities, to provide the resources necessary to continue its vital work. Peaceful homes are the building-blocks to a peaceful society.  Everyone deserves to be safe in their own home, at the very minimum.  It is absolutely critical to break the cycle of domestic violence and abusive relationships which pervades our society.  First Step is doing its utmost to ensure that this happens.

First Step-Western Wayne County Project on Domestic Assult	80816		/users/profile/88227	AGG01	Client Served	5	03/01/2011	First Step gave me the grounding in rebuilding my life from scratch after receiving my gender based asylum as a victim of domestic violence. Their various services helped me get my self esteem and confidence back to become a non-traditional student at Wayne State University Law School and now currently help set up Solution Oriented Domestic Violence Prevention Court (SODVPC) under 3rd Circuit Court in Wayne County, MI.  The counseling that I received helped me see my own potential and work towards being a change that I want other survivors to see. I want to personify Gandhi's saying "You must be the change you want to see in the world." If others can see what I am able to accomplish with the help of First Step, I believe that other survivors will be inspired to achieve their own potential and rebuild their shattered lives.

He obviously couldn't work and neither was I.  We fell behind in our bills and were struggling to stay afloat.  Through another friend we were introduced to Cheryl and Pam at Macomb Feeding the Need.  Cheryl counseled us, make some phone calls to help us delay shut-offs at our home, provided gently used clothing, helped with our grocery needs, and also did a few things above and beyond what she normally does for clients.  She also introduced us to their meal program at the Masonic Hall 2 days a week where she welcomes everyone from the community.  They serve a continental breakfast and a hot balanced meal at noon.  Also they pass out baked goods, fresh vegetables, can goods,  and personal hygiene products when they get them donated.  The lunch crowd is given a message from the bible relating to our everyday lives from local pastors. We are blessed as my husband is walking and working.  Now we continue to partake in the twice weekly lunches more for the fellowship that has developed.  You learn everyone's story and come to realize how many are struggling and how great the need still is in this small part of our county.God bless, Cheryl, Pam, and the gang who work tirelessly to provide (ALL without salaries or compensation).  My husband and I (and many others) will be eternally grateful.   I truly love you guys.

Ms. Hogle and the co-directors are clearly very experienced in working to bring out the very best in children's voices, and my daughter leaves each rehearsal with excitement and motivation to practice the pieces that they are learning during the week.  As a homeschooler, the Detroit Children's Choir is definitely her favorite extracurricular activity. As a parent, I am impressed with the directors, multiple performance opportunities, and the principles of discipline, teamwork, and performance that my daughter is learning. We feel very blessed that she is able to be a member of such an amazing choir at such an early age, and recommend this experience to any child that has an interest in singing.

Volunteer	5	09/25/2012	I was a member of Detroit Children's Choir from 2010-2011 and am currently on hiatus due to furthering my career by now living in Hollywood California. DCC opened doors for me by referring me to local auditions that allowed me to perform for the Wayne County State Of The Union Address! That will hold a memory of a life time for myself and my family. Ms. Schoch is dedicated to her members and holds  structured rehearsals. I learned the true aspect of classical music, the history of the songs that were performed, how to blend with the group as a whole, voice control and harmonizing. Any one fortunate enough to be accepted into her program will leave with the skills needed to take their craft to the next level; that's what I have done.

Working with the kids and the staff was a pleasure, and I'd highly recommend them. Detroit may be well know for music, but sadly with the demise of so many in-school music programs, students must rely on programs like this to gain all the benefits that music can bring to life.

I volunteered last year (2010) for their big annual concert, assisting in the general organization of the happenings of the day.  Living in Boston, I have very limited opportunities to interact with such worthy causes in my hometown, and this experience was more than worth it! I had so much fun getting to know the kids!  They all come from different parts of the city and have so many stories to share.  When the performance started, I was immediately awestruck with the power of their voices.  The impact they had as I  witnessed their dedication and talent come together brought tears to my eyes...three times!  Watching all of these kids work together to achieve such beauty was just amazing.  You could see the confidence and self worth the kids had gained by being a part of the choir.I highly recommend attending their performances and supporting the organization's mission to provide music education to at risk youth.

In fact, it is a model for the nation in both areas of music education and societal unity.  These children are receiving far more than musical opportunities for excellence.

I worked in Protective Services in Detroit, MI; schools in Algonac & Rochester, MI; treatment homes in Grosse Pointe Farms, MI; and a children's hospital in Pontiac, MI. In all, I serviced both rich and poor; in all places, I saw the need for services, especially food, before any treatment could begin.I find that Gleaners is a well established, overwhelmingly volunteer-based agency that distributes to all areas in all parts of the world. These past years in Michigan have been very very tough financially and the need for food has become epidemic. Job loss, foreclosures, financial problems all have contributed to a sense of hopelessness in my area for many people.

I donate to other places but this one seems so 'down to earth'.. over 30million pounds of food distributed per year.Whether you have much or little to give.....just give.... please. It is so needed. Pass the 'will work for food' signs and contribute to where you know your dollars will be properly distributed.These double donation days, like today are terrific! You can donate for someone as a gift or in honor/memory of....Please help. In all my days of service as a social worker, I have never seen so many so needy....and admitting it and sometimes feeling bad for accepting help. Please help so they can feel hope. I can no longer work due to physical problems but I can still help. I hope there are many, many more HELPERS out there today.thanks. Gail
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	24647	1	/users/profile/25669	Ned Greenberg	Board Member	5	12/20/2009	I have served on the Board of several non-profits, but never before have I been part of an organization as well run as Gleaners Community Food Bank.  I marvel at how the Gleaners team leverages 20,000 volunteers to distribute over 30 million pounds of food a year.  There are less than 50 employees, yet Gleaners is at the forefront of countless programs in our community to help alleviate hunger and improve nutrition.  The organization is filled with individuals possessing extraordinary skills and deep commitment to improving the lives of those in need.  I am consistently awed and humbled by their accomplishments.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23493	1	/users/profile/24603	Michelle	Volunteer	5	12/07/2009	Gleaners fills a community need that has become more significant in the wake of the floundering economy.  The staff is proactive, dedicated, and equally open to the support of one person or a small army.  They always respond to requests whether they are need based or inquiries to support on a volunteer basis.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23491	1	/users/profile/24600	Liesel	Volunteer	5	12/07/2009	Gleaners makes miracles! They have a tireless staff, and army of volunteers and an amazing impact on the Metro Detroit area! They operate at an amazing cost and spend every available penny on helping people in need. Gleaners people are good people doing great things!I have volunteered with them at numerous events, and it's a great chance to help out in the community. So often, "helping a charity" means simply pulling out the checkbook, but Gleaners allows you to help at ground level. Meals on Wheels, the food bank, stuffing holiday boxes, are all great opportunities to get directly involved with some of the great things Gleaners does.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23351	1	/users/profile/24436	Rob Ray	General Member of the Public	5	12/03/2009	Gleaner's is an amazing organization and truely provides a helping hand to Southeastern Michigan.  Their leverage is outstanding: $0.95 of every dollar donated goes directly to food programs and every dollar provides 3 meals -- NOW THAT'S RESULTS!We've raised money and food donations a number of times, and volunteered at their distribution centers (which is actually alot of fun!).
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23282	5	/users/profile/24353	heinz	Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	It was an incredible experience working with this organization.  I have worked for many nonprofits, but this the best of the best.  They are extremely organized and professional, as well as making us feel like we are part of the business. I can't wait to volunteer again. It is a great way to spend an afternoon; you meet new people and help an efficient organization serve so many people in need.  I have to say thank you for making my life experiences even richer.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23176	6	/users/profile/24248	Sarahmaria	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/01/2009	I often tell my friends that if all non-profits were run like Gleaners, our world would be in a much better state. They are efficient and resourceful, nothing goes to waste. They truly care about the dignity of their clients, they cherish and respect their employees and everyone I know who works there really works their fingers to the bone to get things done. It is a happy place, their employees love what they do. When you walk into the warehouse, you really feel the love. I would say that in this economy, no one is doing better work for our country than Gleaners.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23045	6	/users/profile/24109	Lynn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/26/2009	I have been doing Social Work for 11 years and regardless of the population of people i assist, Gleaners has always been an option for those less fortunate. They have provided food for homeless teens and teen mothers, the elderly, foster care homes and organizations, the mentally ill, low income, 1time or new unemployed families....EVERYONE. I am truly proud to have associated my work and effort with an organization who's is focus is on the community. They are still located on the east side of Detroit and see first hand how their generosity and charity affects people. i wish them years and  years of service.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23013	6	/users/profile/24066	Lauren	Volunteer	5	11/25/2009	There is so much love in this organization.  I've volunteered making food bundles and the facility was neat and clean.  The staff and the others who came out that afternoon were so friendly.  And on the other end of things I have seen the Gleaners trucks out in my community.  What a life saver to so many.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	23006	11	/users/profile/24057	Renato	Volunteer	5	11/24/2009	I volunteered at Gleaners several times a long time ago and saw that they were making a difference in people's lives.  As a result, I donate s small amount from my paycheck every month to the non-profit as doing so would be the right thing to do so they can continue their good work.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	22990	5	/users/profile/24036	Christine	Donor	5	11/24/2009	My family was able to help stock the shelves at one of the Gleaner's Pantry locations. I like the fact that the people that are served by Gleaners get to pick their food and go shopping for a more dignified and less wasteful approach to distribution. They can take their kids and feel like they are in a normal grocery store. It was a good experience for my family/children to stock the shelves with some of the items we donated and get a sense for the limited meals that needy families would be eating. The volunteer staff that assisted us was fantastic in making the experience meaningful.
Gleaners Community Food Bank, Inc.	22988	4	/users/profile/24035	beemane	Volunteer	5	11/24/2009	I love helping out at Gleaners warehouse. The staff is super nice and you really feel like you are doing something beneficial.
Greater Flint Arts Council	32929	1	/users/profile/33758	charlene-k	Client Served	5	03/10/2010	The Mass Transportation Authority has worked with the Greater Flint Arts Council for over ten years through the successful Federal Design and Art in Transit program.  The program helps local communities include art as an integral part of the design of transit facilities throughout the United States.  Working closely with the Greater Flint Arts Council, the program has brought new life to MTA facilities with artwork created by successful Michigan artists. The artworks grace the walls and exterior spaces of MTAs various buildings and centers across Genesee County.  The collection of art reflects the relationships between people and public transportation.  Each individual service center has a specific theme attached to it, so that throughout the building and grounds, continuity flows through the artwork. Through a successful partnership with the Greater Flint Arts Council, Michigan artists have created beautiful pieces that contribute to the quality of life of Genesee County residents, giving them the ability to view various mixed media, including hanging and standing sculptures and paintings.  The community is fortunate to have a wonderful agency such as the Greater Flint Arts Council.
Greater Flint Arts Council	31572	4	/users/profile/32442	ann-whaley	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	The Greater Flint Arts Council has been a beacon to which many are drawn, me with artwork in hand. I have been given the opprotunity to show my work for going on 5 years.  The arts council has helped give reason and respect to my work in a way unparalleled in my life thus far.  Not only is my work shown consistently I find myself in situations that are a big stretch for me.  I have a serious case of social anxiety.I also volunteer for openings and am getting better at being around crowds.  I am rather phobic in tight crowded areas but these openings bring out artists and supporters and I know we depend on their (my)attendence  in order to be successful.  Just being there and the people I have met there has taught me alot. Being part of the arts council gives me hope and something to work towards.  I am disabled from the military and was quite isolated until I found this outlet and other outlets that Kathy Johnson has helped me research.  It's amazing to me to have found this organization in Flint, Michigan, a town whose negative reputation completely contrasts what's going on in the art community here with the Greater Flint Arts Council leading the way.
Greater Flint Arts Council	31041	1	/users/profile/31975	gschwart	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2010	The Greater Flint Arts Council helps to keep our city alive and connected to the visual and audio delights of the world. Free and low cost events provided by the council spread excitement and encouragement to the struggling and established artists alike. The community is truely blessed by this organization. I enjoy the Flint Jazz Festival and Tunes at Noon and so appreciate the efforts of the the staff at the GFAC.
Greater Flint Arts Council	31016	4	/users/profile/31954	twebbs	Board Member	5	02/25/2010	Greater Flint Art Council has made a positive and economic profitable impact on the City Of Flint. They have been a cataylst for bringing people of diverse cultural backgrounds into downtown Flint to appreciate art. Helping to breakdown racial and cultural barriers and open the door for a more positive community.Tom Webber
Greater Flint Arts Council	30853	3	/users/profile/31797	john9	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	I have been to many different communities that are far larger than Flint and they do not offer such a wonderful local gallery with such high quality art.The Greater Flint Arts Council is a gem and your community is lucky to have it.
Greater Flint Arts Council	30006	3	/users/profile/30995	kathy-t	Donor	5	02/23/2010	The monthly Art Walks are awesome and contribute a great deal to bringing back downtown Flint.  We have brought several of our friends along and they have been shocked that someting so "cool" and fun would be available in Flint.
Greater Flint Arts Council	29186	5	/users/profile/30224	mumsy	Client Served	5	02/19/2010	This organization provides a great presence in the center of town for both artists and those who enjoy art. I enjoy the inclusive way the staff welcome artists and give them opportunities to share their work both in the monthly art displays and at various local sites. I participated in several small classes at the center that widened my experience and enriched my life. Thanks, GFAC, for continuing to shine and encourage us all.If this organization had 10 million bucks, it could provide more classes, extend its services, and expand art activities with children and adults.In my opinion, the biggest challenges facing this organization are a lack of funding and of public awareness of all they provide. One thing I'd also say is that being downtown is great, but some who might come to evening functions are afraid to go into the area after dark.

Greater Flint Arts Council	29060	5	/users/profile/30104	artist-diane	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	GREATER FLINT ARTS COUNCIL has been one of the pillars of the city of Flint Renaissance.  this very dedicated arts council has always seen the cup a half full to completely full.They are always there for the artists with programs, encouragement, kindness and compassion. (sometimes it is not easy to be an artist)   They have consistently put on one of the best art events every single month for years and years.  They run the gallery and council professionally and are always striving for a way to do things better..to serve the artists and community better.   This is a very tenacious bunch of people who seem to eat, sleep, and breathe art in every venue.  They bring out the best in the people in this community who have even the tinest bit of creativity in then.  They help that art spirit and assist in nuturing it in anyone who wishes.   Greater Flint Arts Council workers go beyond the call of duty!!!!!!!   This is great place!!!
Greater Flint Arts Council	29038	1	/users/profile/30081	pharlon	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	Thank you Greater Flint Arts Council!! From my beginnings in my business, the Arts Council has always been supportive, providing space and being informative on where to look and go in support of my Art. I look forward to working more with the Arts Council in the future!
Greater Flint Arts Council	29001	5	/users/profile/30043	dancer1	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	I have been enjoying the wonderful artists and shows that the Arts council does for many many years. The arts council is without a doubt one of the best gems that Genessee County has to offer, for that matter the state of Michigan. The art walk, the Quilt shows and my favorite The Flint Jazz Festival that I am a  volunteer for, for many years. If you have never been into the Gallery at the council you are missing some great art by are local artists. Every year I see the arts council giving this community something great to rejoice about. I hope it never changes but to grow
Greater Flint Arts Council	28986	12	/users/profile/30030	barbeedoll	Former Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	I have attended a number of events sponsored and coordianted by the council and have not been disappointed.  I have also see the work behind the scenes.  This group works very hard and puts their all into what they do. In a community that has seen more than it's share of troubles, the Arts Council has been and continues to be a shining light.  They work hard to bring quality and diverse entertainment to all of their community events as well as their gallery.  The staff is to be commended for all they do and how they serve the Flint and Genesee County community.
Greater Flint Arts Council	28959	10	/users/profile/30002	demingartstudio	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	As a Michigan artist, I find the Greater Flint Arts Council a valuable resource in providing exhibit venues for my art work, assisting me in building my art career and providing assistance in acquiring grants. Also, the GFAC, through their monthly newsletter,provides information on galleries, stores and juried art shows to which artists can submit and display their art work. As a member of another art organization,I find that the Greater Flints Arts Council is very helpful in providing other art organizations with assistance in the growth of the art organization, assistance in special community projects and assistance in grants. One example of a project which the GFAC assisted another art organization was the Deer-In-Lapeer art project. The GFAC assisted us in organizing the project and acquiring a grant to fund the community art project. The staff at the GFAC is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I find that artist members of the GFAC are also friendly and helpful. I highly recommended the GFAC to other artists when considering an art organization to join. I also recommend attending the art shows and artists receptions to all my friends and family. If there were more than five stars in the rating system I would recommend atleast ten stars for the GFAC!
Greater Flint Arts Council	28954	8	/users/profile/29995	rosalie77	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	The Greater Flint Arts Council is a shining star in our small metropolis.  Their whole scenario during the 2nd Friday Artwalk is comparable to any "big city" event.  Thanks to the creative talents of Greg and Cathy GFAC is a strength in our community!
Greater Flint Arts Council	28817	8	/users/profile/29878	glass51	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2010	I find Cathy and Greg to be great advocates for art as well as the artist.  Great place to be a member.
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	320951		/users/profile/414030	spg1974	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/08/2017	The majority of the funds raised go to salaries for individuals/social workers who do not leave the office.  Christmas gifts are a huge issue they like to boast that they provide however individuals that have the means to purchase gifts get the same amount that someone who doesn't have any.  Also special need and emergency funds are extremely limited.  Individuals who fundraiser qualify for bonuses while social workers do not get any.  I also can't get a real concrete answer on how many patients they actually serve
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	297712	1	/users/profile/388520	kburk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/22/2016	As a social worker for the Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan, it is amazing to support children, adults and families faced with Leukemia, Lymphoma, and other blood related disorders. We provide financial and emotional support to all CLF patients and families.

Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	282768	2	/users/profile/372932	Teddy5	Volunteer	5	03/18/2016	I have been involved with Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan for several years and I look forward to continuing my support for an excellent organization.  From my experience, CLF has a strong board of directors and it invests in the youth to one day carry the organization's torch.  CLF also has a great mix of patient events so you can see the non-profit at work and the genuine gratitude of the families CLF helps.
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	282730	2	/users/profile/372895	Writer	Board Member	5	03/17/2016	CLF does an amazing job dealing with patients and their families during difficult times. They offer a tremendous amount of support and guidance. CLF is a wonderful organization!
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	278406	1	/users/profile/368345	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2016	Have tremendously enjoyed being a part of the CLF community. Comprised of truly inspiring patient families, gracious volunteers, dedicated corporate sponsors and motivating staff, it has been a true pleasure coming together throughout the state to provide much needed services to the patients CLF serves. If you're looking to join a dedicated cause and make a true difference in the lives of others, I highly recommend joining forces with CLF. 
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	278362	1	/users/profile/368293	032780	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/29/2016	This organization goes above and beyond for their patient families!

Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	251677	2	/users/profile/339653	RBear	Professional with expertise in this field	4	08/05/2015	I have been extremely involved in the giving community for many years and have been a follower of CLF of Michigan - through attending various fundraising events and even volunteering. I have gained tremendous insight to this statewide organization and understand the Foundation currently serves over 4,500 families statewide, which is an extraordinary accomplishment. Transparency can always be an opportunity for development with charity foundations, and I hope to see CLF take these reviews into consideration. Overall, I highly recommend attending some fundraising events and watch for this Foundation to continuously grow  
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	250646	2	/users/profile/338526	JessicaP	Donor	5	07/30/2015	I've given to CLF multiple times over the past few years and feel good about what this organization does to help others. The staff are committed and passionate, and it's also reassuring to know that .82 of every dollar goes right back to the patients they serve. 
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	249574	1	/users/profile/337403	hgrix	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/23/2015	This organization has been so helpful to our community. I am honored and thrilled to be a part of such a wonderful cause.  A full .82 of every dollar raised is put directly into programs helping children adults afflicted by leukemia, lymphoma and other blood disorders.  Through disease and treatment education, case management, emotional support and financial aid, more than 4,300 people  will receive services this year alone. 
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	148781	3	/users/profile/142669	mr nobody	Donor	1	01/31/2013	Had a prior interest in this charity so I check in with it now and then via Guide Star to see how its doing.  I note that it now has a "Guide Star Exchange Seal, demonstrating its commitment to transparency" yet its most recent 990 is dated 19 months ago (6/30/2011). Furthermore, it does not publish an annual report or have an audit on Guide Star and the needs assessment it has on its website to keep abreast with the needs of families it serves has not been updated since 2004.  How is that transparency?  Rather, it seems high on fundraising but low on disclosure as to how funds are used.
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	106064	1	/users/profile/142669	mr nobody	General Member of the Public	1	02/06/2012	I used to support this organization but have noticed that CLF no longer publishes a newsletter or annual report and hasn't updated its needs assessment since 2004. And while IRS 990's for CLF show losses in 2008 and 2009 - no surprise given the poor economy - the CEO's salary increased both years as well as in 2010 when CLF barely broke even. During that period, research contributions ceased and patient aid all but disappeared.   However, fundraising activity is up and its website is pretty slick.   In my estimation, this once reputable charity is now all smoke and mirrors. 
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan	23122	1	/users/profile/24189	twitestedlim	Donor	1	11/30/2009	CLF has yet to post their 990's for 2008. Calls and letters to the CFO and the Board Chairman regardging the status of the Sylvia Brown Endowment have never been responded to.
Assistance League of Southeastern Michigan	269040	1	/users/profile/357769	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I have volunteered with Assistance League of Southeastern Michigan since 2012.  From the beginning, I was surprised and overwhelmed with the caring attitude and incredible resourcefulness of our 300+ members.  We contribute over 50,000 volunteer hours per year.  And over 90% of our profits are utilized to serve the needs of children and adults in the Macomb, Oakland and Wayne county area.  Our nine philanthropic programs are focused and streamlined--we coordinate with other area agencies  to ensure appropriate coverage and minimal overlap of effort.  As part of a national organization, we can provide local dedication while drawing upon the resources of our National Assistance League membership.  My husband and daughter support my work with ALSM and have gladly volunteered their time, as well, to contribute to this worthy organization.

The 'Thank You' letters and smiles from the children and families who have been recipients of our philanthropic programs is heartwarming and inspiring.  Because of our generous contributors and dedicated members, we are able to continue providing clothing, food, tutoring, and care kits to thousands of individuals in need throughout the year.

Clothing over 2,000 children last year allows a retired teacher to still help children. Delivering Assault Survivor Kits to hospitals and clinics and Layette sets to needy mothers in all areas of our state shows the care and commitment of this organization. These women work hard all the time all year to help others in need.Sue D
Assistance League of Southeastern Michigan	152922		/users/profile/183916	musicmom66	Volunteer	5	04/06/2013	I have been a member for one year.  This group is incredible - I can't even begin to list all the things they do for children, for women, for families.   Their Operation School Bell clothes hundreds of needy kids every fall.   They operate a wonderful tutoring program at a nearby school.  They provide kits of clothing and other necessities to many local hospitals to give to victims of sexual abuse.   They operate a Buddy Bear program.   The list goes on and on.   This is an all volunteer group and they welcome anyone in the Detroit area who wants to help.   Members are friendly and welcoming to newcomers and new members are encouraged to help in whatever way is most comfortable for them.   I have never been in a group that works so hard and does so much! 
Assistance League of Southeastern Michigan	137897		/users/profile/183916	musicmom66	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I just joined Assistance League in the spring and I could not be more impressed by this volunteer group.   They do incredible things for children and women with their Operation School Bell which gives clothes and school supplies to needy children, with their Wee kits which gives layettes to new moms in need of them, with one-to-one tutoring in schools and these are only three of the programs.  What I really like is the way they involve new people by letting them just right into working with any group that seems to be the right fit.      They train new volunteers and make them feel very comfortable and a necessary part of the group right from the start.   I am so glad I found the Assistance League as a volunteer!  Marilyn 
Assistance League of Southeastern Michigan	137748	1	/users/profile/183747	Cindy57	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I began volunteering for this non-profit last year for their Operation School Bell program.  The faces of the children as they entered the makeshift store in their schools gymnasium were unbelievable.  They were so very happy.  The first child I took through told me that she had never been shopping for "new clothes" before and asked me if she could keep them.  She said "I don't have any money!"  The second child, a little boy, seemed concerned as we approached the school pants fitting area where our volunteers measure the children's waists for size.  He said "We don't have to try them on do we?  I don't have underwear on.  My mom had to wash them."  I assured him he did not have to try them on and that he was getting an entire package of new underwear to take home.  He said, "My mom will be so happy!".   The sacks of clothing are as big as some of the children in the younger grades. Since that time I have began tutoring for K & 1st grade readers, delivered Wee Help kits and Buddy Bears to hospitals assembled Assault Survivor kits and filled backpackers of food on Fridays for children in need for the weekend.   What a great organization.  They have over 300 members.  Not one member is paid.  We have an upscale resale store in downtown Rochester that is the major source of funding for all of these great philanthropic programs.  Each member is asked to work at least 7 shifts at the store per year and to volunteer to work on at least one philanthropic program during the year.  Our monthly meetings are informative, organized and attended by over 100 people.  There is something for everyone. I am amazed at the commitment of this fabulous group,of women from the Tri-County area of Michigan.

The workers for Kids' Connection take time to listen to each individual person and assist them in getting help and resources they need for themselves and their family.  They cut through all the garbage and jump right in to help!!  Saving Tax payers thousands of dollars while helping parents and their children get back on their feet and back out into the community.  They promote health living and healthy parenting in a kind gentle mannor that makes a hard time a positive experience and helps families want to make a positve change.  
Sanilac County Kids Connection	88356		/users/profile/99346	Matthew Gezequel	Volunteer	5	05/03/2011	I have worked with this organization for a long time.  As the co-coordinator for out Safe Kids Program I have worked closely with the director and the entire staff.  This organization is a group of greatly motivated individuals who work very hard to improve the community they live and work in.  I have seen the staff help hundreds of families with thier only goal is to make life better for the family.  The Safe Kids Greater Thumb & Saginaw Coalition is a part of the Kids Connection.  That has helped many families by providing safety education and equipment to families.  I have also worked personally with the staff and volunteers.  We have helped over 5000 children by checking thier child safety seats and in over 2500 of these we helped by providing the families with a new seat.  This oranization has worked for many years strictly off of grants provided to the program.  Since its inception the program has provided nearly about $100,000 worth of safety equipment to families.  ie:car seats, bike helmets, home safety equipment, smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors   The Director Nancy Dean and I both volunteer our time to act as the coordinators for the Safe Kids Program.  We both agree it is better to make children safe then to worry about what we could be paid for.    We both agree it is all about the kids and for the kids that matters.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	88278		/users/profile/99219	Marie	Client Served	5	05/02/2011	The Kids' Connection is an awesome organization.  Everyone there goes out of their way to help.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable, and they have helped me and my family get through some very tough times.  I don't know what I would have done without the Kids' Connection and their outstanding programs and services.  They have gone above and beyond anything I expected.  Thank you!
Sanilac County Kids Connection	88252		/users/profile/99175	Chico	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2011	The Sanilac County Kids' Connection is a needs-based service organization conceived, facilitated, and staffed by incredibly altruistic people whose sole intent is to aid children and families in our region.  They always go way above and beyond the call of duty to serve the public in our area.  The staff is professional yet truly caring and dedicated. I have directly observed the operation of one facet of the Kids' Connection on numerous occasions, the Sanilac Baby Pantry.  It is heartwarming to witness as the staff and volunteers provide material and inspirational support to the young families who are the clients.  It is especially nice to see the gratitude on the faces of the recipients of the Baby Pantry services as their basic needs are met.  This is an amazing service that has supported many, many needy families.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	87636		/users/profile/98369	Cody	Board Member	5	04/27/2011	I am  impressed with the time and effort that is devoted  to the children of Sanilac county by the staff and volunteers of the Sanilac County Kids' Connection.  They provide a valuable service to the children and their families of this rural farming area.  Keep up the great work!!
Sanilac County Kids Connection	87117		/users/profile/97706	DebM	Board Member	5	04/25/2011	I have worked with this organization since it was just a concept.  I have volunteered and now I am a Board Member of this organization.  Everyone involved with the organization, staff and collaborating agencies, as well as the community, go above and beyond to improve the quality of life for children in Sanilac County.  They even reach out to other communities in Arenac, Bay, Huron, Lapeer, MIdland, St. Clair, Saginaw and Tuscola counties with certain programs and services. This organization has been designated a Promise Place by America's Promise Alliance and in 2008 received the 100 Best Communities for Young People in the United States designation. I'm very proud of this organization and very excited to be associated with it.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	87054		/users/profile/97629	erinmcdaid	Volunteer	5	04/25/2011	The Kids' Conncection is a non-profit organization with the mission to improve the lives of the children in our communities.  The employees and volunteers at Kids' Connection work hard to ensure that children from newborn through adolecent and teenagers can find the help they need to become successful adults.  This help may be as basic as providing information on local food shelters, to helping new parents get their child's hearing tested, to assisting teenagers who are having emotional difficulties find counseling assistance, to training child care providers in new methods of early childhood education.   The Kids' Connection brings together all of the available resources in our community to make finding help easy.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86996		/users/profile/97556	Linda	Board Member	5	04/25/2011	 When I was associated with the United Way of Sanilac County, the Kids' Connection became one of our agencies because it was a great way to partner with the needs of children from birth to eighteen.  The agency has grown over the years and has helped many children and their families.  We are lucky to have such an inovative organization in our community,
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86978		/users/profile/97537	objective	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	Our organization has partnered with the Sanilac County Kids Connection since it's inception.  Our ability to expand services to the children in our program is due in large part to the Kids Connection.  The staff, director and many volunteers continue to support our mission and goal. Our families who visit there are shown kindness consistently.  I feel comments made otherwise are from professionals who have never supported the ideals of this wonderful non-profit and especially feel covetous of the director who has exceeded all expectations of her "job description".   The opinions of Sanilac County Families are what matter most. I can tell you first hand how much they value the Sanilac County Kids Connection
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86968		/users/profile/97525	Halusia	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	I have used the Kids' Connection numerous times as a resource for the parents I serve in my position as a therapist with Community Mental Health. They have been instrumental in providing linking to needed resources and services for children in our community.  The service is friendly and informative for my consumers who otherwise may not have the confidence to investigate resources for themselves. Kids' Connection makes getting involved and utilizing programs and resources easy and accessible.  I would use their services whenever my consumers have needs related to their children.  Thank you Kids' Connection!
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86959		/users/profile/97509	Jenny	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2011	The Sanilac County Kids' Connection captured my interested when I began volunteering in this community several years ago. The Kids' Connection is the ultimate one-stop-shop for services & programs for area children & families. The initiatives of this organization have benefited so many people! Here is a list of some of these programs and the wonderful things that they have to offer:-The Connection Referral Team is a collaboration of many area human service organizations. The team meets twice a month at the Kids' Connection to discuss & create service plans for families that have multiple needs and don't know where to turn.-Greater Thumb & Saginaw Area Safe Kids offers monthly car seat checking stations in 3 counties & replacement car seats are available to low income families. Over 5000 car seats have been checked since the beginning of this program. Safe Kids offers many other programs on how to prevent injury & death to children such as home safety, bike safety rodeos with helmet distribution, crib safety, sports safety & so much more.-Great Start Collaborative Sanilac is a partnership of parents, community agencies, business leaders, educators, health care providers, faith leaders and individuals working to ensure our young children are ready for kindergarten.-In-Home Team is an intensive program to help keep children with their families & prevent removal. This program has saved Sanilac County thousands of dollars that would have otherwise been spent in the child foster care system.-The Information, Resource & Referral program is dedicated to connecting anyone to appropriate services & programs. In 2010, the Resource & Referral Specialist connected almost 5000 families & individuals to programs that assist with emergency food, utilities, rent/mortgage, child care, homelessness, domestic violence and so many more.-RAMP is an initiative that has a goal of providing youth with positive alternatives to drinking and doing drugs. It is also a media campaign promoting a healthier lifestyle rather than negative behaviors.-Great Start Regional Resource Center is dedicated connecting families to quality child care & connecting child care providers to quality training.The Kids' Connection also hosts the Baby Pantry on the 2nd & 4th Monday of every month. Baby Pantry is a program of the Sanilac County Child Abuse Prevention Council, and provides free baby items such as diapers, wipes, formula, clothing, shoes, coats & much more.The staff of the Kids' Connection work tirelessly to ensure that every child has an opportunity to succeed in life. And, because of the dedication of the staff & director, Kids' Connection has been recognized as a Promise Place by the America's Promise Alliance.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86939		/users/profile/97486	Scott	Volunteer	5	04/24/2011	The staff of Kids Connection are dedicated and work countless hours often times without pay in order to get the needs of children met.  The are advocatesof many children who otherwise would have no voice.
Sanilac County Kids Connection	86794		/users/profile/97276	Roger	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/22/2011	This organization is wonderful: a one of a kind state model for collaborative service delivery. The Kids' Connection's  only goal is to make sure that children with multiple needs and their families  get linked with appropriate services that help them meet  their needs.  The staff do a sensational job  of insuring that no child (or their  family) falls between the cracks in the  often fragmented and complicated service delivery system in Michigan.  I have personally observed them  go to  extraordinary lengths to advocate for their children. They are bulldogs and I know when I make a referral to them  that they will nevere ever give up on any family in need. The community loves the Kid's Connection because they untangle complicated  issues and systems that cannot be resolved by a single agency. Treatment is vastly improved for every child  because  all the  relevant agencies are  working and communicating together to meet the whole childs needs. The Director , Nancy Dean is very talented and dedicated professional .
Sanilac County Kids Connection	53356		/users/profile/54470	samn	General Member of the Public	1	09/25/2010	This outfit is a scam money maker for the executive director to get herself free trips,food and other goodies. She partners with her husband and friends to take what little money the people in this poor rural county make. They use the money to keep their friends in the printing and advertising business in the money. They smirk in their photos because they are proud of themselves at the way they manipulate the people.They believe these honest, hard working ,little educated people, are easy to take advantage of!
Campaign for Aging Research	249850	9	/users/profile/337695	Johanna S.	Volunteer	1	07/24/2015	The elderly woman who contacted me told me she called numerous others and never got a reply. Beware of Elder Helpers at elderhelpers.org dont make the same mistake I did; do your research. I was looking for an opportunity to help seniors in my area, joined Elder Helpers as a volunteer, what a mistake. Not only are they not a BBB accredited business but it is of my opinion that they are stealing money from seniors and their families. All they do is sell a list of names and numbers to unsuspecting seniors and their families looking for help. The list contains a few honest people like me looking to help but Im certain many on the list are bogus. I know that there are the same people who have created more than one profile because that is what has brought me to stand up against Elder Helpers at elderhelpers.org. When attempting to login to update my profile I was told that my password was incorrect so I went for to the Forgot Password option. On their website the Forgot Password process is to type your email address into a text box and they are supposed to send you and email to reset the password but this email never came. After I made several attempts and didnt get the email to reset my password I contacted Elder Helpers. Here is the email volley:Me:  I'm a volunteer looking to update my profile. I have tried several times to reset password but never get an email to do so.Mary R: Have you tried resetting it? Me: I've never gotten the reset email.Mary R: There is a link under the login box to reset your password. Me: Yes, I know and I've tried it several times but I'm not getting and email from your site to reset it.Mary R:  You can try re-registering with a different email address. Me: No, I will not register again. Do you understand what I am trying to convey? After selecting that I have forgotten my password your website prompts me to enter my email address and states it will send me an email to reset my password and I'm not getting that email. I have checked my junk mail too. I expect you to fix this problem with your website by the end of the day.Eder Helpers responded with their generic see our FAQ (frequently asked questions) on our website.They did not fix the problem so here I am shouting out a warning to all: Beware of Elder Helpers at elderhelpers.org! On their home page you will find a short About Us blurb that includes the statement, We believe that compassion at its finest is free. Their service is not free, so what does that say to you about their compassion?Please share my experience with others let us use the power of the Internet for good and warn everyone of this organization and to educate others not to make my mistake and to research before getting involved with any organization.

Campaign for Aging Research	183149		/users/profile/118437	HarvardVegan	Board Member	5	10/28/2013	I like the multidimensional vision of C.A.R. - (a) helping elders today, (b) researching eldercare issues today so that future best practices in eldercare can be improved,(c) researching today the aging process itself so that knowledge produced today can result in better understanding of aging and how aging alters human needs for individuals, communities, and populations,  (d) emphasizing the preventive knowledge (keeping your health - keeping the health that one currently has) through the translation of relevant knowledge into improved living practices so that we can live better for longer, and(e) researching the social implications of longevity (and statistically a progressively more 'aged' population) and how societies, governments, and others can integrate that knowledge into policy formation.
Campaign for Aging Research	171141		/users/profile/226690	Bobbywilson	Volunteer	5	09/23/2013	My experience with Elders Helpers was unbelievably rewarding.  I work full-time and so I was seeking a way that I could give back to the community with flexible schedule. Staff find ways to accommodate my request. It gives me an opportunity to served the elders on my own way of helping them, though it's a small gesture from my side but I know I touch someone's lives.  I will continue to volunteer my time with them as I learn to love them.

Campaign for Aging Research	42999	9	/users/profile/43760	debra-r	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	My husband and I had 6 special needs children along with my own 2, but an elderly land was moved into a place were my mom lived, her children moved her in took everything of value and left! They never had much contact after that all the holidays, birthdays, mothers day nothing it broke our hearts. This lady was the most loving appreciating person I had ever met! She volunteered 40 hours a week in the community and even got the Governors Award.But after the first year of seeing her always alone, Our entire family took her in and had her start coming to all the special holidays, birthdays, graduations etc... She was so full of life and always happy and smiling she was just an inspiration to be around. I was a nurse and took her to her doctors appointments, her family took her car so I just did it. But one day she asked me if I would help her in a way no one else would, she knew she could talk to me about anything but this was very important, and very hard for her to ask but her falling out with her children was that she wanted to be buried with her husband and they (her family) did not want this because she and her husband was Mormon's and did not approve. Before she said anything else T told her I would grant her, her last wish no matter what it was and her last wish was to be with her husband so the day she turned 80 years old she quit her full time volunteer job and said she was ready to go be with her husband. I called hospice and made all the recommended changes took her to the hospice care facility and stayed there day & night with her. We talked about her last wish and what she all wanted for flowers and music, where she wanted her service to be and I told her not to worry about any of the financial part that I would take care of it, knowing she had no money or anything of value, deep inside I wasn't sure how I was going to pull it off but I didn't let her know that. The first day after we put her in hospice he doctor who had become a friend stopped and checked in on her and she said in a stern voice which was totally out of the ordinary for her she asked why she wasn't dead yet and that she wanted to go dance with her husband and how long was this going to take? She had been off her heart medication now for a few days and see was still alive, this was not what she wanted! She just thought she would be gone , have her wings and be dancing with her husband .. They as husband & wife were very well known, traveled and she was affiliated with Sweet Adaline,The orchestra, just about anything you can think of she did, even hosted dinner for President Roosevelt and his wife and her husband was a wonderful well know musician who played violin and she play piano they were very known is there home town!! They even started the daily new paper in that modest town of Iowa. As the second and third day went by in hospice we talked about all there travels and the so called good old days just to pass time away and to keep her mind on other things because this dieing stuff was taken way to long!!!!! One night another old friend stopped in and I had never left her side we sat up and was telling jokes until around 4am.we where all beat so we decided to get a little sleep but when I woke the next morning around 8am she was very peacefully sleeping so I thought but when I tried to wake her she couldn't talk or say anything just kinda smiled like always and laid her head back down and then I knew her time was limited very little words, just smiles once in a while, later that day I called family and friends and even her children and yes they all come even her children they didn't have much to say and #2 mom is what we called her was now fight to stay and I was not sure why. I'd seen death so many times being a nurse but this was different this loving person who so desperately wanted to die and go dancing with her husband now was fighting. She had a stroke and could not express herself with speech I had to try and figure out what she was holding out for! I asked her if it was something she wanted and yes it was I told her that I loved her she had been in the family for 20+ years but hat wasn't it. I asked about her service nope not that, then I said one of her children s name There, There was that smile bingo she wanted something from her biological children but what? After asking dozens of questions I found the fight one!!!! The one she had waited for, for over 20+ years (I LOVE YOU) that was all she wanted to hear from them and then GOD gave her the wings to fly and sour with the Angels her beloved husband. Her girls didn't offer anything and only asked about a ring she gave me to sell to help with exspences it was 3-4 generations old, but to this day I have never taken it off! I paid the 8,000.+ tab over several years and I have to say I have no regrets this wonderful person God blessed us with thought me a lot about Love , Family, and most of all is that you can always SMILE even if you cannot speech.    WITH ALL THE LOVE IN MY HEART THIS ONE IS FOR MOM # 2.........

Haiti Nursing Foundation	218844	2	/users/profile/282445	EpidemiologistJoLynn,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2014	A perfect example of teaching them to fish rather than giving them a fish!  The Haiti Nursing Foundation (HNF) has established a premier medical training program which facilitates medical care throughout the country.  By training Haitian nurses, the HNF gives individuals the opportunity of education and the skills to help their people.  This is what a great non-profit is all about.
Haiti Nursing Foundation	223844		/users/profile/287596	Sharon131	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2014	I am a retired nurse faculty and have gone to FSIL in Leogane Haiti which is supported by HNF.  These faculty are doing the most outstanding job of educating the health care providers for Haiti.  FSIL is becoming a self sustaining but needs our help to keep them going for a number of years.  
Haiti Nursing Foundation	218882	2	/users/profile/227450	Tim_33	Board Member	5	10/01/2014	HNF has changed thousands of lives in Haiti and America. In my family , they have allowed all 4 of my children, my wife and myself to partner with Haitian nurses and students in a very personal way. My girls have tons of big sisters in Haiti. My sons have always had friends in the male nursing students as well. My oldest son has decided to become a nurse because of the time we have been with HNF. I also appreciate the way in which they make us feel at home. Even when times are tough in Haiti, the Hatian staff would always have us over to their houses and make us feel at home. In the community in Haiti, I have seen so many people changed. At the orphanage we work at, there is a 15 year old girl with mental retardation. The nursing students at the hospital helped to keep her alive and get her to this orphanage. At the church where I attend in Haiti, I watch nursing students and faculty provide health screening and teach about common diseases on Sunday mornings and other days of the week. At the hospital, I have seen nursing students dig change out of their pockets to buy a homeless patient some soup. HNF is doing big things. Thanks much. 
Haiti Nursing Foundation	171793	2	/users/profile/227450	Tim_33	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I have learned so much from working with HNF.  While in Haiti I perfect both my nursing and educator skills as I work side by side with students and faculty. Through my work with HNF stateside, my customers, students and colleagues are empowered to get involved and think beyond our borders.

Haiti Nursing Foundation	172148	3	/users/profile/227879	ithoma	Volunteer	5	09/27/2013	This mornings paper had a quote from someone far wiser than I,  it stated. " education is the foundation for a happy and healthy population". The Haiti Nursing Foundation is on target to fulfill the promise of that quote. I have been  the sponsor of a nursing student  that the foundation has supported for four years. That student will graduate  this October, with a BSN and the dream of becoming a Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioner. The Foundation recognized the need for professional health care in Haiti, and provided the means and support to  reach that  goal. My support for that organization will continue because it is not about me or the student that I sponsored. It is about the commitment of the Foundation to continue its work with providing high quality education in the professional health care field in a country that has a desperate need. As a registered nurse, I have been to Haiti on Medical Missions and the need is very real.  I feel pride in the fact that I have an affiliation with the Foundation and hope that it continues for years to come.  ns

I have personally been to the school six times and was privileged to witness several graduations.  Each nursing graduate has their own story of coming from poverty and deprivation to emerge as their family's first college graduate.  The families come to the graduation ceremony any way they can get there - walking, by "tap-tap" or in a rocking chair resting in the bed of a pickup truck (a grandmother of a graduate did this).  The joy, the hope and pride radiate from their faces as they watch their graduate be capped and receive a diploma.  Have you heard "Give me a fish and I eat for a day, teach me to fish and I eat for a lifetime"?  As a baccalaureate prepared nurse, the FSIL graduates provide for themselves and others for a lifetime.
Haiti Nursing Foundation	172016	3	/users/profile/227716	Leslie Stainton	Donor	5	09/26/2013	I've been following this foundation for several years and am convinced they're doing some of the most important work in Haiti aimed at building sustainable solutions to the country's many challenges. By supporting the training of nurses in Haiti's only 4-year bacculaureate program, the Haiti Nursing Foundation--and FSIL Nurses School in Leogane, Haiti--are equipping a cadre of young Haitian men and women with the skills and expertise to make real change in Haiti's cities and rural areas. They're also creating employment opportunities for hundreds of young Haitians--and providing thousands of Haitians with greater access to health care.

This non profit supports nursing in Haiti, especially a 4 year nursing school in Leogane.  I have visited this school six times and witnessed  personal accounts from students and seen the donations at work.  The nursing students are so enthused to have an opportunity for advanced education and for the ability to give back to the people of their country.  The reputation of the school is one of quality and accountabiltiy.  The graduates are readily employed in Haiti and they in turn help to support their families.  Building educational infrastructure in Haiti is a sound approach to helping Haitians help themselves.  "Give me a fish, I eat for a day; teach me to fish and I eat for a lifetime".

The Haiti Nursing Foundation (HNF) has established a premier medical training program which facilitates medical care throughout the country.  By training Haitian nurses, the HNF gives individuals the opportunity of education and the skills to help their people.  This is what a great non-profit is all about.
Haiti Nursing Foundation	129166	4	/users/profile/174524	donna s martsolf	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	Nothing is more important to people than their health.  Unless you have had the privilege of living or working in Haiti as I have, it is almost impossible to imagine the health conditions that are common in that country. A large segment of the population still dies in childhood because of easily preventable problems like malnutrition or communicable diseases like malaria. Even simple things like clean drinking water and hand washing are not available or widely practiced. Nurses who know how to prevent illness and can teach these practices are invaluable. And yet, the number of highly educated nurses in Haiti is disturbingly few. The work of the Haiti Nursing Foundation is directed at advancing nursing as a professional discipline in Haiti. One of the primary recipients of the work of Haiti Nursing Foundation is the Faculty of Nursing Science of the Episcopal University of Haiti (FSIL). FSIL provides a 4-year bachelor's degree in nursing. The graduates of the program are all working in Haiti and making a real difference in healthcare in their communities. They were particularly effective during the earthquake when the students and graduates provided emergency health care for victims who lived in Leogane (the epicenter of the earthquake).  I am really proud of these young nurses. 
Haiti Nursing Foundation	129158	4	/users/profile/174514	rbarn	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	Haiti Nursing Foundation was started to support the advancement of nursing in Haiti.  The Episcopal Church of Haiti asked for help in starting a nursing school in Haiti.  A group of us nurses pitched in working with several Haitians to develop one to meet Haitian needs.  The HNF was started because we realized that funding was needed to support the school and other nursing needs in Haiti.  The volunteers as well as the board members have been very helpful and the organization has really helped in cooperating with the nursing school board members and the school faculty and staff as well as in contact with funding agencies and work groups that have helped with equipment and instruction.  The Executive Director has worked well with the Presidents of the HNF Board to facilitate and expand the opportunities for the education of nurses in Haiti.  HNF has sponsored nursing students to come to the USA for short training experiences with selected academic programs.  HNF also has worked with a university to give online post graduate instruction to graduates.  The inter-cooperation of HNF with organizations in Haiti as well as with USA organizations is a good example of what can be accomplished by working together.
Haiti Nursing Foundation	129157	6	/users/profile/174513	Elise Lev	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2012	I became involved with HNF after learning about FSIL, the school in Haiti supported by HNF. I visited FSIL on three separate occasions to teach as a volunteer at FSIL. I learned first hand the incredible work that HNF does by providing opportunities to Haitian students who, without HNF, would have no way of getting a college education. The education these students receive has the potential to contribute positively to the health of the Haitian population. I spoke with many Haitian students who told me their personal stories and how HNF made such a life-changing difference in their lives. My involvement by knowing these students and the incredible amount of effort they put into their studies inspired me personally to donate money as well as time to HNF. I have taught nursing for 40 years and I can honestly say that the students supported by HNF treated their education as an opportunity for which they were willing to work hard to achieve success. I am sorry that some U.S. students who treat education as an entitlement are not exposed to the wonderfully positive attitudes of the Haitian students who are supported by HNF. There is no doubt in my mind that this nonprofit should be one of the 2012 Top-Rated Nonprofits.

It's amazing how embedded one can be in a community and know so little about it.   Leadership Macomb opened my eyes!   This organization helped me to see the treasures in my own backyard.  From how our lights work and how our waste is managed to how our natural resources and government programs work.  I learned so much about our community through this program and I value how much this has helped me professionally and personally. 
Leadership Macomb Inc	275693	2	/users/profile/365345	MRJackson	Client Served	5	01/05/2016	Leadership Macomb was one of the most fulfilling educational experiences I have had to date.  The ability to get an inside look at Macomb County, where my husband and I both work and live, was so valuable to me.  Instead of sitting through the typical lecture-style presentations, we attended field trips, participated in community service organization events, and were offered the opportunity for private "behind the scenes" tours that generally are not available through any other program. I loved it so much that I have stayed involved through Program Council and the junior program.  The networking benefit has grown even since my program ended through alumni events and mixers and I still keep in contact with many of my classmates and other LM alumni on a regular basis.  You will not regret taking this course (plus, unlike other leadership courses there is NO HOMEWORK). Every single session provided value to both my personal and professional life.  My husband was so impressed with the value it added to my career that he is enrolled and participating in the current program.

Each session provides a unique learning experience that cannot be duplicated elsewhere (including a flight on a KC135 Stratotanker with mid-flight refueling). Friendships and networks are formed that might otherwise not have happened. Even graduates who live and work in the County are astonished to learn about the community they have lived in their entire lives. Some graduates have run for office such as trustee, school board, etc.  A handful have started their own non-profits as a result of seeing a need in the community.   A countless number now serve on boards of various organizations within the county.  Personally, this is the best program I have ever attended  I enjoyed it so much I stay involved as a board member,sponsor and active supporter.

I traveled with Artrain for the first leg of the Native Views Exhibit and it was an amazing experience.  Along with other artists, tour manager and of course the train crew, I got to see parts of the country that I would never have gotten to on my own.  I met so many people and had so many incredible experiences.  In fact, during that time I kept a journal and if you'd like to read it, it's available at: http://artrain.livejournal.com  Artrain is a national treasure and brings so much to so many people and for so little.  I would hope that anyone who hears that Artrain is coming to their town or close by, that they make the trek to see it.  And I would hope that anyone who has an opportunity to volunteer or donate to Artrain make it a priority.  I will always cherish the time I had on Artain.  I'm still in touch with many of the people I met while on the train, and the experiences I had were life changing.  I owe so much to Artrain.

The actual artist gave a presentation of a notable work of art.  It was amazing just to see it; but, to meet the artist and hear about how the work came about and the history behind it was very enlightening, and a once in a lifetime experience.  Throughout the train car(s) were excellent displays and hands-on activities for all ages that not only educate but bring to life the events and history of the theme.

Artrain Inc	61213		/users/profile/66794	Nancy Coumoundouros	Client Served	5	01/26/2011	Several years ago, the school district of Waterford, Michigan created a new position: that of Supervisor of Fine Arts for the district.  The new supervisor saw a need to not only expand the cultural offerings in the schools, but also the community at large, as Waterford was a predominantly blue collar area historically lacking in the arts.  A small group of interested citizens assembled to discuss the idea, and it was decided to host a kick-off event.  The new arts supervisor, who hailed from New York, brought up the idea of bringing the Artrain into Waterford. Although it sounded more than a bit daunting to our small committee of cultural novices, we decided to jump in. (I do remember thinking early on, What in the world have I gotten into? as we learned all that was required.  Our township had not been successful in pulling off even the smallest community event in the past.) The initial committee was expanded, to include a wide range of representatives from the schools, PTA, Parks and Recreation and local artists club.  As discussion followed, excitement grew, and enthusiasm spread.  At one critical point, when discussion of all the necessary preparation issues had ended with, I think I know someone I can ask for that, or Ill do that! there was a silence.  We all looked at each other and realized that this enormous undertaking was actually going to happen, simply because we were working together.  It was, truly, a magical moment, and, I believe, the moment of birth of the Waterford Cultural Council. I was in charge of publicityour first big expense was 400 bright red lawn signs, which said merely, Artrain in Waterford, April 19  24.  These teaser signs, splattered all over the community, started a mysterious buzz Not only did the Artrain project pull in a myriad of people to make it work, it worked well, and quite amazingly banished all obstacles thrown in our way.  A condemned railroad side track was mysteriously uncondemned for the duration by the township powers-that-be; art teachers were all awarded substitutes for days, in order to take on the role of museum docents (very unusual for the school district, and a treat for their students to see); artists donated time and talents; a local clothing expert and designer showed her collection of vintage clothes; members of the Detroit Chamber Winds and other musical groups were engaged as entertainment.  To prepare the scruffy-looking grounds, inmate crews were brought in to do clean up, and a local nursery enthusiastically provided an archway and beautiful plantings.  Even the rather grouchy owner of the nearby property finally bought into the project and allowed us to mow it and use it for parking.  Donors contributed, as well, and the community foundation even awarded us an educational grant. A marvelous opening reception was held in a nearby church reception hall, attended by artists, teachers, volunteers, media, and school, township and county officials, and we were off! Never before had so many different elements in our township been involved in such a great collaborative project, and our many skeptics had to admit, it verged on a miracle.  As excitement swelled, and more and more people joined the Artrain in Waterford team.  We proved to a doubting township that not only could it be done, but people would cometo see art no lessand 5,000 people lined up that weekeven in the rain!   The Artrain visits success proved undeniably that there was a recognizable desire and need for more cultural activities in the area, and the Waterford Cultural Council was formed.  The success also convinced the Township Board and School District that this was something worthy of support, and each, a year later, contributed $30,000 and $25,000 respectively toward the organization, which was repeated yearly.  This formed a strong 3-way partnership that has been used as a state-wide example, gaining several major awards for the Waterford Cultural Council.  Memberships, grants, earned revenue and donations built a strong financial foundation. Since its inception, the Council has expanded, providing classes, workshops, a string program for children and adults, professional performances by groups as the Glenn Miller Orchestra and Michigan Opera Theatre, free summer concerts, exhibits, educational projects, artist residencies, special events, and the very successful Waterford Founders Festival (later renamed Summerfest).  It has proven that even in the most unlikely settings, the arts can make amazing things happen, and can create a sense of real community via its projects and activities.  Thousands upon thousands of children and adults have benefited from the Councils presence. One of the best examples of the Artrain projects direct influence on the Council would be the Picasso project that followed on its heels.  The Detroit Institute of Arts  approached the Cultural Council, and asked if it would be one of only three sites in the state to host the exhibition of an original painting by Pablo Picasso, Bottle of Anis Del Mono, based entirely on the success of the Artrain (other organizations were falling all over themselves to get this opportunity!).  WCC took the project and turned the township on to Picasso-maniaagain, 400 lawn signs with Picasso in Waterford on them, 40-ft. banners, Picasso cubist jello cubes on the school lunch menus, and year-long art projects for students.  When the painting finally arrived, the WCC headquarters had been turned into Picasso museum with the help of the township government and Parks and Recreation Department, including special building security, a new exhibit wall and lighting, a display of prints following Picassos life and career, hundreds of pieces of student artwork, a video presentation, workshops and related concerts.  Between 5,000-6,000 people attended; the more than any other of the sites, which were in known arts communities.  The DIA told us they were concentrating more funding and attention into our site than any other, due to the collaboration that existed in our community for the arts. The Artrain is, as all of us know, not only a train with beautifully presented exhibits, but a museum-on-wheels that provides a spark wherever it goes, strengthening communities through the arts.  Waterford will be forever grateful.

And sometimes, some communities don't have access to these nearby. Artrain's mission is to bring these experiences to every community. The exhibits are mobile and they work with the communities they visit to transform lives. People (and kids!) get to see art and exhibits that they would never have gotten the opportunity to see otherwise. It's amazing to see the effect.

Friends of Grand Rapids Parks	35558	6	/users/profile/36379	yaya	Board Member	5	04/12/2010	FRiends of GR Parks is a proactive, inclusive, grassroots community organization that in its very short existence has raised hundreds of friends and volunteers to support, enhance and advocate for the parks in our community.  The director is a spark plug for engaging representation from all neighborhoods and has inspired involvement of political officials, funders and corporations as well in these challenging times.  A number of special events in the past year have raised widespread awareness of the need to become a "friend" in order to protect and sustain the park system as a critical part of the quality of life in our community.  In a short time, we have come a long way in that regard.
Friends of Grand Rapids Parks	35489	5	/users/profile/36319	katey1	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	Friends of GR Parks was wonderful to work with when I contacted them about setting up a park clean-up. Steve, the director, was wonderful at communicating back and forth as we coordinating the clean up. He's also been great as they are planning a city-wide park clean up this spring. It's great to get the residents of neighborhoods together to help take care of our park and I'm very happy there is an organization supporting it. I also enjoy checking out their website and reading their monthly newsletter.

They have organized Park Cleanup days and have organized volunteer groups in our parks, both of which have been difficult tasks for our parks department, due to extensive staff cuts.The Friends have also been working towards more aggressive and long term solutions to our park funding, programming, development and acquisition issues. Further, they have been proponents of integrating our parks into our community life.

The mission engages so many people-- and people are passionate about their parks. Last year at Parks Clean-Up Day, I met a man with his ten year old son raking, picking up trash and removing branches from our neighborhood park's open space. He told me he had just gotten off third shift (implying he hadn't slept yet) and this was a great thing to do with his son. He and his son stayed for hours cleaning up their park. Friends of Grand Rapids Parks helps engage families and their communities around their shared, open space.

Together we continue to recruit a growing army of Friends, raise money, build partnerships and upset the status quo in City Hall - all in the service of better parks, a stronger economy, improved environmental stewardship and a healthier community. The organization is solutions-oriented, with the elbow grease and credibility in the community to get the job done.

Every penny donated provides for the education and well being of the children in Bosnia. I've been present for the tears of thankfulness of those kids who received that otherwise have nothing. They are the real deal & there is no better way to invest than a child.

More specifically making a positive change by investing in the future generation that unfortunately is unable due to economic difficulties rebuild and grow the country tha once was before the war.

Jericho Foundation provides hope and college scholarships to students from orphanages or financially struggling families.  These students recognize the value of education and are so grateful to have the opportunity.

Jericho is a family to all the students that receive their scholarship. I am their first student and am proud to say that since I have finished school in 2008 I still have that family and support that every person needs. My country was in war and has its struggles after that.  Scholarships and student loans are not available and it is very important for smart, talented kids to have a support in schooling.

Jericho Foundation Inc	289010	1	/users/profile/379215	Elmaaaa	Volunteer	5	05/07/2016	I am a scholarship recipient of the Jericho Foundation. I had a difficult childhood. My mother died when I was 17, my father was an alcoholic and my brother abuser. Because of that, I was forced out of my home. I wanted to grow up and to be an independent and successful person. That was my biggest dream, but they did not allow. They stopped me at every step, sometimes financially, sometimes food, sometimes in ugly words and often with violent behavior. Through it all, it was very difficult to go alone but my light was Jericho organization. My dream would not have been possible without the good people who support Jericho. Jericho organization has made my dream come true and I became exactly what I wanted. My life is a reminder to all young girls who grow up with abusers and alcoholics, a reminder that with good people like you that I fulfill my dreams.  Jericho organization is my reminder to the world there are still good people who want to help others and not to lose hope in humanity.
Jericho Foundation Inc	288418	2	/users/profile/378621	eminaahmetovic	Former staff	5	05/04/2016	As a graduated student who has receiving Jericho scholarship for four years, I can only say great words about Jericho foundation. For me Jericho is family. They helped me in so many ways. After first year of collage I wasn't able to continue with my education because of financial issues. Then Jericho helped me by giving me scholarship. Except material support, there were always somebody to talk with when I was feeling bad, having bad day or even to share my happiness after passed exam. Also, they gave me opportunity to visit America and work as an inter in American company. If I have ability to say 'Thank you' every day for the rest of my life, it wouldn't be enough to show my gratitude to Jericho. It really gives you hope to know that somebody, even very far from you, take care of you and you are not alone. Thank you Jericho :D

As tragedies come, throughout the world, people retreat and move to the next issue. Jericho's commitment to the region has created lasting change and impact in the youth. It is vital that we stay in such areas so that a true difference can be made. Jericho is organized, intentional, impactful AND growing! I am so excited to watch their impact for years to come.
Jericho Foundation Inc	238402	1	/users/profile/323635	Mark.norman02	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2015	I have been traveling to and reporting from Bosnia for the last twenty years for BBC Television News. Having lived in the Bosnian city of Mostar during the conflict in the 1990's, I am only too aware of how some charities promise much and deliver little. In the time I have known about the work of Jericho, I have been hugely impressed with their long-term commitment and ability to deliver on promises made. I firmly believe that charities such as the Jericho foundation will play a huge part in shaping the country for future generations. I wish them the best of luck.

Second Chance at Life Inc	174763		/users/profile/231070	Lissi H.	Board Member	5	10/07/2013	As a transplant center social worker I am always looking for financial assitance for pre and post transplant patients.  Second Chance at Life offers another avenue for accessing financial resources for my patients.  Their grant applications are easy to fill out and their response is extremely fast.  Patients have recieved assistance with the cost of dental care, home IV supplies, and co-payments for medications.  Transplant is expensive and for individuals with even the best insurance, there are gaps and out of pocket expenses.

I have been a part of SCAL since 2001 and it has been nothing but a heart-warming experience.  The positive encouragement/responses received from the social workers and some of the patients that have been helped financially are truly good for one's soul and makes all of the hard work worthwhile.

I am the chairperson for our Bowl-A-Rama and each year we generate more profit so that we can assist more patients that are struggling with the financial burdens that come along with organ transplants.  I am proud to be a board member of this non profit and I talk about it every chance I get.  There are so many people that do not understand how many people can be helped by one organ donor.  A family close to me lost their niece this past summer and made the decision to donate her organs, she was able to save 7 people.  Second Chance At Life helps to make people aware of these facts and sign people up to become organ donors.

Second Chance at Life Inc	89742		/users/profile/102184	Collette Taylor	Donor	5	06/07/2011	After the loss of my son Nicholas in 2008 (20 yrs old) who was an organ donor and helped save 9 lives, I was looking for something to honor his selfless act and memory.  We hold a benefit each year since his passing and wanted to help spread the word of organ donation and help fund recipient costs that they incur.  I came across Second Chance at Life and Shelly Morell through a donor family meeting.  Since that time, I feel I have been given a purpose again in life by holding a benefit auction each year raising money and awareness for Second Chance at Life.  A wonderful organization that helps recipients with the cost of their medications, hospital stays etc.  With this organization you will find that it has been built with love, generosity and hope.  It is an organization I hold very dear to my heart and can never say "thank you" enough for their support and kindness.

I would highly recommend this nonprofit for their dedication to improving the lives of transplant patients.
Arts & Scraps	32704	1	/users/profile/33525	latoniya-4-powerorgmath	Client Served	4	03/08/2010	I have been a fan of Arts and Scraps since returning to Detroit to teach in 2008 and encourage everyone that I know to take a tour. As a Middle Principal, I gave each teacher an allotment to shop at Arts and Scraps. As a nonprofit Founder/Executive Director, this is my first stop for each of our programs. My clients in Columbus, OH have received several of the materials and are planning a trip to Arts and Scraps this Spring to prepare for Summer School as well.Several of our team members have purchased materials for hands-on math activities, Pi Day, and annual conference kits for Metro Detroit youth and families. I had a partnership meeting with Peg to create a variety of math themed kits (for Algebra and Geometry). We were just in Saturday and found materials to create our Pi Day signage for each booth. A huge savings. Printed signs/banners would have cost $40.The staff is very creative and accommodating. If you share your goal with them they will help guide you to materials that will set you on the right path. It is a joy to bring my children (8, 18, and 21) into the store and see their creativity encouraged in both business and play.
Arts & Scraps	32138	4	/users/profile/32938	julieup	Volunteer	5	03/01/2010	Arts & Scraps is constantly adapting and developing new programs to better serve the Detroit area. Their ability to move quickly, focusing staff and volunteer time and resources to a given need has allowed them to create unique programs and much needed services. For example, they saw that it was quite difficult for schools to arrange field trips to the Arts & Scraps location. In response they launched the 'Scrap Mobile' a mobile Arts & Scraps that can travel TO the schools, bringing creative material and workshops to the schools themselves.
Arts & Scraps	31620	10	/users/profile/32485	kysunshine	Board Member	5	02/27/2010	I have enjoyed using Arts and Scraps for a number of years. Beginning my adventure when they were located on East Warren and continuing to the current location on Harper. They have increased in space size and material supplies but the staff size has remained low. Unlike in other industries where the customer might go lacking for service not at Arts and Scraps. They are like "Super Staff and Volunteers" always there to help with a smile on their face. Not only do I buy for myself for craft projects but plan future projects for my church group. In the past I have had them come on site for Union picnics and bought bags of "stuff" when I see them at conferences. I have learned lessons on using recycled materials and thought more about what I throw away. Arts and Scraps has been a fun art and education adventure then is everchanging.

Arts & Scraps also reinforces the importance of Recycling & Reusing products; an important element with every company today, Corporate Sustainability.  They  have  worked tirelessly to exceed their objectives, continue to grow, and strive daily to improve programs as well as expand expand their reach in the community.  I have had the honor of volunteering with their Marketing Committee to plan and execute new programs, as well as improve existing programs.

On several occasions I have taken kits and materials to my children's school and did activities with their classmates.  Everytime I see one of their classmates they ask are we doing a craft today or when are we going to do another one.  Not only does the wonderful materials at Arts & Scraps incite creativity and fun but it allows parents to be active and have fun with their children and others, in the educational process.  It is a proven fact that parental involvement in schools help to produces successful students.  And on top of everything else we are talking about recycling; Arts & Scraps is a win, win!!

The final products are always unique.My chilren come up with projects I never would have thought of using everyday "Scraps" and other materials donated while supporting recycling - which is something important to our family. I'd love to see an "Arts & Scraps" in every city across the nation!
Arts & Scraps	30243	4	/users/profile/31240	detroit-mom	Client Served	4	02/23/2010	As a parent volunteer for my children's elementary school and Girl Scout troop, I utilize Arts & Scraps for many craft making projects.  The materials allow the kids to create art or projects that exist only in their imagination -- it's the ultimate creative process.  The staff is wonderful at offering suggestions and ideas.  I leave the store filled with ideas and all sorts of fun recyclable pieces.  The recycle aspect is such a  topical message today, which makes the art creations all the more meaningful.
Arts & Scraps	27358	2	/users/profile/28413	sumajetskiyahoocom	Client Served	5	02/09/2010	When my kids were young, they loved to have their birthday parties at Arts & Scraps. They loved the freedom that A&S affords them ... recycling and creativity all at once! They were able to make ANYthing they could imagine - even if it always turned out looking like a robot! It was never the same to them. Now that they are teens, A&S is their first choice to volunteer for community service hours - its a no-brainer. We're comfortable there, knowing there are never limits to our imagination.
Arts & Scraps	27077	4	/users/profile/28110	lynnbea	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2010	I absolutely love Arts and Scraps, both the store and the organization.  It's one of those places where I almost hate to pass the word on, because then I'll spoil it for myself.  This is the place I go when I either really am in a rut and need some out of the ordinary materials to inspire me, or the place where I just know I will find the perfect accents or supplies for a low cost.  Digging around the store is a really fun way to pass the time.Aside from the excellent shopping experience, Arts and Scraps does great work in the Detroit area communities.  At a time when arts and creative funding are being cut in schools, and agency like this really help to fill the void in getting our children to use their creative minds and expressions.  I am a social worker in the area, and around the holidays I stocked up on scrap kits for the children of my clients.  Getting to watch them put together a masterpiece while I met with their parents was such a spirit lifter.
Arts & Scraps	27050	2	/users/profile/28085	linda1	Volunteer	5	02/03/2010	Through my volunteer work with Girl Scouts,it has been my pleasure to shop at Arts & Scraps for materials for the girls, donate to them, as well as to bring the girls in for craft sessions with their staff.  My daughters and I have also shopped there for materials just for fun creative time adn for birthday parties.  I have told many, many people about this wonderful resource.  They are excellent community partners, truly embody one of the GS ideals, to "use resources wisely"; and the staff have always been friendly and accomodating in person and on the phone!

Promoting creative recyling to children is the best way to engage them in positive behaviors. Imagine my delight when I visited Arts and Scraps during a session where little ones were having fun creating a personal work of art and recycling at the same time!!!! We need a place like this in every city in the nation. There are lots of materials for just about anything you would like to create, the staff is very helpful if you need just a little direction to complete your project.

I have been involved with the monitoring ever since. I have also worked with the organization through our University of Mich-Flint connections. As the University crosses the river we have a vested intrest in maintaining its beauty and health. The FRWC is a natural partner in our concerns. Their outreach into the community and schools has far reaching effects not to be ignored.

FiftyTwo4Mom	204572		/users/profile/266596	hopkins815	Volunteer	5	06/29/2014	Volunteering for FiftyTwo4Mom has been a privilege and honor. This organization has done many great things for deserving individuals that in some form  been affected by vision loss. Brian has inspired me with his dedication and unconditional love towards his mother, the reason he founded FiftyTwo4Mom. I'm looking forward to see what other mountains we will climb with this outstanding organization.

Brian, the leader of the organization is a total champion for this very worthy cause, and is naturally exquisite at his work.  While the funds raised by FiftyTwo4Mom are extremely helpful to the cause, the message, the positive spirit, and the compassion of the entire team truly make for an unforgettable experience. I'll definitely return to volunteer again, and can't express enough how amazing and well-run the organization makes not only it's benefactors feel, but everyone who comes in contact!

I continue to be amazed at how much Brian does for my group and how much he does for his cause as well.  I am truly inspired by the gift of sight that he provides to people who love to run.  I am in awe of the stories that he shares of runs that he guides across the country.  It takes a special person to do what he does and I feel lucky to have met him and to call him my friend.

FiftyTwo4Mom has helped me to come out of the darkness that I was in when I first started losing my sight.  Because of my son, we have been able to do 5k's together, I am a human book for the local community college, and I get to meet lots of new people and let them know that there is still so much to life, it just takes knowing the right people.  I'm proud that I can take a tragic event and turn it into something positive for others and look forward to doing so much more.
FiftyTwo4Mom	156361	1	/users/profile/207423	MiDogRescuer	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2013	I have followed Brian's journeys for a few years now. What he does is amazing and a gift that not many can provide. He has literally travelled the country to act as a running guide for blind runners, giving them the opportunity to keep running, and to run competetively, even after losing their sight. Running is a passion for some people, and Brian's dedication helps keep the blind from losing something they could no longer do on their own.

The people that I have met over the past 3 years, both visually impaired and those who support the VI community, have amazed me and changed my life.  It has been an honor to be a part of this community.  The 2 things that have been the most amazing were seeing my mom complete her first 5k (she has now done 5) and my first experience as a running guide.  I plan to continue this for many years and look forward to building up these relationships and making new ones.

Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	51221	1	/users/profile/51802	dzanda	Client Served	5	08/28/2010	I graduated from LBC as a pre-medical student in 1976, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology.  Although I had not requested placement services in anticipation of my graduation, I was approached by a major pharmaceutical company who offered me my choice of jobs as a research assistant.  This meant that I had an excellent job BEFORE I had even graduated!  After several successful years, I resumed my plan to attend medical school and subsequently earned my Doctor of Medicine.  I also earned a Masters Degree in Public Health.The bottom line for me is this:  LBC provided me with an excellent educational foundation that openened numerous doors for me, and that has ensured my success in all my professional endeavors.
Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	51056	1	/users/profile/51629	lynne1961	Former Volunteer	5	08/26/2010	My experience at Lyman Briggs laid a strong foundation for everything I do today - professionally and personally.  The ability to interact with like minded students, professors who truly cared what you learned, and staff who were interested in the whole person was an enriching experience.  It was the way Lyman Briggs' focused on balance that has served me so well and in many different ways.  The emphasize on humanities as much as science and the devotion to training a student for a life time of learning continues to motivate me today.  I am not doing anything related to my degree today, yet I credit my 4 years at Briggs with providing me with the tools to do everything I've done these past 26 years.  It is an incredible institution.

Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	51010	2	/users/profile/51554	david-cantor	Client Served	5	08/25/2010	Lyman Briggs College provides a unique experience to science and math undergraduates.  I see several key advantages of the program:1.  As a residential college, Briggs provides a sense of community and support to students who might otherwise be overwhelmed in a large state university.2.  Professors for the Briggs programs are selected because they are truly interested in teaching undergraduates.  So many times a large research universities, undergraduates are treated as a necessary nuisance.  At Briggs, I never felt second class to graduate students or research projects.3.  The Briggs program is designed to encourage science and math majors to broaden their intellectual horizons, and to make room in their class schedules for humanities, social sciences, art, and all of the other wonderful disciplines that highly-focused science majors sometimes miss out on.
Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	50982	1	/users/profile/51523	bob-leininger	Donor	5	08/24/2010	In addition to providing an outstanding education in scientific principles, Lyman Briggs College teaches its students how to actually BE scientists, by requiring that they take courses in the history, logic and philosophy of science.  In 1971 we read Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", fifteen years before Kuhn's concept of "paradigm shifts" came to be used as a teaching tool by the general public. My professor, Dr. Robert Snow, used this "paradigm shift" concept in counselling me to consider other options besides teaching Biology. In 1974 I took his advice, switched gears, and became an environmental lawyer for the newly created U.S. EPA, where I received awards as their lead counsel on the first case ever brought under Superfund and as lead counsel on the largest settlement in the history of U.S. EPA.As a "residential college" within a large university, Lyman Briggs provides a very valuable and unique educational experience.

The academic opportunities are phenomenal. The experiences beyond academics such as human interaction, communication, community awareness, self awareness, and building of self confidence make this environment extraordinary.The personal impact for me was so significant that, when I could share financially, I decided to "pay it forward".  I established an endowed scholarship in Lyman Briggs.
Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	50708	1	/users/profile/51257	kj501c3	Client Served	5	08/19/2010	For students looking at a major in the sciences, LBC is a gem within the broader MSU community.  Although I am a significantly older alumnus, the program has maintained its core since I attended.  That core is to produce critical thinking graduates who have skills beyond their focused area of discipline.  Graduates gain not only a deep knowledge and capability of their "science focus", but also of other important areas such as societal impacts of that science.The broader education I experienced from LBC has been instrumental in my career, by allowing me to operate at a more strategic as opposed to tactical level.More recently, I have provided both formal and informal external advising and am gratified that the program has only gotten better.  Faculty members, while carrying a partial appointment in other departments and carrying on research, continue to be very focused on providing an excellent educational experience to students with classroom teaching, research activities, and student mentoring.
Michigan State University - Lyman Briggs College	50659	5	/users/profile/51194	lexatrex	Volunteer	4	08/18/2010	Lyman Briggs College worked with me to give me a more hands-on and well explained perspective on the connection between science and its impact.  This impact included both scientific advancement through explanation of a crystallized view of atoms, for example, and ethical implications of this advancement. LBC provided an ability to adapt more easily to the college atmosphere by allowing for a smaller environment within Michigan State University where students with scientific academic interests could quickly find a niche within the large university environment.

Charlotte's Wings has grown over these past 9 years with tremendous support from the great community of Rochester and a strong and very dedicated committee of volunteers who work really hard to continue to ensure that every family dealing with loss, illness and hospitals/hospice can find a little comfort from books provided by CW. Not only do they provide books for the library's so the patents and children can escape into a great story together, but provide specialist books requested by different departments to help siblings and family's during the worst of times. Starting 9 years ago with donated gently used books to receiving requests from across the state of Michigan, this wonderful wonderful non profit has made a huge difference to so many family's and to so many of the local community who continue to support such a tremendous idea of one book bringing so much comfort

We often have patients with children in their lives who are impacted by their dying process and their death.  When we can offer relevant books to these families to use with these children, it truly helps with the process of educating and supporting everyone involved.  The families are appreciative of the resources and we are appreciative of being able to offer them at no cost to our agency.  Thank you Charlotte's  Wings!Lisa K.

Charlottes Wings	286308		/users/profile/376403	Lisa537	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	Charlotte's Wings has been incredibly supportive of Beaumont Children's throughout the past several years. They deliver books for children of all ages to read during their stay in the hospital. From board books in the NICU to teen fiction on our Children's Miracle Network Garden, Charlotte's Wings goes above and beyond to make sure every patient we serve in southeastern Michigan has a book in their hands. Jennifer is such a pleasure to work with and we are so very fortunate for all the generosity this incredible organization has brought into the lives of everyone of our patients.  
Charlottes Wings	286307		/users/profile/132659	lnorton	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	Charlotte's Wings has been very supportive of Angela Hospice, providing books and workbooks for the young clients in our grief support and pediatric hospice programs. We are so grateful for their thoughtfulness and generosity as they spread their goodwill throughout the community! 
Charlottes Wings	286300		/users/profile/376397	sbeerens	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	Charlotte's Wings has provided many, many wonderful books to our children's hospital - everything from fun books that encourage kids to read (and take their minds off of medical issues) to grief support books for our pediatric palliative care program.   They even provided a book cart for use by our inpatient reading program volunteers.  We are so appreciative of this organization!
Charlottes Wings	286298		/users/profile/376395	Writer	Client Served	5	04/20/2016	Charlotte's Wings has supported The Rainbow Connection for several years now in the donation of their incredible books. These books are used to at the hospitals when we visit new Wish Children, given to the children to cheer them up, or sometimes there are particular books chosen that deal directly with the child's wish. We are honored to be partnered with this awesome organization - we love Charlotte's Wings!
Charlottes Wings	285590		/users/profile/375594	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	First and foremost in selecting a charity to donate time and money to, I check the ratio of admin to cause dollars.  CW meets this at about 95% of every dollar goes directly to purchasing books. This is outstanding!  Having no paid employees allows them to achieve this, and the minimal admin costs come from routine items 501(c)(3)s must adhere to. Secondly, how far does the organization reach in fulfilling their mission?  CW touches every corner of the state of Michigan and supports children from eating disorders to hospice patients.  I love the diversity!They also do recreation reading options for all levels.  I had the honor of participating in a book delivery to an oncology floor. I watched children put down their "devices" in favor of a book.  Books are not lost!  We tend to go with the easily accessible option  -- and Charlotte's Wings makes books that easily accessible option for children and their families!!Thank you to the many volunteers that make this organization go round!  You prove each md every day that you don't have to be the biggest to be doing some of the best!!!
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	56492		/users/profile/58997	Joel Warner	Volunteer	5	11/08/2010	After 15 years being involved with Special Olympics Michigan I can truely say I have seen lives changed by Special Olympics.  Be it the health screenings offered at state events or the experiences the athletes gain through competition, Special Olympics Michigan is making a BIG difference in the community.  Special Olympics is much more than a track meet or a sporting event!  We bring communities together and foster an attitude of helping each other and acceptance.  Very few things can shift your focus away from yourself and towards others like volunteering for Special Olympics can.  Try it once and you are hooked! Special Olympics Michigan truely is "Changing Lives!"
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	56278		/users/profile/58686	jim ayres	Board Member	5	11/02/2010	I have been involved with Michigan Special Olympics for over 20 years.  My experience with athletes has made my life fulfilling, and constantly reminds me of what is important.  Special Olympics Michigan impacts the lives of thousands of people.  Our athletes learn courage, confidence, and get a sense of accomplishment.  Our volunteers are enriched through helping others in a way that truly improves the lives of others.  The SOMI organization is dedicated to providing outstanding programs for our athletes and rewarding experiences for volunteers.  In a state that is strugging so much with quality of life, Special Olympics reminds us of what is important.  It reinforces the value that we ALL have, and the difference we can make to builds a better community.  
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	56236		/users/profile/58615	yobcmu90	Volunteer	5	11/02/2010	Special Olympics Michigan serves over 18,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities.  The athletes have over 400 opportunities to compete within their area or region of the state.  In addition there are six state level competitions held throughout the year.  Each of these opportunities give the athletes a chance to gain self confidence, experience joy from their success and the success of their teamates and friends.   
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	56080		/users/profile/58365	Volunteer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2010	I have been involved in some aspect of Special Olympics since 1969. I have seen it grow from a small program of a handful of athletes to over 900 athletes. Special Olympics changes lives not just the athletes but the families and volunteers as well. It is exciting to observe families cheering for their sons and daughters just like they cheer for their other children.  In many cases the tears come, because families never thought they would see the day when their son or daughter would be involved in competition like other athletes. The athletes have purpose, build skills, increase social skills and self. confidence, and have a great deal of joy in participating. My joy also comes through participation. It's a win situation for all of us.
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	56014		/users/profile/58293	tinkerbell	Client Served	5	10/30/2010	I am a athlete. when I joined Special Olympics I weighed almost 300lbs and ever since I joined it, I have lost over116+lbs. I went from a D&E student to a A&B student, I graduated in 2007 from high school with honors! 
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	55978		/users/profile/58249	Belinda	Volunteer	5	10/30/2010	I have volunteered for 35 years starting in high school and have been hooked ever since.  I am proud to say I have been a part of the movement.  I went to the first winter games as a college stundent at CMU.  It is amazing to see how far Special Olympics Michigan has grown throughout the years.  We use to borrow equipment now most areas have their own equipment.  Now I work on staff and have a great respect for the talents of our athletes.  We all have disabilities, some show and some don't.  All I can say is if you haven't volunteered for Special Olympics the only one missing out it you!  The athletes give back way more than we can give them in a lifetime.
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	55945		/users/profile/58208	mark6851	Volunteer	5	10/29/2010	26 years I had my "mistake"of saying "do you guys need some help?"...26 years later I am still gladly volunteering for this wonderful organization. The friends that my family has made are lifelong...and the experiences we have shared will be treasured forever.  
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	55944		/users/profile/58207	Barb	Volunteer	5	10/29/2010	I have been volunteering for Special Olympics Michigan for the past 38 years, There  is good cooperation all around. SOMI has made me a stonger, more unified body, and I have grown in my knowledge.  I am particularly impressed with the interaction of the athletes.  
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	54939		/users/profile/56903	Christina M.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2010	My son and I volunteered at the speical olympics for the first time this year. I can say with my whole heart that this was the best volunteer experience that I have ever had and glad that it was my son's first experience in a volunteer role. The staff was wonderful, they took time to talk to all the volunteers, thanked them for their time and made each experience personal. The event itself was great! I was surprized to see how many athletes were out for the event. my son learned a lot about the athletes and even made a couple friends.  This is a great way for these kids to learn about success and failure. It is a great place for kids to play who might not have a fair opportunity to compete in other youth leagues. Wonderful program and wonderful people!! I am very proud to have been part of this event!
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	54936		/users/profile/56896	James T.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2010	Special Olympics is known by the general public as  a sports program for children with intellectual disabilities, but it is so much more. The athletes (both youth and adult) involved with the program experience success and failure, and are able to understand that both are a part of life, and failure today may lead to success in the future. My experience with the atheltes involved in the program is that they bring more to my life than I ever bring to theirs. The joy that everyone br8ings to each Special Olympics event is contagious and should be experienced by everyone at least once in life!
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	54905		/users/profile/56857	stfgraham	Donor	5	10/20/2010	I have been involved in Special Olympics Michigan for about 5 years. I am a proud donor and volunteer. This organization is changing lives each and every day. Each athlete involved in the program is introduced to an amazing athletic experience. In addition, they make new friends, learn new skills, and be a part of something that they can call their own.  Personally, through volunteering, I have learned so much about those with individual disabilities. This is an amazing organization, that touches the hearts of their athletes, volunteers, donors, families, and everyone involved.
Special Olympics Michigan Inc	54898		/users/profile/56849	Lois	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2010	This was shared with me recently by a corporate volunteer...."The very first time I volunteered I looked at it as a chance to get out of work for a day or so. Little did I know the work involved would be exhausting but very rewarding. I returned the following years with a different attitude. Oh I was always tired by the end of the weekend and I always felt rewarded.  I volunteered for a position I have loved for over 15 years. I am a co-coordinator for the volunteers for the track program. Almost always the same volunteers are there every year. They have been bitten by the bug too ! I have been wrapped up in the spirit of the Michigan Special Olympics for about 25 years. There is no comparison to the way one feels after watching, hugging and sharing their excitement with the athletes. They pass onto you the way everyone should feel when they have accomplished something. It is such a joy to see them be so excited when they compete. Most do not care if they are first or last. They just want to do it. The expression on their faces when they finish just melts my heart. When the weekend ends, I am beat, exhausted and just glowing because I know I helped make the athletes feel wonderful and proud. Their families shower them with love and show their pride. That is a winning combination for a lifetime.I have introduced many friends to this program and they return every year.  10/14/10"
Community Care Services	146838		/users/profile/193856	Dr.Johns	General Member of the Public	1	12/17/2012	I have to say, that while CCS intent is honerable, I have a big concern with fake disability people. I'm aware of this as I have many of the clients that report to CCS.  Most of these people would be able to do constructive work and function as normal individuals in society, but there is a big incentive for them to reach for the comfort of a governent disability lifestyle with guraanteed montly support.   I've gained insigt on this though 10 years on the job, working with these folks.  In my opinion, there is no real need for government support in most cases, except for thier continued support which leads to poor health habits, self pitty and a lack of initiative to participate in work activities. Many if not most of these folks allow themselves to self degenerate by use of illicit or abuse of perscription pills. Some have died as a result.  I often see thier lack of initiative carry to a sub normal houshold living condion, poor hygene, cluttered and un-clean surroundings, etc. over time. I feel as though the mental health and disability systems of support are being gammed to receive benefits instead of taking self responsibility to achive a constructive lifestyle.  We need to be honest with our decisions to allow people to receeive a disability for nothing more than an easy lifestyle with ample incentives to continue on the course once they begin to abuse thier well being though durg addiction.  Let's not allow this to happen and if its alrady occured, we need to take steps to return these people to a higher function of living by expecting more from them.  Finally, I feel that we have punished individual achievement though many forms of government support.  If we continue on this track it is at the ruin of our nation.  Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts on this topic.

Community Care Services	129076		/users/profile/174405	AuntK	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	I have had the privilege of working with Community Care Services on both sides. I use to be co-owner of a sweet shop in a park that use to host a basketball event open to the public. The monies raised helped to benefit those in need right here in our own communities.  All volunteers involved in this weekend long event volunteered their time to help always make it a success. The money raised helped to benefit the various services that Community Care Services offer. I also have been on the receiving side of Community Care Services, My sister-n-law passed away leaving her 10 year old son behind, she was a single parent and my nephew was an only child. He stayed with his grandmother for a few weeks and then moved in with our family. He received much needed counseling from staff members at Community Care Services. They did one on one meetings with him, met with my nephew and his grandmother and then also had a session with me and my husband. My nephew is now a senior in high school with plans to go to college after graduation. I know that the counseling he received was a key factor in helping him get through that tough time and transition in his life. He is a good student and well adjusted, doing great! Community Care Services reach out and help those that need help. Regardless of whatever struggles you are facing, they help you to face the challenge. Keep up the good work! Making a difference benefits everyone in the community!
Blue Water Pregnancy Care Center	318717		/users/profile/409981	k24renee	Donor	5	11/11/2016	A few areas that are important to me throughout life include respect and cleanliness.  I would refer anyone needing the services of the Blue Water Pregnancy Center because both females and males will be treated with kindness and respect. Though the BWPCC services are free, I'm impressed with how their staff and volunteers treat people!  The cleanliness of the BWPCC facility also shows that everyone who enters has value and deserves to be respected with a caring and clean environment.

They use a holistic approach understanding one size does not fit all and that important decisions should not be based on impulse, or be made out of fear, confusion or desperation. Growing up, our children hear many things about what a baby will do to their lives -- and much of it is negative -- what their options are, and what they should do. The center lets them know they don't have only one choice and that they are not alone throughout the process. The center understands you cannot change the past, but they're willing to help you find a way forward.

Their support has been critical is helping our organization expand our reach to Holland/Zeeland families of children who have special needs.  We may never know the full impact of the scholarships these children were able to receive for critical therapy.  We know these women operate as an all-volunteer organization and appreciate the amount of work it takes to accomplish all the good work they do for our community.  The HJWL is a wonderful tradition that has touched the lives of many, many children in our community.  Keep doing the good work you do.  We appreciate you!

Junior Welfare League of Holland Mich	284850	1	/users/profile/374906	Writer	Client Served	5	04/06/2016	The Holland Junior Welfare League has been making a huge difference in the quality of life for kids in the greater Holland area for many years.  They have a grant process that involves not only written applications but personal interviews and they do a great job checking up on programs before they fund them so  funds from the HJWL only go to quality programs that are well run and making a difference in the community.  All funds from the League are used as direct service to others.  Programs cannot use the HJWL funds for administrative costs, only direct client needs so again, the dollars donated to the HJWL go directly to impact the community.  
Jwatt Foundation Inc	270405		/users/profile/359122	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	I had the pleasure of working with this foundation when it offered a mentoring program to students in middle school. I was surprised at the dedication and commitment this foundation afforded these students. They provided all the help and tools that was needed to supply the help where it was needed. We helped students that had a below average reading grade to get up to par so they could compete with other students. It is a known that if a student can read and comprehend what they are reading the battle is halfway won. Watt foundation spared no expenses when it came to helping our students. At the end of the school year all of our students reading grade scores improved.

Jwatt Foundation Inc	253429		/users/profile/341619	djd6797	Client Served	5	08/19/2015	     While initially interested in the organization as a means to gain scholarships for school, I quickly realized that JWATT was so much more than that. From the very first meeting, It became apparent the amount of time and dedication the JWATT staff put into developing each of our activities and lectures. Seeing as how the participants were all graduating seniors, the organization made it a point to design each lesson around certain general ideas and concepts that would become increasingly more prevalent to us as we began our transition to adulthood. Of course, many of the topics involved financial literacy, money management, goal setting, career development, and many other typical concepts that one would be expected to learn from such an organization.       However, what makes JWATT stand out is the group's willingness to go out and expose us to a broader range of social concepts that most other organizations wouldn't dare to incorporate. Such concepts include social bias, injustice, poverty, and the various dangers of collegiate life that are rarely if ever discussed in a formal setting. To help expose us to these concepts, JWATT designed a variety of community service projects and other activities. Some events included visits to Gleaners Food Drive, the Ronald McDonald House, and the Christian Guidance Rehabilitation Center.  By making it a point to incorporate these activities, JWATT was able to express the importance of pursuing our ambitions while working hard to help promote the betterment of society as a whole. My most memorable session from the program was the "Real Talk 101" panel where we had a group of guest speakers come and talk to us about their experiences as well as to impart meaningful wisdom and truly inspirational words of encouragement.      Through the efforts of the organization, I can honestly say that I have experienced exponential growth as an individual, as well as developed a better sense of community awareness. All the connections I have built through JWATT have become invaluable to me and I would highly recommend the JWATT organization and their program to any and everyone. 
Jwatt Foundation Inc	252897		/users/profile/341027	Matthew.Alexander	Volunteer	5	08/13/2015	JWATT is a phenomenal nonprofit organization.

Goodwill Industries of West Michigan, Inc.	138200		/users/profile/184247	Susan Carlson	Donor	5	11/13/2012	Several times per year I clean out closets, drawers, rooms and decorating items ready for a change and as soon as I empty my trunk I go right into the store looking for other buried treasure. I  love Goodwill because it is not just a store it is a means to an end. It helps others with training and job placement. How many of us go to Unemployment office to get put on a list and never hear from them again. Or have put in job applications and never called again. The staff are always friendly and wiling to help you unload your car with a hand out and a thanks for donating to Goodwill. Also you can get a tax deduction. Cant get much better than that.  It is more than a store go check it out. Never know what can be on the next rack.

This experience has truly opened my eyes to the great mission-driven work carried out by the organization. It is a privilege to participate on a board with unmatched intellectual horsepower, diversity and hypercompetent senior leadership. GIWM is not only a strong advocate for individuals faced with disabilities and other barriers to employment, but also an economic solution and often underrated "job creator" that deserves recognition during a time of slow economic recovery at local, state and national levels.

The personal success stories in Goodwills annual report are amazing, and demonstrate that the organizations motto of giving  a hand up, not a hand out, truly changes peoples lives. Goodwill is also a great place to shop, where I can not only find fantastic deals, but also feel good about where my money is going.

I know that the money received in the stores through sales helps fund the many programs through Goodwill and they are a non-profit that truly follows their mission statement.   I also have boughten items through Goodwill, sometimes a work shirt or childrens clothing, items for halloween costumes, etc.   When we clean out our closets we donate to Goodwill.
Goodwill Industries of West Michigan, Inc.	129666		/users/profile/175057	valuescommunity1	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2012	I had always seen Goodwill as just a place to shop for cheap, gently used clothing, until I found out what they really did. The fact that Goodwill helps those with disabilities and others struggling for work find jobs, really surprised me. Particularly in Muskegon County, people are struggling for jobs, and with a large number of those people coming from the jail and prison systems, the fact that Goodwill takes time to train these people and give them useful, meaningful jobs is inspiring. Goodwill's goal to help those with disabilities learn new skills is not only helpful for those individuals, but our society as a whole. More people with jobs equals a better community. 
Methodist Children's Home Society	314771		/users/profile/406121	Munzy	General Member of the Public	1	10/26/2016	Before Labor Day 2016, a large group of women took a tour through the Methodist Children's Home in Detroit.(MCHS) What we saw was no sign of any activity. The girls buildings were empty and"used for donations". The largest building was locked and used for staff offices,an empty gym, and a kitchen that was not being used even though it was near lunch time. The " school" building had no black board,pencils,paper,or books,and two out dated computers in one corner. The guide unlocked one boys building where we glanced at an empty kitchen and living room. When asked where the boys were she said "they were in their rooms playing games on their computers."  It was a beautiful day, but never did we see a child playing games, basketball,riding a bike,and enjoying outdoor activities. Viewing no children at that moment was quite shocking. Our large group of women observed zero kids activities during the whole tour. REALLY??? Most of us became alarmed at this time because before the tour began, the CEO informed us proudly," that 42 boys were living there."                                                      After reviewing the MCHS  2015 Annual Report, we almost became physically sick with deep concern.  With a revenue of almost 8 million dollars and expenditures of that exact amount, we believe there is an immense problem with the entire operation. It's just so sad and unacceptable.

When demanded answers from executive staff, no response. Staff admits " you are right it shouldn't be this way!!!" but State of Michigan cps/dhhs keeps placing children here?  Known health department violations since 2014. Board members, volunteers,  donors should be concerned as to where the money is going. Obliviously not into maintenance. Direct staff has excuses for all questions. "Your right it shouldn't be this way!"  "I'm looking for a new job!"  "I just started" Poor vulnerable children live in these horrific unsafe conditions.   Three weeks later its still the same, biological matter in floors, drapes, carpet, mattresses, walls, mold in bathroom, debris in return registers, heat registers with sharp sheet metal exposed. It smells.  Food prep kitchen has food all over walls and ceiling. Profanity on doors and walls. Each room was destroyed and littered with children's clothing& debris if a fire was to happen at night the children may not get out safely ...but they clean daily? What i do know is Animals shelters, prisons,  college dorms are better kept.  I am so sad our government and this Christian org thinks this is acceptable!  The 72 acres is the best thing about this nonprofit. Suggestion shut this place down, demand policies, visit cottages of your choice, question random children. Seems kids run wild and have no structure.

Utimately, to help them in a variety of ways as they prepare to transition into college/workforce (e.g. educational tutoring, career planning/development, building on confidence/self esteem, etc.).

I've done every possible  job there could be as a volunteer, from collecting dresses from generous brides to modeling them for photos and fashion shows for EGD dress drives.  The work is hard and time consuming but its also rewarding and fun.  Times are tough and a lot of people are having to make tough decisions with regards to their finances. When it comes to feeding your family or having the perfect wedding dress the choice is clear but it is also difficult. Thanks to EGD, women across our community arent being forced to let go of their dream of their perfect wedding.  EVERY woman deserves to be beautiful on her wedding day... and EGD makes that possible.  When a woman steps into a wedding gown she transforms. Shes not just a mother or a sister or a daughter anymore... she is a bride... Gods compliment to a man... someones future life mate.  I have volunteered with EGD since the very beginning and I can tell you from multiple experiences that nothing makes me feel better or more apart of our community when a bride in need steps in front of the mirror and cries tears of joy at having found her perfect gown.

This nonprofit provided her with a fully decorated hall, free photographer, 6 volunteers to serve and sit people. They were so professional and giving that I could not believe that they turned a VFW hall into a beautiful banquet hall. This bride had no clue that they would provide everything for her. You can read her story and the pictures of her wedding is on there website. www.everygirlsdream.org "event page".

Very organized with ten models wearing beautiful donated wedding gowns. They also had a male model that wore a donated tuxedo from The Men's Warehouse. I helped the models change into there dresses. Darlene is a very loving and giving person along with her staff. They have hundreds of wedding gowns to give for free to low income brides in need. I have never in my life heard of an organization that would give you a beautiful free wedding gown. I wish that they can get the support they need because this is truly a wonderful organization. It solidifies families and help us as women want to get married. I personally post-poned my wedding because I could not afford a wedding gown for my special day. They helped me to fill and look as beautiful for my special day as any other woman that could afford a wedding gown. Thank You so so much Every Girls Dream.
Just Speak Incorporated	118252		/users/profile/160827	magicgigglesandlove	Volunteer	5	07/12/2012	I had the opportunity to assist the CEO in her mentoring project. The dedication she demonstrated in working out family issues, driving far distances, taking the mentee to places they'd never been, and using her available resources to solve pre-existing issues was remarkable.  Each time I watch her interact with someone who has experience abuse or neglect, she is listening actively and intently.  Her creativity, energy and dedication demonstrate the unparalleled commitment she has in changing societal views on addressing abuse.

On the day of the event, we met for the first time, she introduced me to Brittni, and she proceeded to tell me of Just Speak.  I became more and more interested in the mission of the organization.  Subsequent conversations with Brittni and Barbara led me to further understand and embrace the goal of Just Speak.   Barbara and Brittni are both true testaments of survivors.  Their persistence, energy, and diligence are hallmarks to the cause of Just Speak.  Brittni's courage translates into a passion of increasing intolerance of child sexual abuse -- the platform of Just Speak.

Weather it is for emergency food boxes for the Holidays or just to get them through the week, people are treated with care and respect. All of the CRNC staff as well as the volunteers look for the resources to meet the needs of the families in need. In addition, the trainings that CRNC provides meet the State Mandates set for child care providers at a affordable rate. Providers also appreciate that trainings are scheduled for their convienience.

From selling baked goods, cookie dough, wreaths, etc. the challenge of having enough funds has been great. But when there are funds of any amount they are stretched as far as possible to serve as many as possible.I have been involved with a number of non-profits over the years, but this one has done the most with the least. The staff is beyond dedicated and that is why services have been so valuable to so many.

They have been an outstanding member of the community by helping children and feeding their families when they are in need.  CRNC has visited sites for migrant workers in Lenawee and Monroe counties.  Migrant workers and their families were served nutritious meals on a daily basis.   I am proud to have been able to help with Children's Resource Network Center's projects.  It makes you feel good when you can help another human being.  More organizations should give so selflessly.  Often, the workers of CRNC perform their jobs after-hours and on weekends.  I have seen such hard working people at this non-profit.  They are truly a wonderful group of people!
Children's Resource Network Center	86414		/users/profile/96731	Yvette Miracle	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	     What can I say.... I have known about Drema and Children's Resource Network Center for about 10 years. I was first introduced to this wonderful organization while I was employed at "another non-profit". The two agencies partnered on a few projects, I participated with some of their training events and grew to learn the mission and the genuine concerns for the children and their families from the people involved with CRNC.      I wanted to become a part of this organization because I have never met anyone so dedicated to the feeding needs of hungry children as Drema Raupp. Although I was employed with another agency, I did what I could, on my own time, for CRNC.     In 2009 I found myself in the same perdicament as many folks living in Southeastern Michigan, I was laid off! Because of the economy, the agency I worked for was down-sizing. I filed for Unemployment, put out my resume' and found I had nothing to fill the time that formerly time spent at my job.     One day I decided to "stop in" and say "Hello". Everyone was busy planning and preparing for a conference, the next thing I knew I was sitting in front of a computer, helping out with a flyer and being asked for my input and ideas, and oh yes, "could I spare some time tomorrow", and the rest, as they say, is history! That was almost 2 years ago, and I'm still helping out as a volunteer. 
Children's Resource Network Center	86387		/users/profile/96701	Melissa R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/19/2011	I have seen the members of Children's Resource Network Center in action.  Each person affiliated with this organization is dedicated and selfless.  They all do their work, sometimes without pay, because they know that there are people who need help, especially who are in need of food.  They spend countless hours making sure that food is prepared and delivered to every site.  CRNC members have gone through personal struggles (family members dealing with cancer, CRNC members going through chemotherapy sessions, nursing spouses who have cancer, etc.) but have never closed its doors on the people and children they serve.   The members work as a close-knit family.  Serving children and their families is a passion of every member of CRNC.  It's amazing to watch them in action!

Creative Change Educational Solutions, Inc.	52896		/users/profile/53931	sharisau	Board Member	5	09/20/2010	I was recently asked to join the board of CCES. I am honored to serve in this capacity for an organization that is doing critical work in field of education. CCES addresses in a concrete and substantive way the pressing question, How do we engage students and teachers in meaningful work? Many teacher educators, teachers and students want to be engaged in work that is intellectually challenging, personally relevant, and applicable to the real world. For teacher educators and teachers it can be a challenge to negotiate the tensions between engaging students in meaningful work and meeting the expectations of state and national policies. CCES provides curriculum materials and program professional development packages that facilitate teachers context specific efforts to make and sustain meaningful curricular and pedagogical changes. What is particularly exciting about the work is that it isnt a canned program that is imposed on teachers. Teachers are expected to actively draw from their own knowledge and skill base to work with the materials to create something that is workable in their particular context. This approach shows a respect for teachers as knowledgeable and skilled professionals who can create amazing opportunities for students when they have access to quality materials and professional development. Students also benefit because these materials focus on deep understanding. Students learn that academic disciplines are interconnected through working on topics that are interdisciplinary. They also come to understand real world problems and how to think through possible solutions to them. Susan Santones passion for this work is contagious, and I look forward to seeing the work of CCES become more broadly embraced by educators across the nation.

Not only did Susan Santone deliver high quality professional development to our teachers in sustainable education, she came along for the ride with the teachers and students. She was available for consultation with teachers, she worked directly in classrooms, and she provided materials and information that was cutting edge for us. Susan also introduced the Human Rights and Intercultural Communication class at our high school. This program was written in conjunction with the United Nations Global Teaching and Learning Project. Our high school was the only only one in the country to pilot this program. The teachers involved were amazed at the high quality of materials and lessons. The students in our very diverse high school (over 30 different languages and over 50% poverty)learned about human rights and became able to problem solve many of the school's tough issues in the classroom. All this through a non-profit organization that cares about students, teachers, and the sustainable education so relevant to our troubled environment. I would urge anyone that cares about the environment and can reach our young students to learn more about Creative Changes Educational Solutions, Inc. and Susan Santone. She is one of the most passionate people I know when it comes to making changes in education . She was tireless when working with us to make sure teachers and students had the information that would change their thinking and inform their lives.

All in all, they are dedicated group with high standards and great passion for education.
Creative Change Educational Solutions, Inc.	52343		/users/profile/53238	sastrakh	Client Served	5	09/14/2010	Creative Change is one of the few educational non-profits that seeks to promote sustainability and global citizenship across content areas.  Although many claim to assist schools and provide alternative education programs that promote philanthropic values, their implementation can sometimes be limited to certain content areas.  (i.e. science and elementary education)  This inadvertently ignores other subjects that be equally as beneficial in the learning process.  What Creative Change offers are K-12 solutions that dont limit themselves to standard content areas, but offer programs across the public school curriculum for every teacher in every content.  As a Spanish teacher I have come to greatly appreciate  this source of information and ideas when it comes to making more substantial, relatable and applicable curriculum that teaches values as well as the language.  I recently came back from a conference regarding the promotion of greenin the classroom and their ideas seemed to only be breaking the surface.  They said for a Spanish classroom a nature hike while identifying leaf colors could be a great way to accomplish this and practice vocabiulary.  Although this can be engaging, I dont think it`s as substantial as the one I modified from the Creative Change website involving recycling posters. During my unit on Spain we discussed Spains amazing contribution to alternative energy and some of the ways the country is being innovative with wind energy.  We discussed the irony of this with the Don Quixote story and went on to make our own posters promoting renewable energy.  Many kids enjoyed it and expressed their interest in holding on to their posters.

That was when I chanced upon 4 His Glory Ministries. I started volunteering with them from May of this year. The one thing that really struck me about 4 His Glory Ministries was their unselfish dedication to help homeless and needy families. While people go half way across the globe to dedicate their time, knowledge and skills they forget that there may be a child or family living right next door that might need their help. 4 His Glory Ministries have done just that. They have turned to give back to their own community. Deeply spiritual, apart from providing financial assistance to the needy, the organization even offers higher learning opportunities to young people in their community through their program on television production thereby giving these children a launch pad to more meaningful lives and livelihood.Knowing that I am helping people create a lasting and meaningful impact on the lives of the needy is most rewarding.

During the last six years I've witnessed the many of people 4 His Glory Ministries has helped. Spiritually, mentally. emotionally, financially and physically are among some of the ways they have given back to the community. No matter how little they have they always make it a priority to help someone in need. I have seen the founders of 4 His Glory Ministries give their absolute last to help the homeless and others in need. I have seen them help people by giving money, hotel vouchers, food, clothing, consultation, and a kind word of encouragement. I have also seen them give a tremendous amount of advice through their many media outlets (Youth Unlimited Show, G- TV, stage plays, a short film, newspapers, magazines, youth empowerment events, websites, books, and so much more.) They have also provided a lot of awareness to the youth. 4 His Glory has consulted many youth spiritually and mentally who were in need of guidance. 4 His Glory has made it a priority to give back to the community in many different aspects. They maintained a 4 year television show geared just towards the youth called the Youth Unlimited Show. Now if thats not commitment then I don't know what is. From my own personal experience 4 His Glory Ministries has made such a positive impact on my life not only spiritually but mentally, emotionally and financially. There has been many times where the founder has given me advice to help me get through a situation. Sometimes all we need is a positive word and guidance to help us along the way. When I first started to pursue broadcasting and enhanced my spiritual growth, 4 His Glory Ministries took me in and allowed me to become apart of their ministry. That was such a Blessing that I am forever thankful for. I was able to co-produce the Youth Unlimited and G-TV show and I assisted in all of the other projects as well.  I was also able to guest host the Youth Unlimited Show. Words can't describe how much this ministry has done for me therefore I am thankful!

Almost Home Animal Rescue League	318989		/users/profile/410316	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/16/2016	Having worked at Almost Home is so gratifying!  I love spending time with the animals, and if not for Almost Home these adorable dogs and cats would be suffering on the streets (homeless), beaten by their owners or used for bait, attacking residents pets, running rapid with rabies/diseases or worse. Almost Home took over the dog pound for Southfield in which 80% of the animals turned in were put to their death. The city turned it over to Almost Home because they are a No-Kill shelter and believes strongly in stopping Euthanasia. Almost Home makes the best of what they can with what they are given. They have not had any new renovations from the city, and It is not a new building in fact the city needs to give the animals new cages and fix the place up because Almost Home saves them so much money a year.  The employees are so passionate about their jobs, and care deeply about the animals truly amazing! The money Almost Home spends is astronomical on each animal, and they ask for just a small adoption fee. People who complain or have only worked a day or a couple days of rescue has NO clue how much work goes into maintaining an animal shelter and is not a valid source. In my opinion and many others, It is despicable to try and bring down a wonderful organization who does such great work! Almost Home is very particular with where the animals go to ensure they don't get passed around or worse put to sleep due to negligence.  I look at some of these reviews and it makes me sick to my stomach of the immaturity of these people who lack any intellectual intelligence of why Almost Home is there. Again, the animals would all be put to sleep if they left, I guess people are selfish and simply do not care. I see most the complaints are from prior employees who worked there for less then a week, and couldn't handle the work, or adopters who were not approved. I look at it this way if I got service I wasn't happy about, you bet I would write a negative review...WHY? most the people who love Almost Home and have been a part of rescue for years don't write GOOD reviews. Reviews are mainly for people who love to complain or feel the need to hurt others. It really saddens me how people can abuse people, and they are as bad as the people who abuses these helpless animals. Take it from me check out Almost Home, and meet all the wonderful staff, make your own mind up and you will be so happy you did!  Being a part of Rescue is a very difficult job, one that most rescuers give up there lives for. The biggest challenge I bet is working with the public and having to let people down for all the right reasons. Almost Home does not want to be liable if an animal bites someones kids, and can you blame them? All these animals they save, are so grateful for the wonderful volunteers like myself, and the staff who cares for them until their ready for there new homes.  Almost Home receives absolutely NO funding at all from the city or the government. They ask the community for donations so they can continue to do what they do best and that is SAVING LIVES. What are you doing to make a difference?  I recommend volunteering for once and see how much work goes into maintaining and running a facility, and try screening applications, and assessing the animals and deciding on homes. Try not to cry when you see sick and injured pets being surrendered, but you know what....Someone has to do it!!  We all cry, and we all have feelings. It's time to think about the people who run this facility and see all the hard work they do to save them. Thank goodness for Organizations like Almost Home. A true No-Kill Animal Rescue! Visit them today and adopt your new furry friend! Make a difference by donating, volunteering, fostering, and of course adopting!
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	318807	1	/users/profile/410075	Natasha19	General Member of the Public	1	11/12/2016	This has been the absolute worst experience with a shelter.  Despite being interested in 3 dogs, submitting 2 applications, 1 meeting in the office, and attending an off-site adoption event I am still without a new dog.This past Tuesday I went into the office to meet with a dog (Griffy) I had seen online.  I fell in love with him and it was suggested by an office volunteer that I come back the next day with my current dog to make sure that the 2 dogs would get along.  A note was also left for the manager to give me a call the next day as she was not in, no return call was ever received so I called to inquire regarding the process.  I was not allowed to speak with the manager but was told that Griffy had received 15 applications and they were being reviewed to find the best home.  I was also told that there was no need for me to waste my time bringing my current dog in until I knew whether my application was chosen.....I accepted that because every shelter has a process however on Saturday when I was planning to drop by the shelter again so they could see my face and know I was serious I became aware that Griffy was going to be in attendance at an off-site adoption event (whatever happened to those 15 fathom applications).  I packed up my sons and my dog and we headed to the event to get our dog.  We arrived early to make sure no one would claim him first.  Once my application was pulled the manager and another one of the workers huddled in the corner whispering presumably about my app.  When the ladies came over they rattled off a list of questions, all of which were included on the 90 question application that I had ALREADY filled out.  I successfully answered all of their questions (who lives in the home, is the yard fenced, where will the dog stay and sleep, etc.) and having no legitimate reason to deny me I was NOW told that Griffy was previously abused, viciously bites and cannot be adopted to a home with children.  This information was not relayed on FB, the shelter website, in previous conversation with staff, or on his paperwork at the adoption event NOR did he attempt to bite me, my children, or my boyfriend on the 2 occasions that I had played with him.  It is my opinion that for whatever reason the shelter is not interested in adopting to ME.  They tell me my application is great, they even sent me that in writing, but when I pick out a dog I'm told NO.  Not to mention that the staff is uninformed and depending on who you talk to you will get a different answer.   The process is extremely confusing and convoluted.  And it seems that the process varies depending on who you are and whether they personally like you or not---for some the process can be completed in a day and for others it is far longer.  I would highly suggested that you seek a furry friend elsewhere because it doesn't seem like this shelter is interested in finding homes for these animals but rather they get a kick out of giving families the runaround and breaking hearts.

Marla and her crew took good care of her and I can't thank them enough. They are a very caring group and make the animals feel safe and loved. Thank you again. I would highly recommend them . It's Almost Home Rescue off of Franklyn Rd. In Southfield. Fondly Eileen Rosenbaum. 
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	281064	2	/users/profile/371078	qtpatootey23	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2016	I have worked at the shelter over 2 years and volunteered for a year and been part of this incredible Non profit organization for over 15 years. Almost Home goes above and beyond for these animals. They spend thousands of dollars on one animal and the adoption fee is a few hundred dollars which doesn't cover any of the medical done on the animal or the amount of money they spend on paying staff to care for the pets. There philosophy is that every life is precious no matter the age or breed. They take in animals off the streets, from animal control, high kill shelters, and owner surrenders.  They do so much to ensure each and every animal is safe and happy until they find there forever homes. I have also adopted my dog Chico and a cat named Muffins. I would highly reccomend this organization for anyone looking for a dog or cat. They are incredible people who has sacrificed so much to do something so great and make a significant difference in the world. I feel so privledged to be a part of something bigger. If it was not for Almost Home over 80% of these animals would be put to death. Thank you Almost Home for all you do and continuing to look out for these abused, neglected, and mistreated animals and giving them a second chance!

Almost Home Animal Rescue League	273890		/users/profile/363187	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/07/2015	Almost Home is the best shelter in Michigan! there is no place like this organization! they save countless dogs and cats from a far worse fate, and is 100% Never Kill. They are the only the shelter in Michigan who does not euthanize and cares so much about the animals! A lot of disgruntle past volunteers or ex employees may write reviews that are simply far from the truth. And it is really sad how people get mad and like to try and hurt places that are putting their hearts and sole into a No-Kill movement. It only hurts the animals. The dogs and cats have the very best care and the medical expenses are astronomical. You can go online and see for yourself the adoption statistics 98% Adoption Rates the other 2% is euthanasia due to no quality of life which is determined by a veterinarian, or they still have the dog/cat. Their is no shelter like Almost Home who will spend whatever it takes to make an animal better. If a staff or volunteer is not doing their jobs, and it is not working out just like any other business it's best we part ways for improvement of the morale. I think everyone should volunteer at a high kill shelter, where they put down healthy animals simply because they can. Then volunteer at a shelter like Almost Home where every life matters including people. Almost Home is an incredible organization, who cares deeply about the animals including placement. If your looking to adopt your next pet, adopt at Almost Home Animal Shelter.
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	166164	3	/users/profile/220747	love_animals	Volunteer	5	08/26/2013	This is a wonderful organization that has a 100% no-kill mission. They do so much with so little and only have the best interest of animals in mind. They have finally found a trainer willing to work with their long-term animals to help rehabiliate them to an adoptible status. I have seen first hand animals who had been there for a long time, animals that everyone else would have euthanized, who are now thriving in loving homes. It can be a slow process for some of the animals but with patience it works and they've proven that time and again. 
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	164256	7	/users/profile/218280	PitbullLover	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/05/2013	This rescue is not responsible in many ways. Animal care is very low on their list of priorities.  They have hired a sexual offender, Christopher Henry, to run the shelter and he has no dog experience, and very little compassion. Dogs are locked up 23 hours a day.   Founders take ridiculous salaries for spending no time at the shelter and not working harder to get long term residents out. Oh yea, if you speak up or help, you'll be banned or have defamation lawsuits filed against you. Stay away, they are power hungry and don't know anything about their animals.   They pull dogs from Ohio for a quick buck and these animals always come with fleas, mange, or other more serious issues.
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	142907	9	/users/profile/173547	Anonymous12121	General Member of the Public	1	11/26/2012	I adopted my dog from almost home. Although my dog was with them over a year, none of his behavior problems were ever disclosed to me at or before the adoption. They downplayed his problems, by saying , "oh he just doesn't like men" when they should have disclosed he had history of biting and EXTREME aggression with men.  Why did they adopt out this dog? probably because he was truly an unadoptable dog and that conflicts with thier no kill mission.
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	126225	2	/users/profile/138606	Denise14	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Almost Home Animal Rescue League is a nonprofit organization which is dedicated to finding homes for all homeless animals.  It is amazing to see how they manage to find adoptive homes for each special animal that they rescue from other places where the animals might not be so lucky because they would be killed. There are so many dedicated volunteers who not only take care of the animals that are sheltered there until they find their new "forever home" but they also are involved in important fundraising efforts to help cover the costs  of necessary medical procedures in addition to providing for the animals' basic needs.
Almost Home Animal Rescue League	88597	10	/users/profile/99880	Maggie4	Client Served	3	05/11/2011	I adopted my dog from Almost Home and am so very thankful for their work as there are never enough people or organizations to help all of the homeless animals in need.   I contribute to animal welfare causes on a regular basis and unfortunately  I chose to bypass this organization in regards to financial support due to the following observations:  1.   The shelter environment was crowded and chaotic. It was difficult to determine who was in charge (which can be perfectly understandable in this type of organization). 2.   I was allowed to foster and then adopt my dog unaltered, with only a contract to spay,  which I feel is unacceptable knowing of the serious overpopulation  problem.   (I was a responsible adopter and did the right thing but I don't think it shows enough of an effort on their part.)3.   Their no-kill philosophy sounds wonderful, and is certainly something to strive for,  but unfortunately they house many animals with what I would classify as serious behavior problems, etc.  for very long periods of time in a stressful facility. 4.  They have a beautiful website and are registered as a 501(c)3 but beyond information about the founder, there is a lack of transparency about who the board of directors is, etc.  Upon questioning various volunteers I learned that their board of directors are all family members,  some of which are paid salaries.  (This was the biggest red flag to me even though it could be perfectly innocent).

They provide useful resources for teachers, educators, researchers, and activists. The fellowship in human-animal studies they sponsor at Wesleyan University is a unique opportunity for researchers around the world to spend two months researching, writing and learning from other international scholars on animal-related issues.

Animals & Society Institute	311317	1	/users/profile/402658	Writer	Board Member	5	10/17/2016	I've been both a board and staff member of the Animals and Society Institute for more than 10 years, and am currently on the board.   I want to share a story about Andrea, who was a sophomore in college when she became involved in ASI by starting a student group.  We got to know each other and one day several years ago, she asked me to meet her for coffee near campus. She couldn't wait to tell me some news. She'd met with her advisor and been able to create a special program. Essentially, she told me, she'd be able to graduate with a human-animal studies major, by putting together courses from various disciplines, all of them focused on human-animal relationships.  ASI was a huge influence, Andrea said.  "When I came to college, I knew I wanted to work with animals. But I thought my only option was to become a veterinarian. I wasn't sure that was for me. But ASI opened my eyes to the possibilities for students who want to study  our relationships with animals. Thanks to ASI, not only did I learn about the field of HAS, but you provided me with resources to convince the college administration that my concentration was a viable and credible academic program."

Im so pleased to read about the ever growing number of courses at the graduate and undergraduate level that investigate, analyze, and offer new ways of thinking and speaking about our complex relationships with animals within diverse fields of study. As HAS students graduate and enter careers, they will bring with them their insights, understandings and greater compassion for the intricacies and subtleties of the many positive and negative relationships between people and animals to society and its institutions. I look forward to learning more about ASIs other programs. I really appreciate that ASI is focused upon helping both animals and people to create more compassionate communities.

Diapers are almost impossible to come by in Detroit and the diapers we receive from DADB have been a huge support for our clients. Hundreds of our clients have benifited from this wonderful organization and we couldn't be more appreciative of the work they do. On an administrative level, they have been a wonder to communicate with and have been more than willing to help our organization with the logistics of distribution.

Through workshops, daily tasks, and a great office atmosphere I have really grown at this organization. The complex issue of homelessness is one that was always interesting to me but I didn't know where and how to begin helping. The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness has given me extraordinary opportunities to educate myself and those around me on this important issue!
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	137336		/users/profile/183305	ECHO Enterprises	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2012	The issue of homelessness is a very complicated one and because of its complexity it has a myriad of human service agencies and not-for-profit organizations that are working on behalf of various population segments.  It's extremely important to have a collective voice that will seek to enhance homeless services and, more importantly, seek to end homelessness altogether.  MCAH is unique in it role and mission and the state is well-served by its efforts.
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	136277		/users/profile/182189	Daniel Tamsen	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	Although my time with Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness (MCAH) has been short lived, the experiences I have gained while volunteering have been rewarding.  The amount of teamwork that is produced from this agency is incredible, and effective in raising awareness for local homelessness around our state of Michigan.  The MCAH program seeks to provide support and guidance to those who need it, and as a result, the gratitude is well-reflected among the staff and team members.  I look forward to the future MCAH has, and the ability the agency has to change the face of homelessness in our own state; and I am honored to have been a part of it. 
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	136227		/users/profile/182138	chucks	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2012	The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness (MCAH) has achieved statewide recognition for its advocacy role in support of the Michigan statewide campaign to end homeless.  MCAH is also recognized across the state, and nationally, for its implementation of the Michigan Statewide Homeless Management Information System (MSHMIS).  I have worked in the human services field, in various capacities, for 36 years and have begun my fifth year as part of the MCAH professional team.  I see, on a daily basis, the dedication to informing policy and budget priority decisions, in the advocacy realm, and providing capable MSHMIS support to every county and region in Michigan.  Through these efforts, there is much greater awareness of the nature and extent of homelessness in Michigan and local communities are better equipped to help homeless persons acquire stable housing and become productive citizens. I fondly think of our organization as the "A Team."
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	136188		/users/profile/182094	Harold M.	Board Member	5	11/09/2012	I've been a Board member of the Michigan Coalition against Homelessness for the past six or more years.  I worked as Executive Director of a non-profit development organization for affordable, permanent, and supportive housing of homeless individuals and families with disabilities for the past ten years. I have found the Coalition very helpful since it quantifies the issue of homelessness in our State, and has become very effective at working with community organizations in addressing ten year plans to end homelessness in our state.  I have been happy with Coalition's ability to seek and work within partnerships in accomplishing this very important work.  It is one of the most efficient organizations I have had the pleasure of working with in my 30 years of non-profit organization administration.

In the time I've been here, I can see that all of the staff are compassionate toward the needs of homeless individuals. Most of the staff have the only complaint that they wish they could do more. MCAH is a wonderful organization that promotes homeless advocacy and awareness through several programs and its efforts through the Michigan Statewide Homeless Management Information System. With such a great group of people, I wouldn't want to work anywhere else!

Their involvement in providing grants to local counties through Project Homeless Connects has not only raised more awareness in local communities, but raised awareness statewide. The MCAH AmeriCorp program seeks out to help directly serve the homeless population as well as increase volunteerism for this population. 
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	135568		/users/profile/181444	ryansamu	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	My time at the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness (MCAH) has been very rewarding.  Beginning with my first day I immediately felt welcomed by the helpful staff.  Within no time I was immersed within the issue area of homelessness, constantly learning and at every turn, being supported by staff members and my supervisor.  Frequent connections with the Executive Director always kept me on track and reassured that my work was meeting expectations.  I was always encouraged to give my full disgression on issues, insuring that my work had a real impact.  This all attributed to the high level of professionalism in my first office experience, helping me develop new and applicable skills for the future.  My experiences at MCAH greatly affected me and my outlook, overall leaving a very positive impact.
Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness	135530		/users/profile/181404	Kelly Lennon	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness (MCAH) is a wonderful place to volunteer. I felt as though I was part of a supportive team with the staff members, and that we were all working towards the common goal of preventing and advocating for homelessness. My experiences at MCAH were very fruitful, and I appreciated my supervisor's guidance to teach me how a successful non-profit is managed. The skills I developed at MCAH will carry over into any other non-profit organizations, or businesses that I work for, due to their professional nature. I am very grateful to MCAH for investing the time and energy necessary to turn my volunteering time into what felt like a valuable and transferable apprenticeship. 
Artserve Michigan Inc	61938		/users/profile/67689	DJ Kurse	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I was hired by artserve to perform during their GUVVY awards ceremony for jazz legend Bob James.  I was honored to be a part of this and was very impressed with artserves' commitment to celebrating and commemorating artists of all genres that hail from Michigan.  I also was asked to hold a educational workshop for kids as part of GUVVY student event that focused on the history of hip hop and it's origins with street art.  I was thrilled to be able to connect with the youth and give them access to the history of this art form and culture that they may have difficulties receiving anywhere else.  I was impressed with Artserve for helping expand our youth's knowledge and experiences and I would love to cone back and contribute to any other workshops or events for students if they were to ask me.  Overall, I am impressed with Artserve's committment to better the community and expand and the opportunities of the arts in the state of Michigan.  They show they are leaders and teachers as well as followers and students and this avant garde style of pursuit for a better community should be applauded.  The arts are extremely important to our culture, our society, and our future.  I feel Artserve understands this and I respect what they're doing and what they are trying to accomplish.  Thanks Artserve Michigan!
Artserve Michigan Inc	61864		/users/profile/67598	Docket42	Advisor	5	01/31/2011	I have been working with ArtServe Michigan as a communications advisor for the past three years. The dedication of the staff for arts advocacy, education and awareness is unmatched in Michigan. I am consistently amazed with how much this group achieves despite a consistently uphill battle from people who do not understand the importance of the arts and culture, nor the need to properly fund it.

Artserve Michigan Inc	61166		/users/profile/66725	Ana C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2011	I have partnered with ArtServe Michigan since it was first formed. Most recently I partnered with them in my role as Michigan Department of Education Arts Education Specialist - a role from which I have recently retired. It is a pleasure to comment on the importance of ArtServe Michigan to the cultural well-being of our state. From the annual student workshops with international caliber clinicians, to the daily updates on arts advocacy issues, I have relied on ArtServe Michigan's to be there as the state's voice on arts advocacy. They have been successful in reducing competitiveness across arts and arts education organizations creating a collaborative environment in which the State Department of Education, the State Arts Council and the Michigan Youth Arts Association have been able to create an arts education agenda for the state. ArtServe also provided direct service to public schools in Detroit without dedicated arts educators through a Comic Book Literacy project in which students produced their own comics and teachers received the professional development needed to continue the work in their schools without additional assistance. A non-profit I am president of has also participated in the Michigan Cultural Data Project. The face to face and webinar support has been invaluable to a small non-profit managing its resources.

Artserve Michigan Inc	60841		/users/profile/66301	Valerie Allen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/24/2011	As a professional artist and retail sales/guest services manager for Midland Center for the Arts, I find Artserve MIchigan Inc. to be a leader in compiling and presenting resources for the benefit of the artistic community of Michigan. This past October, I was a participating artist in Artprize 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Artserve Michigan was a visible and active supporter of this international event.  I had the pleasure to meet, Cezanne Charles, Director of Creative Industries, during a seminar for artists on the business of art.  Her knowledge and enthusiasm was compelling.  Artserve Michigan was responsible for collaborating with the New York Arts Foundation to bring in this workshop.  The timing was perfect as it coincided with the over 1700 artists in town for Artprize.  I regularly check the Artserve website and newsletters for current information that is relevant for artists and art organizations.  It is a tremendous opportunity for me, personally, to learn and model myself after the professional members of the staff.  Thank you for your tremendous and tireless work for the arts.  
Artserve Michigan Inc	59617		/users/profile/64496	Alan Stamm	Advisor	5	01/07/2011	I am impressed by the strategic focus, dedicated professionals and broad-ranging outreach at this effective voice for arts advocacy.  Objectives and tactics reflect methodical, ongoing research into the needs of constituents, the interests of supporters and economic realities. Research results are distributed widely, reflecting transparency and a smart approach to coalition-building. Resource development and goals for influencing public policy are pursued with imaginative multi-platform campaigns. The passion of the executive director and experienced, full-time leadership team is clear and  contagious.  Artists, art educators and the public statewide are well-served by the dedication and long-term impact of ArtServe Michigan.         
Artserve Michigan Inc	59575		/users/profile/64416	Lois K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/06/2011	Artserve Michigan has educated me & others in the arts about our role in informing our legislators about the reasons arts deserve support even in times of economic decline.  They've been innovative  doing this when all in our state are financially hurting.  Whether an actual conference or an e-conference, they produce talking points showing why the arts are crucial to both our state's future & its current economy.  Ideas from them were enacted by our legislature & they've kept arts organizations & supporters aware of whom to contact & when contact is needed. We may not win all our battles to support the arts, but with Artserve MI we at least know what battles need fighting & how to do it.  This has kept the arts from being wiped out of funding, preserving a baseline from which recovery may proceed.
Artserve Michigan Inc	59568		/users/profile/64410	docloki	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/06/2011	In my experience with this organization, I have found that all Artserve Michigan staff work tirelessly on behalf of the arts, artists, arts education, and project funding.

I have witnessed clients develop  confidence and social skills so important in providing them the opportunity to be on an equal footing to their neurotypical peers. I can provide first hand testimony as to the wonderful works they perform. Through Music, Art, Yoga, and Theater, my son has blossomed, and overcome a number of social and personal hurdles. It is through the direct support of FAR Therapeutic Arts And Recreation and the services they provide that I attribute his development. While physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and social work has been provided through our local school district, it is undeniable the benefits of utilizing creative outlets to further the impact those core therapies have in the development of a special needs individual. Watching my son go from someone, who in his first performance with FAR the audience was asked to not clap but give a thumbs up due to severe sound sensitivity, to someone who delights in the applause and yells of encouragement from his fans. Without FAR, I don't believe this development would be as dramatic as it has. Thank you FAR Therapeutic Arts And Recreation.
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	311019		/users/profile/402355	Writer	Donor	5	10/15/2016	This program provides needy children with tremendously positive experiences through attendance at a summer camp.  Due to the cost of attendance at those camps, it would be virtually impossible for any of them to attend on their own.   The WCPA has done an amazing job of reaching out to the community for support for scholarships to give as many as 140 children to attend camps.  Every dollar that is collected (other than a nominal amount for personnel and office expenses) goes toward those scholarships.
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	310710		/users/profile/402052	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2016	Washtenaw County Camp Placement program deserves high praise and recognition for their community involvement with our children. They have helped send so many deserving children attend camp for 2 weeks in the summer for a rich experience in outdoors, activities like swimming, archery, and horseback riding, and meeting new friends. I have attended their orientation program where they share photos and past stories, provide a meal, and generously donate clothing, personal care items, sleeping bags, etc., for the camp attendees. Their passion and organizational abilities and love for the children is enormous. I am so grateful to them.

It is an amazing organization of dedicated professionals who work all year to raise awareness and money to send at risk/underprivileged children to camp.  I have seen first hand the transformational  experience that summer camp provides for children.  To be able to offer this to the most needy in our community is an important mission.  WCPA is a well run, excellent non-profit organization.
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	266139	2	/users/profile/354901	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	I volunteered to help with camp registration the past 2 summers and also chaperoned the buses that took some kids to camp and also picked them up. It was amazing to see the positive transformation the camp experience had on so many of these children who were initially so hesitant and anxious to go. These youth would have never been able to  attend without the camperships  that Washtenaw Camp Placement Assoc. provided. My own daughter enjoyed camp her whole childhood and she learned and grew so much being out in nature away from electronic stimulation.  This same gift is possible for so many underprivileged youth because of the generous donations WCPA has garnered and been able to share to make such an impactful difference in the lives of so many. Thank you, WCPA!
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	265660	3	/users/profile/354401	Writer	Board Member	5	10/20/2015	I have become familiar with Washtenaw Camp  Placement within the last few years.  It is a organization that makes it possible for children (by way of donors) that would normally only hear or see about camping by way of story books or television.   I have seen  many children get the opportunity to enjoy camp for the first time come back after a week or two weeks depending on the camp, with a big smile and stories about their experience that they will remember for years to come.  Many have some much fun and meet new friends that they ask when can they go back.  I wish this was around when my children were camper age.  Keep doing what is being done.
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	265103	3	/users/profile/353849	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	WCPA sends the kids who need it most to camp.  They are a crucial partner between educators, families and camps to make sure that kids who otherwise would not be given the chance to attend camp do so and have all of the supplies and information they need to have a blast.  
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	256119	5	/users/profile/344512	JenniLane	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	I have been a volunteer for WCPA for years, and am continually impressed by the way the organization is managed.  The Board and staff are very mission-driven, getting as many children to camp as they can possibly manage, with what appears to be very narrow margins.  Their stewardship seems responsible, frugal, and full of heart.  I think that WCPA is a place that one can support with confidence, and know that efforts and dollars will go directly to sending kids to camp.  Washtenaw County families and our entire community are incredibly lucky to have WCPA here to enrich kids' lives with meaningful camp experiences!
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	219430	2	/users/profile/283044	annlees	General Member of the Public	1	10/02/2014	This nonprofit has been spending much more on salaries than on the mission. I do not recommend donating or using this organization. I would search other similar organizations or go to the camps directly for financial assistance instead.  It is not a highly motivated staff and board.
Washtenaw Camp Placement Association	172707	6	/users/profile/228682	Hillie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2013	Washtenaw Camp Placement Association was established by community leaders in 1962 as the coordinating agency for summer resident camp scholarships in Washtenaw County.  It brings together schools and youth-serving agencies, camps with outstanding summer programs wishing to serve children from a broad range of backgrounds, and donors who desire to invest in the most vulnerable youth in the community.  Decades of successful partnerships with accredited camps throughout Michigan has resulted in the awarding of more than 9,300 camperships.  A campership is defined as one or two weeks of expense-paid resident summer camp, and supportive services such as clothing and gear, medical exams, and transportation.  Applicants are referred by school personnel and social workers in agencies.

Five Points Of Hope	91431	1	/users/profile/104604	BevHavens	Donor	5	06/20/2011	I have attended the Five Points of Hope annual 'Night to Remember' several times.   The most memorable was with my 3 sisters.   The 4 of us really enjoyed the evening and the silent auction.  It was the best 'Sisters Night Out'.   Our family has directly been affected by cancer and want to make a difference in fighting this hideous disease.   Erin Welsh is a great hostess - she approaches everyone and is the bell of the ball. The silent auction has so much variety that everyone will find something that they just have to bid on and follow up to make sure you win it.   The pampering room is divine -  you can get a manicure, pedicure and massages - is a great treat.  The event has grown each year, yet you see old and new friends every year.    I hope all the  vendors that contribute understand the social and community commitment that they are helping Five Points of Hope in achieving - thank you.

Five Points Of Hope	90905	1	/users/profile/103835	posinski	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2011	November 2010 was my second year attending the Five Points of Hope "A Night To Remember" event. It is a fun filled evening with great people raising money for an excellent cause.  My daughter has even become interested in volunteering. This will be an annual event for us. 
Five Points Of Hope	90848	1	/users/profile/103759	NighNigh	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2011	Five Points of Hope's "A Night to Remember" is a great event.  I have attended this event the past three years.  It has a variety of pamper stations from nails to massages to phycic readings if you want to enjoy all at a resonable price.  The variety of vendors is amazing.  Each vendor donates a gift to a silent auction.  This is well bid on and all profit/donations are greatly appreciated by the charach Cancer Center and put to use to make the patients more comfortable.  The location is upscale and drinks are available for a nominal fee and orderves are provided.  It truly makes a great "Girls Night Out"
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	218523		/users/profile/282098	lgdec20	General Member of the Public	1	09/30/2014	I have a friend who is terminally ill with cancer and has reached out to this organization a year ago. They completed the paperwork and did everything they were supposed to do. They have spoken to three different people who tell them every time that the director hasn't reviewed their account yet. The last time they called they were told that he still hasn't reviewed their account but they could help themselves by having an auction? He is terminally ill and unable to go to the store let alone throw an auction. If he could "help himself" he wouldn't be reaching out to a charity for help. I feel like he has been mislead and I'm curious how many other cancer patients have received this same treatment. 
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	189305	9	/users/profile/247051	Disappointed2013	Donor	1	11/25/2013	Been a donor for the past three years.  This time for the first time, I actually looked into the organization to see where my $25 went to.  They told me that it went to the 300 patients that needed financial support to continue with their cancer therapy.  I downloaded their Form 990, which is their tax return, and found out in 2012 that they had 670k worth of donations, and 470k (70%) went to fundraising costs (???), and 140k went to "other" expenses (21%), and salaries were 40k (6%) leaving only $17,666 of excess donations.  Not an accountant, but this organization looks like it runs for the benefit of the fundraisers, (Ronald F. Doddy & Associates, of Essexville, Michigan ($469,797).  Disappointing, won't contribute ever again.
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	114240	11	/users/profile/155463	MIgiver	General Member of the Public	1	06/07/2012	I believe that this organization is being fraudulent in claiming that their  primary purpose is "to provide Direct Financial Assistance to cancer patients and their families."  Their IRS Form 990 available for years 2008-2010 indicates that they have spent OVER 75% of their revenue annually on professional fundraising fees and approximately 2.5% on direct financial assistance to cancer patients.  Personally, I'd be very curious to know whether or not the Executive Director (Rock Mangus) is related to the owner of the fundraising organization that they employ.
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	92853	2	/users/profile/106577	John C.	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	Mission of Hope Cancer Fund, (MHCF), is a both a unique and effective nonprofit. They provide financial assistance to cancer patients enabling them to fight the daily battle this dreadful illness demands. No, MHCF does have labs filled with research doctors, but that do have the gas card for the patient that without it, would miss their chemo-therapy treatment. They do have the night's stay at a motel close to the hospital that makes it possible for the family to travel the long distance for treatment. They understand that cancer attacks not only the cells in the human body but equally attacks the family's financial stability by robbing them of paychecks, and increasing both medical and non-medical costs alike.  Founded by a cancer survivor, Rock Mangus, MHCF  understands the plight and burden faced by not only caner patients, but their families as well. This is a non-profit that "puts their money where their words are" daily. One only needs to look at the number of former clients now serving as volunteers for the organization to measure the true impact that MHCF makes.  
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	92810	1	/users/profile/106524	Jim Hoaglin	Board Member	4	06/29/2011	I have been a board member of the  Mission of Hope Cancer Fund for the past 8 years.  During this time  I have lost a few relatives to cancer.  Our family has been fortunate enough to have had insurance and financial strength to weather the storm but there are many many families who cannot.  I have witnessed first hand the gratitude of affected families who we have been able to help.  Through our founders financial help and more importantly first hand compassion, cancer patients have been able to continue treatment and keep a positive attitude in their fight against a horrible affliction.

Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	91860	1	/users/profile/105208	Karen M.	Volunteer	5	06/23/2011	My father died from lung cancer about 16 years ago. We know how hard it is on the family to try to give him all the care that he needs and not have any help financially.  Awhile later we met Rock Mangus.. the executive director of Mission of Hope Cancer Fund. My husband was able to help with one of Rock's first fundraisers. I have volunteered for MHCF, now I am a part time employee. I have seen first hand how clients have been helped. I have been able to talk to clients and understand their grief and fear. The one thing that I love the most about this organization is how much Rock truly cares about the clients. He is the director of the organization, but still takes time to hand deliver the gas cards to client that are local. He goes to clients benefit dinners. He is involved with every aspect of every client.  We need help though. If you or anyone you know could give time or financial help please let us know.... MHCF@cancerfund.org
Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	46395	1	/users/profile/47249	cathy8	Client Served	5	06/29/2010	I was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer on two separate occasions in 2001 & 2002. After a bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy and five years of oral medication, I had a recurrence a year and a half ago. This time, surgery, chemo, radiation and now oral medication again. I should mention in between my two cancer treatments, my husband had two devastating accidents, one of which he was air lifted to an out of town hospital. This past December he then had to have back surgery.  Needless to say, our medical bills continued to mount, creating much worry and hardship as our capability to work to pay for them lessened. I heard of Mission of Hope and called and had a very comforting discussion with Rock Mangus.  Not only is he an inspiration with his own survivorship, but an Angel sent from Heaven with his financial assistance.  I received some assistance on three of my largest bills and I am so very, very grateful. Thank you so much for the kindness and generous gifts that you have given me. I appreciate you from the bottom of my heart.  Cathy

Mission of Hope Cancer Fund	33169	24	/users/profile/33989	christine5	General Member of the Public	1	03/14/2010	I received a call today asking to donate to this organization in the form of a cookbook purchase, which would be delivered to my door Monday. I asked for them to call me back after I'd had a chance to review their website (CancerFund.org).On the website I saw the GuideStar logo and clicked through until I could see their 990's (tax returns). From what I can tell the 2008 990 showed that:* Mission of Hope raised over $325,000 in 2008, all of it through a telemarketing vendor. The vendor kept $238,000 in fees (73%).* Mission of Hope spent $46,000 (14%) delivering services that would benefit people with cancer. Of that amount, $39,200 was for general assistance (answering questions over the phone, for example) amd giving out information at health fairs and similar events.Only $8,600 (2.6%) went to "direct financial assistance", which they state on their homepage as their "primary purpose."I'm very aware of how important it is to assess nonprofits on more than financials, but these ratios are very, very troubling.
Pregnancy Aid Inc	180326		/users/profile/236986	Nancy129	Board Member	5	10/20/2013	Pregnancy Aid uses its resources very well.  Expenses are carefully thought out, and all of its services are free.  Each year, about 1000 new women sign up for assistance. Volunteers offer emotional support, pregnancy tests, ultrasounds,  maternity clothes, baby clothes and supplies, and helpful information to women facing unplanned pregnancies.  Great organization.

I was looking for someone just to talk to, to assure me that if need be I could have this baby on my own. And then I found pregnancy aid. The moment I walked in the door I could feel the love that just oozes from the staff here. I was embraced, treated with respect and for the first time in a long time I felt safe. I soon began to volunteer at P.A. I knew that this place was making a difference in our community and I wanted to be a part of that. 3 years later, Pregnancy Aid has become my second home!!!
Pregnancy Aid Inc	168864		/users/profile/223836	JAVA	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	Pregnancy Aid is such a great organization.  I have been a volunteer there off and on for many years and the people involved with PA are kind, considerate and care so much about the clients.  The clients are very appreciative and many value an organization where they can attend classes for fellowship while at the same time receive help with baby items.  Having the ultrasound machine available for pregnant mothers to experience the first sign of their babies life has been so awesome.  I believe many women have chosen life over abortion after having an ultrasound.  Keep up the great work PA and God Bless all the volunteers and clients.

Pregnancy Aid Inc	163556		/users/profile/217190	emily1983	Client Served	5	07/25/2013	I am in my 5th week of my first (unplanned) pregnancy. When I found out last Saturday, I was in complete shock and panic. A friend brought me to Pregnancy Aid to have a confirmation test, and they instantly helped me, made me feel welcome, understood and not judged... which was very important for me. I felt comfortable with the professional and knowledgeable staff, who guided me through what to expect while in early pregnancy. Their ultrasound tech was very sweet and informative, and I look forward to seeing her again before I make my first OBGYN appointment. If you aren't comfortable talking with friends or family members straight away, or don't know how to share the news of unplanned pregnancy, Pregnancy Aid is an excellent place to start :) I look forward to assisting in spreading awareness and fundraising for this organization.

The mission statement of the Society expresses my concern for a need that is not being met by any other organization that I'm aware of. I believe Biblical Truths MUST be made aware to all, and rich Christian art can be used to inspire those who need or desire that extra inspiration.

Our world today is disrupted by economic uncertainty, terrorism, and violence. This can only be addressed in the longrun by a society that possesses strong morals and values.  Sacred art is an expression of Christian culture spanning two millenia, and proper appreciation of this art form and culture in the hearts and minds of our young people will help to strengthen their morals and values as they face the challenges of their own generations.  The Society of St. Henry seeks to do much good work in this field, and I want to be part of it.

New Latino Visions	107782		/users/profile/146347	Cody Evick	Professional with expertise in this field	4	03/09/2012	  	With over two years of  planning and implementation as a club member and youth development professional at the Greater Kalamazoo Boys and Girls Club and a board member with New Latino Visions. The Institute for New Leadership leveraged youth and adult leadership in communities. The purpose is to enhance organizational leadership and engage in strategic planning that advances equality in Southwest Michigan.  Through multiculturalism, education, youth and community development programs and the opportunity to work with multiple cultural teams that are unified and committed to improving our communities social equalities.         The demand for unity and  commitment to learning, collaboration, and opportunity has been extremely important. In my opinion the years spent advocating unity and commitment in our region and throughout the world have been some of the most important years of my life. 	The opportunity New Latino Visions and Boys and Girls Clubs have given me to share and value the visions, unity, and commitment to equality of our new youth leaders, they definitely took me for an amazing ride. There is one specific conversation I had with a group of youth that I will never forget. The group explained that the diversity of  the young brings harmony. The group explained that they don't and refuse to live in the same generic (census) box that the older generations have created. Instead of limiting our youth based on the importance and value being placed on one's nationality, gender, skin color, age, etc.  The youth expressed an emphasis on "Staying You" and it is the value of each individual that makes you unique. 	To develop the social justice paradigm youth leaders investigated why certain cultures acted the way they do and how we as a society can share the power and influence of multiple customs. Being taught by the youth, the group learned how to avoid misconceptions, counterproductive behavior, and boost multicultural morale. I realized just how rational and necessary the #NewYouthVisions have become.  The YOUTH overcame century old stereotypes and obvious slips in our nations history. With a new vision, a new mindset, and a greater understanding of diversity. A understanding so great, that all-inclusiveness will out weigh the counterparts of reverse discrimination. The result: a mind, heart, and body of YOUTH that respects a wide range of cultural and individual differences. #NewYouthVisions at http://newlatinovisions.vpweb.com/About-Us.html

They also provide an excellent platform for Latinos to celebrate their culture, build self esteem, and celebrate their diversity.  This is a great organization that truly cares about improving the community for all of us.  Keep up the great work NLV!     
New Latino Visions	107590		/users/profile/145828	noritita	Volunteer	5	03/06/2012	Latino Visions has really done a great job at keeping our community connected. They have been part of many charity events througout the state and have sponsoried events such as "Cinco de Mayo", "Hispanic Festival", etc. I believe that events like this create more awareness in the community and help people stay connected with their heritage. I love and admire Latino Vision!!!!
New Latino Visions	107575		/users/profile/145788	JaniceH	Donor	4	03/06/2012	This organization is very instrumental in bringing the Hispanic community concerns and celebrations to the community at large. I encourage everyone to consider donating to this organization as they represent a worthy cause.
New Latino Visions	69831		/users/profile/76324	Marylou M.	Volunteer	4	02/17/2011	I have been a volunteer for numerous events that New Latino Visions has participated in.   We have a great group of people leading and directing this group towards its mission statement.   Even though, they have gone from many board members to a few, they are small but MIGHTY.   You can tell the passion is there, there is much enthusiasm and the joy and hearts they have touched in their volunteer efforts has been outstanding.   They continue to work on projects small and large throughout the year and many connections have been made due to the partnering with other organizations.  I feel this is important when a group is willing to share the limelight with others.   
New Latino Visions	67987		/users/profile/74297	glomi2009	Board Member	5	02/14/2011	I have had the opportunity to volunteer and become an actual board member for New Latino Visions in the last 2 1/2 years.  This organization has educated me not only on non-profit work but also different Hispanic cultures, soccer, event organizing, fundraising, organizational skills, leadership skills and the list goes on.  I have been directly involved with many events, classes, meetings, fundraisers for New Latino Visions to name a few: Cinco de Mayo 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 1st Annual Hispanic/African American Cultural Event, 1st Annual Day of the Homeless in partnership with other nationwaide Hispanic groups, tejano fundraising dances, raffles etc........Just to name a few again.  New Latino Visions is a great non-profit in the mentoring piece.  New Latino Visions takes every opportunity to help out local schools and colleges to name a few:  Edison Magnet school (Halloween & Green project in process), El Sol elementary school (Boxtops for Education), Phoenix High School (Mentors classes & possible Cinco de Mayo), Washington Writers Academy (Afterschool programs since 2005 to 2010) and the list goes on.  Not only is our Mission focusing on the Michigan YOUTH but also focusing on the whole community.  The organization is restructing and obtaining dedicated, passionate and committed board members and all are getting their hands wet in all areas of the organization and understanding how to communicate and respect each other and the community.  We have had some ups and downs but are working hard to keep making a difference in the whole State of Michigan.  Additional information on New Latino Visions Facebook that shares everything we have accomplished throughout the last few years.  Proud to be a part of this organization! 
New Latino Visions	67861		/users/profile/74171	jkholstine	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I was fortunate to be involved with New Latino Visions' First Annual "Day of the Homeless" at the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission.  We collected food and financial donations to help this organization feed the homeless.  It was our pleasure to also be the servers for the evening meal the day we delivered our donations. New Latino Visions is a great organization, working to better the community in which ii is involved.  I am a member of the Insurance Professionals of Southwest Michigan and we joined forces with New Latino Visions and HERO for this event.  By the three organizations joining forces, we were able to make a bigger impact than any organization could do on its own.

Food Gatherers	57740	3	/users/profile/61142	Emily S.	General Member of the Public	5	11/23/2010	I love that I can donate fresh garden produce to Food Gatherers!  So many food shelters can only take non-perishable processed foods. So this year, I grew a large plot of pumpkins and potatoes specifically for them to distribute this year.  Each time I came in with a donation, they recognized me and updated me on how the vegetables were being used - mostly for pumpkin muffins at the shelter downtown.  It made me feel good that I was helping some folks get a much-needed meal that's really nutritious.
Food Gatherers	57706	2	/users/profile/61093	kderezinski	General Member of the Public	5	11/23/2010	I have volunteered at Food Gatherers -- n the warehouse and in their kitchen at our local shelter -- as part of my company's ongoing support of Food Gatherers. As a volunteer, I have been impressed with professionalism, enthusiasm, commitment, imagination, and humor of the staff. I'm also a contributor to Food Gatherers (both food and money)  because I know that my contributions are being used in the most effective way to help people and to promote good health in our community.  Though I am a volunteer and donor, I'm writing as a "General Member of the Public" because I see the Food Gatherers trucks everywhere when I'm out in the public and I have been following its history since its beginnings in the late '80s. Food Gatherers is part of the fabric of our community.
Food Gatherers	57702	2	/users/profile/61087	Kristin P.	Volunteer	5	11/23/2010	I volunteer in the community kitchen weekly.  The food that we serve is resteraut quality and the people we serve are very thankful to have a good hot meal. Some of our people that come in say it's their only meal of the day.  There are working people who just do not have enough money for food.  Thank you Food Gatherers for making a difference in Ann Arbor. 
Food Gatherers	26347	4	/users/profile/27384	Sean	Volunteer	5	01/27/2010	I've been a volunteer on pick-up and delivery routes for a couple of years now. It's one of the best things I've ever done. I'm continually impressed by the operational efficiency of Food Gatherers right down to the most microscopic details. This focus is unique in non-profits, in my experience. Also, the people are truly outstanding. I look forward to every shift.Truly can't say enough good about this organization.

These displays have included uniforms, helmets, gas masks, blankets, photographs and all matter of historical military articles. The MMTHS representatives provided detailed information on each piece so that factual signage could be included in the displays. We will definitely be calling on the MMTHS for future assistance to help encourage knowledge of our nation's military history.

Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	89104	1	/users/profile/101021	Cathy	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	I have been involved with the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission for 5 years and what a blessing it has been to me. KGM touches people and let's them know that they are cared about and loved. But most of all KGM teaches the power of our LORD and SAVIOR, Jesus Christ.  I have seen clients at KGM who had hit rock bottom from addiction to alcohol and drugs but the programs offered at KGM has put them back on the right track to get their lives together.  KGM is not just a homeless shelter, it is a place where one can go and get the support that they need and regain the respect that they deserve. The KGM is a GOD send for those in need, not only for shelter and food but for support from others who have experienced the same situation they may be going thru. I do love KGM for what they represent in the Kalamazoo Community and for what they do for those in need and letting them know that GOD forgives all sins and all things are possible if you believe.
Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	24561	1	/users/profile/25599	Seedarock1	Former Volunteer	5	12/18/2009	The Kalamazoo Gospel Mission is a great pillar of our community.  Not only is it an outreach for the those in need of shelter, food and clothing it is a place where everyone can receive the love of God.  As a mentor to some of their clientele I have always had a blessed experience working with their staff. As a member of this community I have been able to bring my family to their family events and know that my children age 7 & 11 will have a great time fellow shipping with the staff and clients.
Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	23877	1	/users/profile/25013	Rhonda	Board Member	5	12/12/2009	KGM is not just a food kitchen, not just a shelter, not just a place to have your life changed, not just a a safe haven for your children, not just a place to come into a real and meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ, it is a force in the community.  It is an honest, reliable, stable, caring and trustworthy integral part of this community we call Kalamazoo.
Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	23806	1	/users/profile/24944	pgoheen@wwplc.com	Volunteer	5	12/11/2009	Our firm provides free legal services to Kalamazoo Gospel Mission patrons.  Through those sessions, we have witnessed what KGM brings to all those who enter their doors.  With these poor economic times and with so many more now homeless, the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission is extraordinary in what they provide from food and shelter to support, strength, and hope.  Because the need is greater now than ever before, donations and volunteers are desparately needed.  If you have time, a spare coat or blanket or a few dollars, please consider supporting the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission.
Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	23704	1	/users/profile/24833	cash	Volunteer	5	12/10/2009	I volunteer to teach Financial Literacy Classes to the clients at KGM and from what I see the staff do there is amazing. I have seen clients who were at rock bottom come back to the top and reclaim their lives thru the help of the staff at KGM and God. It is just so overwhelming to see the miracles that happen at KGM. Kalamazoo is so blessed to have people who care about people at KGM.
Kalamazoo Gospel Mission	23701	1	/users/profile/24829	LaukaJ	Volunteer	5	12/10/2009	The staff and volunteers at the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission are people who truly have a heart for the poor and hurting community in the Greater Kalamazoo area.  The staff go above and beyond to serve each client and meet the individuals physical and spiritual needs.  I have found this to be true with every person I have interacted with at the Mission. The great work that the mission does in the name of Christ results in changed lives.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	81952		/users/profile/89889	ChryslerMom	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	As a working mother,  I always want to contribute to my children's school .  Our PTC board is outstanding.  Everytime I have gone to a PTC meeting,  I have been so impressed with how professional and friendly everyone is.  Very focused getting things done, educating themselves with other districts to see how we can better ourselves and always challenging opportunities to create a fun, educational and exciting life at Hatherly.  I have volunteered for the Holiday Shop, Talent Show and Field Day.  I always want to do more because the PTC encourages me to want too.  Hatherly's PTC board is a major structure within our Hatherly family.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	80923		/users/profile/88358	chili	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I think the Hatherly PTC is an important part of the school.  They sponsor fun and educational events that give whole families a chance to participate.  The PTC also tries to help the great teachers get a few extra things from their "wish list". 
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	80702		/users/profile/88076	impressionelle	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	Hatherly Elementary PTC has many supporters from the board president of our district as a professional and parent, principal and staff of the school as well as all of the parent volunteers that make it successful.  Most of the activities that are sponsored are free but most importantly provide educational and social building skills early on for children, for example our PTC sponsors many assemblies and author visits.   This group is totally dedicated to support the school in any way possible for the maximum learning potential of each child.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	80201		/users/profile/87562	Mr. Konal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	As the principal of Hatherly Elementary School, I know that it is imperative that the staff, students, parents and community see the importance of educating children.  The Hatherly PTC is a dedicated group of staff and parents who work extremely hard to provide the school community with the tools to help all of our students succeed and achieve their personal best.  Through their main fund raiser (annual Fun Run) the PTC reaches out to all stakeholders in our community to contribute to this fund raising endeavor.  This has provided funds to the organization, but it has more importantly facilitated lasting relationships with our school community members.  Throughout the school year, the PTC supports the activities of the school by providing funds for assemblies, sponsoring author visits, hosting evening activities for parents and students to engage in fun learning activities and ongoing volunteer efforts during the school day.   The students and staff at Hatherly have greatly benefitted from the generosity and hard work of the Hatherly PTC.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	80162		/users/profile/87522	EliandEmmasmommy	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	My son is in kindergarten, and so when I first learned that there was club made up of parents and teachers, I was ready to join, to help do my part. I was a little hesitant at first, because I was not sure what to expect and not sure of what exactly they did or if my son being in kindergarten, if it would really even benefit him if I helped out. Let me just say, I'm glad I went to that first meeting, the PTC is an exceptional example of what a parent-teacher group should be, everyone involved working toward a common goal. It is committed to students, teachers, and just the school in general. It's goal is to really help students achieve their personal best through exciting activities, and learning opportunities that they otherwise may not get. I'm definitely a proud mom, but I'm also proud of my son's school, principal, and the other parents, that help make up the PTC.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	80101		/users/profile/87459	PTC member	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have been a member of the PTC for several years. The PTC is  committed to supporting many wonderful activities (such as author visits, family fun nights, and educational assembiles) for our school's students. I appreicate all of their efforts!
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	78604		/users/profile/85886	Aidans Dad	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	This is my 3rd year as a Hatherly parent and volunteer.  I always knew that when I had children that I would be a part of the organization and feel lucky to be a part of this one.  This group truly looks at all possibilities with the school and students at the heart of all efforts.  All of the actvities and fund raisers I've been a part of, or reviewed, have had an excellent success.  With the financial state of affairs with the school, district, and state, this organization - and the work that it does - will continue to be a  critical part of the school's success.
Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	72635		/users/profile/79400	BusyMom	Volunteer	4	02/22/2011	I have been a Hatherly parent for 6 years now and have volunteered for many of the events.

Hatherly Elementary School Parent Teacher Club Ptc	71309		/users/profile/77976	mbednard	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2011	I have been a Hatherly parent for 4 years, and one of the groups that I feel has been a huge part of the school has been the Hatherly PTC.  The PTC first of all raises money for many different programs inside of the classrooms.  They are always looking for ways to help out education programs.Also, the PTC  sponsors many after school activities that involve all of the Hatherly community, including students, younger siblings and parents.  They have had family game nights, Dr. Seuss night and various programs throughout the year to give everyone a fun, free night out.  These sorts of activities ensure that everyone feels like a part of the school.  It is groups like the PTC that make brand new families feel welcome to the community, and I appreciate all of their efforts!
American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association	291595		/users/profile/382033	Tina100	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2016	I am newly diagnosed and the group had been my lifeline. It is nice to know I am not alone
American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association	291572		/users/profile/335409	AARDA  Autoimmune Diseases Support Group	Volunteer	5	05/31/2016	Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Related Diseases My story begins in the year 1978.  I woke up one morning and could not get out of bed as I cannot move my legs or left arm. I am only 18 yrs old.  I went to the hospital, was admitted for a week, but only to discharged by the hospital, with no diagnosis except that I still have Psoriasis's as well as Psoriatic Arthritis which started at age 13 yrs of age.  Several Weeks go by and Im getting worse, I have red raised nodules on the shins of my legs below my knees. Im back in a different hospital and they put warm towels on my legs.  They take pictures of my legs for a medical book.  My legs are warm to the touch and very painful.  The doctors are baffled and send me home again with no diagnosis.  After being home for a few weeks of horrific pain, Im finally carried in by my father and again admitted to a different hospital.The doctors tell my parents that they think there may be fluid in my ankles because they are swollen and red and that I will never walk again.  But thank God there was no fluid.  I spent a week in the hospital only to have them discharge me with a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis and Erythema Nodosum.They thought it could have also been Polio or Rheumatic fever and so I spent the next 9 months in a wheelchair, because I just couldnt walk.So I cant walk, I have Psoriasis's, Sarcoidosis, and Erythema Nodosum, and I was receiving steroid injections in my ankles and taking liquid painkillers just to be able to walk & function.  Its now May in the year of 1995.  I am giving birth to my second son by C-section.  During this 3-day experience the only symptoms that I had was severe tremors and headache. The nurse said it was normal after a C-section.  I didnt agree, as these tremors were involuntary and uncontrollable. They had given me Ativan.  Finally, my husband and I left the Hospital and took our baby home.  Two nights later after being at home, I had to go back to the E.R. as I had a severe headache and my blood pressure was up.  The doctors gave me a CT and a shot of Demerol, and sent me home.  They said I was fine.  I knew I was not. The very next day, I literally woke up feeling like I only had a head in the bed!!  I could not feel my body parts especially from the neck down to my toes and I had no control of their movements.  I was numb from the neck down and unable to walk without assistance.  Today, I have learned that what I had experienced has a name, PROPRIOCEPTION, another major symptom of MS.  At this point my speech started to slur.  My husband drove me back to the hospital.  By the time I entered the emergency room, I had no vision, I was blind and within hours, and I felt as if I were paralyzed.  I could not respond to any of the doctors commands.  I simply did not know how to respond. Yet I could hear every word they spoke. After being admitted for weeks and after undergoing many, many tests and having had Nitroglycerin put under my tongue every few hours, the only diagnosis that I received was that I had Post Partum Psychosis and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist.Although, I remember a Neurologist checking my balance before I was discharged, and because I had a slight responding reflex; he said I was fine, yet... I still could not see or walk correctly.  I had no perception of time or space or even where I was.  I could not drive a car, as I didn't know how?  I relied on my husband for everything that had to do with thinking. As time went by my vision finally did come back as tunnel and mirror like vision. I was discharged from the hospital with a 1mg of prescription Ativan 3x a day as it calmed the tremors that had overcome my body as I left the hospital.  But I listened to the Doctors recommendations and I did go to see a Psychiatrist and had a Neuropsychological evaluation. It was my Psychiatrist who said I had every symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and suggested that I see an MS specialist. So I made an appointment to see an MS specialist who finally diagnosed me with Multiple Sclerosis. He was also very upset at the other so-called educated Doctors, as they had no idea as to what they were looking at when viewing my MRIs.He said it showed that I had MS on all different MRIs.  He also said I had a host of other autoimmune related diseases as well. In June of 2001, I was told by this MS Specialist that I had a secondary disease diagnosis called Multiple Sclerosis.  I had to undergo speech and cognitive therapy for almost 3 years and I had to be detoxed from a medication called Ativan that I was now addicted too for the Tremors and was now shutting down my digestive system.  I was taking up to 18 mg a day of Ativan because of a MISDIAGNOSIS. I feel that telling my story may benefit others who maybe experiencing or already has experienced this same kind of situation.  Im also telling my story so that I may one day save someones life. One doctor wrote a letter to my Psychiatrist that he had spent over an hour counseling me on my symptoms and complaints. Others said it was all in my head.Since my diagnosis of MS, I have also been diagnosed with ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura) as well as Lupus, Sjogrens, Uveitis and Blifferitis. Today, I have become a self educated and volunteer leader for a nonprofit organization called American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association at www.aarda.org. We now have a support group in the local Detroit area with meetings held once a Month, March thru November only for the comfort of our members.  Our autoimmune support group is the first in the nation, as we bring education, research and support, to the growing public and to the healthcare system on over 100 autoimmune related diseases.  We are located at Henry Ford Medical Pavilion, 16151 19 mile road & Hayes, Clinton Twp, Mich. 48038. Meetings are held every 2nd Thursday evening of the months March thru November only.4th Floor-Conference room 3Times: 7:pm to 9:pm We look forward to seeing you all In March.

I went from being a competitive athlete, Coach and trainer to a drooling, vomiting bed and chair-ridden shell of myself, riddled with excruciating pain I had never experienced in my life-time. After several hospitalizations, surgeries, biopsies with no explanation as to why my body was failing on me, I thankfully stumbled across The American  Autoimmune and Related Diseases Organziation (AARDA). I realized I was not the only person who was suffering. This Organization has saved me. The interaction within the Organization and it's members has been phenomenal to say the least. Through grassroots fundraisers, walks, International Summits, newsletters this Organization has provided so much information for it's members. I have helped organize 2 grassroots fundraisers, raising over $5K this year alone for AARDA. We could NOT have done it without AARDA's help! They provided fliers, banners, shirts, rubber bracelets, etc.! They were awesome! Treatment for these diseases is sketchy, at best. These diseases seem to be in the 'infantile' stage of awareness and funding. Millions of people are fighting these diseases all on their own which, and I can tell you from experiencing the fight every hour of every day, can be incredibly depressing and lonely. AARDA has done an amazing job in helping to get the word out, increase funding, finding and getting approached by well known researchers, scientists, doctors and specialists who want to be involved with AARDA. I and my family have benefited tremendously by being a part of the AARDA family.

Internet searches can only do so much to give you information about what you can expect in the coming years.    AARDA's monthly support group meetings mean the world to me.  There are always handouts about the diseases and the speakers provide me insight on things I can try to do to help my symptoms.    Speaking with fellow sufferers makes me feel less alone.   Don't know what I would do without these folks!

I appreciate being able to attend the free support meetings each month held in Clinton Township. They offer educational as well as  a personal  view of autoimmune diseases, diagnosis, and offer a medical background by the many physicians and health care providers that attend and share their knowledge of autoimmune diseases with the group.

They are also involved in reaching the medical profession to spread info, increase awearness and help get laws passed to aid in funding and research. There are over 50 million suffers of Autoimmune diseases, the AARDA website gives lots of info and a place to talk with others who have AI problems. Six years ago when I found out I have an AI disease, the AARDA help me accept my disease and lead me to understand my disease better. I don't know what I would have done if I had not found this wonderful organization. Thank you all who work and support the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association.
Bair Lake Bible Camp	134972		/users/profile/180840	Reynbanker	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with Bair Lake Bible Camp several years ago. After growing up in a non-christian home, BLBC gave me the opportunity to experience a Christian camp for the first time as a husband and father. I found it a wonderful experience that my whole family enjoyed. The beautiful grounds provided an excellent place to relax, reflect and study God's Word. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed the facilities that range from zip lines and rock walls to tubing on the lake.  The family games and activities were a great opportunity for us to bond without the electronic distractions of today. I would recommend Bair Lake to all campers in all age groups.

Detroit Dog Rescue	266749	3	/users/profile/355506	DDR_volunteer	Volunteer	1	10/23/2015	If I could give them ZERO stars in this review, I would. They don't deserve one star. This is a fraudulent organization whose mission is to deceive the public in order to bring in the most amount of income possible. They falsely advertise themselves as a No Kill shelter when they do not meet the definition of a No Kill shelter. To be a No Kill shelter, they must be open admission. They are not. They are limited admission, which means they turn animals away. By definition alone, they are NOT a No Kill shelter, and they know that. But the term brings in half-a-million dollars a year, so lie, lie, lie to the public. 
Detroit Dog Rescue	233466	3	/users/profile/297283	Supremedogtrainer	Volunteer	2	11/12/2014	DDR is a rescue in Detroit that rescues homeless dogs in a city that is over run withb abused and stray dogs. They claim to be the only no kill rescue in Detroit,   but they are the only one that has a shelter. The good is they do rescue dogs and are known to vet their dogs in the best way possible. They may have put dogs to sleep for curable medical issues,   it may have been done due to the advice of a vet. I don't think they put dogs down be a use of space issues. The bad is their director Hush. He has more people hate him than DAC. He has been accused of poor money management, not rescuing a dog until the camera man shows up and paying more attention to himself than to the dogs. I had occasion to approach him and he backed away. I only tried to offer  my training services and find out how he is able to keep dogs in Detroit at his facility legally.  His claim is he has adopted 500 dogs but many rescues do that in a year with a much more difficult adoption process and a much smaller budget. He could do more but does not know how .  He would do better by offering money to get dogs spayed or neutered . 
Detroit Dog Rescue	225995	4	/users/profile/289746	Sara246	General Member of the Public	1	10/24/2014	Sorry folks DDR are liars. They say they are no kill but they take the animals to open admission shelters to be put down. Second THEY AREN'T EVEN BASED INTO DETROIT THERE SUPPOSEDLY NO KILL SHELTER IS IN ST. CLAIR SHORES. THEY NO NOTHING ABOUT THE D. I don't trust them. Just watching some of there rescues they don't even handle the animals correctly. Hush..is a joke. More worried about the money. It's about the animals!! I will never donate to this rescue again. Stay Away
Detroit Dog Rescue	211322	5	/users/profile/274236	MaxSteele	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/20/2014	When DDR needs animals euthanized, they turn them into open admission shelters for said service.  The money which they've gleaned for a shelter was used to build a boarding facility.  DDR alone propogated the fallacy that Detoit was overrun w/50,000-100,000 stray dogs (which is 350-700 per sq mile) in an attempt to attract attention for a reality show, even referring to their untrained "stars" as "cast" instead of staff.  The number was a complete fabrication and since surveys have proven actual numbers close to 3,000.  And, of course, there's the annoying implication that DDR is in Detroit.  They do not live in, work in, take dogs from or have a shelter in the city.  They do make a great deal of money off of the city, though... especially by selling TShirts which say "Rescue, not retail,"  which delights me- available for sale, by a group that does no rescue.  Good marketing, kids.  That is the extent of positive.  
Detroit Dog Rescue	211159	7	/users/profile/274048	Pibbles	General Member of the Public	1	08/19/2014	Detroit Dog Rescue is NOT the ONLY no-kill rescue in Detroit by any means! There are and have been many smaller no-kill rescues that actually RESIDE in Detroit (NOT St. Clair Shores) that have been in operation for decades. However, they are not publicity hounds like DDR. DDR is not open to the public nor does it accept strays from the general public. The only reason it can be called "no-kill" is because they take the animals to MHS and/or MACS or others to have hem euthanized.
Detroit Dog Rescue	180601	11	/users/profile/237289	unknown to avoid backlash	Volunteer	1	10/21/2013	I am Writing with information concerning a rescue in the Detroit Area called Detroit Dog rescue. I am not writing this because any harm has been conspired against me or my family, but because I believe people need to be informed that this company is " Dirty". They are continuing to accept donations from the public with promises of creating a non kill state of the art shelter in Detroit. in the last 2 years they have been gifted over 2 million dollars and have nothing to show, except minimal progress (enough to fool people that they are doing the right thing) they operate out of a small boarding house, with volunteers, who receive no payment for their time. Daniel Hush Carslie a failed rapper, in the last year has purchased a custom S.U.V, A new home, and used Donations to produce his own rap album, plus much more, His top tier guys have a comfortable income for almost no work hours. For the time that these guys have had to make a change in the city, they have not. They rather use excuses, bully and strong hold local business when they do not get their way. they are Hostile and threaten people. they use a publicst  whom gets pay from the donations that are support to go to the dogs care. In the beginning of their start up, they filmed start dogs hungry, so they were attacking and eating puppies. Instead of STOPPING this HORRIC SCENE they FILMED IT! and Placed it on the internet in hopes to gain the attention of a TV studio and gain a reality Televison show! Is asked about any financials Carslie will say of course he took a salary and started a business Thats not the Problem, the problem is he took a 6 FIGURE SALERY and HAS NO RESCUE TO SHOW FOR IT! They do not rescue homeless dogs roaming the street RATHER Carslie, says it is ILLEGAL and DOES NOTHING! this group DOES NOT ASSIST OR HELP?FEED any DOG that they Consider Feral, the homeless dog population has shown no decrease if anything the numbers have risen, and only few people have rescue's to show progress within the rescue effort of DDR. They owe money to Vets (THOUSANDS), other Non profits and rescue groups who have extended their own time, money, and more because they want to assist the animals of Detroit in need! THE CITY OF DETROIT does not what to PUT money in these CRIMINALS pocket or pay check of Daniel " Hush" Carslile or His boys. ONCE I SAW THIS WAS GOING ON I NEVER RETURNED TO VOLENTEER!  AGAIN PLEASE LISTEN They use a publicist to continually get them on various local shows, and Bully people, threatening to injure them physically if anyone gets in their spotlight.Please beware, inform people and expose these guys, who are using the hardship of these Animals and this Community to their profit. Sincerely, to remain anonymous to avoid backlash

Detroit Dog Rescue	146640	3	/users/profile/193597	Dog-dad	Volunteer	5	12/13/2012	Detroit Dog Rescue takes pride in the fact that they are the ONLY no-kill dog rescue in Detroit. I have seen them take in animals that were so sick and starved they could barely stand - and DDR nursed these animals back to health and found them forever homes! And they do it all with a very limited income stream - because they spend their money on the dogs, and not on slick newspaper ads or gut-wrenching TV spots. I know that the executive management of this organization has gone for months - years - with no paychecks. And I know that the work done by this organization has earned it a brilliant reputation -- even in the well-heeled suburbs (denizens of which are very generous to DDR). DDR deserves your support!

Ever since I was eight years old, the founders have embraced me and helped me manifest my potential.

Enter Stage Right, the parent organization, now is venturing into Hamlet (with a twist- role reversals). I thought, due to age (77) I was past stage rolls. But our director found some roles which tolerate a long staff, and not too much memorization. The cast is a joy to work with, and next week I need to be off book.  Love this work.

Young Peoples Ballet Theatre Inc	278627	1	/users/profile/368594	Writer	Board Member	5	02/01/2016	My daughter is in her third year of training at YPBT. We drive an hour each way to go to this exceptional program and have known several other dancers who do the same. It is simply the best training to be found in the region. The caliber of dancing at this studio is superb and not something that we could find closer to home. The pre-professional training program offers classes Monday through Friday and the performance company on Saturdays. The teachers are wonderful and concerned about each and every student. The atmosphere at the studio is friendly and welcoming. I think my daughter will have a harder time leaving her friends at YPBT when she graduates than her high school classmates because they spend so much time together and are a close-knit group! The performances are beautiful in every way with challenging choreography, gorgeous hand made costumes, and so much more! Our only regret is that we didn't find YPBT sooner!

The studio is technique driven, family friendly, with dancers that quickly become friends. I have found over the last ten years that the teachers are current, thoughtful and professional. In addition, the performing side of YPBT is the best! They perform full length, storybook ballets that come to life through exceptional dancing, beautiful handmade costumes and sets. It is an experience my daughter has treasured. I would highly recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for great dance technique, qualified teachers, professionalism, clean studios and a family friendly environment!

There are ample opportunities to excel and it is a very positive environment.

We were so delighted to find YPBT, which not only conducted regular dance classes, but also staged full length ballets appropriate for a young audience.  From Heidi to Beauty and the Beast to the up-coming Coppelia, the shows chosen have been top notch.  From little kids all the way through High School, this organization excels.  The professional training our daughters receive is setting them up for whatever level of dance they desire to achieve.  Most important, however, is the positive environment they are experiencing.

Great Lakes Weimaraner Rescue, Inc.	320993		/users/profile/414119	Jeremy Z.	Volunteer	5	01/09/2017	I first met GLWR when I was privileged enough to be approved to adopt Sierra. I say privileged as she was a long term alumni of the rescue and was loved my many.  Not only did I adopt Sierra but the entire group adopted me. I have since became a volunteer and fostered for GLWR. It is a wonderful extended family who not only will do anything for the pups but also for the people in the group.  When I was adopting a loving dog I got a lot more than I expected and am proud to call everyone in this club my family.  If you are looking for an outstanding organization this is a gold star standard to go by.
Great Lakes Weimaraner Rescue, Inc.	320815		/users/profile/413751	Cindy233	Volunteer	5	01/03/2017	I adopted my Weimaraner Trent from Great Lakes Weimaraner Rescue, Inc.  They are well organized and care about getting a good match with the dogs they serve and potential adopters.  I also have volunteered to do home visits for this group over the years.  Trent is a certified pet therapy dog with Bright and Beautiful and volunteers in Michigan with the Fur Angels and Pet-a-Pet.  He also authored his own Love is a Dog and Some Crayons - Weimaraner Coloring Book that is available on Amazon and Barnes and Noble.com to benefit Great Lakes Weimaraner Rescue, an excellent rescue that helped him find his forever home with me.

He had been fostered for 13 months - between the US and Canada. I really appreciated the time and thoroughness that this organization  spent on ensuring these dogs would go to suitable homes with owners who know about this breed of dogs, their characteristics, and their needs. Being new to  having a dog, and one that had some behavioural issues, I really appreciated the willingness the members of this organization showed me to  help listen, understand and offer ideas to help me learn and work through these challenges with my adopted weim. He is a wonderful dog, and very much loved by both me and my entire neighbourhood. It has been an incredible experience to adopt a rescued dog, and to see him blossom and change into such a happy, loving, and playful good-natured dog. My life would not be the same without him. Thanks GLWR. I have had such a positive experience, and have spoken with many folks out hiking and walking dogs about this...several have adopted through GLWR since.

The love and care that the GLWR volunteers have for these pups was obvious from the moment I first spoke with our boy's foster mom. We were put through an extensive vetting process, which as an animal lover, I really appreciate. It's just as important to them as it is to me that these dogs ultimately find the perfect home. Words cannot describe how grateful we are to GLWR for bringing our Weimaraner, Jerry, into our lives. He is one of the best things that have ever happened to us, and it's all thanks to the amazing people at GLWR! When the time comes to add another Weim to our family, we know just the place to go! ;)

Great Lakes Weimaraner Rescue, Inc.	320751		/users/profile/413646	EnslenB	Volunteer	5	01/02/2017	I found GLWR when my 11 year old Weim had passed away and at the time I was looking to foster a Weim.  I picked up my first foster dog in June 2015 who was raised in a puppy mill.  The great people at this rescue provided so much support to me as I helped this dog that went from being scared of everything to loving life as a normal dog! We ended up keeping this foster dog for our family and we fostered another Weim for the rescue in 2016. The rescue is great in their efforts to rehabilitate the dogs so they can again become part of someone's family. I think the work they do is so important in educating potential adopters about how to care and train their new Weim since this breed is not for everyone.  I love working with this group and fostering for them. They are amazing!

Insideout Literary Arts Project	31123	5	/users/profile/32048	poet	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2010	As a poet-in-the-schools, a high school teacher of 35 years, a writer of 2 books on teaching writing, and a coordinator of writer/artist school visits, I value highly what InsideOut brings to the Detroit students. I donate yearly, buy the schools' anthologies to use in the schools where I work, and have just today watched two InsideOut writers in three classes (grades 3, 10, and 11, including a social studies class). Classroom teachers and students alike find the act of writing becomes genuinely engaging, as live and lively writers lead them through writing experiences that open their imaginations, develop their pleasure in language, and above all help them believe in themselves and in one another as individuals with the right to make their own artistic choices. Teachers see all these strengths can be transferred to the writing of expository, critical, and personal essays.Students who care about writing are more likely, also, to become reflective, appreciative readers--to "read as writers." Every child deserves the experiences offered by a strong writers-in-the-schools program like InsideOut.
Insideout Literary Arts Project	21504	8	/users/profile/22641	Carol	Donor	5	11/04/2009	As a professional writer and former educator and business owner, I was impressed with the fire and commitment to the InsideOut Literary Arts Project displayed by the Founder and Executive Director, Terry Blackhawk.  Her enthusiasm is contagious.  Since then, I have become a donor to this critical project that can change children's lives as they discover their creative selves and speak out.  I have read and been moved by the work of these children.  I have  met the artists who teach and give their deepest selves to keep this program alive and growing.  Detroit needs such voices, such belief and such commitment to succeed.

I look forward to working with InsideOut in the future. Kudos to Dr. Blackhawk and the entire staff!
Insideout Literary Arts Project	11714	10	/users/profile/13648	Dr.Dan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2009	I'm on the faculty of a state university, and became aware of Inside Out through alumni work. I am astonished at what Inside Out does, and wish that all of my incoming freshmen could've had the kind of experience that Inside Out provides. The program (1) teaches students to love words, ideas, and creative expression by encouraging them to work and play with words, ideas, and images (rather than merely receive words and images passively), and (2) by publishing their work, teaches students that their thoughts are important and worthy of consideration, and that they have a contribution to make to their community, to literature, and to society as a whole. Inside Out, then, jumpstarts both intellectual and civic engagement. Three cheers!
Insideout Literary Arts Project	11265	10	/users/profile/13207	Pat	Donor	5	09/29/2009	The creativity and quality shining through the poems written by students in the Inside Out program are a true inspiration to writers of all ages. Here is an idea that really works. Congratulations to all who participate in this fruitful effort.
Insideout Literary Arts Project	11252	5	/users/profile/13183	lsummer1	Former Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	I truly love this organization, the instructors who help teach students poetry and the professions who sometimes take time out to do a workshop with the students. I have been a member for this organization. I was embarrassed when I joined because I was the only freshman. Fortunately throughout time becoming a poet, your writing technique and stage presence gets stronger throughout the years. I am currently a nursing major at Eastern Michigan University. Although I don't perform poetry as much as I use to I feel no other poetry organization is better than InsideOut Citywide Poets. Maybe one year I will join the poetry society here. I continue to write when I can and have take a creative writing course and this semester Literature 102 where we evaluate different pieces of poetry throughout time. Ever since InsideOut, I don't think I would ever stop writing poetry. Performing is a bit more of a challenge but I learned a lot of techniques to get me prepared to perform in front of an audience. I love this organization and I hope that they will continue for many years to come so that children and teens have a chance to be apart of something unique and express their talent, feelings, creativity and poetry.

Williams Syndrome Association	147927	1	/users/profile/120065	Rebecca2345678	Client Served	5	01/10/2013	The Williams Syndrome Association has been a wonderful source of information and support to our family over the past 8 years.  
Williams Syndrome Association	141026	1	/users/profile/187252	MomToRobyn	Volunteer	5	11/18/2012	My son was diagnosed with Williams Syndrome by his cardiologist at 3 years old. I was terrified. The  first place our doctor told us to go was the Williams Syndrome Association. There I found an organization of caring people dedicated to helping families cope with all aspects of WS, providing valuable and accurate information about WS, spreading awareness in the educational and medical communities, supporting cutting edge research into the various medical and developmental issues of WS and connecting families so that they could share their experiences and resources. Through the WSA I met many other wonderful families on facebook. I now belong to a fabulous support group which is supported by the WSA. I am continually impressed by this organization which has been the most useful resource for WS I have found. They recently celebrated 30 years spent working to enhance the lives of those with Williams Syndrome...of all ages. I will forever be grateful to the WSA for all they have done and continue to do.    
Williams Syndrome Association	140418	3	/users/profile/186595	Mom to a beautiful girl with ws	Client Served	5	11/16/2012	My almost 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with Williams syndrome when she was only 3 months old.   I was totally unaware of Williams syndrome.  When I was first told about the array of health and cognitive issues she could possibly experience, I was numb...I asked, why me?...this wasnt supposed to happen, at least not to me?!  I had to take time to mourn the little girl I thought I had brought home from the hospital almost 4 months ago.  Grasp what I was just told and soak it all in.   	With such a rare condition, it can be a challenge to find information.  Although my pediatrician had heard of WS, she was not able to offer me much information except for what she found online.  Most information found on-line is frightening because there is more written about the extremes. I was determined to do everything I could to provide the best life that I could for my little girl, but it was a struggle finding any real life information from other WS families as well as accurate information from the experts.  I was very fortunate that my developmental pediatrician from Kennedy Kreiger knew exactly where to direct me!  She directed me right to the WSA.  With the help of the WSA, I was able to connect with local families in my area as well as an amazing Facebook network of families across the country. With their help and guidance I was able to connect with national Williams syndrome experts. I even took her to a the leading researchers for Williams syndrome at the Univ. of Kentucky Medical School where she was examined and tested. This has given me tremendous guidance in the areas we need to be concerned with in her development as well as suggestions on where to go for the proper counseling and therapy. Without the WSA my path as a newly diagnosed parent would not have been what it is was.  To be able to connect with others who live and breath what I live, to have the support network, the plethora of information from others that have had similar experiences,  and most importantly to have a place that I know I can reach out to at any given time for the best medical, educational, and emotional advice to help my daughter and the rest of my family is simply indescribable.  Their mission is not to find a cure for WS, because there is none, but rather to enrich the lives of individuals and families affected by William Syndrome and similar conditions through  support, research and education. The WSA is not just an organization, they are more like my extended family.  We are a community, who support each other and each others families.  It is such a different type of a bond, something that I never would have expected.  After finding them I did not feel so alone.  They got it and they were there for me!  And I can tell... they will be there for me and many, many other families who are finding how much they can benefit from the WSA resources. The WSA just celebrated their 30th year of helping families and making a difference in the lives of people with Williams syndrome.Every other year the WSA holds  a 3 day gathering of more than 1200 research educators, therapists, and various physicians who specialize in this condition, which all of us were so unaware of.    We just attended our first convention this past July of 2012 in Boston.  The  convention offered, in one place an ocean of resources and information to individuals with WS and their families. It was so wonderful to be filled with such important information that pertains to my daughter as well as meeting so many families that I have and will be able to connect with over the internet for support and real life pertinent information.   Not every family is as fortunate in having the opportunity to attend  and thankfully the WSA does provide scholarship funding for families that may not have the means to attend.   As I mentioned it is so important for me to devote all the time and energy possible in making the best life for both of my kids!  I am extremely grateful to the WSA for continuing to play a huge role in helping me do that for my daughter.  I truly feel indebted to them.
Williams Syndrome Association	140406	3	/users/profile/186582	WS mom	Client Served	5	11/16/2012	My son was diagnosed with Williams syndrome 20 years ago...never even heard of Williams Syndrome.....my son was in the hospital for failure to thrive...he had not been diagnosed at this point....another mother in the hospital who son had Williams Syndrome recommended that I contact a genetics doctor in Boston ( the mother thought my son had Williams Syndrome). I immediately contacted the doctor and days later my son was diagnosed with Williams Syndrome. 20 years ago there was not a blood test to determine Williams Syndrome...Diagnosis was made through various characteristics of the person. I remember asking the doctor now what, she handed me some papers and a card and said contact the WSA, they can help you with a lot of information and answer your questions. I contacted them and they provided a wealth of information. Additionally they connected me to other families in my area.  So 20 years later we are still members of the WSA. Because of the WSA and their dedication to Individuals with Williams Syndrome and their families so many things have changed in the WS community.. There is now a blood test (Fish) to diagnose WS. The WSA works with the top researchers and doctors to help gain knowledge and awareness about Williams Syndrome. The  conventions brings doctors who are familiar with WS and provide current information. What I love most about the WSA is they get it....they don't provide weighted blankets or leap pads to select individuals, they don't flood my email with invites to tupperware, avon or scentsy parties, what they provide  is knowledge, awareness, path to doctors, WS clinics, networking, social events, conventions, research studies, scholarships, all the ways to help enhance the lives of the greater Williams Syndrome Community. One of the best feelings and sure to bring a smile to your face is to see all of the wonderful friendships that our children have made from attending conventions and social events...what a great group of people.

Jaruad and my mother got into confrontation.  Jaruad tried to set the bathroom on fire. I just so, happened to go to a meeting with my sister and a lady was talking about mental health and different service. I explsin to her how Jaruad get up all the time out of his seat at school and he was falling in his grade and my youngest daughter was having the same issues.  The advocate gave me her number and I said, I was going to call her but, than I thought to myself hey, I'm not going there...that's for crazy people and my child is not crazy so, I prolomg going and the problems got worst.

I didn't want anybody to know I was receiving service from mental health so I asked for them to meet me some where else other than my house or me coming there.  My son Jaruad had to be locked up a year later because he wanted to kill himself and someone else and life started with me having to really advocate for my son.  If it wasn't for ACMH advocate I think I would have went crazy...not only did I get help for my son and daughter I also received service for my depression.  All of this made me see that it's okay to ask for help.  I could have never did this along and I with the help of ACMH I would have been lost and those old fears of the Mental Health Department would have still been in my head and I would have not gotten help for my family.  And to share something else personal.  My mother needed the help back in 1983 with my brother and he wanted to kill himself because my mother let him repeat the 3rd grade and 7 years later my brother went to juvenile and after that he went to prison.  But, the point of the story is that my brother needed help and my mother back than didn't know how to ask for help.  Deon (brother) when he went to see the mental health worker at the juvenile center the assessment stated that he had a IQ of a 3rd grader...Deon stopped learning in the 3rd grade and he started getting into trouble and hanging with the wrong crowd.  I'm glad this service is available now for family.
Association for Children's Mental Health	43294	7	/users/profile/44117	shareenmm	Client Served	5	06/08/2010	In 1999 after my son was diagnosed with a mental illness I became involved with ACMH. The staff provided me with education on my son's illness and the rights we had with the services being provided. The staff also encouraged me when times were tuff and celebrated with me during the good times. Someone was always available when support was needed. Resources were also given to me for my area that helped my family through the process of mental illness.
Association for Children's Mental Health	42654	12	/users/profile/43369	jrw	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/02/2010	As a School Social Worker, I have participated in many planning and placement meetings on behalf of students with educational disabilities.  On several ocassions I have colllaborated with family advocates from the Association For Children's Mental Health during these meetings.  The professionalism and advocacy demonstrated by the staff of this association did make a significant difference in the eventual outcome of services msde available to students.  Providing a service of this nature is invaluable to parents who otherwise may be intimidated by the school bureaucracy and give in to offers of service less than what would be needed to meet the student needs.
Association for Children's Mental Health	42649	10	/users/profile/43360	shawn5	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2010	I am the parent of two children with Mental Health challenges.  My oldest son is now an adult and my youngest son is a high school student.  Our journey began when our oldest son was four years old.  I began to notice that something was different.  He didn't react to situations that same as other children his age.  He had anger outburst and seemed to never sleep, he was impulsive and "had no fear".  We tried enrolling him in pre-school thinking he needed peer interaction.  (After all, I was an elementary school teacher at the time and should know what to do.)  Pre-school was an up hill battle with the school calling me on a daily basis to pick him up early due to his behaviors.  By the time he entered Kindergarten he had been removed from the school bus and was out of school more that he was in due to his disruptive behaviors.  The doctor put him a Ritalin and diagnosed him with ADHD.  That helped for a while.  In the 3rd grade we again had a bumpy school year.  This time we sent to a Phychologist and were giving an official diagnosis of ADHD and sent on our way.  More medications...more disruptive behaviors...more chaos is our lives.  During the 4th grade we were giving a referal to CMH and did the intake process.  For the first time we had help!!!  A therapist came out to the house once a week and after a few months we noticed a marked improvement!  Then came middle school...and another bumpy ride.  At this time my family and I made a difficult decission and I became a stay at home Mom.  I was getting called from the school daily to pick him up early due to his disruptive behaviors, anger outburst and refusal to cooperate.  Once again we were involved with CMH and had a therapist at the house on a weekly basis.  During this time the therapist mentioned ACMH and new pilot program, IMPACT.  ACMH had a job posting for Family Advocates and the therapist felt I could help families going through the same the journey.  After much discussion, my family and I thought the time was right and maybe, just maybe our journey could help others.  Five years later I am still employed with ACMH and my children have benefited so much along the way also.  My son will be graduating from high school this month...something many teachers told us along the way would never happen.  My youngest son is very involved in ACMH.  He belongs to the youth group and attends many youth events thoughout the year.  He has gained a knowledge of how to share his story and help others in their journey.  I don't know where we would be today without the help we have recieved. ACMH is a wonderful place to be...and wonderful experience on an awesome journey.  ACMH has given my family the courage to keep trying and keep going.

Camp Michi-MAC	50566	8	/users/profile/51081	susieq231	Client Served	5	08/17/2010	Camp Michi-Mac is truly a gift from God himself. We are raising our granddaughter who has Cystic Fibrosis. She is an active 8 year old who loves the outdoors, animals, water and being with other children. Unfortunately, she faces daily challenges due to Cystic Fibrosis. The disease affects her lungs and breathing requiring her to use many daily medications.These include inhalers and nebulizers and oral medications. Daily physical therapy is necessary to keep her lungs functioning properly and prevent mucus build-up. She also has medication that she has to take everytime she eats so that her food will diqest and her body can obsorb the nutrients along with nutritional supplement several times daily. This is way more than normal summer camps are equiped to deal with so we believed that she would never be able to participate in this wonderful childhood experience. Thanks to Camp Michi-Mac and the wonderful staff there, my granddaughter was able to spend a week enjoying the ability to be "normal". She partipated in all of the camp activities including horseback riding and had an absolutely fantastic time. The staff there took great care of her and handled all of her medical needs and physical therapy without a single problem. I cannot praise them enough for what they have done for us and what they do for all of the children who attend each year. Without them, these kids would not be able to experience this wonderful part of being young and learning about independance and the natural world that we live in.Thank God for Camp Michi-Mac!

This was an experience for her that we thought she would never be able to do because of the many medical needs relating to her diseae. The staff at Michi-Mac were very dedicated, caring and professional.  They took her under their wing and made sure that even though her medical needs were different from the  other campers, that she was able to do them and still join all the  camp activities.  Do to the great staff in this organization, my granddaughter had the best summer of her life and is looking forward already to next year.  Thank you to Mary and all the other staffers at Camp- Michi-Mac.  I really appreciate your dedication and hard work to provide this services for those campers with disabilities that would not be able to have this experience without you.

I am so pleased with the level of care and friendliness this organization shows.  They take their time and make sure to answer emails and send forms as promised. It is  very professionally run. They make it possible for families with needs, medical and/or financial, to have this great camp adventure. Thank you.
Camp Michi-MAC	50013	5	/users/profile/50701	bigmamma48	General Member of the Public	4	08/10/2010	In 2004 at the age of ten I began contemplating camp for my daughter; however, in October of this year she was hospitalized in intensive care for an acute asthma attack. After this very frightening experience sending her to away camp was no longer an option for me because of her asthma. At my daughter's follow up visit to the pulmonolgist's office I was approached by one of the nurses who mentioned an asthma camp, Camp Michi-Mac and provided me with an application. Still apprehensive I did complete the application, my daughter was accepted and has attended Camp Michi-Mac every summer since. Upon arriving at the camp site seeing the full medical staff of Camp Michi-Mac all my fears, concerns and apprehensions disspated. I am forever thankful for Camp Michi-Mac and their very competent staff, not to mention they exceeded my expectations. Without Camp Michi-Mac my daughter would not have had the chance to experience camp which I believe every child should at least once in a lifetime. Camp Michi-Mac is truly a worthwhile organization and will contine to have my full support in donations.
Camp Michi-MAC	49445	6	/users/profile/50661	deborah15	Volunteer	5	08/09/2010	Camp Michi-MAC provides an outdoor camping experience for children with asthma. They are in a safe and healthy environment. Because the campers have close health supervision, they can enjoy the full camping experience at a premier Michigan camp. I am honored to be a part of the volunteer staff.
Camp Michi-MAC	49409	5	/users/profile/50610	lauren15	Volunteer	5	08/08/2010	This organization is truly wonderful. It provides an opportunity for children with asthma to run through fields, hike in forests, swim in a lake, climb a rock wall, ride horses, participate in campfires...all things that they would otherwise have difficulty doing due to their asthma. The terrific team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists are on-hand around the clock to provide any medical care that a camper may need. At first, some campers feel timid about participating in activities that they know would normal lead to an asthma flair-up. In these instances, the staff works with the camper to help them understand that with the proper medicine routine, they can participate just like any other camper! My role as a volunteer is somewhat different. My background is in education and I have much experience working, not only in schools, but in the summer camp field. I was on hand to assist with organizing and managing camper paperwork. I also helped with a variety of educational activities that teach the campers many different things, such as asthma triggers and how to properly read their peak flow meters. Lastly, I was on-hand to assist with any camper behavior issues. This can range from slight homesickness for first time campers (which usually tapers off after the second day they are at camp) to campers that need extra encouragement to make positive choices.In conclusion, this organization not only gives the  campers' a healthy experience for their bodies but also for their soul!I will leave you with a few of the many incredible things that happen everyday at Camp Michi-Mac: - Watching a child who is allergic to hay and animal dander ride on a horse for the first time... Amazing!- Sitting back and observing a child who has difficulty running without using their inhaler climb to the top of a 60 foot rock climbing wall... Awe-inspiring!- Seeing a group of children with asthma sitting around a campfire, singing songs, roasting marshmallows, and not having an asthma attack because of the smoke, well, that is perfection!

I was told that yes he was scare and wanted to come home cause he doesn't like bugs, but once I pick him up and ask him do he want to come back next year and I was surprise and he said yes.  I never knew that it was a camp for kids who have asthma.  I've already told family and friends about the camp and I will remind them next year and my son will be there.  Now he know what to expect and won't be scared.

Forever Friends Network	303585	2	/users/profile/394761	BettyDecker	Board Member	5	09/12/2016	Before I knew about Forever Friends Network, my teenage son was isolated without friendships and I prayed for help daily. I am 100% committed to FFN's cause and our families. As parents of kids on the Autism Spectrum, we often feel hopeless and even alone. Something as simple as our child having a friend, is something that doesn't come easy when they are often judged and perceived as "weird" by their peers that are not on the Autism Spectrum. FFN has not only given my son the chance to make true friendships, but as a bonus I have an amazing group of parents that I have pulled support from. Autism doesn't feel so lonely anymore. My son has come along way in the past 5 months and I owe my thanks to FFN and the wondrful families that it is made up from. The picture is my son Draven. I can not express how much this picture means to me. His smile is priceless and is because he is attending a social meeting at FFN at the time that it was taken. He is filled with undeniable happiness because he has found the one place so far that he fits.

Kala Project	209039		/users/profile/271800	PDaniel	Client Served	5	08/07/2014	The guys from Kala Projects are amazing! When we told them the story about this eight year old boy with autism who can identify our windchimes just by hearing them play, they were inspired. By the time they arrived to film, they had a clear vision of what they wanted to do and not only did all the clips they took look great (including the ones that I thought had no chance of looking good on camera - shows you what I know!), but they all worked together to support the story. The result was a video that was better than we could have dreamed.  What's more, the "Kala Krew" as I came to call them, were polite, were able to communicate their vision and what was needed to make that happen, and were just all around nice guys. They involved Tyler in the film-making process, making him more relaxed with an unusual situation. This resulted in some great clips of Tyler, both at our offices, at the hotel and elsewhere. Some of the filming took place in my home, and the Kala Krew became interior decorators as they rearranged the furniture for the best effect. Much to my surprise, before they left, the Kala Krew had put everything back where it belonged and I had very little clean up to do. (Thanks guys!) Can't wait to do another project with them!

Last Day Dog Rescue Inc	157804	3	/users/profile/209266	LDDRsucker	General Member of the Public	1	05/13/2013	Last Day Dog Rescue is basically a scam that steals money from unsuspecting people who want to adopt a dog or other animal.  They first require that the person and their home is approved, and if it is, they are then determined to get the person to adopt immediately to "save a dog's life."  So, adoptions are done without all the relevant information or time spent with the dog to get to know what its personality is like. The adopter is required to sign a "contract" that states that the adoption fee, hundreds of dollars, will not be refunded if the adopted animal is returned for "any reason."  So, when the adoption fails, as is often the case, because the dog has some disease or disability, is not spayed or neutered, is not house-broken or even lived in a house before, is not trained to walk on a leash or come to its name, etc, including many other problems that can come up when adoptions are rushed and manipulated on unsuspecting people who cannot spend 24 hours a day to care for a dog with many problems, LDDR keeps the adoption fee and turns around and collects another adoption fee from another sucker.

They place a high-value on finding each animal a loving family with a healthy environment, which ensures adoptions are sound and secure.Afterwards, I've received countless emails from friends and acquaintances that they ALSO have adopted their dog(s) from LDDR.

Michigan Pet Fund Alliance	189284		/users/profile/88407	Cheryl	Donor	5	11/25/2013	Michigan Pet Fund Alliance is a progressive organization that takes a leadership role in promoting the no-kill movement and best practices to protect the rights of our shelter animals.  In my work with the organization, I found them to be responsive and committed to the animals and always willing to assist in promoting animal welfare.   A wonderful organization with outstanding leadership. I highly recommend them.      
Michigan Pet Fund Alliance	189283		/users/profile/247018	Tanyahil	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/25/2013	Michigan Petfund Alliance is a highly effective organization that provides critical leadership, education and advocacy for homeless animals and animal welfare groups.  Our state is fortunate to have MPFA advancing the cause of saving the lives of our beloved companion animals and stemming over-population.
Michigan Pet Fund Alliance	189277		/users/profile/233232	Carrie54	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/25/2013	Our animals are very fortunate to have the Michigan Pet Fund Alliance in their corner.  MPFA is ALWAYS willing to step up and help shelters improve, to educate and influence policy makers and to support anyone advocating for animal welfare/protection.  I count myself very fortunate to have firsthand experience working with this group.  Not only am I much more knowledgeable and informed, my family (including my pets) lives in a better community because of this group.
Michigan Pet Fund Alliance	151177	1	/users/profile/201752	kmou	Board Member	5	03/16/2013	I have served on other boards of non-profits, but this one is exemplary.  The mission of saving animals is foremost in everything they do, often at personal expense. 
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	122980		/users/profile/167539	Captain Greybeard	Board Member	5	09/24/2012	The Fox Island Lighthouse Association was founded in October 2004, initiated by Sandra Bradshaw of Suttons Bay, MI, and seconded by my humble self, an old sailor and lighthouse buff from Switzerland, and John McKinney of Traverse City, former Seagrant Agent. Our goal was to save the lonesome light station on South Fox Island, 17 nautical miles off the mainland in Lake Michigan, abandoned by the US Coast Guard in 1959 and left to decay. By recruiting the right people, doing a lot of publicity work (Sandra is a writer and journalist), building a network of connections to the relevant authorities (the station will be MI state land "in perpertuity" according to a deed from 1971), and volunteering thousands of hours of hard physical work at the station, the decay has been stopped. A Historic Structures Report was drawn up and submitted to the State Historic Preservation Office a few months ago. Real restoration of the structures (seven buildings, one of the biggest light station complexes in the USA!) will be allowed depending on the outcome of the assessment of the the report. Very much has already been achieved, but much more will have to be done in the future. We are determined to take up the challenge, which includes tackling huge transportation and financial problems and a constant fight against weather, because there is no harbor on the island. 
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	112532		/users/profile/153169	Jcoop	Board Member	4	05/21/2012	This small non-profit effort to help preserve the most complete lightstation in the Great Lakes has been an amazing 6 year experience.  We have captured this journey on our web site - photos, narratives, meeting minutes, public input - and I suggest you start there. foxisland.com
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	111799		/users/profile/152202	Trillium	Advisor	5	05/11/2012	This n/p was founded in 2004 by a dedicated group of locals who were (still are) determined to keep the 7 building complex on South Fox from falling into disrepair. The Board of Trustees has been conservative in their financial issues. The lareges expense is fuel for their boat rides to and from the island. A small, but well run and  organized group.       
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	111623		/users/profile/151986	Karen69	Volunteer	5	05/09/2012	The Fox Island Lighthouse Association is an all-volunteer group dedicated to stabilizing and restoring the light station complex on the publically-owned section of the island.  In addition, members have been active in doing oral histories and collecting historical documentation of the station.  Our budget is currently small (mostly covering fuel and materials we cant get donated) but will increase as we take on bigger projects.  Please help!  Its a very unique and special place.
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	110713		/users/profile/150701	miboatlady	Board Member	5	04/25/2012	If you have a connection with light houses South fox light station is one of the most unique places in northern Michigan. Not just a lighthouse the station has 7 structures still standing including an oil house, fog signal building, boat house, work shop and a 3 apartment assistant keepers quarters. Its one of the only stations to have had TWO lights operating through its history. The original lighthouse was first lit in 1867, the second light is a steel tower transported in 1934 from Sapalo Island in Georgia. The station operated for 102 years and was decommissioned in 1969. South Fox Island is one of 7 islands that dot their way up to Mackinaw Island. the station itself is 115 acres and sits on the southern tip. Rich in history it is recorded that even Mrs. Lincoln once stopped there while cruising the lake. More than 65 different men and their families served as keepers at the station while in operation. It was not a very desired or comfortable appointment: Isolated (19 miles from shore) location, wicked, extreme weather, and long hours. But the views are spectacular and fishing was in abundance. The location was key for navigation signals and overcoming challenges made the men strong and ground fertile.  Fox Island Lighthouse Association is committed to stabilizing, restoring and preserving this unique bit of maritime history. One day the station will be an educational environment for many to learn what island life was like and the sacrifices made to ensure the safety of boaters in the past and become a safe port for boaters in the future.  
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	102739		/users/profile/135433	gary.stauffer5	Volunteer	5	12/30/2011	As a volunteer at South Fox Island Lighthouse I can personally say it is one of the most beautiful and secluded spots in Lake Michigan. We are a small, dedicated group of people who have a mission and we wish to share this expierence with others. Check out the web site and read the history of this maritime jewel.
Fox Island Lighthouse Association	102324		/users/profile/133142	south fox	Volunteer	5	12/15/2011	The Fox Island Lighthouse Associaton (FILA) is an all volunteer...no paid staff... that is focused on the restoration/stabilization of the 7 building campus at the southern tip of South Fox Island in Northern Lake Michigan.  We work with the State of Michigan, who owns the light station to enhance, restore and slowly develop this very unique setting. Two lighthouses are among the several out buildings at the campus. No safe harbor or anchorage is available making trips sometimes hazaderous. 
Wings of Mercy	113057	2	/users/profile/153862	April V.	Client Served	5	05/26/2012	This is something that I should have done a long time ago, but I couldn't find the right page! I'm not very good with computers but had my daughter show me enough to be able to write a review about this organization.I have had to go to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minesotta for life saving treatment and without this organization I would have died months ago. The entire problem of transportation was taken care of from start to finish.The person on the phone( I believe her name was Sharron)had a kind,patient voice. She re-assured me that they could help and sure enough they did. If I were to drive,it would take me 12-14 hours and absolute torture to get there. I live on the Upper peninsula of Michigan.Sharron told me that they had a varity of pilots that volunteered their time to fly people in financial hardship to medical appointments.One of the diseases that I have is only treated in two hospitals in this country. Boston and Rochester.She told me to pick which one!! I was there in 3 hours!The pilots were amazing. They made sure that my husband and I were very comfortable and had everything we needed. They even showed us the equipment that they used and showed us points of interest. The quilt to keep my legs warm was the icing on the cake. One even shared his cookies!!!They were so kind that it made me cry.I have had to go back 6 times in the past year and will have to go back in June.This organization can litterally say that they saved my life because they did. I've told everyone I know about them and when I'm a little stronger my husband, daughter and myself will be holding a benefit concert for them to help raise money so that they can continue to do this incredible service.They deserve it and don't even ask for it.This is something that I and my family will never,ever be able to thank them enough for. God bless them and keep them safe.Just when you think that there is no hope,something like this pops up. Thankyou once again, all of you. My love and greatfullness always, Lee Ann Vigliotti.
Wings of Mercy	93319		/users/profile/107227	Marsha	Client Served	5	07/02/2011	I would like to thank Ray Bine from Frankenmuth, Mi. He was so very helpful in getting my husband a flight home from Madison, Wi. after his kidney transplant. Between him and the social worker at the hospital everything was worked out. We were not aware of this organization and are very thankful that it does exsist. It was a nine hour drive from Kimball, Mi. to Madison, Wi. Very stressful and it was nighttime trying to drive in a unfamiliar area. My daughter and I had to leave for home due to work schedules. And we sure are glad not to have that drive again, especially on this fourth of July weekend. Thanks again to all involved. God Bless.  Marsha Schambre

Wings of Mercy	91627		/users/profile/104899	chusmom	Client Served	5	06/22/2011	A little over 4 years ago I was told I needed to go to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota for further evaluation of a rare congenital heart defect. I really didn't know what to do as there was no way I could afford to travel that far. Thankfully, I found Wings of Mercy and they helped me get there not only then, but also for my subsequent surgeries and follow-ups, even going so far as flying my friend out to be with me so I didn't have to go through my second surgery alone. I will forever be grateful 
Wings of Mercy	89813	1	/users/profile/102304	Glenn J.	Volunteer	5	06/07/2011	In the past I have been quite active with this organization and can state unequivocally that they do a great service for people who otherwise would be wiped out by the cost of transportation for medical treatment or simply would have to forgo the treatment and suffer the consequences, which often would be death.  All involved with Wings of Mercy will go to great lengths to fill the needs of suffering people.  It is a caring organization and it exists for all of the right reasons.  Many passengers have sent me heartfelt Thank You cards and letters that I will keep for the rest of my life as a reminder of the lives that WOM has touched.  One time while walking down a sidewalk an approaching woman suddenly cried out "My pilot!" and ran to me.   I had flown her husband for repeated cancer treatments that allowed him a chance to spend a few more years with his young family that included  children under 5 yrs old.   She won't forget it- neither will I.None of the 100+ pilots get paid for their time or dedication to Wings of Mercy and the scheduling office runs as lean as it gets.  Good people all around.    
Wings of Mercy	89797		/users/profile/102277	Patient	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2011	Wings of Mercy always treated us with grace and professionalism no matter what pilots flew us. They made our journey a better one for all they did.

Catherines Health Center	121953		/users/profile/165998	Shelli Zomer	Board Member	5	09/06/2012	I have been involved with Catherines Health Center since it began in 1996.  From the small nurse run clinic in the dark basement of a church to the first Gold LEED certified clinic in Michigan, the growth has been nothing short of amazing.  A Clinical Staff of Doctors, Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, RNs and Medical Assistants treat patients with compassion and dignity.  The Administrative Staff, from the Executive Director, Development Director, Front Office Personnel and VISTA Workers, is second to none.  And the 200+ volunteers make this clinic possible. I am honored and blessed to be associated with such a caring, giving and humble group of people.  They make Catherine's Health Center a quality place for health care.

I'm so impressed with the care they provide, always with heartfelt passion and commitment. The work I do as a volunteer helps communicate the vital role that Catherine's plays in the healthcare safety net... to provide medical care to the uninsured and under-insured residents of our community who have nowhere else to go.

Catherines Health Center	120805		/users/profile/164358	Cynthia35	Client Served	5	08/16/2012	In 2007 I was self employed and caring for my disabled husband. When health issues forced me to stop working, I had no insurance and no money for health care, but I knew I needed help.  No one was available for my issues, until I stumbled on Catherines Health Center. At that time they were located in the basement of a church, and they were life savers.  They found me help for my issues and even surgery when it was needed. Since then my life has really changed with a chronic illness, but they continue to provide support when ever I need it.  They are awesome caring people dedicated to provide quality service. 
Catherines Health Center	120740		/users/profile/164260	Sarah71	Volunteer	5	08/15/2012	Volunteering at Catherine's has helped me realize how important and essential it is to have access to health care.

Catherines Health Center	120627		/users/profile/164082	Marcie K.	Client Served	5	08/14/2012	I had let a lump in my breast go for several years because I had no insurance, when I finally confided in my sister she and her boyfriend  called Catherines care for me to see if I could be seen there, they explained my situation to them and they got me in right away for only ten  dollars. I had no job at the time so they worked and got me funded because it turned out I had stage 3b breast cancer. They were a God send and helped me so much. Without then I might not be here today. They set me up with Lack's Cancer Center and I am still here. In fact it was 5 years ago this month that I first went to Catherines care and was diagnosed by Lacks with the breast cancer. Thanks to my sister, her boyfriend ,Catherines and Lack's I am a 5 year survivor...God bless everyone and every agency that helped me.
Catherines Health Center	120294		/users/profile/163606	rlrr	Client Served	5	08/09/2012	Ever since 1995 I owned a small business and I had health insurance.  In early 2008 work was getting scarce and I had to cancel the insurance because of the lack of work.  Around the same time I needed health care so i somehow remembered that Catherine's was a walk in clinic so I made an appointment.  Dr Walen listened to my symptoms at which time he took a simple blood test and he diagnosed diabetes.  He gave me samples of the supplies I needed and provided followup care.  Six months later I was very fatigued and I remembered Catherine's so I made an appointment.  Karen listened to my symptoms and she took a blood test which showed a very low red blood cell count.  She (and Dr Walen) told me to immediately go to the hospital for followup care.  I went to Saint Mary's Hospital and a few days later I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with 95% of my blood cells were cancerous.  I was admitted for 6 weeks of chemo at the Lacks Cancer Center which brought remission and a few months after that I was admitted for 3 months in Detroit for a Bone Marrow Transplant.  Since my transplant I have been back to Catherine's only to tell them "Thank You"for saving my life.  I was later told that if I had waited a few weeks more in going to the hospital for chemo I wouldn't have made it.  This is why Catherine's holds a special place in my heart.

2-1-1 Northeast Michigan	320114		/users/profile/412257	Computer1	Client Served	1	12/14/2016	I thought that 211 was supposed to help people. I called 211 for help and they connected me with a food pantry. When the food pantry called me she was first of all very rude to me and furthermore treated me like a child. She asked me all kinds of questions about me and my family and even scoffed at some of my answers and then basically denied me saying i needed further proof that i needed help. She didn't even say goodbye, just hung up. I felt very insulted and destitute. I was completely embarrassed.  I will search elsewhere and NEVER call 211 again for "HELP"

Teen Hype	142089	1	/users/profile/186614	Tiana T.,	General Member of the Public	5	11/22/2012	I became aware of Teen HYPE a couple of years ago when invited to attend one of their productions. The organization made a lasting impression on my children as well as myself. We continue to attend these performances annually. The impact Teen HYPE has on their youth is innumerable. I've witnessed young people who were shy and timid come out of their shell, becoming outspoken and bold, as a direct result of being involved in this program. It is awe-inspiring. My son and I look forward to him becoming of age and being involved with Teen HYPE to benefit from all the organization has to offer. 
Teen Hype	144457	1	/users/profile/190993	Myriha B.	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I joined Teen H.Y.P.E my Sophomore year of high school and have been a part of their family every since! As a Junior in college at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, I can honestly say I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Teen HYPE. I have a scholarship for Hip-Hop/ Theater and Spoken word when before joining Teen HYPE, I only had a few verses written in tattered notebooks and spoken word poetry just wasn't something I was doing. They encouraged me pursue both and playwriting and acting. They supported me immensely throughout my high school career and continue to  do so even though I'm too old for the program. I recommend all of the youngstas I know from back home to join Teen HYPE. It's an environment they can be themselves and where their skills and interest will be honed (not to mention it keeps youth off the streets and promotes positivity). I don't know where I'd be without Teen HYPE. When I make my first million dollars, $100,000 is going to the program and they can hold me to that!
Teen Hype	143670	1	/users/profile/190142	amy.s.peterson	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	  Teen HYPE is an organization serving youth with heart, integrity, and commitment.  As a founding Board member, I am proud of how the organization has grown while remaining faithful to its mission, and the youth we serve.  The core staff, and new recruits alike take pride in their work, and strive every day to make the lives of Detroit youth better; that is worthy of celebration and praise. Whether attending the annual play, hanging out with parents and kids at the Thanksgiving dinner, serving refreshments, or attending a Board meeting, I am honored to be a part of the Teen HYPE family.
Teen Hype	141537	1	/users/profile/187888	Asandi	Board Member	4	11/20/2012	Prior to joining the board, my daughter begrudingly auditioned for Teen HYPE in 2009.  A poet since age 5 she was shy about her talent and preferred to allow others to shine.  However, Ms. Red, Mrs. Hudson and Ms. Joy were patient with her, and nurtured and encouraged her to share her gift with her peers and the community.  The staff's positive influence has helped shape her leadership skills and opened the door to new friendships and connections with teens throughout the state and country that she otherwise may not have experienced without Teen HYPE.  Today she speaks passionately about Teen HYPE, the staff and the organization's bright future.  Teen HYPE is restoring hope to Metropolitan Detroit one teen at a time so come see what the HYPE is all about.
Teen Hype	140644	2	/users/profile/186845	Judy Asman	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	When I was first introduced to Teen HYPE (Helping Youth by Providing Education), it was thanks to their executive director finding me on LinkedIn to help them rewrite their Web content. I knew the moment I started my research that this project would be an important experience for me professionally. What I did not expect was that it would turn out to be a significant personal journey as well. Based in Detroit, Teen HYPE offers programs for urban teens that are wholistic. They not only cover the logistics to make sure they're educating teens about how to lead positive and healthy lives, but beyond that, their staff and board members are personally devoted to helping each teen succeed. And the results are phenomenal. They've guided students through the most trying experiences urban youth can face: violence, addiction, neglect or abuse in the home, peer pressure leading to poor choices, and risk of HIV or teen pregnancy. When I bought their DVDs featuring the annual community plays their teens produce, I was able to see first-hand how their students understand the lessons that Teen HYPE teaches them on a cellular level. I was moved beyond words by the subject matter and the acting. Later, I flew to Detroit and volunteered at their HIV-prevention summer block party. There I met their staff, board members, and the teens on whom they have life-changing influence. It's incredible how teens who join Teen HYPE are forever a part of their family. They turn to the organization years after graduating for guidance on how to simply live life. It was an incredible day volunteering for Teen HYPE, and equally so as I had the honor to rewrite their Web content, promote their efforts in Chase Community Giving, and overall get to know them on a profound level. I believe with all my heart that Teen HYPE defines greatness. They make important and courageous contributions in a city that, these days anyway, the media rarely portrays in a positive light. What they're doing as we speak will have an impact on lives for generations to come. I can't say enough wonderful things about this organization. I truly love them and appreciate the impact they've had on my own heart and soul.
Teen Hype	140350	1	/users/profile/77085	ShardeF	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Teen Hype is an excellent organization. Detroit needs a positive impact/inspiration for it's youth these days, now more than ever. As an alum, I know personally the influence that Teen Hype has on it's youth whether they are a part of the organization or witnessing their work. Such programs instill a sense of hope for the future. Promoting positive, healthy lifestyles was a way for me to meet other youth that shared my interests as well as build my own character through education and the performing arts. Its disheartening to hear a teen say they have never been to summer camp or a part of a youth group because I know the extensive amount of enrichment they have missed out on and the drastic effect that such groups as Teen Hype can have on a teen even years later when they have become a young adult like myself. May God bless Teen Hype and the live that they have changed and will continue to enrich.
Life For Relief and Development	287044		/users/profile/377116	Hebatullah_I	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	In the summer of 2006 the Middle East was ravaged with war between politicians and factions in which innocent civilians paid the deadliest price. The images of maimed children, dying youth and pain stricken eyes not only moved me, but it shook me. It quaked my soul and threw my body into a spiral of grief that I refused to allow to continue. A group of students who were as stubborn as I was to make a change came together to try and plan a benefit concert at NYU. The concert wasnt the most successful, but I couldnt accept failure. Failure wasnt an option I manifested my guilt in failing and used all my energy to organize a fundraiser of sorts through the help of Life for Relief and Development. I asked my local ISCJ to provide a room to collect donations. ISCJ made announcements to its congregation asking for non-perishable foods, new or like new clothes, first aid supplied, diapers, feminine products and other necessary needs refugees and the wounded could use to rebuild their everyday lives.  I also advertised online and emailed local houses of worship from every religion. We received so many donations in the room we were storing them in that the piles were taller than any of us. I enlisted some 20 volunteers to organize, label and load the products onto a 18-wheeler flatbed tractor trailer container. We filled the entire container. The boxes that Life for Relief and Development werent enough. My family went out and bought more boxes out of pocket. We even had products that we couldnt fit in the container because the container was at capacity. Those products we then chose to donate to local charity bodies suggested by the ISCJ. http://www.lifeusa.org/site/PageServerhttp://iscj.org/

They are very tough when it comes to allocating resources, since donor is a very invalueable asset to the organization.
Life For Relief and Development	24085	1	/users/profile/25195	Rasim	General Member of the Public	5	12/15/2009	This organization is right where the help is most needed and acting fast when emergency strikes.

Faiths Angels Inc	140115		/users/profile/186282	Deanna T.	Donor	5	11/15/2012	Great organization.  Does a great job raising awareness of congenital heart defects and raising funds to support research into CHDs.  They put a lot of energy into this very important cause.  If you are looking for an organization to support, please give serious consideration to this one.  Currently, there is so little public health research funds spent to learn about and develop better treatment options for something that affects so many of the babies born (approximately 1 in 100 in the United States).  Every dollar counts and this organization delivers. 
Faiths Angels Inc	137233		/users/profile/183197	Marikje H.	General Member of the Public	4	11/12/2012	I am so proud to know Monica and her family, and to be able to support Faith's Angels and their work for infants with heart defects.  They have wonderful awareness and fundraising opportunities such as the annual White Caps baseball game, Sparta Town & Country days, and most recently, a craft show I was able to donate some homemade items to.  I know their works are making a differnece!
Faiths Angels Inc	111957		/users/profile/152352	Jennifer94	Donor	4	05/12/2012	We have a son with a heart defect and we wanted to help fund research to better understand heart defects, why they occur and how they can best be treated.  Faith's Angels is providing funding for research at the University of Michigan and prides itself on directing 80% of its funding to the cause.  We have not found another organization with this kind of track record that directs its funding directly for congenital heart defects.  Keep up the great work!
Faiths Angels Inc	111916		/users/profile/152310	Angie9	Volunteer	5	05/12/2012	Couldn't be more proud of this organization and all it stands for! Helping bring awareness to such a HUGE roll in peoples lives and the lives of their children. Great information, great support, and a powerful tool to help anyone that has a heart 
Faiths Angels Inc	91551		/users/profile/104783	Monica G.	Board Member	5	06/21/2011	My husband and I founded Faith's Angels in memory of our daughter Faith Rose.  She was born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, meaning she had no left ventricle.  Since her diagnosis and death we have learned so much about heart defects as a whole.  It is our hope that we can change the future for children like her to have a better quality of life and a higher chance of suvival.  Faith's Angels raises awareness for heart defects through various media outlets and family friendly fundraisers.  EIGHTY percent of funds received go directly to heart defect research. Did you know that approximately 35,000-40,000 babies will be born in the US alone with a heart defect this year and TEN percent (4,000) won't live to see their first birthday.  So Faith's Angels is here to help change the odds for babies, children and adults living with all forms of heart defects. It is our extreme joy to see each baby that makes it through surgery and pass each milestone as research improves.
Faiths Angels Inc	91026		/users/profile/103992	cjneffiii	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	 This is a great organization that does a wonderful job raising awareness for heart defects! They are very active in the community and the community support they receive is awesome. The president works tirelessly for this very special organization. Every year they have a big fundraising event that the whole community supports more and more each year.

Comforting to know that perhaps someone is reading because of his belief in donation!  Yes....he was a supporter.  We had talked about it when he turned 6 and there was a program on about organ/tissue donation!  He truly understood and could not figure out why anyone wouldn't donate!
Michigan Eye-Bank	121863		/users/profile/165837	jtislerics	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/04/2012	I've worked side-by-side with the Michigan Eye-Bank for almost a dozen years.  They impress me with their level of commitment to the people they serve - the Eye-Bank doesn't just speak to community members, they are part of the community.  In addition to helping restore vision, they work to prevent the need for their own services by encouraging health and safety in regards to people's eyes.  Remarkable!
Michigan Eye-Bank	121748		/users/profile/165658	Jessica65	Donor	5	08/31/2012	I feel that donating to this non-profit was an excellent choice. I know that the Michigan Eye-Bank makes such a difference in the lives of so many people. This organization was able to provide the gift of sight to nearly 1,000 Michigan residents last year alone. But they don't stop there, they also provide tissue all across the United States and even Internationally, improving lives worldwide! What a wonderful cause to donate to!

Darling Cetaceans	237033		/users/profile/321318	Alyssa16	Board Member	5	01/19/2015	Darling Cetaceans has assimilated to the Great Lakes region by forming lasting relationships with other local organizations to implement educational projects.  Events and presentations concerning marine mammals effectively engage children of all ages to help  highlight local connections to the marine world. Educators with Darling Cetaceans offer excellent factual instruction, with a focus on ensuring that students understand the importance of stewardship to the overall health of our waters.
Darling Cetaceans	84304		/users/profile/93486	Jenn	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2011	Every year Darling Cetaceans helps promote education to students and the community alike by bringing their program to classrooms, scouting and community events nationwide! They bring the exciting world of marine mammals to areas where children might not ever come into contact with them. In doing so, they inspire future generations to join conservation efforts to protect marine mammals and the environment at large. Every Earth Day I look forward to taking my children to community events and without a doubt, their favorite exhibit is always Darling Cetaceans!
Darling Cetaceans	83331		/users/profile/92272	Jeuls	Volunteer	5	03/26/2011	I had the pleasure to volunteer for a non profit organization called Darling Cetaceans (DC) for a few years and it is certainly more than just Dolphins and Whales!  Within those fun few years I was expanding the public knowledge about marine mammals and environmental stewardship. We had various informational booths and hands on activity games for the children to engage in to grasp the concept of learning about marine mammals and the environment year round.  Not to mention parades at the Muskegon lakeshore and working with the local Girl Scouts and helping them earn a scout badge that DC has created.  DC offers outreach programs as well. The company website is a great tool for students in high school or in college, or rather  anyone that wants to look up information on certain marine mammal.   DC is  fun to volunteer for. Not only do you get to learn about marine mammals and the environment, but also you have the satisfaction of seeing the wonder in a childs eye as they point to a Norwal tusk at your booth as they ask what that is. When you tell them their eyes fill up with wonder and the questions start flowing.  As the years went on I thought I was the one who was doing all the teaching to the public but on the contrary DC was teaching me how to be more patient and a better citizen in my community. I have so many fun memories with DC and I encourage anyone who wants to get involved with their community contact DC to volunteer.  Its an awarding experience you will never forget!!
Darling Cetaceans	82261		/users/profile/90538	Jennifer D.	Board Member	5	03/15/2011	This is a great organization that comes to your classroom with great hands on materials.   Where else could you touch a dolphin skull and a narwhal tusk while sitting in your desk at school.  DARLING CETACEANS provides the link of the enviornment with your classroom and link it to the environment no matter where you live.  The ocean meets your classroom no matter what.  
Darling Cetaceans	81728		/users/profile/89598	FRCCarol	Client Served	5	03/10/2011	Darling Cetaceans has led 2 education programs for events I have organized.  The information and teaching style is excellent for the children they lead.  They provide visual and interactive activities for children to understand their part in the global community.  The efforts of Darling Cetaceans to educate the public about our oceans are to be highly commended and encouraged in the water 'crisis' of this century.  These leaders are passionate about the environment and seek any opportunity to contribute to keeping our world 'green.'
Darling Cetaceans	81622		/users/profile/89442	Whaleguy	Board Member	5	03/09/2011	I am a proud co-founder of this amazing organization, as well as an active Board Member and Lead Educator! In the past 9 years, DARLING CETACEANS has done more than anyone thought it could, and on a very limited budget. It has educated children & adults with unique, hands-on programs across the USA & helped people appreciate marine mammals across the globe. This organization is an asset to stranding networks, researchers and environmentalists because it highlights their work and fosters understanding of the general public.
Franklin-Wright Settlements Inc	274855		/users/profile/364366	NorthofDetroit	General Member of the Public	1	12/23/2015	Wow. Most reviews are negative regarding the actual support they have received from this agency. Now, Franklin-Wright seems to have validated that criticism by hiring the ex-Detroit school principal who is under Federal indictment for stealing and bribery.  No wonder their financial disclosure statements are not readily available.
Franklin-Wright Settlements Inc	200747	7	/users/profile/262089	AngryCitizen60	General Member of the Public	1	05/23/2014	I can't even begin to express my deepest concern with the way our city has allowed Franklin Wright and Sophie Wright to be ran in the ground by the corrupted management that had been there for years. Myself and other community residents have decided to voice our concerns and maybe even let Lansing know by letters asking for support in gaining supportive services that are given to our local center but doesn't become available to us but the staff keeps it for personal use like it was in the past (the food baskets, free social events, free supplies are just a few examples. We are not even allowed to utilized the building for community meeting, social events, etc... Without a cost given by CEO Marks, Deputy Brown, Finance Director May Lee, and the final person is HR Director C. Jenkins to just get an answer about our center and the available hours. It's sad that Franklin Wright Settlement  and the sister site Sophie Wright was once a pillar of our community on the east side but now it is corrupted by greedy, low down individuals who don't respect us at all and they say their serving the community. Yea right!
Franklin-Wright Settlements Inc	199720	10	/users/profile/260732	oneandonlyme	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/06/2014	FWS is THE WORST managed charitable organization I have ever worked for. I was continously appalled by the lack of respect, professionalism, honesty and integrity displayed by the President & CEO. She only works 2 days a week most weeks and when shes there most employees hide or get called into ridiculously LONG meetings where she tells tales of how wonderful and great she is. However, that couldn't be more further from the truth. Truth is she's corrupt; morally and spiritualy. She hires stafff and businesses but refuses to pay them when they've completed the work. She finds some fictitious reason not to pay. She forces contract employees to work under employee rules and its known that if you complain you will get loudly yelled and cursed at and rudely escorted out of the building by the DRUNK ex-deputy director who still "works" there daily while collecting Social Security for his blindness. This man has shown up to important events and meetings stumbling, loud and reeking of alcohol.  I feel sorry for his son who pretends to work there in the summer along with CEO's son while her daughter as the director of Early Start with only an art degree. She has learned from her mother to mistreat her employees as well. There hasn't been any promotions in the 3 years I was there. She never acted as a leader and allowed her management staff to flourish she only brow beats them. But I guess she really can't lead by example to show them how to uplift and motivate the employees.  She tells unsubstantiated lies about her staff to their spouses, other agency directors and anyone else who will listen. The most horrific acts were due to her corrupt and fictional spiritual compass. She steals from the agency on a regular basis to benefit the church where her husband is pastor. She has the maintenance staff work at the church while they are on the clock at FWS. I have photos to prove this. She buys things with FWS money but they disappear only to show up at the church: christmas trees, tv's , food, yellow rubber flooring pieces meant for Early Start children and many other items. She buys memberships to local attractions but only the children from her church have benefited. I always wanted to go to the board but that was a joke since seats are filled with all her relatives, flunkies, and business partners. The last time members tried to investigate she made the finance personnel give her the information and documentation the board had requested and she lobbied successfully to get rid of those members. This whole situation reminds me of Detroits former mayor and how he used funds intended to improve living conditions to take luxury trips and live a cushy lifestyle. Hope someone checks her expenses reports for receipts to Detroit Seafood Market where she regularly takes her family after church in Sunday and charges it back to FWS. I finally decided that knowing this corruption and deceit was happening and doing nothing to report or stop it was almost as bad as knowing who a killer is and not reporting it.
Franklin-Wright Settlements Inc	194708	9	/users/profile/254461	TinyLadybug01	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/22/2014	This is an organization where the professional, moral, and ethical fabric is in sheer decay and deplorable corrosion existing particularly at the macro level which spirals out of control into the micro levels of daily functioning. There are layers of fiduciary mismanagement, misappropriations, oversights, and lack of integrity which appears to be wittingly intentional. To say the least, it is an understatement that there is an extreme fragmented disconnect in what is presented to the public (community) and what is actually taking place within the infrastructure of the Franklin Wright-Settlements, Inc.; in fact they are polar opposites on the spectrum. What is most unfortunate and disheartening is the loss of the true rich historical context of the mission of Michigan's first Settlement house since the late 1800's until today's poor existence of a mission in the realms of nepotism, cronyism, and favoritism. The understanding is that this review is of a candid and personal nature and because of the fear of retribution this is the least I could do as a professional means of conveying to the public the traumatization of my very brief, but psychologically exhausting experience. There needs to be an immediate and complete overhaul with a solid corrective plan of action for this organization; the status quo needs change. This includes, but is not limited to an in-depth financial audit, restructuring of organizational leaders including the board of directors, and definitely feasible and efficient programming. This organization has been and continues to be a pillar in the community; it needs to remain being a pillar in the community with accountability and responsibility but without carelessness and neglect.

Franklin-Wright Settlements Inc	38826	10	/users/profile/39727	loveroflife	Former staff	1	05/13/2010	I worked at this organization for several years and I can't begin to explain the massive mismanagement that went on before and during my tenure.  The Executive Director stole money and filtered it through her husbands Baptist ministry and the Program Director was drunk everyday.  Working at this organization was the most depressing time of my life and I'm glad that I found new employment before I went crazy.  I still have nightmares of the lies and deception that I was ordered to manifest in order for everyone to get paid.  Worst job ever.

You can see that in everything they do. They empower grandmothers to use their own talents and knowledge to get out of poverty. They give the most vulnerable children free education. I had the privilege of visiting them in 2014 and it was a life changing experience. I would recommend this nonprofit to anyone who will listen.

General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2013	The Nyaka AIDS Orphans Project is a unique  and shining example of how a non profit, charitable organization can change the lives of a large community in need.  By addressing the overwhelming AIDS crisis in rural Uganda holistically, they are not just saving the lives of the more than 1 million children orphaned by the  epidemic but the grandmothers left to care for them and future generations.

This story is not just about building schools, though.  They have also built a gravity-fed water system for the entire area, opened a medical clinic, and started a library and a garden.  The whole-person and whole- community idea is the reason Nyaka does such a great job.  They are also very, very creative about development, and they communicate by social media often, keeping me feeling like I really am in the loop. I am a volunteer, helping remotely with the Sponsor-a-Student program, but I am a supporter, too, sponsoring students and, in 2012, helping my daughter with a bake sale fundraiser for Nyaka.

In addition to providing a school, uniforms, meals, and school supplies, they have built housing for some of the grandmothers who are caring for children who have lost both parents to AIDS.  They have also helped provide running water and a medical facility.  I have met Jackson Kaguri once, and he seems like a very genuine person, and one with great ideas about helping the orphans of Uganda.

The best feeling one can experience is having to see the "light" come on in their eyes when they have grasped a concept.   It is very encouraging to call parents and have them to ask what can they do to assist with their student's learning.

Michigan Disability Rights Coalition	126730		/users/profile/55934	angies1	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	I can state that Michigan Disability Rights Coalition is one of the most honest, hard working, and caring non profit organizations I have ever had the blessing to be a part of.  The depths the staff reach for and obtain are amazing.  I love that there is not one single person that gets turned away.  They fight for the rights for so many, and it has no bias. Black, White, Red, Yellow, Straight, Homosexual, Heterosexual, Blind, Deaf, the list goes on and on and not one person has ever been turned away because of what others may call a handicap, disability, or the wrong way of thinking.  I will stand behind MDRC and all it stands for.  This is an amazing organization that deserves recognition.

Most people have no idea what it takes to hold fundraisers, especially in this economy, but, this organization is just amazing.  I wish there were more we could do to bring forth more opportunity for the clients and more recognition of what exactly MDRC does so more grant money can be had.  Keep up the amazing work.  We will support you everytime!

At first I was not exactly excited about having todo it when I felt like I already had enough on my plate.  After the first day at Hannah's House I couldn't wait to go back.  I enjoyed spending time with the irls and getting to know their stories.  I felt like I was having a positive impact on their lives by being able to share my experiences with them as well.

National Foundation for Esoteric Healing	321187	1	/users/profile/414444	MawEH	Client Served	5	01/13/2017	My experience in being treated with an esoteric healing session is pretty extraordinary.  It has brought about a change in thinking in my life, thus wellness has returned to my physical body.  I am so excited to know about this modality of healing.  More people should be award of the many benefits of this work.
National Foundation for Esoteric Healing	232795	2	/users/profile/296387	HealingWays	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	Esoteric healing is a method of healing whereby health is enhanced by improving the flow of energy around and through the physical body.  Many traumas and stresses are felt first in the fields around the physical body.  If they can be dispersed before they manifest in the form of a disease, better health results.  The Foundation  for Esoteric Healing supports research documenting the results and techniques used in this method of healing as well as exploring new methods.  Their goal is to integrate this alternative form of healing with traditional medicine by increasing credibility and knowledge within the medical community as well as with the general public.
National Foundation for Esoteric Healing	217960	3	/users/profile/281513	Sciencegirl	Client Served	5	09/27/2014	Ten years ago I was introduced to esoteric healing as a healing modality that would assist the body in finding more balance physically, emotionally and mentally.  Having experienced esoteric healing for over the past ten years, I can share that it has truly made a tremendous difference in the quality of my life. The  premise of the healing practice is that we are surrounded by an energy field that affects our health and when it is balanced it brings into alignment these energy fields so that further healing can occur in the physical areas of our body.   After personally experiencing the affects of esoteric healing on conditions of illness I was having and finding a greater sense of well being, reduction of pain, more calmness and clarity of mind and ultimately having a chronic condition reduced in severity, I began to take the courses to learn the underlying principles of esoteric healing. Having a scientific background in college caused me to seek out both medical and alternative treatments and courses of study that could both match my scientific understanding as well as find personal results in areas of illness I was facing in my body.  I have found after taking all of the courses offered in Esoteric Healing that it matches both my scientific background and my internal compass of watching my body become more healthy physically, mentally and emotionally.   The National Foundation for Esoteric Healing is an organization to forward the scientific and research validation of energy medicine as it is used to help individuals as we all seek ways to find health in all areas of our life.  The NFEH is committed to linking the results of energy healing experienced by individuals through esoteric healing principles with scientific studies.  Together esoteric healing and medical advances can give individuals, as myself, hope and results that bring their bodies into greater harmony and health.
National Foundation for Esoteric Healing	217094	3	/users/profile/280612	S.Heal	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	This is an amazing nonprofit!  Esoteric Healing is an energy healing modality that has had amazing results for many people using this treatment protocol. The National Foundation for Esoteric Healing (NFEH) was founded with a goal of doing scientifically credible research on the effectiveness and use of this healing modality.  It will further the knowledge about this wonderful alternative mode of treatment that can be used to supplement traditional treatment practices and further health and healing for those receiving it.   There is a large demand and need for this research, and this organization with its many professional members will be moving this forward.  
National Foundation for Esoteric Healing	196749	6	/users/profile/257163	Energy.Medicine.Practitoner	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2014	The National Foundation for Esoteric Healing is engaged in advancing research to contribute to the body of scientific knowledge on how esoteric healing contributes to health, vitality, creativity, and proper functioning of the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies that comprise all living beings. The energy field which flows through and around every living being is an active field, often referred to as the aura or etheric body; it can be photographed with Kirlian photography and felt by trained hands.   This energy field can be affected to facilitate the restoration of health. The existence of the energy field and its use in healing has its roots in ancient healing practices. Esoteric Healing was developed in the early 1960s in England. When one is healthy, energy flows easily throughout the body.  When energy is blocked, restricted, or deficient, it is often associated with physical body disease, emotional issues, and/or mental anxiety. These problems with the energy field are often present before they appear in the physical body.  Esoteric Healing practitioners have learned to use their hands to sense areas in the client's energy field that are weak or congested.  Using energy balancing techniques, the practitioner can restore the client's energy field to a flowing, healthy state. Treatment often results in improved physical, emotional, and mental conditions.  The practitioner does not touch the client, but works within the energy field at various distances from the client's body.  Healing energies are available to all living beings. The National Foundation for Esoteric Healing was established to integrate knowledge of energy medicine within the greater scientific community of health and healing practitioners.

Habitat for Humanity of Oakland county not only gave us an intrest free loan for a beautifully built home but they gave us the knowledge to understand how to maintain our home both fiscally and structually. I was blessed enough to have them put us through finacial classes and they spent hours of their time to answer my endless questions. I enjoyed being apart of the process to refurbish my own home and it felt good to know this was a way to help my family and not just feel weird about a handout, we're just not good with those. I can think of no other organization that cares more about it's community and helps families with the most basic essentials a family needs to thrive, Knowledge, a debit free start, and beliefe in humanity.

Habitat for Humanity of Oakland County	115464		/users/profile/157240	derrik7583	Client Served	5	06/15/2012	Habitat helped me improve my life in so many ways.  It all started when I lost my job.  The company I worked for was suffering due to the economy; the business was collapsing.  Coworker after coworker was "released to the industry."  Then it happened to me.  I decided to return to school to finish my degree so that I could build upon my talents and pursue a career in business administration.  I applied for the work-study program at Habitat for Humanity of Oakland County and was given part-time work directly related to my degree-of-study.  After working with Habitat for a year, I applied for the home-ownership program and got word that we were approved just in time for Christmas.  After the new year, I was hired on full-time.  In May 2012, I graduated cum laude from Oakland Community College with an Associate Degree in Business Administration.  I worked very hard to improve my life but I would never had gotten this far without help from the community that Habitat brought together.  Now, I don't have to worry about breathing the black mold that grew from frequent flooding of raw sewage in the basement of our rental house.  I don't have to worry about the expensive energy bills from that old, poorly insulated house.  I don't have to worry about the rats that lived in the abandoned house next door spreading disease to my dogs.   I am incredibly proud of my home and so grateful to the thousands of strangers that volunteered to improve their local community.  Habitat helped me build a house, but more than that, they helped me build hope for the future and confidence in my ability.

Habitat for Humanity of Oakland County	115384	1	/users/profile/157132	Restore	Client Served	5	06/15/2012	Habitat for Humanity of Oakland has been wonderful to my family and I. I have several roles at Habitat, the first is that I am a Very Proud Homeowner. The home was built for my mother and I in the 2006 Blitz. Habitat built 5 homes in 2 weeks and we were blessed to be one of the families. At the time of the build I had just gotten out of the hospital and was not allowed to go on the build site, but I was allowed to work in the office for the 2 weeks and my mom would go on the site everyday. From the very beginning of the process it was a gift from god. The staff did everything they could to help us in every way. I became a part of the Habitat Family. Not only did Habitt build my family a home, I was blessed with two jobs, first as the front desk receptionist and for the past serveral years as a cashier/customer service rep in the ReStore. A few years after my home was built, my brother and his kids were blessed with a the first Habitat Rebuild. I was also chosen to be a mentor to some of the new partner families when they come into the program. Habitat is always looking for better ways to help the new families as they come in. We have such hard working, dedicated staff and volunteers. It is so rewarding to be not only a Home Owner but a part of the wonderful staff and organization. Habitat for Humanity Just Keeps Giving and Building Communities all of the World. It is Truly A Gift from God. Thank You! Floretta Turnipseed

Before I went to CFL I didn't understand how this camp worked, until I saw and felt it for myself. In just a few short days, these kids that come to this camp, are touched, as well as the adults. It brings me healing also just by being a part of this camp. What this camp does and the lives it touches is truly a God thing, a touch from God.

I have happily volunteered for Vision Hope's Champions for Life Kids' Camp for over 10 years now because I have seen firsthand the difference in these hurting childrens lives as a result of just spending 1 week at camp.

My husband and I helped set up a fundraiser motorcycle ride to fund the kids. That was about 8 years ago. Then I started volunteering in the kitchen during summer camp. It is a fabulous nonprofit. The best part is all of the money raised by fundraisers goes directly to the kids. Working with these kids is amazing. They can't wait to come to camp and don't want to leave at the end. You can see how much this means to these kids. Now after working there I feel the same way.

Open Doors Kalamazoo	23168	9	/users/profile/24228	makob069	Client Served	5	12/01/2009	I am a former resident of the Open Door and Next Door Shelters.  The program helped transform my life by providing support when and where I needed it.  It also facilitated many of my early-recovery growing pains that were necessary for me to become a whole person.  I had lived at the shelter for six months and saved enough money to move into one of their community houses.  I was asked to be the house leader and I gladly accepted this responsibility.  The part that helped me grow was when I had to ask two of the residents to leave because they weren't staying substance free.  They were my friends and I had to choose between them and my own recovery.  Thankfully, I chose recovery!  This is only one example of how the safe environment of the Open Door and Next Door helped me become who I am today. I am currently a board member and also volunteer where I can for them.  Being on the board has given me a wider perspective as I feel I help them understand the homeless perspective.  One thing that stands out in my mind is that somewhere over 90% of the money that is donated goes directly back into the program... The people who work for the Open Door and Next Door are truly dedicated to helping.
Open Doors Kalamazoo	23145	8	/users/profile/24207	Claire Nehring	Former staff	4	12/01/2009	What I love about this organization is its flexibility to meet the changing needs of the community, and its responsiveness to guests.  For example, OD/ND has shifted focus form solely providing shelter to addressing the issue of affordable housing for the working poor. People with minimum wage/ no benefits jobs have difficulty affording market rate housing.   OD/ND has piloted a residential program that allows working people to rent at affordable rates, while also providing follow-on services and a sense of community and support.  The biggest challenge for OD/ND may be its size.  The small size of the organization allows for flexibility, responsiveness and creativity.  It has a veery grassroots feel.  But there are limits to what a small staff can do.  Growth could lead to more housing units, but could put distance between staff and guests.
Open Doors Kalamazoo	23096	5	/users/profile/24159	jari47	Former Volunteer	5	11/29/2009	Open Door and Next Door Shelters really cares about its residents and guests.  It provides not only a place to stay and meals, but individualized support services, including helpfinding a job, saving money for an apartment,encouragement to complete GED, etc.  The staff are extremely caring and helpful.  Shelter guests are expected to make a plan with the staff to work towards self-sufficiency.  The Residence Community provides permanent housing for low-wage workers, and involves them in theplanning of resident activities.

A couple years ago, a friend told me about a great class he took at the BBAC & encouraged me to check it out.  I took a drawing workshop - one-day commitment - & really enjoyed it AND was very encouraged by the teacher.  Have gone to to a painting class & this term am trying pot-throwing in ceramics.  What works for me is using my hands & the other side of my brain...The BBAC makes it so easy to enter the world of art.
Birmingham Bloomfield Art Center	27763	7	/users/profile/28847	arinrentzcomcastnet	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	The BBAC is the hidden gem of Southeast MI.  It is a wonderful place for families to work together, individuals to pursue hobbies or passions.  They uphold their mission of Art for All.  I love the BBAC!
Birmingham Bloomfield Art Center	27692	9	/users/profile/28755	sueb1	Board Member	5	02/10/2010	My experience with the BBAC has been nothing but awesome.  This center offers pretty much everything you would want in an art center.  Well known experienced teachers, a wide range of classes offered from painting, clay studios, jewelry, art camps during the summer for adults and children, Sunday drop-in classes for all ages from 1-4pm and much, much more.  My daughter and I have taken clay studio classes during the summer months for some one on one time and have had so much fun.  I use to take my son once a week when he was little (when he had half day classes in kindergarten)and attend a drawing class (age appropriate)at the art center.  We would have so much fun together and every time he would come home with his creation and be so proud. I became a Board Member in 2008 and currently, I'm a big supporter of Studio 1 which works with individuals or groups with disabilities and organizations where kids can come and be exposed to the arts.  I'm trying to build a bridge within the system for children in my school to volunteer their services and work with the organizations coming to Studio 1. We have to teach our kids early that it is always good to give back and support the organizations that help and provide for everyone.  I would love it if everyone would just go to the website or visit the center and see what it has to offer for their family.
Birmingham Bloomfield Art Center	27433	8	/users/profile/28519	sarah1	Client Served	5	02/09/2010	I grew up at the BBAC in the 70's.  It was the best place to take art classes in the area.  Now it's 30 years later and my own children are growing up at the BBAC.  It's still the same safe inspirational place to explore the arts but with so much more.  The changing exhibitions keep us coming back every month, as do the Sunday drop-in workshops.  On the other end of the spectrum, my grandmother has attended the adult art camps and I have a couple girlfriends who paint seriously here during the day with some amazing teachers.
Zaman International	232968		/users/profile/296619	rachellchina	Client Served	5	11/05/2014	I am truly greatful to have such an extraordinary organization within my local community. I lost my infant son in July of 2014. I was completely overwhelmed as to how to have a funeral for an infant or even how to bury an infant. This was a tragedy I could never have even imagined. losing my precious son Ali was the most difficult trial I have ever faced. Then I heard about the organization Zaman International and how they had formed the Plots for Tots program within the Islamic Memorial Gardens Cemetery. It is a particular area designated for the burial of infants and young children. The very first time I visited the plots for Tots Cemetery I was immediately moved spiritually and knew that was exactly where I wanted my son to be burried. Amongst this overwhelming loss, the idea of my son Ali being buried with other precious babies brought so much peace to my aching heart. I am so greatful Zaman International designated such a special place for these little angels. Thank you again for bring light into one of my darkest days. May God bless you for all the comfort your effort has brought to all of these grieving parents. 
Zaman International	232963	1	/users/profile/296611	Simail	Volunteer	5	11/05/2014	I was a volunteer/intern for Zaman. It is an amazing and wonderful non-profit that serves the metro Detroit area.  They are extremely transparent in everything that they Dom they are a very diverse organization that does things no other group does. they bury infants whose parents cannot afford to do so, the eyes teac women English, help them get there GED, and find jobs. These are only a few of the things that they do. They are a truly  an inspiring organization. I wish them all the success! 
Zaman International	232946		/users/profile/296590	Tammy86	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2014	Zaman does many wonderful things from feeding the hungry to providing clothes and school supplies for the less fortunate. One particularly important mission is Plots for Tots which raises money for families that have lost a newborn and cannot afford burial. In a time of unspeakable sorrow, Zaman helps families bury their little ones even though the family doesn't have the funds. Surely this is one of the most touching acts of charity for a need that often goes unnoticed.
Zaman International	232839		/users/profile/296445	Lyski	Volunteer	5	11/04/2014	I have been volunteering for this great organization for almost three years now.  Zaman International promotes social justice and cares for abandoned women and children with compassion and dignity.  What I like most about Zaman, is that all ages are welcome to help out.  There are many opportunities for children, teens, adults, and seniors to be a part of the solution.  Zaman provides my family with the chance to help others throughout the year.  We pack food boxes, and we deliver coats, school backpacks and gifts to the kids.  Their annual WALK for Humanity is excellent - a wonderful family event.  Thanks Zaman for doing such awesome work!

I had no idea of what I was doing, Krista Poole helped me every step of the way while I coordinated appx 100 volunteers intenrally.   Once we arrived at Forgotten Harvest I was able to see the wheels set into motion.  They provided an overview, the coordinators (Chef Aaron)  quickly broke out the team into sections, and we were off and running.  We were a constant movement of hustle and bustle until everything was completed, but what a great feeling.  I provided the group with a survey after the event asking what we could have done better, outside of a few things I was responsible for the feedback was 100% favorable, with everyone stating they would do it again. The event was held in the fall and I am helping another leader coordinate our return back this month.  Great organization with people who really care!!

At times, there are families who need financial assistance and the Bonnell Foundation was there to provide that support for a family needing assistance with unexpected day care expenses due the military member having to train across the country for a few months and his son with CF needing specialized day care to continue. This specific assistance was a part of the Bonnell Foundation's Medical Support Program which is a new resource that is available to military families having to deal with CF. The Bonnell Foundation also has a CF Pen Pal Program which is an emotional support network for children and parents. Bonnell also has a CF Caregiver Appreciation Program designed to help military couples (both parents) by sending them cards of emotional support on a monthly basis. I highly recommend them and utilizing their incredible support system.Respectfully,Dan Hernandez LCSW

I have been attending the support groups for anxiety disorders for about a year now. The ARC is the only place I can talk openly about my experiences with an anxiety disorder and get ideas from others in the same boat.The center has also recently added new features, such as an experiential group and a clinical group. They are also considering adding yoga, which has been shown to help many anxiety disorders. I cannot emphasize enough enough what a positive influence the center has in my life and the lives of others with anxiety disorders.

E S T H E R S Children	303256	2	/users/profile/394418	Jack63	Board Member	5	09/11/2016	ESTHERS Children is a Christian ministry that is changing the lives of dozens of families in Vera Cruz, a little town outside of Recife Brazil, where the culture is steeped in substance abuse, child sexual abuse, poverty, and hopelessness. Working on a shoestring budget, Esther's is showing these families how to live differently and is providing the tools, the direction, the motivation, and the confidence to do so.Esther's stands for End Sex Trafficking for HER and has been very effective in preventing young girls (ages 4-18) and their moms from falling into a lifestyle of drug/alcohol addiction and prostitution. My wife, Donetta, and I visited their Quiet Strength Community Center on a mission trip in 2013 and learned the secret to their success first-hand.Their secret is amazingly simple: Love. Love and care for the girls the same way we would care for our own children. Feed them hot meals, give them clean clothes to wear, tutor them when they need help with their homework, teach them a craft, introduce them to Jesus. This builds their self-respect, their self-confidence, and their hope for the future. There's no better protection against evil than this.This is Matthew 25:34-40 in action and as a result, God's light is shining bright in a very dark place. Please join us in supporting Esther's work in Brazil.God is great!

Palanca Leadership	322128		/users/profile/415765	Writer	Client Served	5	01/25/2017	The Palanca Leadership Program brought to our program a sense of  ownership for our participants in the Young Adult Diversion Court Program. They started to realize what it takes to move forward and learn how to implement successful and easy strategies to do so. Lisa was very fun and knowledgeable and the participants liked the information that was given to them. Our participants especially liked the panel of mentors, that spoke            during one of the training days. This is a good program for young adults, who are               struggling with self-identity and self-motivation.

The Women's Giving Circle, a fund within the Cadillac Area Community Foundation provided a grant to provide new and improved smiles to the women seen at the Stehouwer Free Clinic.The ladies from Women's Giving Circle were very helpful. They discussed with us the needs of those we care for and the problem the Stehouwer Free Clinic struggles to meet. This helped us to decide which area of need would be of the greatest interest to the Womens Giving Circle and also beneficial to the clients of the Stehouwer Free Clinic.A huge thank you to the Womens Giving Circle for granting us funds to provide dental care to the uninsured women of the Cadillac area living in poverty.  With the assistance of local dentists, the funds from the Womens Giving Circle helped many women smile again. This also gave them the confidence needed to find a job but most importantly, improve their health.

Throught their close work with youth they've formed a very dynamic and enegetic Youth Advisroy Committee (YAC) that annaully gives out funding to advance the needs of youth in our Community.  At the Y they've supported collaborative efforts in programs like Teen Impact and the development of our Teen Center.  YAC also participated in a 3 way partnership with the Y and Club Cadillac to provide a Christmas Card service that generated awareness about the Y, the foundations, and Club Cadillac. The foundation has also been instrumental in other collaborative efforts.  Most recently they helped fund the Lincoln Afterschool Prgoram that provides a Heatlhy Snack and vigerous play five days per week to fight the obesity epedemic in our youth.  Additionally the program provides 3 days of tutoring in Math or Reading for kids that are struggling in those areas.   Withouth their funding this program would not have been possible. I've found the staff team at the foundation to be extremely approachable and ready to help us think through how best to frame our programs so they are best positioned to recieve funding and succeed.  They've been straightforward to identify potential obstacles or programs that lack the integrity to be funded.   We also use the foundation to hold our endowment fund.  It's been excellent to have a local team handy to answer our questions and be our advocates for developing and utilitizing this fund.  I've been extremly thankful that their leadership removes any worry I have regarding the security and growth of our endowment.

Despite the economic hardships of our community and state, the FLC continues to obtain support through generous donors and creative fundraising activities, such as the "camel races" and an annual auction and dinner.  Of course, maintaining support gets more and more challenging, and the literacy support from this organization is so valuable to our community.

Young Detroit Builders	26458	5	/users/profile/27490	julieann	Volunteer	5	01/28/2010	I am a student at Wayne State University, and for one of my classes during the fall 2009 semester I was required to fulfill a learning service requirement. So, various different representatives from schools and other organizations came and spoke to our class to let us know about how we can help each one of them. I chose to volunteer at Young Detroit Builders (YDB). Ms. Jennifer Boyd, English Instructor at YDB, came and spoke to our class, and she inspired me to volunteer for them. At first I was a little apprehensive because I knew I would be tutoring students who were either the same age as me or older, but it turned out that there was no reason for that apprehension at all. After the first couple of weeks volunteering there, I felt comfortable with the students and staff. Everyone was extremely nice and friendly. Ms. Boyd and the other staff members made my time there thoroughly enjoyable. Also, it is so very evident that each one of the staff members whole-heartedly wants the students to succeed. They do not consider what they do as just a "job." All of the staff members do everything that they can to see the students pass the GED test. And the students try their hardest as well. I started tutoring about once a week at YDB in late September and I plan on continuing that as long as I am able to.
Young Detroit Builders	26327	3	/users/profile/27366	aivy2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/27/2010	I have had nothing but pleasant and good experiences with YDB. I have been employed here for the last five months and I have witnessed nothing but positive results. This program give young adults the chance to reestablish their lives and really make something negative into a positive.
Young Detroit Builders	26065	3	/users/profile/27097	Erica	Volunteer	5	01/22/2010	I originally volunteered with YDB as part of a requirement for an honors class at Wayne State University, and though I was somewhat nervous about how it would go, I have found volunteering here extremely rewarding and fun. The students that study here are trying to make a positive change in their lives and community, and the work that they do is truly amazing. Though we were only required to perform 20 hours of service, the students who chose this as our specific site gave much more time simply because of our love for the staff, students, and organization as a whole. The only downside to working with YDB is their obvious lack of resources. Though they have most of the absolutely necessary essentials needed to stay afloat, they do not seem to have the extra funds available that would allow them to truly expand and grow to their full potential. Because this is such a great organization that gives high school dropouts in Detroit a second chance to get an education and gain construction and life skills, the more that they expand and grow can only lead to more rebuilding and reshaping of the city of Detroit. As a part of the class that introduced me to YDB, we had to give a small something back to whichever organization we chose, and my classmates and I decided to try to fundraise and hold a raffle, which showed us all how tough times are today and how much everyone and every business is struggling. Though we raised only a small amount, the staff could not have been more appreciative and receptive of our efforts. I have found the people involved at Young Detroit Builders to be so empowering and inspirational that I plan to stay here and give whatever I can to help them continue their mission. Though six months ago I never knew they existed, YDB has become a priority in my life that I plan to continue to balance along with a full-time college schedule and part-time job, because, even though that initial honors class is over, I could not be more excited to donate my time and skills each week to help out this amazing organization. With so many cities everywhere now facing many of the same problems that Detroit has faced for years, I think that it is amazing that there are groups like the Young Detroit Builders who work so hard to do what they can to make a difference in their community by engaging members of that community to educate, rebuild houses, and learn life skills that could be one small step in repairing the city of Detroit. Please endorse the Young Detroit Builders and help them to continue to rebuild and transform the people, buildings, neighborhoods, and city of Detroit as a whole. Thank you!

Very admirable work done by every member at Young Detriot Builders.
All-of-us Express Children's Theatre	127374		/users/profile/155373	Tanya17	Board Member	5	10/19/2012	It's my daughter Kiara's fault that we joined All-of-Us Express Children's Theatre- once she was cast in a show, we noticed her usually teary-eyed, sulky behavior change to dry-eyed, happy engagement in school and family activities!  Her grades went up considerably (from C's and D's to all A's) and her organization skills skyrocketed!  With the discipline learned during her time with AECT, she is now a very certain person who doesn't follow the "popular" crowd, but confidently does her own thing.  I can't imagine how her life would be now if we hadn't joined the All-of-Us Express Family- I hope you'll see why our family supports this amazing professional children's theatre... it's not just about acting, it's about learning!
All-of-us Express Children's Theatre	114184	1	/users/profile/155373	Tanya17	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	Our story begins with a chance encounter with a munckin from the Land of Oz.  My daughter Kiara was in a 2nd/3rd grade split class that was selected to act in the Everett High School's rendition of  The Wiz.  After the first night of applause, she told me she wanted to be on the stage for the rest of her life!  I knew a little bit about All-of-Us Express from my business partner, as her daughter was invloved with some of their shows.  We decided to go in and see what all the fuss was and took Kiara to her very first audition!  Right from the start, I realized that this was going to be a quality theatre experience for my daughter.  I was impressed by the professionalism of the audition!  While I filled out information sheets, Kiara was measured for height and size (they make the costumes for each actor) and then photographed.  She was given a script and waited until her name was called to do a cold read of a character.  This particular show (still one of my favorites) was A Midsummer Night's Dream. (Did I mention that one performace per show is professionally filmed and available for purchase?) I thought it would be a kid rendition, but was surprised to discover that the script was not any watered-down version.. it was Shakespeare's play!  Kiara struggled to get the words out and was quite angry that this playwright's version of English was messed up (lol).  I sat with other parents and listened to kids who read quite proficiently from the script!  (I later learned that audition workshops are held before each show so kids can come in and read from the script as well as get instruction).  Kiara didn't get a callback, but she did get a call that weekend offering her a part as puppetter of a fairy.  She gladly accepted and began her life-long dream of acting. In the Fall of that same year, she signed up to be a crew member (cast one show, crew the next, and so on is the policy of All-of-Us). I wasn't sure how she would do, managing her time with school and rehersals, but she did wonderfully!  I  noticed a change in my daughter's attitude toward homework- once a struggle to get her to even sit for a few minutes, she finished all homework assignments on time!  Then I got her first report card... all A's!  WOW! What was going on with my kid??  I realized that her time with All-of-Us was actually HELPING her manage her own time!  She was surrounded by smart, talented adult crew heads and under the supervision of a professional director.  All kids were expected to follow protocol, which meant listen, participate, and do what they were told to do.  Once a  battle of wills, Kiara increasingly became more and more compliant at home.   I believe to participate in the creation of something bigger than herself really pushed her to be her best at all times!  She's now 14, and is Assistant Director of the upcoming show Jolly Rodger and the Pirate Queen.  She has learned not just how to act on stage, but how to build a set, create and sew costumes, manage props, apply make-up, run the light and sound booth and many other theatre-specific skills.  But it's the skills that she has learned about teamwork, discipline, time management, collaboration, innovation, and compassion that has made her time with All-of-Us so much more meaningful to me.  My daughter's life was changed the moment we decided on All-of-Us Express Children's Theatre, and I couldn't be more pleased.
All-of-us Express Children's Theatre	126575		/users/profile/171584	cvzdesign	Board Member	5	10/17/2012	We have had All-of-us Express in our lives since my daughter was 2 years old.   We found shows advertised in the local paper that we thought she might like to see, and she loved them. They were quality theater performances which was amazing in that they were all kids performing.    At that  time we didn't know that the kids do everything.  From lights and sound, to set building and costume making;  makeup  stage design, assistant directing. board members  and script selections.    When my daughter was 6 she wanted to BE ON THAT STAGE  and got her first role in the summer show.    The volunteers and staff are great with the kids and have given them all wonderful skills and confidence that follows them through to their 'adult' careers.   My daughter, at 13 is still performing with this group, and I have played many a volunteer role myself.   We love telling people to come try out and be a part of this wonderful organization.
All-of-us Express Children's Theatre	115847		/users/profile/157758	libbypacer	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	All-of-us has been a major part of my life. I have always loved it and I didn't even realize how much time I spent there until I moved and found my self just sitting around. All-of-us is such an amazing program thanks to them I have learned so much. The skills they have taught me have gotten me immediate respect from my current towns directors and theater managers. I started in summer show for fun when I was nine and became a year rounder. I used to hate doing crew but I came to love working backstage even more than being onstage. Seeing other small theater groups now I realize how well organized and professional All-of-us is. I admit, I cried after my last show and always try to get back and help. I have made life-long friends at all-of-us. It has become like a second family to me. I would go back and do it all over again a million times!

They also have programs like Mayan Power and Light that get jobs and life enhancing technologies into the hands of those who need them.  
Appropriate Technology Collaborative	159827	2	/users/profile/212012	lori-hart	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	ATC is a great organization!  Ive worked with them as a volunteer for over a year.  The work they do is life-changing and fascinating.   As an engineer, Ive been able to get involved with designing and optimizing solutions for poor people in developing countries  treadle pumps, clean stoves, solar vaccine refrigerators.  Technology that makes a real difference to peoples lives AND allows some to create their own income-generating situation, a key opportunity to take them out of poverty. As a volunteer, Ive been able to travel to Guatemala and work on natural building projects to help communities at their schools and, in the future, a medical clinic.  Its been amazing to be able to make a concrete difference with my own hands and effort. As a donor, I have seen the workings of the organization and feel confident giving money where so much of it is being used for its mission and not absorbed as too much overhead.  Further, the designs that ATC develop are kept as open-source information so that the lessons learned in Guatemala can not only be spread to Africa, Asia, South America, etc., but can also be locally built and maintained, another key element in helping people by giving opportunity and employment rather than just charity.  This principle allows ATC to make an even wider difference in the world. I will continue to stay involved in this organization and to support them.
Appropriate Technology Collaborative	158987	2	/users/profile/211052	atc.treas	Board Member	5	05/29/2013	A few years ago I saw an inspiring presentation about the Appropriate Technology Collaborative (ATC) and how it was leveraging student brainpower in the US in collaboration with input from very low income people in Central America to design solutions that would improve lives while being truly affordable. But my real introduction to what that all means was on an 11-day trip to Guatemala in early 2012 to help on two ATC projects along with 16 other volunteers, including adults and university students.   The first project involved installing solar panels on the roof of a vocational high school on the north shore of Lake Atitlan to provide reliable backup electricity, since the grid power was rather unreliable.  As a retired engineer I had a great time working with the other ATC volunteers and a couple local craftsmen (electrician and welder) to overcome interesting design obstacles and get the job done in our limited time.  We also provided training materials so the school could start teaching classes in basic electricity and solar power.  The second project was at the other end of the technology spectrum: helping to preserve a traditional technology -- a building technique named "bajareque" taught to us by Mayan elders who still know how to build walls that are more earthquake resistant than adobe or even typical Guatemalan concrete, using bamboo, mud, stone, and twine made from dried local plants.  We built a courtyard wall at an elementary school to help keep the young students from venturing off during recess.  Besides helping with the construction, I created video documentation of the material preparations and the building technique.  The trip was incredibly fun and rewarding, not to mention being very well organized and managed by the ATC Director, John Barrie.  As a result of that experience, I ended up joining the ATC board of directors, and as Treasurer I have moved us from spreadsheet accounting onto Quickbooks and filed our first 990EZ tax return, since our revenue increased across the $50K threshold in 2012.  Craig Harvey
Amyloidosis Foundation	193618	2	/users/profile/252886	hyalohall	Client Served	5	01/31/2014	All of the Amyloidosis diseases are confusing and complicated and there is little information out there that is straightforward and helpful.  The Amyloidosis Foundation went above and beyond to help me and my family when my brother was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis.  The website contains medical articles that are updated and informative.  The volunteers with the organization are helpful and supportive.  I am very impressed with their fundraising efforts and annual research grants to further awareness and research.  If it weren't for this foundation, I would have been unable to navigate the medical jargon and they know all of the specialists in this disease so they can guide anyone, worldwide, to medical professionals to help them.  I am very grateful that they were there for my brother and my entire family.  When I call them, they talk to me right away - and always call back when needed!
Amyloidosis Foundation	193604	1	/users/profile/252873	DenaHeath	Volunteer	5	01/31/2014	I lost my husband to this terrible disease.  When he was diagnosed there was limited and out of date information about it and very limited resources available to patients and caregivers.  It was an extremely difficult time for us and for all other patients dealing with this life threatening diagnosis and very difficult treatment protocol.  The Amyloidosis Foundation did not exist at this difficult time for us but when it came into being I wanted to be a part of amyloidosis awareness around the United States.  I wanted to make some kind of difference, no matter how small, to helping others faced with the same experience.  Working with the Amyloidosis Foundation has given me this opportunity.  As part of the effort to raise awareness about this rare, often misdiagnosed and mistreated disease, the Foundation provides and staffs an awareness booth at the annual medical conventions for cardiology, hematology and nephrology.  I am fortunate to be able to work in this booth every year. The booth is staffed by volunteer patients and caregivers who talk with physicians from all over the world about the disease, about research projects and clinical trials, and new treatment protocols.  We provide much needed disease information in various languages to attending physicians and other medical personnel and we facilitate critical connections among the disease experts and others.  We continue to update our disease information and to make it available to others at these medical conventions and through the website.   In addition to the disease awareness efforts the Foundation funds amyloidosis research efforts every year.  Research on rare diseases such as this one is always an issue and a challenge as funds are always limited with all rare disease foundations competing for the same pool of money.   In honor of my husband Bill Finnegan who died of this disease I am pleased to support the Amyloidosis Foundation both financially and as a dedicated volunteer.
Amyloidosis Foundation	193602	1	/users/profile/252870	donnau	Volunteer	5	01/31/2014	I am both a volunteer as well as an Amyloidosis patient.  If it were not for this wonderful organization spreading the word, educating up and coming research stars as well as the medical community, I would most likely be dead by now.  Since I was diagnosed over 6 years ago I have seen so many advancements in medicine and the way they treat patients, that we (the patients), are surviving longer than the predicted 18 months we were originally told we had left to live.  Some of us are fortunate enough to be living very productive lives and without financial support to this wonderful organization the wheels will begin to slow down.  We can't let this happen as more and more people are being diagnosed every year with this awful disease.  Come join our choir, we can always use a new voice and help us snuff out this dreadful disease or make our lives easier to live. Donna U.

More research needs to be done to help cure this terrible disease. The type he was diagnosed with is hereditary and could affect other family members.

The Buster Foundation	125511		/users/profile/170713	esko1082	Client Served	1	10/15/2012	Our dog recently passed away unexpectedly and we decided to adopt another dog.  It was important to us to rescue a dog because there are so many pit bulls in shelters and rescues that are in desperate need of a chance at a good life.  We were going to provide an exceptional home for whatever dog we ended up with.  They are like our children.  We were going through the Buster Foundation and found the perfect dog.  The day that we were suppose to have a home check and possibly keep him if all went well they canceled on us.  Instead we drove an hour away to go meet him and introduce our two other dogs to him.  He was perfect and all of the dogs got along very well.  He was exactly what we were looking for.  We still had to have our home check done and the earliest date was a few days from then according to their schedules.  We got out the crate they asked us for and took off work and my volunteer shift that day.  Everything in the house was ready for the new dog.  The day after our meeting with him they called and told me that their foster family decided they wanted to keep him.  Now they have had him for over two months and when someone show interest in him they all of a sudden want to keep him.  That is not how you run a rescue.  The ultimate goal is to find good quality homes for the dogs.  Adopting out pit bulls is a tough slow process.  We know and love the breed and to take away that dogs chance at a good home is just ridiculous. We were broken hearted.  She tried to tell us about some other dogs they had but we already looked through all of them and we picked this dog for a reason.  Needless to say we will be going through a different rescue.  -Esko/Theresa

They're so compassionate with their animals and take such great care to make sure each dog is placed in its perfect fur-ever home. The biggest thing I love about them is that they're not just trying to get homeless pittbulls rescued... They're educating the public and taking a stand against the ignorance and stereotypes of this amazing breed. I'd highly recommend adoption OR even just education with them!

Now being a part of Buster, I am humbled and excited to be a part of such wonderful things in the Pit Bull world. I look forward to all of the great things this rescue will do in the future!

Her Grandpa -my husband- said "every one should have the chance to get on stage and not be themselves." Since then Jessica has been in countless plays  which enabled her to meet other kids from the metro area. I volunteered to sew. What a pleasure to work with all the parents,kids, and to watch them grow to be young adults. At DYPAC they stress - volunteering, being nice to everyone. It doesn't matter how much talent a child has or hasn't everyone is welcome. We are a fun group come check us out. Maybe we can find one of your hidden talents. Maybe you like to paint(scenes,faces) maybe you could help in the dressing room, sell cookies at intermission.  We are Family!!!  Nancy Eluskie

I recently got an eloquent, fun, educational and entertaining reminder at The Bat Zone at The Cranbrook Institute of Science, in Bloomfield Hills, MI. I took my son there to see the animals and was delighted by the over 150 that call it their forever-home.They have a two-toed sloth, bearded dragons, skunks, sugar gliders, flying squirrels, and (naturally) bats from all over the world, including the largest species! Kamilah was SO cute and had a wing-span of over 5 feet! The presenters were well-spoken, incredibly knowledgeable and plain-old-fun. We learned a ton: Did you know, without bats we wouldn't have tequila?! Yikes! While these animals were cool to see, it's important to know that they are all injured or abandoned and need permanent care for the rest of their lives: That's a lot of mouths to feed! What a cool place Can't wait to go back for another visit!

We wish to provide an open forum, website and eventually a museum to present this diverse material for all to access for their own areas of study and research. Our Vision:  To construct/buy an Ancient American Culture and Artifact Center in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, with a focus on ancient copper mining and trade; an area where there is substantial evidence of ancient copper mining and Norse/Viking presence. Certainly there are fascinating evidences all over the Americas, and this data is highly welcomed as well. This building would exhibit artifacts from all over North America, house a library for research, provide rooms for meetings, lectures and presentations, give a venue for exchange of ideas, and to invite serious researchers into this collection to reference. We also are maintaining and adding to a Virtual Museum on the world-wide-web, encouraging people to send photos and descriptions (provenance) of ancient American artifacts, to be viewed and compared with artifacts sent by others, thereby opening up a world-wide museum and research facility without the constraints of space, time and the expense of maintaining a physical facility.

The web page and annual conferences are like a living library where we all can research our past.  All great nations are started by the dedicated minds of a few. Look where we are since 1776 in America. Our great great grandchildren may look back and thank the AAAPF for their contributions to understanding our past.

They also intend to sell organic vegetables at reasonable cost to the public to create jobs and support their initiatives.

But the part I like is that parents who dedicate time to the project bring their children and before long, the children are pitching in. To see little ones digging in the huge piles of soil, having no destination in mind for the dirt but having fun, is great. Watching a child pull on something green in the bed and see something orange come out is a mystery being solved in one moment in time. These are the small victories in the huge overall plan to feed hungry people that is the goal of the Going Green Foundation.

Cedar Water Healing Lodge	134246	3	/users/profile/180032	momofkids	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	As we begin our lives, we rely on the teachers closest to us, be it our parents, our teachers, clergymen, etc.  Once we set off on our own journey (and for many of us this starts with our college years) we start to hear other people's stories, learn other cultures not previously exposed to and, many of us, start questioning our own basic belief system.  We question only to further understand what we have been taught and to grow our own belief system thus making it "ours".  I was born with Cherokee blood running through my veins but was never able to have a true understanding of what that meant.  I was raised Catholic and followed the Traditions of the Catholic religion very closely.  Once I was out and on my own, I learned about different cultures and different beliefs and grew a respect for each of them - whether I "agreed" with the philosophy or not.  As an adult with children, I encourage my kids to seek understanding in each belief system and decide what is right for them (not me).  When I started attending classes at the Cedar Water Healing Lodge, I began my journey into an understanding of myself and others that, I am certain, I could not have gained on my own or while continuing to travel down the same path that I had been.  The respect of the teachings at the Lodge grew when we were encouraged to express teachings that we desired.  That respect has grown even more so year after year as we are adopting families to feed, offering our Community Garden to the general public, speaking to children in schools and on the land when they visit.  I felt that I finally belonged to the Community that the Lodge has built during the 2012 Ancient Wisdom weekend.  The Healing Ceremony offered to each person in attendance was extremely profound and incredibly personal.  This Lodge opens it's arms to each person without judgement and without expectation.  The Traditional Native American Ceremonies have helped me to understand my heritage and have given me a respect of my own when it comes to Mother Earth and our own individual journey.  The only desire is to reach out and help.  I hope to be involved here throughout my life's journey.

As a matter of fact a professional fundraiser for Insight and their director of development no less. You set up these four groups so that you could siphon off donations meant for the other groups that Insight raises money for. You should be ashamed of yourself for what you are tryingto do and to do it at the same time some many other groups have been shut down for doing what you are doing. Have you not heard of Bobby Thompson and the United States Navy Veterans Association? You are trying to do what he did 4 or 5 times over at the same time.

The charity got ~$113,750.  It appears to me that the principle reason for Good Charity, Inc. is to retain the services of Insight Teleservices and only the minimum amount of money is actually funneled charity to keep the whole thing legal. Notice the names of a group that is actually contracted Insight to raise money for them and then notice the name of the same group that Brian Maiorana started. Contracted Group Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans of AmericaScam Group Disabled and Paralyzed Veterans Fund Oh Yeah, he is siphoning money, no question about it. All these groups are similar to ones contracted to Insight Teleservices INC.  This is a massive R.I.C.O.

Lymphoma Foundation Of America	283779		/users/profile/373766	BobPG	Client Served	5	03/27/2016	My name is Bob.  I am a lymphoma survivor and have been grateful to the Lymphoma Foundation of America for over twenty years.  I was first diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in late December 1992.  It was an unbelieveable shock.  I was a healthy person, we had no family history of lymphoma.  I went through six months of challenging chemotherapy and tried to keep it all in and do it myself.  Three months after I finished my treatment and had been told that I was "cured,"  I had a recurrance.  The doctors could not believe it because I was told the chemo regimen had a 95% effective rate.  It threw me into a huge spin not knowing what to do.  I had a six month old son who was born when I was on chemotherapy.  I ran a small business.  My oncologist and the one at Johns Hopkins did not agree on the next steps and what treatment to do.  I needed support.  Thankfully I found the Lymphoma Foundation of America.  I was able to speak with people who understood what I was going through and could provide good ideas and options both medically, emotionally and in general health terms for someone under the pressure that I was dealing with as well as my family.   They gave me someone to speak with who was like a friend who had dealt with similar issues.  I went and had a 3rd opinion at Dana Farber Cancer Institute  in Massachusetts and also looked into alternative health support.  I came back with a reasonable plan which led to surgery and radiation therapy.  That was in 1994.   I have stayed in touch with the Lymphoma Foundation of America and now also serve on their Board of Directors.  I try to help any other people dealing with cancer or serious illness whenever I can.  There is no doubt that the help and understanding that I received from the Lymphoma Foundation of America is one of the reasons that I am here today.  I cannot recommend them enough and if you are dealing with Lymphoma or know some that is; this is the place to call or email.  They truly care!

In the beginning, everyone we came into contact with, regarding WEC, was supportive and excited about what we were trying to do. Starting something like WEC from scratch takes time (I may be a little impatient at times), but now we are starting to see a good deal of progress and the future looks great. At our last public event the response was almost overwhelming. Young and old alike surrounded our booth and I and a hand full of volunteers answered questions and demonstrated some of what we do at WEC. I was very pleased with the response from the public, it just reaffirms and redoubles my efforts to make the WEC Institute a premier research and development non-profit.

At Maker Faire we ran a display to explain the effects of erosion and talked about new ways to initiate erosion control.

I've never had the sense that what I was doing really mattered in the grand scheme of things until now.  The work we're doing has the potential to really make a positive difference for this planet and its inhabitants.  It is amazing to realize that we just sparked an idea in someone.  A person recently stated, "I have never considered volunteering for an organization like WEC."  That person, who never though of themselves as having anything to offer, now realizes they do.  And that they, one person, can make a difference. We've changed their life.  They in turn may change the life of others.  For me, it's simple.  Just knowing that I, in some way, had a small part in all of this is really satisfying.

Thumb Industries Inc	25454	7	/users/profile/26453	woodland	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/12/2010	The Laker School District was funded, by State Farm, to create a youth driven County Wide paper recycling program. Paper recycling has been done all over the world but in this case the waste has been turned into a useable energy source- paper pellet fuel. Once the project was designed, funded and the equipment purchased it was a natural fit to have the labor supplied by Thumb Industries staff and clients. Thumb Industries was supplied with collection trailers, shredders, and pellet mills to create the final pellet product. They have gone above and beyond the Grant expectations and have created the collection services and routes to manage the paper waste stream, developed the formulas and processes to create the pellets and are now working on marketing the product. Very few nonprofits that supply like services as Thumb Industires have gone to the extent of filling a need to the public, created dozens of jobs for thier clients, and are as "Green" as Thumb Industries.

Homeless Angels	294493		/users/profile/385233	Tina101	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	I first learned of the Homeless Angels a few years back from posts that I would see on my friend Jody's fb page, never really had much thought of helping due to this false image that I had regarding people that were homeless. It wasn't until almost a year ago when I decided to take a visit to the Homeless Hotel...there I stood talking to one of the residents that was organizing the free store. The gentleman shared his story with me and stories of many others like him. That day I sat for hours researching all that I could find regarding these people called Homeless Angels...as I read all of the things that I found online, tears flowed from my cheeks...tears of so many different emotions. I immediately signed up to provide breakfast for the children on a Saturday morning. That day has changed my views, my heart and my plans forever. I am thankful that God has lead me to be part of such a wonderful outreach. I've seen nothing but love pouring out of the hearts and hands of many volunteers! Together through Christ a community unites in order to provide support for those that need a chance to get life turned around. A big shout out to Mike Karl, his fiancee, his mom and all of the core group for doing what you do! God Bless

Communication Alliance to Network Thoroughbred Ex-Racehorses	213673		/users/profile/276871	Janet98	Volunteer	5	09/05/2014	Canter is a free service available to racing trainers and owners. Canters mission is to help retiring racehorses find a new, non-racing career which is suitable to each individual horse. Canter also partners with Michigan State University to provide surgery for injured racehorses as well as offering an invaluable teaching opportunity for veterinary students. The horses undergo down time as needed during their transition, rehabilitation and training for their new, non-racing career. Each program is tailored to the individual horse keeping their history  and abilities in mind. When ready, the horses  are made available for adoption through the adoption process and are then available to go on to a variety of new careers. This can range from a companion horse to trail riding to competing in the disciplines of dressage (English/Western), hunter/jumper, 4H, or 3 day eventing.Canter Michigan has a wide support circle available to the horses and to the program. These include the veterinary services mentioned above, as well as transportation, experienced volunteers who care for the horses, and various facilities who showcase these horses to prospective adopters and provide the necessary rehabilitation and training to transition these horses to their new career opportunities. Support for Canter Michigan is also provided by individuals, local as well as national businesses and organizations who believe strongly in the opportunities that Canter Michigan offers to help these ex-racehorses go on to find new careers and homes.

Its great to see pictures and stories of these horses in their new lives after racing.
The Ian Clemens Foundation	317518		/users/profile/408654	sssegal	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	It has been my great honor and pleasure to volunteer for the Ian Clemens Foundation.The foundation was set up by Al and Michelle Clemens and the Foundation was named after their son who died of cancer soon after Ian started at the University of Michigan.  Al and Michelle having faced the worst tragedy that parents can ever endure.  Instead of succumbing to despair they  have used Ian's death to work on improving the lives of other families facing similar situations.  This is the goal of the foundation.  The events are always well attended and the Clemens's have the ability to embrace you and make you a part of the family.    
The Ian Clemens Foundation	311151		/users/profile/402493	Joe_94	Board Member	5	10/16/2016	The work of Al and Michelle Clemens to make this foundation a reality is truly inspiring.  They continually honor their son's memory by working year round to raise funds for the Foundation, which go towards an Engineering scholarship at the University of Michigan, as well as to families struggling with the costs of pediatric cancer.  It is truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with such generous people.  Every year the Foundation grows, raising more funds and touching more lives.  I'm excited to see how much good work can be done in the coming years!

Now they are helping families recoup the cost associated with pediatric cancers and supporting organ and tissue donation along with helping families afford the cost of college.They have kept the family feel while expanding upon their fundraisers which allows this foundation to be meaningful and succesful.

Habitat for Humanity, Grand Traverse Region	237912	4	/users/profile/322876	spudkth	Volunteer	5	02/11/2015	I have been a volunteer with  Habitat for the past ten years. Before my retirement a co-worker knew I enjoyed construction and asked me to participate in the Jimmy Carter "blitz build". I have lost count, but I am sure I have participated in providing at least forty families a new and affordable home. Each of their stories are unique. But the "joy" that they demonstrate is universal. Each family works alongside the volunteers as they build their house. You hear their story and enjoy what they express daily as they see their dream materialize.The organization staff and board of directors are wonderful. They "walk the talk" of being committed to their mission. They are very supportive of helping the recipient families prepare to be owners of new home. They are invested in doing all that they can to make sure the ownership is a long term success. The construction supervisor makes sure that the work is of high quality. Each work day you enjoy the working with other volunteers who are also committed to building a quality, energy efficient home. You always receive a heart felt thank-you from the supervisor. Additionally the director and her staff find various ways to let you know you are valued.A great organization with a great mission. Thomas Keith
Amma Center Of Michigan	18187	5	/users/profile/19696	Mary	Volunteer	5	10/21/2009	I have worked for two non profits in Michigan. Both of them had residential programs for youth who were abused and neglected.  The Amma Center of Michigan took the wish list of these children and bought Christmas presents so that in the morning they had presents from Santa.  Recently  they gave a donation so the youth could have summer experiences they would not normally receive.  Just this week I was able to send a six grader to camp with her school mates.  Without those funds she would not have been able to go.  This will give her a normal experience that most kids would never have doubted they could go.  She held the form for many days from staff because she was so sure that being in a residential treatment program would mean she couldn't go.  Thanks to the Amma Center for all the memories they have given the youth in our residential treatment program.

One of the ways to help is at Mother's Kitchen, which  prepares and serves food every saturday at a transitional family shelter in Ann Arbor. The residents get assistance to "get back on their feet." One woman said to us (those who were serving food that day), "Thank you all so much, one day I want to help others just like you are helping us."
Amma Center Of Michigan	15776	7	/users/profile/17617	Jerry59	Volunteer	4	10/19/2009	Amma's help with the poor and disadvantaged has been an inspiration to me.  Her volunteers routinely help feed the poor in kitchens, as well as feeding others sprititually.    Her trips to various cities in the U.S. to give us hugs is the external manifestation of the workings of an organization that truly serves others.  It is sorely needed in times like this.

Having had experience with other nonprofit organizations and their staff, I can honestly state that this is one of the hardest working and dedicated group of individuals that I have had the pleasure of interacting with on a regular basis.  The executive management and staff are always cheerful and eager to share their current productions and future lineups. It will be an exciting 2009 and 2010 season at the Performance Network.

Through a simulation employment agency students become employees responsible for their finances, bill paying, purchases, etc. They are paid every two weeks in cyber money based on their GPA, absences and tardiness. Thus, the F.L.O.W. empowers students with practice life skills, work ethics, personal development and financial literacy while simultaneously helping them to acquire and maintain full engagement in the academic learning process.

Raising their GPA, raises their paycheck.  I believe when one learns about finances at an early age, lifetime habits are developed. Grants for such a project as this will take this project to another level as the name implies.  We are looking at the Future Leaders of the World, our children.  Help us educate as many as possible about everyday Finances.

The walking trails wind through the forest and to the river or through the prairie and to the wetlands.  There are always educational events taking place. The herb garden is next to the historic 1860s log cabin and has a charming log bench where visitors can sit and enjoy the fragrance of the plants that might have been used by the Moon family who lived in the log cabin. Woldumar is a door into nature and environmental education and preservation.

Porter Hills Village Retirement Community	4626	1	/users/profile/6371	MEMMEL	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/19/2009	From the time that I first volunteered at Porter Hills Village (PHV) while I was in college, I was very impressed by this organization's commitment to seniors, drive for excellence, and dedicated, knowledgeable staff.  Now, having worked at Porter Hills for more than 5 years, I am even more impressed by what I am able to observe and participate in on a daily basis.  Porter Hills truly lives up to its mission of "providing a continuum of high quality communities and services for older adults in accordance with Christian values".

There is a hum of activitypurchases being made in the PX, the Store of Treasures or the Emporium, a table or two of Bridge or Porker, perhaps the artists group at work in the Activity Room, a history class in the Assembly room and a group of friends or family members having lunch in the Caf.Everyone one smiles and nods a greeting as we navigate the traffic of walkers and Amigos. Or I stop to speak with acquaintances and the greeter at the desk in the apartments lobby. If I feel the need of a more meditative stroll, I wait until the lunch or pre-dinner hour or move up to the second or third floors where the halls are quiet. As I pick up my coat back outside the Meeting Hall, I smile at the sound and sight of the dear little children of our daycare center Generations.It may be snowing or raining outdoors, but Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood!

Some of them didn't even know what cats/dogs were kid friendly. Also they didn't sit in on the "get to know" the animal part of the application process. I've been to shelters that work a lot smoother than this one.
Lenawee Humane Society	203699		/users/profile/265729	maverick16	Volunteer	5	06/25/2014	Awesome No-Kill shelter! Staff seems very knowledgeable and caring, although much of the time overworked(as is usually the case for many shelter workers). Wish they had the funds to hire more workers or that more people would volunteer. They have a good selection of animals at the shelter and the staff is good at getting to know each animal and temperment testing them so they know how to properly place each animal. They do their best to find each animal its FOREVER HOME by getting to know potential adopters and their individual lifestyle and letting potential adopters spend time with the animal in a socializing room. Finding the animals a FOREVER HOME is very important to the staff here and they work hard to find the perfect  match and at times they have to turn a potential adopter down because they are not the right match for that particular animal. Often potential adopters think they want a particular animal because of the attractiveness or breed of the animal, but they are not aware of the particular needs of that animal and the animal does not fit for their individual lifestyle. The staff at LHS is very knowledgeable about what each pet needs for a proper fit and helps guide the potential adopters so they find the right animal for them. However, if for some reason the adoption does not work out, the shelter does gladly take the animal back to find it a new home. They want the animal to be loved and cared for and and have a happy home for its entire life and do understand that sometimes no matter how much work they do to try to find the right home for each aninal, sometimes it just does not work out.

Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Foundation	109191	1	/users/profile/148712	fmgsf	Board Member	5	04/06/2012	My clients wanted to provide their children with monthly cash that they could rely on for their respective lives. After discussing the use of trusts, including charitable remainder trusts, they decided that Charitable Gift Annuities for each of their children with the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Foundation was the answer. It provides certainty (each child will receive the same amount on the same day of each month), security (the Foundation is substantial enough to make the payments it agreed to make),  and simplicity (no investment plans to review). Even more important, it will provide an eventual benefit to the charity they have come to love: the Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park. The fact that there were tax benefits to both the donors and their children was just a bonus. Dirk Hoffius  Varnum333 Bridge Street NWGrand Rapids, Michigan 49504

What begin as "a date night" was too good to keep to ourselves so we began bringing the children to the shows. It has become a sort of right of passage in our family to be able to attend the MSF. Now as young adults they too come each season and are delighted. The MSF does an incredible good of bringing Shakespeare to life at the same time keeping it fresh and appealing. The MSF is a true gem.
MICHIGAN SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL INC	288510		/users/profile/378704	Lois23	Client Served	5	05/04/2016	This became a rekindled love affair with Love's Labours Lost, which I attended with a group of friends in 2012.  20 minutes into the luscious and humorous production friends on both sides, one after the other leaned in to whisper, eyes alight "It's clicked...I understand the words!".  It is magic when MSF actors perform ("translate" if you will  with such ability and grace.  An added plus - the entire audience enjoyed true belly laughs in this comedic performance.  2015's A Midsummer's Night Dream was another standout among each  season's offerings...a weird, wild and wonderfully fun performance.  An elegantly simple set and a perfect cast made for a perfect evening.  I love MSF (both with the eyes AND the mind)!

Welcome Home For The Blind, Inc.	27218	1	/users/profile/28262	bill1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/06/2010	Welcome Homes for the Blind has significantly increased its services and provides quality professional support to its clients.  This transitioned from owning its own facilities to one that now outsources services with measurably less expense and increased services throughout the area it serves.  An excellent organization that provides a needed service.  I have more than 20 years experience in the field of blind services.

Welcome Home For The Blind, Inc.	3503	1	/users/profile/5283	ConcernedLion	General Member of the Public	1	04/15/2009	The "home" in Welcome Home no longer exists.  It was closed in 2004.  The Board's attempt to redirect this organization into a nursing home certification service (Welcome Homes Residential Services) has failed the past 3 years to obtain a single member nursing home.  Money sent to this organization pays the one and a half staff their salaries and pays rent, etc., with little benefit to the blind.
Outdoor Discovery Center - Macatawa Greenway	35305	1	/users/profile/36139	paul13	Donor	5	04/09/2010	We actually first visited the Outdoor Discovery Center to find a Geocache.  During our 2 1/2 mile walk around the ODC we were so impressed with what had been done with the grounds that we returned later in the summer with our small group from church.  This is a wonderful way to get families and children away from video games and TV to learning about nature and get some exercise at the same time.  We recommend this place to all our friends.  Keep up the good work!
Outdoor Discovery Center - Macatawa Greenway	35278	4	/users/profile/36109	kathy-winnett-murray	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/09/2010	I'm a college professor who loves to teach ecology, behavior and zoology outdoors, but it's a pretty tall order to come up with a great place to teach outdoors about Animal Behavior in the middle of winter in lake-effect influenced west Michigan.  But because of a recent partnership formed between ODC-Greenway and Hope College (where I work), I decided to try to make use of their field station and outdoor resources for my Animal Behavior class this winter.  It turned out to be the best winter animal behavior ivnestigations we EVER had in my 23 years of teaching experience here.  The field station made the perfect "home base" to construct materials, convene and brief the class, warm up, store things, and even watch wildlife from inside when the weather was bad.  From the home base, we were able to embark out in all directions (small groups of college students having been assigned different study areas in most cases) to set up experiments, observe wildlife, and learn how to collect data.  We completed two long-term experiments that were extremely data-rich and gave my students great challenges in both animal behavior interpretatino and in data analysis.  Plus we came out for several one-time events, such as an "Owling" night in late January hosted by Jamie Krupka.  Because of ODCs hospitality and open-ness in letting us use all of their facilities as much as we wanted, my students were able to enjoy a much richer educational experience with real wildlife in real settings than ever before in a winter semester.
Outdoor Discovery Center - Macatawa Greenway	35103	9	/users/profile/35945	maggie3	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2010	I am surprised that more people haven't found this gem. I have been to many of their "Bird of Prey Days" events, photography classes, and herb walks. All of the volunteers are open, easy to approach, well informed, and fun. To unwind I often simply walk the park for exercise and to enjoy the Raptor Center on my way home from a stressful day. They obviously take very good care of their birds. The trails aren't always perfectly groomed, but weather is often a culprit. I love the idea of the "No child left inside" program, and am impressed at how many school children they teach each year.
Wedgwood Christian Services	275220		/users/profile/364811	Kerry23	Donor	5	12/31/2015	Wedgwood is a groundbreaking organization.  Unafraid to tackle the most difficult and potentially controversial situations, they take Christian love and compassion to a new level.  The team is highly professional, focused on their mission, and talented.  West Michigan supports their efforts to make a difference in the lives of children and teenagers who have experienced challenges beyond what most people could imagine.It's impossible not to be moved by the courage and determination of their clients, and by the difference Wedgwood Christian Services has made in their lives.

I am amazed at what it takes to put on a show at Center Stage or to hold one of the Art Fairs or maintain Heritage Park.  And they do it all with positive energy and smiles.   It is a great place to volunteer but it is also a great place to spend time as a visitor.  The museums are outstanding and the shows and events are spectacular.  I'm very proud to be a part of MCTFA and proud that Midland has such a great organization.

Social Philanthropists Foundation	36164	7	/users/profile/36954	davep	Client Served	5	04/19/2010	Rob and the SPF have been phenomenally helpful with regards to our larger DetroitNET.org Pink Slip Party events.First and foremost, Rob asked what sort of organization we were, what we were looking to do, what our events were like, and really took the time to understand the Detroitnet.org group's core focus and ideals.  He then put us together with The Pink Fund, a group that's dedicated to helping those afflicted with breast cancer, in order to let us help them in their fundraising efforts at our larger events.  Rob handled all of the coordination between our two groups, making sure that everyone was on the same page with expectations, scope and purpose.Rob also stepped up and was immensely helpful with our registration table, and selflessly threw himself into a situation that other folks would easily find to be too overwhelming as hundreds of people showed up with whom he had no familiarity whatsoever.  I cannot possibly thank him enough for doing so, as it allowed more time for those of us engaged in running the group to make the rounds of the room and ensure that people were making the connections that needed to be made, and that everyone found who they were looking for at the event.  He was also great in advance, using his own connections and resources to help get the word out about the event beforehand.I cannot possibly put into words how highly I regard Rob in particular, and this organization in general, for what they've done to help our events as well as helping us aid an organization that deserves as much help as it can get.

POUND PALS DOWNRIVER	279083	1	/users/profile/369125	Rose Ann D.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2016	The reviewer DDR_volunteer is obviously confused about Pound Pals Downriver.  This non-profit works closely with the animal shelter in Wyandotte  and has helped institute strict spay and neuter rules for adoptions through that shelter.  This non profit also funds the medical care for sick and injured  animals that come into the shelter so that the euthanasia rate is extremely low.  Pound Pals Downriver is an absolutely top notch non profit!!
POUND PALS DOWNRIVER	279044	1	/users/profile/369083	lapcat	Board Member	5	02/04/2016	You must be mistaken with another group.  Our non-profit has implemented a spay neuter program for the nearly 2000 animals that are impounded at Downriver Central Animal Control (animals from Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Southgate and Wyandotte, MI).    Our spay neuter program has existed since 2008.  Originally, Humane Ohio spayed our animals and currently the Paws Clinic spays our shelter animals .   All animals are spayed prior to adoption.    It has a strong volunteer program and the  implementation of an adoption program back in 2006 has dropped the euthanasia rate from 80% to less than 10% at the animal shelter.   There must be some kind of confusion as a simple call to Paws Clinic could verify we have a spay neuter program.    People who have adopted from the shelter could also verify that their animals were spayed and neutered.   Simply put, an excellent program for a municipal animal shelter.      
POUND PALS DOWNRIVER	270960		/users/profile/355506	DDR_volunteer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/03/2015	This group has repeatedly advised adopters that they do not have to spay or neuter their rescued pets. Every legitimate animal rescue knows that spay/neuter is a critical component to ending the pet homelessness crisis. To advise otherwise is irresponsible. You can't and shouldn't call yourself a rescue when you have no care of concern for the plight of homeless pets. 
Waterloo Natural History Association Inc	134535		/users/profile/180376	miflyfisher	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	The WNHA provides outdoor education and recreational opportunities throughout the Waterloo Recreation Area. We are an all volunteer organization, working on projects like the observation deck at the Eddy Center, the indoor active beehive display, trail work, and funding projects that support outdoor education, recreation, and conservation. I believe that we have an obligation to support programs that give others, especially urban youth, some of the experiences that made us connect so deeply with the natural world. 
Waterloo Natural History Association Inc	134165		/users/profile/179947	woodswoman	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	Just returned from a wonderful 5 mile hike along the trails surrounding the Eddy Discovery Center.  The crunching of the leaves underfoot and the spicules of frost on the autumn olive leaves enhanced my fall hike along the Oak-Woods and Lakeview Trails.  There are almost 15 miles of trails within the immediate vicinity of the Eddy Discovery Center.  Besides these trails you can also explore bog, lowland woods, swamp and old field habitats.  I feel very lucky to have Waterloo Recreation Area and its 20,000 acres as my backyard playground.  I have been a member and volunteer of the Waterloo Natural History Association since its inception over 30 years ago.  The WNHA functions as a "Friends Group" for the Eddy Discovery Center, located within the Waterloo Recreation Area and operated by the DNR.  The goal of the WNHA is to provide both educational and recreational opportunities to the public.  Interpretive programs may include evening walks to the spring pond to hear spring peepers, a walk with a naturalist to hear owls or maybe an astronomy lesson on the constellations.  Sandhill Crane viewing in the fall and Maple Sugaring in the spring are events that attract hundreds of visitors each year.  If you are a bird enthusiast or enjoy photographing wildflowers then the trails surrounding the Discovery Center are the place for you.  The WNHA obtains its funding through memberships, donations, program fees and gift shop sales.  The organization is entirely run by volunteers and all funds that are generated are used to promote education and recreation within the Waterloo Area.  If you would like to find out more about the WNHA visit the website at WNHA.org
Waterloo Natural History Association Inc	133940		/users/profile/179702	Kathy80	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	I have been a member of the Waterloo Natural History Association for 20 years and can enthusiastically recommend it to anyone interested in promoting an appreciation of the natural world.   The purpose of the Association is to provide both educational and recreational opportunities to people visiting the Waterloo Recreation Area.  The Association is composed of concerned citizens who value environmental education and want to share their love of the Waterloo Recreation Area with others.  Everyone is invited to become a member.   WNHA uses its resources to support the DNR and to provide additional offerings to the public.   Projects which have been done in the past include:  an observation deck with handicap-accessible spotting scope, live-animal exhibits, display cases, a beehive, and an osprey nesting platform.  WNHA also sponsors festivals, entertaining and educational programs, and maintains the gift shop at the Eddy Discovery Center.   Currently the Association is raising funds to upgrade the projection system to improve its program offerings.  WNHA members are all volunteers, so funds are used entirely to support its mission.

Michigan Wildlife Habitat Foundation	257655		/users/profile/346110	Wendy129	General Member of the Public	3	09/16/2015	Hello,  My name is Wendy Retzloff and I vacation at my Parents home in Crystal Michigan at Loon Lake in which the lake is divided by land as someone has filled in the wetland part of the lake in which is just about dried up.  The neighbor's have written many letters to the state regarding destruction of the lake to the state with no response.  "Loon Lake" was know as home nesting grounds to Loons, Sand Crain's and Herrings which are no longer seen, raccoons scavenge the area eating turtles, clams and fish that no longer have water as the water continues to drain.  This all has occurred over the past two years in which is devastating the area greatly.   Now the new Drain Commissioner hired her Husband who does sewer and drain work and spent county funds and put in a new drain which is also making things so difficult it will be very hard to recover the loss of this huge area of wetland.   It appears that just anyone can drain a wet land and get away with it.  I have been coming to stay at this lake every summer since I was 16 years old and now 32 years later, I have watched in two years how fast a wet land can drain and kill a special area that I used to catch turtles and watch the loons and other wildlife nest and grow.  No longer there for anyone's grandchildren to watch and learn.   Please advise as to what to do?

Autism Support & Resource Center	100486	1	/users/profile/122741	kj4amom	Board Member	5	11/10/2011	We first heard about the Autism Support Group of Genesee County (ASGGC) through a newspaper advertisement in the local paper.  The ad said they were a non-profit organization focused on the support of families with kids on the spectrum and with a mission of creating a residential community where these future adults will be able to live happy, productive and involved lives.   As the parents of 4 daughters on the spectrum and with no neuro-typical siblings to rely on to look out for them once my husband and I are gone, the thought of an organization solely focused on the helping people on the Spectrum, right in my local community, was like finding gold.The services the ASGGC has provided me and my family include (1) workshops that are up to date on how to use and collaborate with the schools on the IEPs which are the keystone for accommodations  and success of kids on the spectrum navigating and completing their grade school and secondary school experience.  (2) Workshops on dealing with bullying.  (3) Workshops on sensory training.  (4)  Workshops on the workings of the mind of kids with ASD and how to adjust how information is presented so that they can keep up and absorb it. (5) Workshops on behavior modifications and how we as parents can use their strengths to achieve progress on their goals.  From all of these workshops, we have been able to adjust how we live our lives to reduce stress and increase learning. The ASGGC has provided opportunities for my kids to have social training through family fun events such as bowling, swimming, teen socials, Halloween and Christmas parties, camp, picnicsand so on.  The ASGGC provides opportunities for social interactions that are relaxed, non-judgmental and accepting for our kids. For a parent having a child on the spectrum and putting them into social environments is always a stressful, but can also be so depressing, sad and disappointing, that you start avoiding thembut with the ASGGC events, the atmosphere is always accepting because everyone there is dealing with the same thing.  You are a part of an extended family that understands everything you are going through, because they are too.  It is life saving for many of us.  You feel you are not alone anymore.In addition to all this, the ASGGC is moving forward and making progress on the future residential project.  This is a long term goal and it will take some time, but I am confident they will get it done.With all that said, through the ASGGC, My family and I have made many new friends, learned new skills to use with our kids, successfully graduated one of our girls from grade school and is now taking college classes, have developed a positive attitude towards our future and for the first time are hopeful.just that .we are now hopeful again for happy , productive lives for our kids.

ASGGC is trying to connect the dots between the parents, schools and professionals.  Very proud to be a member of ASGGC.

1Love	120540		/users/profile/163943	Nonprofit Supporter	General Member of the Public	5	08/13/2012	I attended the Bob Marley Way event in Brixton, London this past July where I learned more about 1Love. I had the opportunity to speak to a 1Love representative there and she shared all the cool projects they have done with Save the Children, charity: water, and all of the involvement from the Marley family, who I think helped to start the organization. Cedella and Julian Marley were even at the event and stopped at the 1Love tent while I was talking to the 1Love rep. I'm looking forward to getting more involved in the organization and hope they do more in the London area!

It's an amazing expirence for both the teen buddies and the campers! My life a changed immeasurably by camp! That's why I keep coming back every year!

Childrens Bereavement Network	8693	1	/users/profile/10423	R. Friday	Board Member	5	08/05/2009	I have been a volunteer for Children's Bereavement Network for 4 years now and for the past 2 years have served on the Board.  It is hard to describe the change in the children from the Friday they arrive at camp, to the way they are when they leave on Sunday.  While they are there, the discover that it is OK to have fun again, they are not the only one who has lost someone and that whatever they are feeling- it is OK.  There are tears and smiles over the course of the weekend but I am sure that it has been an experience that nobody will forget.  The Memorial Service is a moving experience that all campers, teens, adult volunteers and family members of campers participate in.  At our camp last year we had the fortune of seeing a double rainbow during the time that rain seemed to have "ruined" part of our outdoor time.  All stood and watched together for about 30 minutes.  It was one of the unbelievable things that happens at camp.  There is also a reunion with campers and their families, teens and adult volunteers in the fall where the campers receive a puppy or bear from their loved one's clothing.  We share a meal together and also follow-up with families about how camp effected the camper.  All in all, it is a wonderful experience.

The availability of the physical plant and especially the membership have been instrumental in my continuing recovery.

The collaborative meets monthly and has great participation from other agencies and the public at large.  Lastly, I have met with the Executive Director about programs we can offer with the new Senior Center.  Overall, it is very evident that SHASS is very motivated, caring and knowledgable about all aspects facing seniors in our area.  It's a privelage to work with them.

The staff really cares about their clients as well as the funds donated.  I always feel like my donations go to do the best good, whether monetary or in kind, such as from their "needs" list.
Ruth Ellis Center Inc	25562	1	/users/profile/26572	mrosso	Volunteer	5	01/14/2010	This is an organization that cares deeply about homeless Youth. I have never felt the pressure to just donate money like other charities. The center is happy to receive items on their needs list. That way your money goes directly to helping out the youth. I have a great deal of respect for the staff and volunteers that work with the youth. Sometimes I think their troubles would be overwhelming, but the staff just motivates them to help themselves. It is great that the gblt youth in Detroit have somewhere to turn to, and I think that other cities should follow suit.
Fabulous African Fabrics	88732		/users/profile/63768	Kiri S.	Board Member	5	05/15/2011	I will be selling off personal items next weekend to raise money for shoes.  It is a cathartic way to approach spring cleaning while also making a change in a child's life.  A win-win!
Fabulous African Fabrics	59200		/users/profile/63768	Kiri S.	Board Member	5	12/28/2010	I have been inspired by the dedication of the small band of incredibly active members who selflessly devote hours and day to sew, travel and promote the needs of this worthwhile cause.  It is very easy to feel sympathy for children in need and to whip out a checkbook to make a donation.  It is much harder to be the driving force for the betterment of a community a world away.  The Fabulous African Fabrics board and extensive membership work very hard to gain every nickel they can raise to make life better and the future provide more potential for these children who are refugees of hunger, poverty and AIDS in a country where strife and political instability are common.  There is no greater satisfaction that I can have to be a member of this crew striving to make a change one dime at a time.
Fabulous African Fabrics	59240		/users/profile/63827	Sheba O.	Volunteer	5	12/29/2010	No words can describe the amount of passion and dedication FAF board members put in place to make a difference in the lives of HIV/ AIDS orphans and widows in Kenya. Being a Kenyan myself, I had an opportunity to visit Good Samaritan Children Home where I listened to stories from orphaned teens on how FAF funding is positively impacting their lives. Because of FAF the orphans' educational dream is coming into fruition. Because of FAF, vulnerable young orphans who would have perished are getting a new lease of life. To FAF, may God bless the work of your hands and for those who wish to impact someone's life, may you find joy in providing support to FAF as they search for ways and means of helping those affected by  HIV/AIDS in Kenya.
Wild Swan Theater	144032		/users/profile/190527	LPR3	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	I am a children's librarian in Ann Arbor, Michigan who has invited Wild Swan Theater to entertain and teach the children of our community for many years. Every performance is high quality and filled with joy! Traditional tales and classic literature are adapted with care and respect and details to tickle the funny bone of young audience members. I was so impressed with this children's ensemble that I became a board member to help support their work. There is so much thought put into each play that it is always a pleasant surprise and a delightful experience to watch the reactions of the children. Wild Swan is simply a class act!!
Wild Swan Theater	143970		/users/profile/190468	vweiss	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2012	I am an elementary teacher in Grand blanc. I had the pleasure of watching a play called "Shipwrecked" dealing with Michigan history at one of our local schools. We combined our 4th-5th graders (and our expenses) to bring the Wild Swan Theater group to our location. They were fabulous! This is the email that I sent to them after the performance...       Dear Shipwreck Crew... Awesome! Fantastic! Brilliant! Kudos to the cast of Shipwrecked. It positively was the best performance for students in a school that I have ever seen! the kids were mesmerized...they hardly took a breath. they enjoyed each and every second of the play and the music!   When we came back (after going to a picnic lunch and playground for three hours) the kids were so excited to see what was in the Shipwreck box. As they examined everything, they wanted to do a play! So, they started to do one and then broke into two groups so they could be creative and give a "play" to each other tomorrow. Gracias...merci...danke...thanks a million. You taught the students so much is so many different ways...history, economics, overcoming hardships...how to make scenery, learn lines, be expressive and create music!   WOW!!! I can't wait to see other Wild Swan plays in the future. Thanks for coming to Grand Blanc! Sincerely, Vickie Weiss

Plymouth Historical Society	61567	1	/users/profile/67237	Slasher	Volunteer	5	01/28/2011	When I first moved to Plymouth, MI., I had no idea of how important the Plymouth Historical Museum is to the State of Michigan and to the Midwest.  In all probability; it is, argueably, one of the real "gems" in the U.S.  A rich repository of Lincoln memorabilia and a "Timeline" that captures the essence of how important the growth of small towns was to the culture of Americana.  It is fair to say that the Plymouth Historical Museum is unique in presenting the "America" that our founding fathers envisioned.  Take a "look" - it will far exceed your expectations.
Plymouth Historical Society	61472	2	/users/profile/67110	Leis Miller	Volunteer	4	01/28/2011	A couple of years ago The Plymouth Historical Museum had "Volunteers Needed"  on their sign just outside the Museum.  I had not been in the Museum for quite awhile but remembered enjoying my visit.  I told my husband as we drove by that I think I would like to volunteer there.  I wrote down the number and called it once we got back home and left a message.  A week or so went by and I hadn't heard anything so I assumed that volunteers were no longer needed there that they had gotten a good response.  That made me happy but I was a little sad that I had missed my opportunity.  The next day, Friday I got a phone cal  from the Museum.  "Can you come to a meeting tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.?, she asked.  "I'll be there", I replied and thus began my career as a volunteer at the Plymouth Historical Museum. I've been there now for almost 3 years. I quickly became a Docent, learning everything I could about Lincoln and the history of Plymouth.  A town I grew up in and one now where I am raising my children.  The Museum is a treasure!  So much to learn and see and the volunteers are so eager to share the information with visitors. It is a great, great way to spend a day.  A wealth of information for educators and just a beautiful place to escape and think about all that has brought us to where we are today.  I love volunteering. I am inspired every time I am there and I encourage people,  I see to pay a visit.  I am very proud of it!  The staff does a wonderful job with the displays and they do quite a bit on a very tight budget.  Most of the people there are volunteers and have always been so nice and gracious sharing what they know so that we can pass it along.  I get a great deal out of the volunteer experience and encourage as often as I can, people to get out and do the same.  Giving back to the community is so important, rewarding and you get so much out of it!  Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience.
Plymouth Historical Society	61223	1	/users/profile/66804	dianne	Volunteer	4	01/26/2011	I walked into the Plymouth Historical Museum to volunteer almost two years ago. They had just lost their volunteer coordinator and offered me the position. Feeling that my background as a high school English teacher, I could easily use my skills here: coaching, organizing, training, writing, and committee work all with follow thru expectations.I met numerous volunteers who have been here for various amounts of time and do numerous jobs as well. My job is to interact with everyone and find the right spot for them and the right spot for the museum's posterity
DRCCC (Michigan Compassion)	163452		/users/profile/217004	jay bale	Donor	5	07/24/2013	What an incredible start to this organization. receiving a lifetime grant from Google is very very difficult and requires some pretty hard analyses before Google will let go of these kinds of awards. I believe it is a $250,000 a year renewable grant. What we have here are some pretty savvy people that in  not dabbling.  I like calling the plays first, so let me say this, "What we have here is the organization with the power and personnel that will be making the final push in legislation and public information that will lead to national reform for medical usage of marijuana. - Sorry about that long run on sentence. Jay Bale

Clint Herrema Ministries	117874	1	/users/profile/160302	Mike57DD	General Member of the Public	5	07/08/2012	Clint is the real deal, and his specialty is his teaching and faith in God's ability to heal any and all. Do all get healed? Does God pick and choose who he heals? Does our faith have anything to do with it? Are there some who say they want to be healed but really don't? We don't look at the visible world for answers to Kingdom issues. We go to the King. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Disappointment caused by misunderstanding shouldn't lead to critisism. Dive deeper in the faith. Your Father in Heaven wants you Free. 
Clint Herrema Ministries	57981	1	/users/profile/61502	gmac	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2010	I have had the privilege of knowing Clint and working alongside of him in the ministry for many years now and have been greaty blessed with his teaching and giftings. Not only is he a great friend but he is someone who strives to seek God in every situation and it is evident in the lives he has touched. His love for God and other people is a sure sign that he seeks only to live a life led by the Holy Spirit and to see peoples lives transformed by the power and love of Jesus Christ. I highly recommend Clint Herrema Ministries to you. I know you will be blessed  with his fresh teachings and his unique style as he shares the love of Christ in powerful and relevant ways.

Covenant House Michigan	26552	4	/users/profile/27574	Neil	Donor	5	01/29/2010	Covenant House Michigan is the treasurer of our greatest asset--our youth.  The staff tirelessly works to help raise our future up.  Their mission far transcends hope.  They help breathe life into young people otherwise who have been cast aside.  It is important to note that this mission is a statewide initiative.  I am proud to support CHM and will continue to do so.
Covenant House Michigan	26424	3	/users/profile/27455	Rodney	Volunteer	5	01/28/2010	Covenant House Michigan has a simple call:  To love and care for all children and young adults unconditionally.  The way they meet that call far exceeds expectations.  Most people know CHM offers shelter, food, clothing, and even healthcare services on-site.  Did you know it also offers a transitional living program where youths may live up to two years learning to live independently, get a job, and save money?  Or that CHM runs three charter schools in Detroit in addition to GED prep classes on its campus?  How about the community service centers that provide inner-city kids a safe haven to spend free time engaging in crafts, counseling, computer classes, ESL instruction and other forms of crisis intervention?  These services and more are part of a comprehensive "contiuum of care" aimed at equipping all kids with physical, educational, emotional, psychological and spiritual tools and OPPORTUNITIES to succeed, beginning with simply keeping them off the streets.I find it amazing that CHM continued EXPANDING its mission even during this crippling recession.  There's an inverse relationship between economic prosperity and demand for CHM's services:  as the economy worsens, people donate less which cuts into CHM's budget; yet schools are closing, people are losing their homes, and more kids end up on the street without access to basic necesseties or stability in their lives.  So, money goes down while demand goes up.  It speaks not only to the quality of CHM staff, but also its amazing base of donors and volunteers who all feel compelled to help a little bit more in times like these.
Covenant House Michigan	26266	1	/users/profile/27300	mswan17	Former Volunteer	5	01/26/2010	Working as a marketing intern, I had an amazing experience at Covenant House Michigan. I wrote articles to promote the organization, interviewed kids, helped organize events, and learned as much as I could about CHM. During my time, I noticed how passionate every staff member felt about his or her job, and how they all felt passionate about helping the kids. Many would take the time to develop personal connections with the kids, and to help counsel and mentor them. From my observation, the organization ran very well. The fundraising events were very successful, and everybody was constantly thinking of creative activities (talent shows, barbecues) to try and make things more fun for the kids. I also noticed how staff members were constantly brainstorming possible improvements to an already successful program - especially improvements with regard to staff unity, job assistance, education, etc.

The organization is devoted to the mission, the board is entirely volunteer and admistration fees are nearly zero.

Back when I worked for them.. we were paid 8 bucks an hour.. I nvr got a raise in 3 yrs of working there.. no one got a raise ever. The owner of the company feels she is God.  N we should all bow down to her.. a joke of a company.. I eel sorry for the innocent consumers. 
Community Administrative Services Inc	237167	4	/users/profile/321556	CraigP	Volunteer	1	01/22/2015	I worked for this company and to say it is a horrible company understates the matter considerably.  The pay was about a dime above minimum wage when I left and required criminal background/fingerprinting(!), MORC training (several weeks), recipient rights training, cpr/first aid, etc., etc., one would think s/he had acquired an exclusive position as a top government official or something.  It seemed like every week we were taking modules, additional course work and such for this ridiculous company.  When I complained to management about a resident mistreating another resident, I was told to stop documenting it and to stop talking about it or I would be sent changing diapers at a lower functioning house which is exactly what was done.  The company and its agents and minions ought to be embarrassed to be associated with this terrible organization.  If I could grant this organization zero stars I surely would but out of necessity to register a rating it generously gets one star from me due to default.  One could do any number of jobs (beggar, pop can collector, adult films, garbage rummager) where you'd be treated with far more dignity than working for this company.

Ann Arbor Center For Independent	126710	2	/users/profile/77043	sjs1	Client Served	5	10/17/2012	Incredible multifaceted agency. In 1993, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  I began attending the Monday night M.S. support group that met at the C.I.L.  Although there were other groups closer, this one met every week, so I could usually find time to get to a meeting once or twice a month.    As time went on, the C.I.L. was able to help me with information   when my job was about to move the handicap parking spaces to an inappropriate area.   Invaluable! There is so much going on at the C.IL that I  will probably miss a lot.                     Advocacy: Many places and events could be made much more accessible, not only for wheelchair users, but also for people with decreased vision. Advocacy efforts   support not only new building accessibility,    but also availability of arts and culture to people who might otherwise be marginalized.   Things like large print programs,  and ASLinterpreters,   They (the CIL) also have job hunting skill training.   I'm also fortunate enough to be involved in some of the CIL's recreation program- Things like  bowling,  art  biking and gardening,  There are other support groups that meet at the C.I.L., though I can't name them all. One group that is very active is the youth group. Not being that young anymore, I'm not aware of everything they do, but they have social events and specific groups to support young people with disabilities as they move out independently in  the world.    I'm always impressed with the way the AACIL  staff keeps up with interests and capabilities of the people it serves. One example is making the different people interested in art (like me!) aware of a call for submissions for a disability awareness  art show.  Or, bringing people from all walks of life to a celebration of the 20th year anniversary of Americans With Disability Act.                  *To sum it up, the AACIL has helped me with information about handicap parking, support for the ongoing problems that Multiple Sclerosis brings, making sure that I could maintain my employment  by using accommodations mandated by  ADA. They have organized recreation programs that I enjoy doing (bowling, bicycling) or watching & photographing (wheelchair rugby). They have kept me informed of advocacy events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Looking For My Sister	101997		/users/profile/131862	lfms2004	Volunteer	5	12/08/2011	This agency has provided me an opportunity to pay it forward.  Helping provide housing and lifeskills to victims of domestic abuse is so needed in this community.  I have seen first hand the women who have excelled from being in the program.  This program provides help to women who have no where to go and it's the oy program who have survivors of domestic violence working directly with victims.  I give this agency the highest rating and enjoy volunteering here
Looking For My Sister	101901		/users/profile/129383	Michella F.	Board Member	5	12/07/2011	It is devastating to read in the paper about the young woman who was beaten by her boyfriend or watch the news and hear about the married woman with two children who was killed by her husband.  Who are these victims?--Statistics of domestic violence.  Domestic violence is typically hidden, kept as a shameful dark secret, forcing victims to suffer in silence.  It is one of the leading causes of homelessness for women and children. Looking For My Sister (LFMS) is an organization that empowers women and children of domestic violence by providing housing and support services to help survivors transform their lives.  They are client focused on addressing the safety of the client and their programs are designed to teach clients how to take hold of their futures and become self sufficient.   I knew instantly after going through the volunteer orientation that LFMS was the place for me. It was reinforced even more after meeting the Executive Director and listening to her personal experience of hell that I knew I wanted to help make a difference.  As a volunteer who has been with the organization for 8 years, I continue to be impressed with the work and success of this organization.   I serve as a Board member and grant writer and I am proud to have the opportunity to work with an organization that works to rebuild, reclaim and save the lives of victims threatened by domestic violence and help them become survivors. What distinguishes LFMS from other domestic violence shelters is that they are the only remaining transitional housing program for victims in the City of Detroit once they leave the one domestic violence emergency shelter.   LFMS is powered by a passionate and professional board, dedicated staff and volunteers committed to making a difference in their community through advocacy and education.  Volunteering at LFMS has given me a better insight on domestic violence.  I have learned more about domestic violence through the eyes of a survivor that has truly made a rewarding impact on my life.  Through my writing and volunteering, I help bring voices to women and families who have been suffering in silence.  It is a rewarding experience volunteering with an organization that is a beacon of light, dedicated to making a difference in helping women find their way out of the darkness and attain self sufficiency.  LFMS is an organization that has grown to new heights and continues to look toward the futurethey deserve the highest praise for what they do and how they do it.

STAR FOUNDATION	39247	9	/users/profile/40199	kerry-ann	Board Member	5	05/17/2010	STAR Foundation is an organization that's necessary and very helpful in educating our young women about appreciating their bodies and making sure that they make responsible, well informed decisions regarding having sex at a young age. Jennifer Payne works tirelessly to ensure they young women know the types of diseases there are out there and how to make sure they don't end up being a statistic of bad sexual choices.The STAR Foundation uses celebrity influences with real, straight to the point material to get the message out there. I'd say that this is definitely an organization that's needed. With the right amount of funding the STAR Foundation could leave a life long impact on young women across the world.
STAR FOUNDATION	37964	11	/users/profile/38749	dbyrd1	Board Member	5	05/04/2010	I worked with the STAR Foundation for a couple of events before joining the board of directors.  The first event was hosted by Westchester High School where over 100 students received a candid dialogue with celebrities and speakers, including alumnus Nia Long, about HIV/AIDS awareness and their personal life experiences in valuing themselves and others.  The students made pledges to abstain and/or be safe when engaging in sexual activities.The second event drew a larger crowd of ladies after the excitement of the first event was announced.  A new line up of speakers shared their stories and discussed topics relating to the media and its influence on sex.  The girls were very fortunate to have alumnus Regina King speak giving the students something they could relate to in their own lives.  The students were extremely excited and cherished the memorable moments.STAR began working with a small group of middle school students at Marina Del Rey with mentoring and having discussions about preparing for high school.I work with STAR in finding school locations that can utilize the services for building self-esteem and awareness for our female students.

Avon Players	60816		/users/profile/66265	tina	Volunteer	5	01/24/2011	I have been a volunteer at Avon Players for the past 11 years. I began volunteering for the Youth Theater Program when my daughters were interested in performing.  The Youth program at Avon is a great experience for children of all ages and experience levels.  After my daughters became older, they also participated in Adult cast shows.  My primary interest is costumes, but over the years I have learned from other volunteers at Avon to do set dress, help with set construction, usher, help with props and many other jobs. I have made great friends there and love the feeling of a "job well done" when the show opens!I feel we put on high quality shows for our patrons!
Avon Players	60364		/users/profile/65617	Grant D.	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I began volunteering with Avon Players just over a year ago and have been coming out and working with them ever since. The group is fun, inviting, and like a second family. They are able to embrace all skill levels and have made me feel like a vital part of their theatre family. I regularly come out and paint, help with the sets, usher, and have even gotten to help out with some crews. As a Musical Theatre Major in College, and a theatre lover since childhood I have been around a lot of theatre groups but this group is the one I call home. With volunteer from all age groups I have made many friends that I would have never otherwise had the opportunity to meet. I would suggest to anyone looking for a fun, welcoming theatre group to check out Avon Players
Midland County Humane Society	200097		/users/profile/261212	Casey N.

A job like this is never easy.  There are always hurdles, as a lot of emotions can be involved, and they always find a way to overcome and become better in the process.  They have one of the highest save rates in the state and do everything they can for the animals in their care.  I have fostered, volunteered, and as I said been employed there and it has changed my life for the better.  This organization is not funded by the county or city and needs all the help they can get.  Please consider donating!

826 Michigan	67080		/users/profile/73313	EmilyJ	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	826michigan is an amazing organization, powered by a tiny staff plus hundreds of volunteers (like me!). Volunteers and staff provide tutoring, work with teachers and students in classrooms, hold incredible workshops, publish students' writing in actual books, and basically do whatever it takes to help students shine through their writing...and all for free.  Every student has a voice that is uniquely theirs. 826 helps them express it and gives them confidence that their voice is important. It's wonderful to see how students respond to having their writing nurtured by the exceptional programming that 826 provides, and by the sincere and dedicated volunteers that make it happen.
826 Michigan	65150		/users/profile/71212	SusanL	Client Served	5	02/08/2011	I'm a high school student in Ann Arbor, and over the years I've been to 826Michigan many times. 826 is a nonprofit organization that helps kids with their writing skills. It also offers opportunities to students attending college in or near Ann Arbor. 826Michigan offers all kids of programs, from drop-in tutoring after school to weekly workshops. At drop-in tutoring, students from grades K-12 can get help on their homework assignments. Monday night drop-in sessions are one-hour long classes that do not require registration and allow students to write about a topic selected for that day's session.Workshops vary with each new workshop schedule, but I have attended classes involving poetry, playwriting, fiction writing, character development, and publication procedures. Each class was taught by a volunteer who freely gave their time to 826.Because 826 is a nonprofit, it hosts many fundraisers to help support its free student programs. Some of these fundraisers have included the 24-Hour Theater, a theatrical production completed in one 24-hour session; releases of the Omnibus, a publication of student work; and more recently, Five Bowls of Oatmeal, which featured plays written by students and performed by professional actors.Overall, everything involving 826 has been a good experience for me. Their robot storefront, Liberty Street Robot Supply and Repair, offers a variety of funny and ingenious products, and all proceeds support the free student workshops. Everyone at 826 friendly, and new people are always coming into the organization with new ideas. This organization is wonderful, and definitely helps kids develop their writing skills.

At these fundraisers I graciously was introduced to all of the board and community members who made the clinic possible and was invited to help with the clinic when and where I could. I originally volunteered on the finance committee. I had taken a step back for a year and a half, and was approached by a board member asking if I could or knew of anyone who would be a good Treasurer for the organization. The board is nothing short of amazing for its diverse ideas and thoughts. Everyone is willing to put in the extra effort and time for the organization, and the number of people whom we help brings a smile to my face, especially those who desperately needed service and could not find or afford it anywhere else. The volunteers are all top notch professionals who are gracious and treat everyone equally. This is truly one unique organization with a golden heart to do what is best for our community. Finally, for the number of people we help, the cost is very low. Many people slowly get better and start to improve their lives.

Charlotte Junior Orioles Inc	214857	1	/users/profile/278169	Concerned40	General Member of the Public	1	09/12/2014	The Charlotte Junior Orioles (CJO) Athletic program still exists.   However, the organization is currently under scrutiny for how they administer the funds received for participation in sponsored athletic programs and for funds collected at sponsored events and concessions.    Since November 2013, parents and coaches from the Charlotte community have asked the CJO Board to provide an Income Statement that discloses the revenue received and the expenses incurred over the last two years.   To date (Sept 2014), the CJO Board has been unable to do so.   In August 2014 a complaint has been filed against CJO with the Charlotte Police Department to investigate the embezzlement of funds.  
Northpointe Christian Schools	254294		/users/profile/342621	pastorgeh	Client Served	5	08/28/2015	All five of my children went to NorthPointe from Kindergarten through twelfth grade. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made for them. NorthPointe did several things that were a blessing. First, they matured my children in their relationship with Jesus Christ. Every one of my children is serving Christ up to this day in the church. Secondly, it prepared them academically for the challenges of the colleges that they attended. My children all state that NorthPointe thoroughly prepared them for college. Lastly, the teachers, staff, and faculty were simply outstanding. I have no complaints and I would recommend NorthPointe to anyone who is looking for a school that will prepare their children for the future. I thank God and still pray for NorthPointe Christian Schools.
Northpointe Christian Schools	253728		/users/profile/341965	gratefulvolunteer65	Volunteer	5	08/22/2015	Our three daughters graduated from NorthPointe  Christian School with a great education and a wonderful depth of Biblical understanding. Their teachers displayed a love for the Lord, a love for learning and a love for teaching. The families at NPCS were involved and interested in their children's Christian education. As parents, we appreciated the great friends that they made while at NPCS. The investment we made to send our girls to NPCS was worth it on so many levels. They had lots of opportunity for growth and learning from participating in the fine arts, plays, golf and leadership roles. NorthPointe Christian fulfilled its mission for our children of equipping them to impact their world for Jesus Christ.

Friends of the Rouge	129913	2	/users/profile/175347	Riverguy	Donor	5	10/26/2012	For the past 25 years Friends of the Rouge has led hundreds of thousands of volunters to the Rouge River to remove trash, open log jams and improve the environment during its annual Rouge Rescue event. While Rouge Rescue is the organization's signature event, Friends of the Rouge has raised the evironmental awareness of school children in Wayne, Oakland and Washtenaw Counties, teaching them and their teachers to annually conduct both chemical and biological water quality tests each spring. Many schools have expanded this experience across many subjects including science, math, language arts, geography and history. The Rouge Project is especially attractive to local businesses who are given an opportunity to "adopt"one or more schools through financial contributions and employee involvement. The focus of Friends of the Rouge on public involvement and participation brings thousands of local adults to monitor the progress of the Rouge River in supporting fish and insects that provide physical evidence of the river's water quality. With the support of federal, state, county and local governments, Friends of the Rouge has seen steady improvement in improving the Rouge River from and open sewer and convenient dumping site for everything from grocery carts to cars and trucks. As a sign of that improvement, in early October hosted more than 40 people in canoeing the Lower Rouge River through the city of Wayne. Through all their activities, Friends of the Rouge has raised the environmental awareness of many thousand young people and adults and helped change public attitudes about the river from a public eyesore to a public resource that can be used and enjoyed. Friends of the Rouge staff and volunteers are very deserving of recognition as a Great Non-profit organization.

Global Projects for Hope, Help and Healing	128054		/users/profile/173180	Liberia	Client Served	5	10/23/2012	Dear friends,Grace and peace to all in Global Projects network. I have known the Global Projects since 0ctober, 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa.From my acquaintance with Global Projects,the organization deserven to be nominated as a favorite non-profit organization for the following reasons:1. Global Projects is a sponsor and supporter of orphans and abandoned children that are    without means to be in school. For instance, 45 school children at Trumpet Early    Foundation school are beneficiaries of Global Projects scholarship assistance.2. Global Projects is training a little over 45 young girls under the team, "Girls with    great potentials" in the city of Ganta, Nimba County, Liberia. This program is helping   couple of young girls to know their God giving values and dignity as they try to live   for God and serve their communities in different positive ways and some have been taken off the street as a result of the "Girls with great potential" program.3. Global Projects is involve with training of teachers, Pastors and Church leaders and   workers in three counties in Liberia-Nimba, Grand Gedeh and River Counties.   In addition to the training, she also help to provide school and church materials for    the use of the churches and some schools in these counties.   Materials that churches and a school have benefited over a period of two years are:   A. Bibles for Pastors and church workers in Nimba, Grand Gedeh and River Gee Counties.   B. Books and school supplies like printer, two laptop computers, two set of soccer       jessies, supporting school farm projects(cassava & rice farms, piggery) for Trumpet      Early Foundation School in Ganta, Nimba County, Liberia.4. Working  and empowering women groups in Nimba, Grand Gedeh and River Gee Counties. With these support in Liberia,there is no doubt that Global Prtojects is a life touching and transforming non-profit organization that needs nomination for whatever consideration to serve humanity around the globe.Thanks.Rev.

Safe Haven Ministries, Inc.	165562	1	/users/profile/220054	Woag	Volunteer	5	08/20/2013	I have been involved with Safe Haven Ministries for about 15 years. I had been a victim of domestic abuse during my first marriage. While I was serving on my first term as a board member, I attended Domestic Violence Orientation (an educational service that Safe Haven offers to community groups free of charge every other month) and learned about what I had been living. I also learned that I was no longer a victim, but a survivor.  I regained my self-confidence and self-worth as I continued to serve on the board and eventually was elected board president.  God works in mysterious ways and I know that He is working at Safe Haven Ministries.  I feel that Safe Haven has helped me to grow from a survivor into a thriver and I am happy to be an Ambassador for this non-profit organization anytime I am needed. If you are afraid of the person you love, please contact Safe Haven for help. LOVE DOESN'T HURT!

Wings Of Wonder	156668		/users/profile/207800	Hugh McDiarmid	General Member of the Public	1	04/29/2013	I attended WOW's presentation at the Petoskey Stone Festival 2012. Rebecca clearly was an excellent communicator and a knowledgeable expert in her field. However, I made the mistake of walking my leashed dog near the raptor boxes during her presentation. It was a quick transgression -- one or two seconds as we crossed in front -- that neither the dog nor the birds seemed to take notice of. Rebecca halted the presentation to call us out loudly for our mistake in front of the crowd, including a two-minute berating that included an admonishment to the crowd not to be as ignorant and stupid as us. We apologized  repeatedly during her tirade, before watching the remainder of the presentation from a distance.  For 30 minutes following the conclusion of the presentation, Rebecca went out of her way to find us and subject my wife, myself, and my 8-year-old niece to a barrage of unwarranted verbal abuse the likes of which I have never encountered before or since. She told me that: 1. Our dog (a puppy we rescued starving off the streets a month earlier) was ill mannered and dangerous (side note, he just passed the AKC Good Citizen test and is now qualified for therapy)2. I was an evil and ignorant person who had no understanding of wildlife and should be kept away from animals of any type. (note, I work for an environmental nonprofit dedicated to protecting Michigan's natural resources)3. We were a poor role model for our niece, who she probably assumed was our daughter (said right in front of her).4.  It is highly unlikely that I have the emotional or intellectual capacity to understand the work she does and that is the reason I felt it was OK to approach the birds with a dog (truth is, I didn't see the boxes until we were right in front of them) My favorite part was when she physically pushed me away from a line of people waiting to see one of her raptors, telling them "He can't be trusted not to harm the animals." I'm hard pressed to recall any person I've encountered -- stranger or otherwise -- who has treated my family or me with such unmitigated contempt and verbal abuse.  No fewer than three separate people who witnessed parts of the encounters approached us afterward to tell us how shocked they were that she was so malevolent. It disturbed me so much I sent a respectful email to her -- apologizing again and suggesting our lines of work might mean we have more in common than her first impression suggested. She did not respond. Rebecca has an exceptional knowledge of and love for her birds and does a great service on their behalf. Communicating that message to a broader audience requires some minimal people skills that she lacked -- at least on this particular day. Hugh McDiarmid Jr.Farmington, MI 
Wings Of Wonder	97198	1	/users/profile/113820	Kris K.	Board Member	5	09/05/2011	Wings of Wonder is a non-profit raptor sanctuary located in Empire, Michigan. Active since 1990, the primary mission is education. Wings of Wonder presents almost 150 educational programs annually throughout Michigan, reaching almost 10,000 people each year. Presentations are designed to foster appreciation, understanding, honor and respect for raptors and the important role these birds play in healthy ecosystems. Wings of Wonder is also a raptor rehabilitation and release facility. Sick, injured and/or orphaned raptors are admitted for treatment, rehabilitation, and eventual release back to the wild. All raptors are seen and evaluated by the team of participating veterinarians. The primary goal with rehabilitation is to release healthy and strong raptors back into the wild. The organization is funded 100% by private donors and grants - there is no state or federal funding.  All donations go directly to the health and well being of the birds.  There is no paid staff other than the founder/director, Rebecca Lessard, who personally administers all of the care.  It is an amazing organization!

SHELTER TO HOME INC	122411	1	/users/profile/166716	JCap	Volunteer	5	09/17/2012	Shelter to Home is  a fantastic, dedicated, hard working group of people who are making strides every day in rescuing animals (typically cats, who have a very poor turnover rate at most shelters, although they do help many dogs, too) from their local city animal controls.  They have great relationships with multiple shelters in South Eastern Michigan (in Wayne, Oakland, Jackson, and Monroe counties, as well as a few further up North), and those shelters who work with them rely on Shelter to Home to help alleviate the problem of overcrowding (leading to euthanasia) due to lack of space and high influxes of drop offs.  They also rely on STH to help with any animals too young, too sick or injured, those who are elderly, or those who have just been passed over too many times and are on the list to be euthanized.  Shelter to Home does not shy from accepting animals who appear hard to adopt, nor do they balk at animals who are ill, or who need specialized care.  They spay or neuter every animal before adoption, and they work with the local PAWS clinic (PAWS of MI, Riverview, MI) to get this done.  All animals also receive appropriate medical care (including work-ups and medications for any illnesses or disease, and dentals, and surgeries beyond s/n).  STH also collaborates with other rescues, working towards the final goal of every unwanted, stray, or unable to be kept animal having a place to stay while they await their new home. Towards this end, they have been systematically saving their donations not used for the animals to invest in a 'shelter' of their own: a 1874 Victorian on one of the main streets of the town of Wyandotte.  They are currently leasing said house, but will be looking towards the future, and hoping to mount a capital campaign to own this house, and secure the future of hundreds of animals a year with its purchase.

Volunteering at AFNA has given me the opportunity to interact with SHED, Parijat Academy, Rural Volunteers Centre (RVC), Centre for Rural Development (CRD), Atma Nirbhar Ek Challenge, Tapovan, and other noble efforts in Assam, all of which are helping underprivileged people break out of poverty and realize their potential.In addition to loving these moments, how do I benefit from volunteering in organizations like AFNA?Three things:- It gives me a shared purpose with other volunteers in North America and beyond who believe in being service to help others realize their potential- It helps me sharpen and share skills and build experience while contributing to a good cause- It gives me the chance to meet inspiring people who lead projects on the ground in Assam and other locationsIn case you havent already figured it out, I love these moments of volunteering!

As a past board member I can say without reservation that staff from the executive director down are intelligent, hard working, and totally focused on what needs to be done to provide more housing services and homes for those that need some assistance.  I was on the board six years now and were building six homes per year at that time.  They now are providing 18 homes a year, offering no interest loans for repairs on hundreds of other homeowners that cannot afford these repairs normally, and giving away hundreds of refrigerators as well.  The staff are consistently seeking ways to help others that just need that little boost.  The Habitat for Humanity Huron Valley is expertly run financially that will insure this continued wonderful contribution to our community for many, many years.

I got to attend a program that was sponsored by them called Live and Learn and this session was on financial planning for gay couples. It was very informative and I got a lot out of that seminar. I think now that they have a Executive Director, Curtis Lipscomb, new President, Tiffany McLean and Vice President Jeremiah Jones, and have moved into their new office building that will accomodate more people because of the expansion they will be able to have more programs, events, activities for the LGBT community and reach out to a lot more people in our community and really do the work that is so needed.

They work with kids from elementary thru college to develop them, not just as young scholars but well rounded people. While there are many fundraising efforts in which the board of directors and committee members can partcipate in the most rewarding are the programs that provide direct interaction with the kids where you can make a real difference. Whether it's mentoring or tutoring you have the opportunity to see how you affect each one of the scholars and see them grow year after year, reaching thier full potential.

Mel Trotter Ministries	88809	4	/users/profile/100306	L Petty	Client Served	1	05/17/2011	Mel Trotter is one of a very few such programs in the Grand Rapids, Mi. area. Due to a medical condition which lead to extended unemployment and loss of my home, I was forced to go to the Mel Trotter woman's shelter for a short period of time. Mind you, I am not ungrateful for their helping hand in my time of need, however, I was very disappointed at the level of service afforded to homeless women and children that pass through their doors as opposed to the men and drug program women. Women in the drug rehabilitation program are given many support services, medical care, transitional housing referrals and a variety of amenities to enable them to get a more solid foundation under their feet before being put back into society. If you are simply homeless, with or without children, your are literally entitled to "two hots and a cot." That is to say, if your schedule and appointments allow, breakfast is available at 7 am every morning for 1/2 an hour, and dinner is available at 5:15pm until 5:45. If you are unable to make these times, you and possibly your children will simply not be eating. The thing I found most troubling was the stringent rule of putting everyone, regardless of age, health condition and even weather conditions, out into the street promptly at 8 am until 4 pm into what is known as the Heartside area, which for those unfamiliar is the most concentrated area for homeless, addicted, and mentally challenged people in the city. They are not afforded bus passes to get around safely, nor are they given referrals to any other housing resources even though Kent county is the most abundant in the state of Michigan. It is not only unchristian how the homeless women and children  are handled by staff, but it is simply irresponsible, and puts women and children at serious risk, and vulnerability. 
St George Special Ministries Inc	193153		/users/profile/252296	logansmom2128	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2014	This campaign is raising money for "Single mom with brain tumor "http://www.gofundme.com/63fwo8. Please help us! She needs help ASAP! thank you! 
St George Special Ministries Inc	114569	1	/users/profile/156112	Sandyduby	Volunteer	5	06/11/2012	  That is my sister, Sherry, on the right. The picture was taken at the Special Ministries Easter Party in 2011.   She was born in 1947.  No one knew the hospital had made a mistake with my parents blood types.  It was a couple days after her birth when Sherrys skin started turning yellow, and they knew something was wrong.   The doctors said Sherry would never be able to hold up her head and she should be institutionalized.  My mother refused to do this and took Sherry home.  As a result of this decision, my parents divorced and Sherry grew up with my mom and her two older sisters. The results of the mistakes at Sherrys birth left her with practically no hearing.  She wears the strongest hearing aids we can find and they help, but not enough.  There are many sounds she does not hear, so her speech is a little funny to some people and her shopping list has things like oak meal for oatmeal, dish soak for dish soap, and kitty liddle for kitty litter. She also has dystonia (a neurological movement disorder) and a lot of uncontrolled movements.  They make her clumsy, and with two back surgeries to relieve her pain from all the spasms, she is now quite ridged and teeters when she stands.  She receives shots quarterly to help stabilize her neck, which, I suspect, may have been broken at birth.  People stare at her because she is different and she doesnt have many close friends, as most people dont have the patience to understand her. Thats the sorry side of Sherry,now for the best part.  Sherry is independent.  She lives with her cat and keeps her home cleaner and neater than I do.  She used to write her own checks and pay her own bills, but the dystonia and arthritis make that really difficult now.  She is a much-loved member of our family. Her life would be pretty lonely and miserable if not for one beautiful organization, Special Ministries of Livingston County.  Through Special Ministries, Sherry has been able to participate in activities such as Bingo, Faith Formation Classes, Cooking Classes, Christmas and Easter Parties, Computer Classes, and Arts and Crafts Classes.  She also enjoys attending concerts, theatre productions, and the All Sports Banquets where each participant receives a trophy.  In the past, before her back gave out, she had participated in the softball league and weekly bowling and swimming. The organization is 40 years old this year, and with the economy being what it is, they are losing funding in many areas.  It makes it tough.  It is my dream to help raise money so that my sister and all the other people like her can continue to have activities in a world that often overlooks her kind. If you have read this far, and think you would like to help by either volunteering, or making a donation, or attending Special Ministries first fundraiser on October 24th, please go to www.special-ministries.org  or call 810-229-6661, ext. 106..  Special Ministries is a 501(c)3 organization. And I am Sandy Dubisky, proud sister of Sherry.
ANGELS FOR CANCER	93038		/users/profile/106811	Wrenchin Rodney	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	Angels For Cancer has a lot of information resources on alternative methods of curing cancer and many other diseases. That mainstream medicine doesn't want you to know about. I am personally applying one of the methods and my cancer is almost gone, I am amazed no drugs.
ANGELS FOR CANCER	91682		/users/profile/104972	Jeffrey K.	Board Member	3	06/22/2011	Angels for Cancer has a big vision for helping those with cancer not only find the life saving information they need, but helping to fund the treatment and recover back to vibrant health. Angels for Cancer (AFC) helps individuals with cancer return to health, but also gives them the information, support, tools, and knowledge to make a lifestyle change in their life. We know that insanity is doing the same thing over again expecting a different result. So AFC's goal is to help change lives after cancer because we understand what you did before the cancer played a role having the illness, therefore you must do things differently in your life to ensure a healthy and vibrant life after the illness.

This foundation has researched and trusts the HIGH VALUE that EAGF can put their money to use on the children, not on ADMIN or salaries. Just Received a grant from a Livonia Foundation to help Livonia,MI kids with special needs.  These foundations trust us to distribute a very high percentage of their donation to the charity's true work: kids with special needs and their families. We promise to do so.
Emily Ann Griffin Foundation	60758		/users/profile/66166	Dr Griffin	Board Member	5	01/23/2011	Very efficient foundation: no one takes a salary, no extraneous expenses are allowed. The annual Golf Outing has prizes for the auction that have all been donated: no donation money spent for prizes. The foundation has found favor among many shrewd supporters, as we have been able to prove time and again the value of our service to Special Needs Children.
Jack Van Impe Ministries	147265	3	/users/profile/194558	Cruz A. Ramos	General Member of the Public	5	12/26/2012	A fine organization that candidly expresses a traditional Christian perspective on the news and that seeks to enlighten the public at large concerning Christian values and Biblical truth.  I have no doubt that their view of current events and sometimes hard edged commentary is driven by their adherence to Christian truths.  Over the years, I've been encouraged by their broadcasts and touched by their love of their viewership as evidenced by the passion they regularly communicate in their evangelistic outreach.  This is a refreshing departure from the phenomenally biased, so-called "news coverage" that's otherwise prevalent in the media.  Drs. Jack and Rexella Van Impe have integrity and chutzpah that's glaringly absent   in the mainstream media.  
Jack Van Impe Ministries	122107	3	/users/profile/166248	rettamead	General Member of the Public	1	09/10/2012	I never cease to be amazed at the lengths this man goes in accusing Democrats and President Barack Obama of being corrupt and evil.  He came on today and preached his politics again. This time he railed at Obama for taking God out of the party platform and not supporting Israel. Then he went on about how Obama's supporters have said he was God.  He also mentioned something about Obama being Muslim.  It was all political propaganda. Why hasn't this televangelist lost his tax exempt status?  He's been supporting Republican party candidates and condemning those from the other party for years and years and nobody ever does a thing.

Drop-In Self-Help Center	146603	1	/users/profile/193550	smartin1	Client Served	5	12/13/2012	I moved to St. Louis about 5 years ago looking for help. I was very lucky to get medical and some financial help. However I was having trouble finding any way to socialize mainly because for one I was still very suicidal. The hospitals and doctors were not helping very much in this area. Finally I got a pysch. Dr. and began a lot of work and counseling.  About three and half years later and being passed around like a rag doll, someone gave me the name and address of the Self Help Center. I didnt come right away cause I just figured it was another dead end. My best friend in New Orleans talked me into coming. He kept pressuring me to go inside. I have to say it was the best thing I have done in over ten years. I walked in and felt so welcomed by the director and one of the peer specialists. I knew right away I was in the right place and felt so accepted. I could sit here and write for ever and go on about how great this place is. So come down and see us you will be glad you did.
Michigan Basset Rescue	249252	3	/users/profile/337082	Droolrules	Former staff	5	07/22/2015	Helena's comments are slanderous. Not one word she says here is true, our board is made up of long standing volunteers. Two with our organization for more than. 20 years and one for more than. 10. We are dissolving due to lack of support ie: funds. ALL of MBRs assets are going to another 501 (c)(3) as is required by law. Does this list allow lies and slander? Apparently so. Michigan Basset Rescue has been a shining example of what breed specific rescue should be. Well respected in it's. 23 years and extremely successful. Never once in MBRs history was a sweet Basset turned away for any reason, including medical. Michigan Basset Rescue is very very proud of it's accomishments and the hundreds and hundreds of bassets it has saved over the years. Being a 501(c)(3) org, it's books are open to the public.

Through out my life money and/or Finance has been a huge part of my life. As a result allot of his information was  passed on to my children. Unlike their peers, even relatives, as adults they find themselves far more stable; financially  than they are. Homeownership, a budding portfolio for retirement, a plan to pay-off installment debt and so much more. I'm not sure if I hadn't been in the financial service industry, if my children would be as financially aware as they are.  Thus, the importance of such a program. Programs life this one are extremely under rated. The children are so important to our future in so many ways.

I have personally seen the positive impact Caribbean Children's Foundation (CCF) is making in the lives of children in Haiti.  I've seen the smiling, appreciative faces of many Haitian children who are only able to go to school due to CCF tuition grants.  I've spent time with children who are being lovingly cared for in Haitian orphanages, due to financial support from CCF.  I've seen children live to see a future after life saving surgery enabled by donations through CCF.  Caribbean Children's Foundation is making a real difference in children's lives and futures in Haiti.

Cats Cradle Feline Rescueincorporated	122623		/users/profile/167020	kgsings	General Member of the Public	5	09/20/2012	This rescue group helps cats who would generally not have a chance, such as Corky the Cradle Cat, who has received international fame as a cat with Bilateral Arthrogryposis of the Tarsus, a rare disorder which causes the legs to be turned backwards.  After several surgeries and much care, Corky has made a remarkable recovery, though ending up losing most of his left rear leg.  
Cats Cradle Feline Rescueincorporated	109256		/users/profile/148820	marybooj	General Member of the Public	1	04/07/2012	I contacted this shelter to inquire about a dog.  The person who answered the phone was so rude that I didn't even ask any further details about the dog. Wow, is this how you hope to get pets adopted?  I don't understand organizations who want to place animals in good homes but are so incredibly rude to potential owners.  It makes me wonder how much compassion they really have and if they treat these animals well. There are so many great no kill shelters in the greater Detroit area that are welcoming to potential pet owners.  I would choose one other than Cat's Cradle.

Greening Of Detroit	162423	1	/users/profile/215586	Betsy17	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	The Greening of Detroit is one of the city's jewels from a non-profit standpoint.  I am proud to be a volunteer at The Greening, which is helping to grow and improve Detroit from multiple standpoints:  Tree-plantings, urban agriculture, workforce development, education -- the list goes on and on.  Personally, my heart sings when I think about the neighborhoods that have gained so much benefit from The Greening's work.  When you hear a story about the difference made in a neighborhood, it's so very powerful.  Five-plus stars.

YWCA Great Lakes Bay Region	246692		/users/profile/334105	Kaylou	Donor	5	06/30/2015	Glad I ran across this review so I could set things straight.  I was a member of the YWCA back in 2009 when they closed.  I do not know what MaryK is talking about but she obviously did not know what was going on.  The YWCA was holding town hall meetings for a year telling members of their financial issues and even held a small telephone campaign.  When they did make the decision to close their doors the staff was informed well in advance.  Most importantly, every single member of that organization received a full refund for their remaining membership including me.  It is a shame MaryK has to write false information on such an important site.  I remain a donor of this agency and find their transformation to an efficient, mission-driven organization to be an incredible accomplishment.  Sometime organizations are faced with tough decisions and this one made those decisions, turned things around and are now providing vital programs to women living in poverty.  It is now 2015, lets move forward and focus on what matters and that is the people the YWCA serves.  I highly encourage all prospective donors to view the YWCA website to see what programs and services they provide.  They also have completed a wonderful report called The Economic Status of Women in the Great Lakes Bay Region that is getting a lot of attention. www.ywcaglbr.org
YWCA Great Lakes Bay Region	24707	10	/users/profile/25726	maryk	General Member of the Public	1	12/21/2009	My husband and I joined the YWCA because of its good price and for the fitness center.  We renewed our membership in Dec of 2008 and they closed the building in January of 2009 without a word of explanation or a refund.  We filled out a form to receive our money back--prorated but no one that I know of has received a penny and worse yet the board president has NO COMMENT and stonewalls any attempt to find out what exactly happened.  The Executive director left town right after the closing.  Whether it was outright fraud or mismanagement no one knows but the public has the right to know from a non-profit organization.
HUMANE ANIMAL TREATMENT SOCIETY	160773	1	/users/profile/213156	Friend of HATS	Donor	5	06/16/2013	There are so many worthwhile charities to support and my husband and I are just now reaching the point where we have expendable income and can give back a little.  To be certain our hard earned dollars went for programs versus operational costs, we did quite a bit of research.  After two months, we narrowed it down to two charitable organizations - one being H.A.T.S.   We scheduled a meeting with Jill and were made to feel very comfortable.  We had a lot of questions about transparency and how funds are used.  Jill not only answered all of our questions, but directed us to research GuideStar reports and talk with staff.  She even gave us a tour of the shelter!   After we made the donation, Jill called us personally to say thank you and to ask if we would like to receive the HATS newsletter and additional correspondence.  We really appreciated the personal touch and since have become volunteers for the organization.  We continue to contribute as we can and recommend the organization to anyone wishing to support an organization that extends their customer service beyond the physical doors of their facility. They do great work!
HUMANE ANIMAL TREATMENT SOCIETY	151339	2	/users/profile/202037	Mom of Max	Client Served	5	03/20/2013	We adopted our both our cat and our dog from the Humane Animal Treatment Society.  We had searched and visited many animal welfare facilities prior to traveling from Traverse City to Mt. Pleasant to visit HATS.  We walked in to a very clean environment with friendly and knowledgeable employees.  The employees answered all of our questions about Max and really worked with us to ensure that this was a good fit for our family.  We hadn't planned on adopting Bella too, but my husband fell in love with her.  The staff helped us introduce the two and even gave helpful hints on how to handle the first few weeks in our home.  They went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable with our decisions and that the animals would be a part of a healthy and happy home.  Since then, we have received kind notes and even taken Max back for a visit.  The staff remembered him fondly and he appeared to remember these wonderful people who had given him a second chance at life too.  We would (and do!) highly recommend HATS.

Crashs Landing	251654		/users/profile/339624	Wally547	Volunteer	5	08/05/2015	Most of my experience with this organization, Crash's Landing and Big Sid's Sanctuary, is in volunteering at Big Sid's. Taking care of 100+ cats involves some hard work--there are 28 litter boxes that have to be scooped and cleaned at least twice a day--but the reward is giving happy lives to cats with FIV/FeLeuk who would otherwise be euthanized. It's sort of a stewardship thing--people have thrown away pets they no longer want. These cats have FIV and/or Feline Leukemia because somewhere along the line they were left out on their own and contracted the disease from another stray or feral cat through a bite wound. It's one of the results of not spaying & neutering our pets. (These diseases are mainly transmitted via bites from intact males fighting.) Anyway, I love the cats at Big Sid's and am happy to contribute to their well-being. They are as loving, funny, and zany as any other cats. 
Crashs Landing	54458		/users/profile/55907	activistreactivist	Client Served	5	10/05/2010	Crash's Landing is simply amazing--all volunteer run.

Dream Project	26610	6	/users/profile/27616	Drew Durbin	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/30/2010	My organization, SolarCyle, partnered with the Dream Project in Pemba, Mozambique, to distribute 45 solar cookers and over 300 sanitation units to local families.  As a startup organization unfamiliar with Pemba, we relied on the Dream Project to help us get set up in the local community, find families to test our novel solar cookers, help us find translators, and navigate government bureaucracies.  Julie Malacusky, the local project director for the DP, went above and beyond in helping us get settled in Pemba.  Beyond that, everyone at the DP was a wealth of knowledge of the local community and always willing to help us out whenever we needed.  Finally, the DP center provided a great diversion as the kids were always energetic and enthusiastic and up for a game of soccer or basketball.  With the help of the DP, we were able to impact the the lives of over 2000 people in the Pemba community and grow our startup organization.  I could not recommend the DP more highly to anyone thinking about working or donating.
Macomb County Humane Society	241568		/users/profile/328166	LynneDee	Donor	1	04/23/2015	Do not give any money to this organization!  Not sure how they are allowed to call themselves a 'humane society'.  4 of 5 adoptable cats are euthanized, over 60% of all animals brought there are euthanized.  Many horror stories from volunteers, pet owners, and potential adoptees.  I don't think the majority of people that give to this organization realize that it is an extremely high kill 'shelter', and one of the worst in the State.    This organization raised over $1 Million and only spent $300K on programming in 2013, less than 30 cents of every dollar donated goes to actual care, feeding, and euthanasia of animals.  Meanwhile the Director is bringing down $70K + per year.  Seems that the leadership would rather euthanize animals than help getting them adopted.  This organization does nothing to proactively get animals adopted, they do not work with local rescue organizations, they do not even post pictures of adoptable pets on the web.  (Not for lack of funding or willing volunteers.)   This place really needs to be investigated by all authorities from animal cruelty to mismanagement of funds.  Should be shut down, cleaned up, and reopened under new management.

It is a innovative way to engage children and family to have a common platform to share ideas! The best part of the magazine is written for children but Adults read them too! We have learned so much about the thought process of the young authors and the honing in their skills in this process is remarkable! Not to forget anyone who can motivate youth to do more thinking and writing deserves standing ovation!!!

Also, PPL does an awesome job on educating the youth about the truth of abortion and really shows young people that they can make a difference in the world. Go Pinckney Pro Life!

They do not vet the dogs and keep them in wire cages almost the whole day.  Does not properly clean after them.  Many dogs have died there, and the owners one dog dog fights all the time.  Gwen just lost another dog, wonder if it was due to lack of attention, being caged all day, a dog fight.  She married a sex offender and when he kicked her out for stealing she now wants to bad mouth him about being a sex offender, but she had no issues with it in the past and before she married him. Run as fast you can, this place should be shut down.

I am so very grateful for their existence.  I was in need and they were there for me.  What a blessing.  As I read the only other review of the Capuchin's organization I felt that I had to let others know that this is a place that will help you any way that they can.  I am really suprised to not see more reviews of their services.  They are now advocating for Urban farming and they are teaching the community children how to be a part of their neighborhood.  This gives them something to do with their time and that is something that the inner city children are lacking.  Thanks, St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order for being there!

New Directions Animal Rescue Inc	306872		/users/profile/360185	JacqueT	General Member of the Public	1	09/28/2016	I would avoid this "rescue" at all cost. He doesn't properly (if any) vet his animals. He is always begging for money or food (but he would rather have money). He was even homeless with 9 dogs for over a month.  He even held for hostage a child's dog that was chipped. He wanted the family to jump though all kinds of hoops including he wanted the local TV stations involved so he could tell his side of the story.  It wasn't until the authorities got involved that he released the dog to it's owner.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN!

H-Cat Hamtramck Cat Assistance Team	205951	1	/users/profile/268230	aletaandrus	Client Served	5	07/14/2014	I have found HCAT to be very faithful in caring for feral cats in this city.  Oftentimes. they are yelled at by people who seem to dislike any creature with 4 legs but the mayor of Hamtramck supports what the volunteers of HCAT do in providing food and shelter for the homeless and often abused cats of Hamtramck, MI.I have seen youth in this city go out of their way to mistreat cats by throwing rocks at them, riding their bikes at them and trying to kick them when the cats are just lying on the grass. I have seen speeding cars, again, mostly men in their 20s-30s, though it takes all ages of ignorance, fly down residential streets in Hamtramck, not caring if they hit an animal or a person.There should be speedbumps on residential one way streets where these idiot drivers don't care about anyone but themselves.  If the city is broke traffic and speed control would help and is sorely neglected throughout this town.We don't need new laws if the old ones are not enforced and these drivers are not penalized to the max.  Again, the one way streets are a major speedzone for the lawbreakers.So, if you don't like animals. leave them be.  They have just as much right to life as people and in so many ways are kinder and more intelligent.  We could learn alot from them.Where are the parents of these cruel and heartless kids or are the parents as cruel and heartless as they are?The residential fireworks being shot off this July 2014 was nonstop 2wks. before and even 2 wks. later they're being shot into the air above the roofs and trees by children. My dog and cat were so frightened and why are they not regulated in Hamtramck, MI?Anyways, thanks to HCAT for trying to do the right thing. The rest of you who are troublemakers and selfish, you are being watched whether you know it or not. And God is taking notes too.

They seem to be really straight forward when you ask them questions. They can provide proof of all their work and I like that about an organization when you ask them. It is hard for people to find trustworthy people to donate to but I can trust their work. I really like their Orphan Sponsorship program in which they tell you the kid that you helped and their progress (almost like a report card). I haven't been oversees to see their actual work like Haiti or Pakistan but have heard some young guys who have went and seen and did the work and describe it.

Kalamazoo Animal Rescue	172339		/users/profile/228092	Tangram	Client Served	5	09/28/2013	These people are amazing. Rebecca worked with us over many weeks to most humanely capture the stray kittens in our backyard. When the usual means failed she came to our house with a special trap. Upon seeing the contraption I had my doubts but, thankfully, our rescuers have the courage of their convictions. They deftly set everything up and waited with us inside, where we all sat on the floor in the dar, scarcely breathing. The kittens arrived for dinner and as they nosed around the thing Rebecca knew just when to pull the string that brought the door down on our long feline-human ordeal.  The most amazing part came when they brought the nearly-feral kittens inside. Before I could collect towels for the carriers Marina, The Cat Whisperer, had one of the the kittens purring and gazing into her eyes. I had already noticed a rare sensitivity in this young woman, and I soon learned that she extends it toward humans as well as felines. In a gesture I shall never forget Marina very gently handed the kitten to me to hold. I hadn't even known how much I wanted to hold them, but Marina did. I didn't evoke anything like the adoration Marina had, and when I held the second kitten he even stretched his arms back at Marina then hugged her when she took him back, just like a shy baby. These women make a wonderful team. They never judged us for our inability to keep the kittens or catch them. They are extremely dedicated to serving animals and people alike. We are very glad to have worked with them
St Paul Nonprofit Chariable Organization	134874		/users/profile/103399	Faye	Donor	5	11/07/2012	SPANCO was started by the most beautiful Gisela Becker, when she was in her 70's. Now, in her 80's, she is still traveling from US to Ghana several times each year to be sure everything is running smoothly with her orphanage, school, and hospital, which saw 12,000 patients last year. She also puts together a full truckload container of clothing, furniture, school supplies, books, and many other things each year. Her house is full of donated items, which she sorts, boxes, and loads (with help) onto the huge container. She has helped thousands of children live full, educated lives, going on to University, and then returning to the village to give back for a period of time. I would like to see Gisela's work continue to grow and expand long after she is unable to do it herself. She really needs a steady fundraising system, rather than the haphazard way her projects are currently funded. Who do you know that could help make this happen?

The PBA has no adminstrative overhead and the proceeds go directly to enhancing the musical necessities of the band students including new instruments, equipment and subsidizing performance trips to far away places both domestic and international.  Not once, but TWICE, the Ann Arbor Pioneer High School Music Program was recognized as THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY (#1) in the judgement of the Grammy Foundation Awards within the past few years.  An amazing accomplishment thanks to the dedicated teachers and students at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School.

The Corner provides much needed primary health care, education, and support for young people ages 12-21. Not only do they provide excellent medical care in a professional and welcoming environment, they also offer a number of programs (e.g., a Youth Theatre Troupe) through which young people can become engaged in their community and learn valuable leadership skills. As a board member I have seen first hand how passionate the people involved with this organization are AND how much the youth they serve enjoy and appreciate all that the Corner adds to their lives.

Lisa Colagrossi Foundation	286847		/users/profile/376918	Carolyn_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The Lisa Colagrossi Foundation is a private funder of brain aneurysm programs focused in the areas of awareness, education, research and support throughout the United States. Her story inspired me to do more regarding bringing awareness regarding this silent killer.  I have started writing a book regarding my own experience after suffering a ruptured brain aneurysm on Nov 21st 2014.  'In a Blink of an Eye'here is my story:Who knew that one day I would be busy> at work excited for the weekend and sign off my computer. > I get in my 1964 VW and head home.............> > Incidentally I had just returned to Seattle from Daytona Beach> FL where I met my three other sisters.  Our 90 year old> father Donald R Arnold passed away.  Our 90 year old mother> was alone > in the house they shared. My father was a WWII veteran US> Navy in a submarine.  He was my hero.  It had only been a> few days since I was back and I was excited to relax over> the weekend.> As I was driving down C St in Auburn WA from the call center I work at all of a sudden BOOM it happened, something was in my head making a horrible> noise.  I  thought at first it was my stick shift in my bug I started trying to adjust it however it wasn't that.  Than the worse pain in the back of my neck shot up like a shouting star to my head and  than the pain in my head I screamed and kept saying 'What's wrong with me to myself' as I drove I realized it was worse> so I stop my car at the intersection where I was about to turn on and  sat there crying in horrible pain worst in my life.  I tried to to call my ex mother in law where I live in WA and> work my home is in Portland with my partner of 14 years> Michelle. I  cried she yelled 'What's wrong what's wrong' I realize the> pain was to bad to continue talking.  I got out of my car> and hailed down the person behind me to call 911.  Later I> learned his name is Robert, he yelled back at me 'what is it how can i help I said call 911 something is horribly wrong with my head I have the worse headache ever (I knew at that time it wasn't just a headache)  He said he would, I heard him tell 911 my condition, than I wanted to threw up.  I cried and cried in pain.  Begged my father who is now in heaven to help me out I was scared alone and in grave condition.  Than I saw the flashing red lights and as I closed my eyes I saw bright light like I never seen before, as I think about it I truly believe my father intervene, that bright light was from him he must have told God 'not yet don't bring her home yet' my wife, her mother would be devasted.  Two individuals came up to me as I sat in my little bug and asked me tell them what was happening.   Just like above I shared about the scary horrible pain in my head.  They took my vitals >  and my Blood pressure was 212/118 pulse was 98. I also  was in incontinent d They told me they would get me help however> I had to be taken to the hospital.  While laying in the> ambulance they took my vitals again no  change.  I could hear them talking to someone on the radio> and it turned out to be the local hospital however they had> to call the paramedic to take me to a Trauma Center in> Seattle WA Harborview Medical center.  >The paramedics arrived and spoke with the medics.  When I> had to be transported to the other ambulance I told them I> had o threw up and I did......after that I don't remember> the ride almost 30 mins away I don't remember the ER or anything until I woke up in ICU.  I had stables in my head and my partner Michelle was beside my bed.  She said my ex mother in law called  her and said i was in a accident  She explained slowly what had happened to me  I had a SAH of my brain and they clipped the rupture one and another they found.  I had no idea what she was  talking about.  I had tubes, needles sticking every where.  There was drain in my head to remove the blood from my brain.  Michelle gave me my cell phone so I could take a look at myself on my cell phone.  All I remember was what I stated above.  Slowly the Nero team came into to see me.  They work through the U of Washington in Seattle there were residents interns and of course my surgeon.  They smiled and explained what Michelle had shared with me.  Told me to be prepared for additional test while in ICU.  The nurses were great they were just a shout away and a press of my call button.  My surgeon explained I had stay in ICU for two weeks and that I was in serious condition, later I learned most with my condition died when it happens or on the way to the hospital. I had 50/50 chance of living however> they assured me that they were there to HELP me.  Their> words encourage me there was HOPE there was no way I was going to die.

Emmanuel House	241416		/users/profile/327956	Bizclass	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2015	For several yeas I have worked with Emmanuel House as they serve the homeless and recovering veterans throughout the country. Every week I watch the progress being made in each individual and I cannot tell you how rewarding it is to serve this population. If you look in Websters Dictionary, you will find that a veteran is a person who has a lot of experience in a particular activity.  That is certainly true of our veterans.  Committing to go into the service means you are vowing to eliminate an enemy if necessary.  Weather you have to do that or not, you are trained and on alert for the job of protection, and you know that the service you are providing is of great value to your fellow man. You go into service to protect your family, your home, and your job. Some of our veterans come home with visible physical challenges, but all of our veterans come home with a need for emotional adjustments.  They have seen things they would prefer not to have seen, and they have done things they would prefer not to have done; and they have come home with those memories.   Their minds and bodies are still on alert and their surroundings are now unfamiliar, but there is no decomposition when they exit the service. As they try to adjust, they take a job in an office or on a factory line and they can no longer see the value of what they are doing and the memories haunt them.  If they are well grounded, supported by their families and peers, have financial resources available, and seek medical attention, the adjustment, though still difficult, is doable.  If on the other hand, if any one of these pieces is missing, they will often look for a substitute to help them survive  and that substitute tends to lead to addiction, which leads to the loss of all those things they were fighting so hard to protect: their families, their jobs, and their homes.  These are the veterans of Emmanuel House: loving, caring individuals fighting to regain balance in their lives and become a contributing part of society.

Blodgett is an agency supporting itself through the wrongful removal of children from their families by using false allegations.  This allows Blodgett to receive federal funding through Social Security Title IV E.  When is a child's life so unimportant that they may be legally trafficked/kidnapped for money?  Before you considered supporting Blodgett financially or any other type of support, check what has actually taken place in many of the cases where children have been removed.  So many from homes where they were actually very loved!

3rd World People Inc	286692		/users/profile/376762	Catherine_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Be the change that you want to see in the world.There are a lot of things in this world that are out of our control, a great number of things that we cannot change, but there are so many things that we CAN change. Those things that can make a difference, not only in my life, but in the lives of people around me, are what I choose to focus on and that is what inspires me to give. A few years ago, after dealing with the sudden death of my father, struggling with my mother battling cancer, and coping with the overwhelming depression brought on by infertility, I found myself in a foreign country doing a VBS missions trip with children. I caught myself standing in a room full of impoverished people, looking around the room as they raised their hands to God and they not only prayed for their struggles, but THANKED Him for the little that they had. While there I also met a man who had a crippling disease and he told me of his pain and suffering. He went on to share with me the abandonment he had as a teenager, the torment of having his best friend murdered and die in his arms, and the struggles of poverty and starvation. He also shared with me his faith. He told me of a time when he was at rock bottom.  He had no food, no money, no home, and no one to turn to, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to suffer for because he was trying to make a difference in the lives of others. He was given the opportunity to leave, to escape this torment and leave it all behind.  He had a choice to make and he chose to give his life to those in need rather than run because he had faith that God would provide. It was at this moment in his story that I realized my life meant nothing if all I was doing was living for myself and I vowed to change the things that I could and leave the rest to God.I knew that I wanted to make a difference in this world and I knew that the change needed to start with myself. I changed the way I ate and I changed the way I lived. In fact, I changed so much that I lost 100lbs in less than a year and completed a triathlon. Not only did I change my appearance but I changed my outlook on life. I started small by helping the man that I met, sending him money when I thought he would need it. After all, this man changed my life and I wanted to change his.  Our friendship led me to Honduras where he was living and helping in an elementary school. I met and fell in love with each and every 104 students that were in that school. They showed me a love that I had never experienced before. They looked at me as a mother, a friend, even an angel of hope with tears in their eyes and smiles on their faces. How do you walk away from that? You can't! To look around at the community and see fathers to had abandoned their families, parents who had been murdered, children who were beaten and abused, living in homes made of mud, sheets, and broken pieces of wood; walking away was not an option. We wanted to do whatever was possible for these kids, but with no money it seemed incredibly difficult. Difficult, but not impossible. We looked for the things we were able to change, and we started teaching them. We started with English lessons in the elementary school, teaching them a skill that they could use to get a job with no further education, but it wasn't enough. The government in Honduras only provides schooling through 6th grade, after that the families have to pay for school. In this community they are too poor to advance past 6th grade. So after a few months we came to the decision to start a school for these kids, grades 7, 8, and 9.  We had nothing to start with, nothing but the desire and the Faith that God would provide.God provided! We found an organization to help us, one that believes in making a difference in the world, no matter how small. The efforts of this organization not only help our school in Honduras but they help schools in other countries like Burundi and Uganda, they help in the Philippines, in Haiti and are now making efforts to join the war against human trafficking in the United States.  Supporting the organization, 3rd World People, is near and dear to my heart because, like me, and like my partner, they believe in doing whatever you can to make the changes that are possible and leave the rest to God.We are now nearing the end of our second school year and we have plans to start a bakery for the school. They will not only be able to learn lessons that will help them in their futures, but we will be able to generate an income for the school to pay for our teachers and supplies. We are excited for the future of our school and we couldn't be more proud of our students. They are bright, caring, and funny and they are a constant reminder to us that although we can't do everything, we can do something, and we can change the world!

Springs Of Hope Foundation Inc	286735		/users/profile/376805	Jennifer_B2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	If you look at Murang'a on Google Earth it's misleading.... From the images you see what looks like occasional grey warehouses and trees dotted along the side of brown roads. It kind of looks like nothing much is there. The reality is something quite different. Murang'a is vibrant, noisy and colorful. The streets are tightly packed with brightly hand painted shops and businesses all imaginatively named and unique (a favorite one spotted last night was the 'Meat Garden Hotel').Bike taxis buzz around the town - a 6km ride from Murang'a to Roko costs around 60p. The bikes are all fabulous extensions of their driver... Extensively decorated with slogans and bright flashing lights they often look a party on two wheels. The edges of the streets in the center are lined with men and women all selling their produce on wooden pallets. Avocados (4 massive ones for 0.30p), thorn melon, passion fruit, sweet potato, cabbages, onions, oranges etc etc - all beautiful and fresh. People are honest about their prices and very friendly - in among the hustle and bustle you can always catch people singing or laughing together.The other thing you can't see from the images online is the color of the actual earth. The best way to describe it is like intense cocoa. It's bright and deep in color - a bit like you have put a bright color filter on Instagram on it. In the sunshine it reminded Cassius of the dusting you get on 'top of a posh chocolate truffle'. He's spot on.Back to today..... I spent the morning visiting each class doing music sessions. I caught a quick break for a lunch of beans and kale with Cassius, Job and the cat followed by a practice with the teachers for their song for Thursday's concert. All the teachers were amazing - we worked on some harmonies and movement and will perform Jambo Bwana on Thursday.... All the kids had their noses pressed against the windows very excited to see their teachers Margaret, Merci, Caroline, Dorcas and Zipporah in action, and Cassius and Job supervised the kids.At 2pm the whole school met up for group practice and with another planned tomorrow we will hopefully be ready for Thursday!Each day speeds by with so much going on and Cass is working at breakneck speed trying to get the blue house finished in time for Thursday too... Never a dull moment.Yesterday passed in a blur. Everything has been so busy that I have struggled to find a minute to write. The end of term celebrations went great - songs were sung, certificates awarded and everyone had lots of fun. Tracey gave a lovely talk about the ethos of Roko's teaching - learning through play and education without corporal punishment (which is common place in most schools). The event was also attended by Michelle, Buddy and Blake who hail from Texas, USA. They have been great supporters of Roko and have helped with everything from providing dentists, doctors and even wiring the school in preparation for when electricity is available in the area.Roko made sure that each and every child received a small end of term gift and after the ceremony bags of donated shoes and sandals were lined up so that the kids could start next term with new shoes. Much excitement ensued with children showing off their new footwear. There was lots of tearing around after balloons we had put up on the buildings and the kids were thrilled with chocolate we had bought for each of the kids. To quote one of the girls from the Rescue Centre - Stellah - 'Today has been a good day... a good good day'.After the last of the kids departed in the late afternoon we were all knackered after such a long day. We headed into Murang'a to grab some food and pretty much collapsed into bed as soon as we got back to school. Today has been quiet in comparison - I cant believe we are leaving in the morning. I managed some of our washing, attempted to cook on the fires in the kitchen and painted the bases of the last of the classroom buildings. After we leave Cyber' tonight s we plan to pop into the Rescue and Kenwa homes to say our farewells to the sponsored children.Coming to Kenya and being part of such an inspirational project has been such a fabulous experience for both me and Cassius. I know we will miss all of our new friends so much. Most of all I want to say a massive thank you to everyone here - the children included. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed and secondly for giving us the opportunity to be a part of such a brave and life changing community. I am already looking forward to coming back again....For a child to receive the education they so desperately need it costs around 10 pounds a month.... amazing I know.Our last night in Murang'a.Cassius and his Mom.www.springsofhopefoundation.org

The Bethania Foundation	53022	2	/users/profile/54074	steinermicah	Volunteer	5	09/21/2010	I have had a relationship with Bethania for over 10 years that started while studying abroad in southern India in 1999.  I saw firsthand the care and concern that Bethania Kids provides on a local level.  I was impressed with their efficiency, integrity, and the fact that all of their work in India is done via local paid and volunteer staff.  My experience with Bethania in India forever changed my life and the organization is still near and dear to my heart. As a youth pastor, Ive been privileged to help raise money for Bethania for the past 7 years through various youth sponsored fundraisers.  We worked with several Christian aid organizations while in India, however the reason I was so endeared by Bethania is because they truly put their money into the spiritual, physical, and emotional care of Indian children.

It really do bring the past to life.

Ywca West Central Michigan	258077		/users/profile/346564	Lynnsa	Volunteer	3	09/17/2015	I was a volunteer at this organization for just over 5 years and although it does offer a lot of services for women, victims, and children, the management leaves a lot to be desired.  Volunteer are often made to feel bad if they don't cover as many shifts as the supervisor feels they should, despite the fact that there is no minimum and because they are volunteers, it is largely dependent on when they have time to commit to covering shifts.  There has also been a strong push recently to appease law enforcement and outside medical professionals, often at the expense of the client and is done in such a way that the volunteers are forced to be mediators in some very sticky situations.  Trying to address these issues with higher ups was a waste of time, as they don't want to know what issues are present nor seem to have any intention of dealing with them properly, if at all.

When I called to make the pledge, there was a bit of miscommunication, but I was contacted by their Membership Director, Ryan and everything was taken care of.

Not only does it give a creative outlet to anyone who is willing to pick up a paintbrush or pencil, but after a certain amount of time, it also gives an opportunity to sell their work.  I have been volunteering there once a week for a year now, and will continue for as long as they will have me!

Kalamazoo Gay-Lesbian Resource Center	115458		/users/profile/157232	Carol-in-Kzoo	Board Member	5	06/15/2012	When I first came to Kalamazoo in 1993 for my job interview, I remember sitting in the room I had at a local bed & breakfast looking through the phone book to see if there were any LGBT organizations listed.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the KGLRC listed; knowing that they were in town made it easier to stomach the cat calls when I walked down the street downtown holding my girlfriend's hand.  Now, 19 years later, it's kind of amazing to me to realize how far I--and the Resource Center--have come.  I've been getting newsletters for years, have given what I could since I moved to Kalamazoo, and really got to know the Resource Center with the Proposal A anti-domestic partnership ballot initiative in the early 2000's.  Then I realized just how much a center the Resource Center has been for Kalamazoo.  We've been through lean years since we were first established in 1988 and are, thankfully, entering a "not-so-lean" phase--thanks to a lot of hard work from a lot of people.  My sincere thanks to Zach, Tracy, and David and all of our extraordinary volunteers for such a great year this year.... record-breaking turnout at Pride last weekend, a great youth mentorship program, and just great work from day to day.  And--in the interests of full disclosure--I've been on the Board for two years.  
Oakland Steiner School	58479		/users/profile/62283	dansaintamour	Volunteer	5	12/05/2010	My son is a student at OSS.  We chose OSS for our childs education and discovered it to be a community built on development of the human spirit. The philosophy of Rudolf Steiner caries over to all aspects of the school from administration to playground rules. It is exciting to see our our child grow up in surrounded raw objectivity in the pursuit of truth and excellence. Our family as most others has attempted to participate in every opportunity to make tangible improvements. My wife is active in the handwork group which produces distinctive toys for use in the classroom and sale across the globe to help fund the construction of a natural playground. I have found our contributions to be personally rewarding and genuinely appreciated. We have recieved ample recognition for our relatively small contributions.  I would encourage anyone interested in the school to see it for themselves and learn more about Waldorf education at http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/ or see the school at www.oaklandsteiner.org/.

Children With Hair Loss Inc	87451	6	/users/profile/98126	helpinghand	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2011	     My sister Regina Villemure, is the founder of Children With Hairloss.  She has always wanted to help anyone in need.  Years before Children With Hairloss was founded, she had a dream that she could use her skills as a hairdresser and shop owner to help children.  That dream has come true!     When my daughter was three years old, she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphbloastic Leukemia.  She wasn't given much hope to survive and was on chemo for five years.  During that time, she lost all of her hair.  Wigs or hairpieces were out of the question because they didn't fit and were not designed for kids.  At that time, Regina wanted to do something to give my daughter back her hair.  My daughter is a cancer survivor and Regina founded Children Wtih Hairloss--two great success stories!     Years later, Regina founded Children Wtih Hailoss .  She works very hard giving up her own time and money to help the children who are in need.   Whenever a child comes to her, she always finds a way to help them.  Unlike the other charities, there is not a charge to the parents.  I am very proud of my sister and all of her accomplishments.  Her work with Children With Hairloss is directly from her heart!

Smyrna Social Club	275245		/users/profile/364842	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/31/2015	     The Smyrna Social Club was started in Smyrna, Michigan in 1903 by the Knights of the Maccabee's.  The group held regular social events and soon determined that they needed a permanent place for these meetings.  The current Maccabee Hall was constructed in 1905.  The group held regular meetings, such as quilting bee's.  On year the quilting bee fell on St. Patrick's Day.  Rather than quilt, they threw a party.  And have been doing so the Saturday before St. Patrick's ever since.  This event is open to the public!  A roast beef dinner is served from noon until two, with all the fixin's, and later in the day roast beef sandwich's and food is still available.  The annual euchre tournament takes place and a cash bar is available.       The monies earned at this event, along with the monies from the Summer Celebration and the Fall Festival, all go toward the maintenance and upkeep of the historic hall.  The Maccabee Hall is listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Building.     Donations can be made to the Smyrna Social Club, which is 501-c-3 non-profit.

It is amazing to see day in and day out what the students are capable of accomplishing. What is even more exhilarating is knowing that they are capable of doing twice as much if given the support and resources. There is a fund at LSSU that supports student centered projects by allowing them to apply for grants; this is the fund to which I donate. These grants allow students to travel to present their work and receive accolades, complete research projects, utilize classroom lessons in the real world, and so much more. The depth and breadth of projects/causes students are passionate about is astounding. Their passion translates into action and then success. I am inspired to give because this is a pivotal time in their lives - college is a time when students figure out what they love, what they are good at doing, and that they can do more. The day you realize your potential, when you realize you are worth more than you thought, is life-changing. This is why I give.

Packard Health Inc	162548		/users/profile/215763	Kara13	Client Served	5	07/13/2013	I have been at the bottom of Packard's sliding scale for regular treatment for depression (my prescriptions), annual gyn exams, and miscellaneous medical needs that one takes to the GP.  Unless tests were ordered I paid 20 bucks per visit.  My GP, Dr. Holly Ross, sets a higher standard for the quality of care she provides than any doctor I have ever met.   She makes sure to ask lots of questions, really listen to what you have to say, answers your questions respectfully and fully, and reaches out to specialists/increases her knowledge base when there might be a better way to tackle a problem I'm facing.  If you get in touch with *her* she will get back to you immediately through some sort of magical power.  If you bring knowledge, questions, and a desire to work with her to get well she doesn't take that for granted.  She seems to appreciate the patient's cooperation in the treatment.  Great bedside manner.  Knowledgeable about wide variety of medical problems I faced -- not afraid to admit it when she did need more specialized info.  Always happy to help me off the clock in some very unusual circumstances.  They have given me a real service here.  A good doctor is hard to find. Also, the staff is always friendly and relatable.  It's a pleasure to see them in the office.  Sorry if I'm redundant at all.  Thanks for reading.

Santa Claus Girls Of Kent County	286713		/users/profile/376783	Roberta_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The Santa Claus girls made our Christmas.  When I was a young child of 5, my daddy went in the hospital.  He was there for many years and never returned home.  My mother was pregnant with her ninth child.  She sold the farm and moved into town, thinking life would be easier.  It was still difficult.  I remember the first Christmas the Santa Claus girls came to our home.  We had a scraggly little tree in the living room and I believe it was the day before Christmas Eve.  It was dark outside and a truck pulled into our driveway and unloaded several large boxes.  Everything was wrapped and there were three gifts for each of us nine children.  27 beautiful gifts under our sad little tree.  For many years thereafter the Santa Claus girls showed up at our house with gifts for all.  It was so exciting for us kids and made my mother so happy.  I try to donate to them every year.

Grand Rapids Symphony Society	286712		/users/profile/376782	Terry_J	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I guess the question at hand is Why do I give back to the Grand Rapids Symphony? The easiest answer is simple: Because its what feels right. When I give back it makes me proud, and with the Grand Rapids Symphony I can instantly see the results, from the work put into the voices of the Youth Chorus, to all the lessons given by musicians in the orchestra, to the countless outreach concerts and events they provide. Having said that, the best gift I get in return is the kids (or even adults!) who come up to me on the street and say, hey, you are that symphony photographer thank you for the pictures! The smiles on their faces say it all, and that Im doing the right thing. Ive seen firsthand how important the gift of music is to youth, adults, and people from all backgrounds. So, why do I give to the Symphony? I give because music matters and needs to continue to live on in todays society.

Edison Neighborhood Association Inc	272780		/users/profile/361904	eyesonkalamazoo	General Member of the Public	1	11/24/2015	Edison Neighborhood Association promoted the city of kalamazoo's expansion of the DDRD/downtown design review district against the overwhelming rejection by the citizens. Apparently, 2 board members of ENA may have received city HUD grants of over $18,000 each,  just prior to their support of the measure, The ddrd negatively impacted existing owners of older commercial buildings. While residential and multifamily properties were exempt from the burdens of the new restrictions, existing owners of commercial buildings were refused a partial exemption or grandfathering which would have allowed the usual maintenance that older commercial buildings require. The Edison Neighborhood Association participated in this Gentrification against lines of people opposed to the measure and acted in bad faith. HUD should investigate the HUD grants given directly to board members of the ENA by the City of Kalamazoo. 
Mount Hope Church of Lansing	133359	1	/users/profile/179070	Timothy Henley	Advisor	5	11/04/2012	As the Community Manager on staff at this organization I've seen countless men and women give to help make Mount Hope Church in Lansing become a meaningful center of progress which inspires Godly initiatives that an entire city can rally aroundno matter the denomination, organization, or background. From the families who have been restored and strengthened through it's weekly services and Gilead Healing Center to it's community outreaches like Bless The City where tons of food was given in one evening to the homeless. Mount Hope is a worthy place to invest your time and resources. Their A Little Boy's Prayer "strategy" is the beginning of something very significant in support of foster and orphaned children. I'm looking forward to the day when Mount Hope can say that their involvement in this issue caused Lansing to no longer be a city with fatherless children.

SEEDING CHANGE	88949	1	/users/profile/100658	Leslie H.	Volunteer	5	05/19/2011	I fell in love with PeaceJam when I first picked up the book, and couldn't wait to start groups at my school.  However, the experiences my students have had through Seeding Change/Great Lakes PeaceJam far outweigh my greatest expectations.  I have seen a student who spoke a dozen words her first year at our school become fast friends with people she had known for two days at the 2010 Conference.  I have seen a student who had no interest in school or civics take charge of the youth campaign to reintroduce the Equal Housing & Employment Act in Ohio's House.  My students have used these opportunities to create school-wide anti-bullying and recycling programs, they've met Nobel Peace Prize winners, and they feel like they can bring about positive change in the world with the love and support of the students, mentors, advisors, and staff they've met through Seeding Change.  Nothing can replace the role GLPJ has had in their lives or mine.

The Ronald Mcdonald House Of Western Michigan Inc	164903	1	/users/profile/219196	Alvin J.	General Member of the Public	5	08/13/2013	I had just come home from work, and shortly after my 3 year old son began to shiver, and shake as he feel to the floor. He was always full of humor, and could act very well at this age. He loved the attention. It did not take long for us to realize he was actually having a seizure. I found a washcloth and stuffed it in his mouth. I could feel his bite even though it was wrapped tightly around my two fingers. We called 911, and he was rushed to the hospital. They discovered he had been given the wrong medication, and did not understand how it got confused with his prescription. It was not long after that when the helicopter arrived and he was airlifted to Grand Rapids from Muskegon. I will always remember that empty feeling as they would not allow me to ride. To this day it is just like it happened yesterday when I think about how separated we were so instantly, and not knowing how his status was. Apparently the local hospital had contacted the Ronald McDonald House in Grand Rapids, and made arrangements for our stay. We were taken to the hospital by cab which the hospital arranged for the Ronald McDonald House stay, and the taxi. We were not allowed to visit my son, me or his mother, and it was not long before the shuttle from the Ronald McDonald House arrived to pick us up. They provided housing and food, and gave us a private room away from the other guests. They also provided a minister to come in and comfort us. We though our son was going to be coming home within 3 days, but the length of stay ended up being a bout 3 weeks. Neither of us wanted to return home for fear of something going wrong because he was having convulsions expectantly. I will always remember the hospitality of the Ronald McDonald staff. They were always courteous and when out of their way in many areas they did not normally do on behalf of the local hospital we arrived there from, and also on behalf of us. This is very difficult to do, but the professional staff made us right at home, and welcomed us to stay until we were sure our son had recovered. I will always keep The Ronald McDonald House held in my memory because of the outstanding hospitality they served us during our stay. Thank you! Ronald McDonald House of Western Michigan. This is not the only thanks I give.

Huron Pines Resource Conservation And Development Council Inc	198558		/users/profile/259300	DanetteB	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2014	If you care about forests, lakes and streams; if you enjoy clean water, fresh air, and bird songs; if the conservation of our natural environment is important to you, then you'll agree with me that Huron Pines in northern Michigan is a Michigan treasure.  Huron Pines is a small organization that does big things, from supporting our Kirtland's Warbler as it comes off the endangered species list to supporting landowners and Americorps volunteers.  They work to restore our rivers and to remove invasive plant species.  Michigan, especially northern Michigan, and the Kirtland's Warbler, attract visitors and tourist dollars from all over the world.  Huron Pines helps to ensure that our state will continue to be one of America's crown jewels for many years to come.  I personally enjoy spending weekends up north, hiking the many trails and enjoying the rivers and lakes.  I've been known to pull off the road to watch coyotes, birds and other wildlife as I drive from one beautiful park to another.  These are things I would miss if conservation organizations like Huron Pines weren't there, doing what they do best.  One of my favorite things about Huron Pines, though, is their willingness to partner with other organizations for the greater good of the environment.  This is the hallmark of an organization that is focused on making a difference.

Sweet Dreamzzz Inc	124635	2	/users/profile/169578	Deb Kuptz	Board Member	5	10/05/2012	I get frustrated, as a volunteer, when I can't connect what I do (give time, expertise, money, etc) to a measurable impact. I understand that this is sometimes rightly the way it is, but my volunteering "profile" is to want to  work in organizations where I can see results.  That's the sweetest thing about working with Sweet Dreamzzz.  Every week during the school year, I see our mission in action.  That mission is to improve the health, well-being and academic performance of at-risk children and their families by providing sleep education and bedtime essentials.  Science has determined that lack of adequate sleep is a key contributor to many of the issues affecting children today: difficulty learning and paying attention; physical, mental and emotional health, obesity and others. The Sweet Dreamzzz volunteer 'sleeper teachers' deliver the message directly to elementary school kids (and often their teachers and parents) in a fun and memorable way. Follow up studies now in progress are showing that kids and families are changing behaviors.  "Sleep fitness," as we call it, is a low-cost, painless and effective antidote that has a life-long impact on the child, their family and the community as a whole.  And best of all, the smiles we see when the kids get their sleeping bag, shirt, book, and hygiene essentials, says it all.  Visit sweetdreamzzz.org to see for yourself.  Like and share our link, and call us if you want us to bring sleep fitness into one of your community schools!  Kids will get more As and Bs by getting more ZZZs!

South End Community Outreach Ministries Secom	61636		/users/profile/67318	volunteer	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	SECOM is a beautiful place. Very rarely does one see a community of like minded people as passionate as they are about doing God's will. One of the directors explained his job to me as "Making Friends". And that's what they do. Despite all of the excellent work they strive for every day, you will not find a more humble set of staff and volunteers.   Nor will you find a group that uses their money more wisely. As a volunteer I saw first hand how very carefully they utilized every resource available to them- there is a strong understanding that the little money they have is to feed the hungry in West Michigan.  I look forward to working with them again soon, and have made this my Nonprofit of choice.
