Fellow Mortals, Inc.	230855	2	/users/profile/88090	Mary Ellen,	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	The staff members at Fellow Mortals are the most dedicated, hard-working, and compassionate people I know.  With them, the animals always come first.  All patients are given the attention and respect they deserve, whether big or small, furred or feathered.  I first went to Fellow Mortals when I found a dead opossum mother with what I thought were two surviving babies.  (There were actually seven more babies still tucked in the mother's pouch.)  Now I am a volunteer, and I can't imagine a better use of my time.  My life is richer in so many ways because of my association with Fellow Mortals.  This organization deserves everyone's support, whether it be gifts of time, talent, money, or all three.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	314229		/users/profile/405592	johnoMuirkirk	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	We visit Fellow Mortals from Scotland every year. They are a fantastic example of dedication to the creatures of our natural world.  No animal is ever turned way even if it means the staff working until late into the night to ensure that it has the best chance of survival and recovery. The staff members go 'above and beyond' and prioritise animal care over all personal considerations.As a charitable organisation they have a fantastic support from dedicated volunteers but can always use more help and donations from generous benefactors.

Be very sure that every animal in their care is given the amazing opportunity to heal and be released back to the wild where they long to be.  xo

At times I will see a bird which has just been hit by a car laying in the middle of the road, panicking; and people just keep driving around it and some would not even take the time to do that.  Fellow mortals is a sanctuary for these souls to come 'bounce back' and at times a safe peaceful place to 'carry on' it's journey.  The staff at fellow mortals work countless hours caring for these animals as if they were their own children. Faces beem on release day when an animal is finally 'set free' to return to it's natural environment, and the commitment and effort has finally paid off.  And on the day that an animal is so badly injured that there is nothing that can be done, tears are shed.  I know; I have heard these stories. I am from Canada and my daughter has been a rehabilitator at the hospital for almost 5 years now. When I visit Jess I will go to the hospital and help in any way I can.  I miss my daughter very much but I believe in what she does and I am very proud of what she does. I beleive this organization has used it's expertise to better educate the community in interactions with wildlife.  More people should read the stories on their website.  I believe it would open many eyes and hearts as to what the excerpt on Fellow Mortals' home page means 'A Living Philosophy based on the belief that encouraging compassion in humans toward all life brings out the finest aspects of humanity.God Bless each and every one of them!!!

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	295006	1	/users/profile/385803	Writer	Donor	5	07/08/2016	Fellow Mortals is such  wonderful place staffed by a really remarkable staff.  We have brought  birds to them in  3 different years.  The staff are always so positive and welcoming when we arrive.    They were so gentle and caring as they quickly took each bird in and assessed it's injuries and made it comfortable.  One of our trips was to bring in a baby squirrel, found hiding from a kitten under our car.  The girl who admitted the squirrel let us know it was a little girl and acted so happy to see her.   Fellow Mortals kept her for the winter and released her in the spring.  This is a really amazing place with loving people who are incredibly dedicated to all animals.  My favorite charity. I know that donations will be used to help an animal that will be helped by loving caregivers.

The fawn was circling in water about a foot deep, on Koshkonong Lake.  I called the DNR, who would not help, except to transfer me to the fine people at this non-profit.  These folks called me back very quickly and were not only willing to help, they encouraged me as I attempted to capture this blind baby deer.  I was able to capture him and bring him to these lovely people.  Today is July 4th.  The fact alone that these fine people are there to take me call is impressive - and they stepped well above that, by waiting while I drove an hour to get there with the little baby.  They deserve every bit of support that they can be given.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	293473	1	/users/profile/384072	Lisa555	Client Served	5	06/21/2016	My daughter found a baby bird, like a four day old bird, in a gutter. She looked for a nest and there was none to be found. She took the bird home and cared for it all night, and it survived!! We made a couple of phone calls with absolutely no luck of finding a facility to help our bird. What do you do, when your child has put her heart into caring for an animal and no one will help you? You TRY harder! We were directed to Fellow Mortals. I left a message describing our situation and as much detail about our bird as I could. Our call was returned promptly and the woman on the phone was so extremely kind and helpful, she even texted me with their address because I didn't have paper or a writing utensil! We drove from McFarland, a little over an hour, to deliver our bird. I taught her how to love all animals, so how could I not give this little life a fighting chance?! I thank God for them, I don't know what I would have done! They were so sweet, compassionate, and grateful. We received a "patient sheet" with our birds info and picture so we could check in. I am forever grateful to them for showing my daughter there are good people in the world who care and are willing to help. Thank you so much for what you do! You all are very special and we are so happy that our bird found a temporary home. Please donate to this wonderful safe haven for wildlife, they are a blessing to us all!! Keep doing great work! You are making a difference!

After scooping it up, I kept it warm until I was able to make an appointment with Fellow Mortals to bring it in. I cannot tell you how very thankful and relieved I am to be able to have someplace to take these poor creatures. The caring. compassionate staff are knowledgeable and kind. I will sleep peacefully knowing that the sparrow is in good care.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	269412	1	/users/profile/288298	Pixiecat55	Donor	5	10/29/2015	Fellow Mortals, a wildlife rehabilitation center in Wisconsin, is an exemplary rehabilitation center that cares for injured and orphaned wildlife in the hopes of returning these animals to their natural habitats. The staff of Fellow Mortals demonstrate remarkable knowledge and care in providing animals a chance to heal and thrive. Each animal patient is evaluated, treated, and provided nutrition and a safe place to heal. If an animal is unable to self feed, then they are hand fed by gentle and caring staff.  I have had the opportunity to sponsor one of the many animals that are unable to return to their natural habitat because they are too disabled to fend for themselves.  Parker Bunny was able to enjoy  a winter of good nutrition, medicine and a safe place to stay.  I received a picture and an update when I contacted Fellow Mortals asking how Parker was doing.  The ultimate goal of Fellow Mortals is to nurse injured animals or take care of orphaned baby animals until these creatures are able to be on their own.  I highly recommend offering your support to this amazing and needed wildlife rehabilitation center.  
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	224536		/users/profile/288298	Pixiecat55	Donor	5	10/20/2014	I can't say enough about Fellow Mortals!From their top notch staff and interns, to the loving care they give to their animal patients, Fellow Mortals goes above and beyond any wildlife rehabilitation hospital.  I have had the privilege of seeing them in action and they provide excellent care to injured and orphaned animals.  I have been able to sponsor one of the many animals that cannot be returned to the wild because of their injuries named Parker Bunny.  Fellow Mortals also provides wildlife education using some of their special animals in the hopes that more people are aware of their valuable service.  My recommendation to all is to support this vital lifeline for our injured and orphaned animals.

They have served us with professionalism and dedication.  The staff offer practical advice, are patient and show no judgement when I call to ask questions or get advice.  On one occasion we had a live squirrel stuck in part of our furnace venting system which we were able to rescue safely in the middle of a very cold February night. This was accomplished through multiple phone conversations and our trust in their knowledge and skill.  We have brought numerous injured birds which they take without complaint during the busiest season.  I love the fact that they send us post cards to let us know the outcome of a rescue attempt.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	253129		/users/profile/341291	Lisa718	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2015	Fellow Mortals is amazing! My son found 2 newborn squirrels. We knew we didn't have the knowledge/skills to properly care for them so we started to look for someone licensed who can. It was an unbelievably exhausting task. We had these babies for 3 days now and had no choice but to feed them formula...hoping that we aren't causing more harm than good. But I knew they couldn't go long with food/water. After 25+ phone calls, most of them never returned messages or said they no longer care for animals, I was given the number to Fellow Mortals by a coworker. They were amazing. Renee took the time to talk to me and helped arrange for me to drop off the babies. I drove 45 mins one way to drop these little guys off. I have to admit, I did get somewhat attached to them but knew this was the best  choice. Once I arrived to the clinic, I was greeted by Renee. She took the babies to Yvonne and they were examined. As expected, they were dehydrated. Yvonne came out and thanked me for bringing the babies in and explained what their plan was. I immediately felt relieved and knew these babies were in great hands. Yvonne truly loves what she does and should be commended for the work she and her staff do. Its outstanding! I am so glad I found them! They truly make a difference!

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	80717		/users/profile/88090	Mary Ellen	Client Served	5	03/01/2011	I learned about Fellow Mortals two years ago when someone brought an injured killdeer to the public library where I worked.  Since then, I have delivered several other animals in need of care to them.  It is wonderful having this organization in our area where I know every animal can get the individual care and attention it needs to be returned to health.  The seven baby opossoms, two rose-breasted grosbeaks, and Swainson's thrush I brought to them would all agree.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	224256		/users/profile/288000	goody	Volunteer	5	10/19/2014	I first came to fellow mortals with my grand daughters and a little baby sparrow.  learned more about them at an open house and became a part time volunteer after that. Thanks to the interaction I've had with them it has been my pleasure to be with them at a beaver release and an eagle release. Through them I have also been introduced to the world of animal rehabilitation. As a result of the people and animals I met I had a fascinating trip through Canada with a fellow volunteer and met Audrey Tournay (now my favorite author) and a myriad of other people and animals. The work they do is priceless. I wish I could do more..
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	222037		/users/profile/285729	loudoun73	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	Why is Fellow Mortals such a trusted and highly regarded organisation in among its many stakeholders? Whether it is the donors who trust FM to spend their money wisely or the members of public who bring injured or orphaned wildlife to them for care and rehabilitation, or the Wisconsin and Illinois community who see them as setting the standard for animal care or the government agencies who look to them for advice and experience..I could go on!! The answer is that the management, staff and volunteers of FM are dedicated to providing the highest quality care to any animal that needs rescued and will work tirelessly to achieve a positive outcome. 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	221847	1	/users/profile/285539	sani928	Client Served	5	10/10/2014	Fellow Mortals has been a true Godsend to me!!  My story is a little involved & long, but worth it - so please read on:  My husband & I have been involved in the conservation of Wood Ducks and Hooded Mergansers by providing & maintaining 2 nesting boxes for these particular ducks for many years now.  We have installed small video cameras with night vision capabilities in these boxes, which have allowed us to monitor their nesting process 24 hours a day during the spring breeding season.  Sometimes there is only 1 female with 8 eggs, and at other times, more than 1 female is laying in the same box, which can produce over 30 eggs in 1 box.  Every year around the end of March, a female (or 2 or 3) starts laying an egg a day in a box, covers it up with the Aspen bedding we provide for them, then leaves until the next day to lay another (both of our duck nesting boxes are occupied every spring, and sometimes, twice in a season - one right after another).  When she's done laying, she starts incubating them 24 hours a day (with an hour break both in the early morning, then again right before it gets dark) for approximately 30-33 days.  Hatching takes place within a 12 hour span, and by the next morning, the ducklings make the BIG JUMP.  Mama drops down onto the ground under her nesting box and softly calls to her ducklings.  Within about 2 minutes total, all the fully feathered ducklings jump out of the box bouncing one at a time onto the ground by their Mama approx. 9 feet below them.  When all have safely left the box, they all waddle off in a feathery group down to our hidden creek and into the wild somewhere & are gone & never come back.  We are able to watch this AMAZING process from both the inside of the box with our cameras and through a window from our home.  This is the happy end of my story when ALL the ducklings (from 8 to possibly 30+) make it out successfully and waddle off with Mama.  Amazingly, the same female duck or her offspring will come back to the same nesting box year after year to lay, which is an incredible feat in itself.  Unfortunately though, when there are an excess amount of babies in a box or they hatched an hour or two later than the others, there have been ducklings too weak to make the big jump or their mother wasn't patient enough to wait for them all.  In these cases, an orphan or 2 have been left behind in the box.  Sometimes, there are eggs still hatching or don't hatch until a day or two from the others.  These instances have been heartbreaking to me, as I have had no where to take a newly hatched or even an unhatched duckling egg for a chance at life.  I've had perfectly formed, peeping ducklings pass away in my hands within a couple hours while waiting for a call back from a phone number someone gave me that could possibly help & take the baby - (calls that were never returned or were too late).  Sadly, Wood Duck and Hooded Merganser ducklings don't survive after a few hours of being separated from their mother - they are so fragile.  After this happened a couple times over a 3 year span, I seriously thought about taking the boxes down so that this wouldn't happen again, even though 95% of the ducklings successfully fledged and we were contributing great numbers towards the conservation of these ducks - I couldn't handle it anymore :-(.  Then a MIRACLE!!  One day I came upon a pamphlet from a place called Fellow Mortals and read it from front to back and realized that this wildlife/rehabilitation facility was only 40 minutes away from me.  The next day I called them & told them my predicament that I have been encountering every spring & they told me they could help me whenever I needed a place to bring an orphan or even an unhatched egg.  They said they had foster Wood Ducks that will raise my ducklings as their own and that they would be released into the wild when it was time.  They also have an incubator for any unhatched eggs that I might have.  I was SO RELIEVED!!!  I now could continue with my nest boxes so that many more ducks could have a safe place to nest in an effort to conserve these beautiful creatures, and that Fellow Mortals would be there any day or time I needed them.  Every year now, I call and give them a heads up when my eggs are hatching so that they know that I may possibly need to bring a duckling or two or an unhatched egg (or 2) the next morning.  They are always prepared & ready for me since they too know that it's crucial to get the orphaned duckling to their foster parent as soon as possible or it will perish.  Believe it or not, since then, I haven't had any orphaned ducklings, but I have had unhatched eggs.  With Fellow Mortals help, at least 2 ducklings over the last couple years have hatched with the help of their incubator and been fostered and were released by them.  There isn't a better feeling than knowing that there are people like me out there who considers even an unhatched duck egg a treasured creation and worth given a chance at life!!!!  I have brought Fellow Mortals several song birds who were either injured or orphaned over the past few years (with 8 cameras in 8 different nesting boxes from ducks, owls & bluebirds, I can't help but have some bird in need!), but have yet had to bring them an orphaned duckling (phew!)  I always know that they are there for me and all the creatures that need compassion & help, and I appreciate each & every one of their rehabbers, vets & volunteers.  I pray constantly for them - that they can continue the work that God has called them to accomplish.  Every month, I consider it an honor & joyfully contribute to their cause and hope that my meager offering will help them.  I truly can't put into words how grateful I am that if one of God's creatures need help, Fellow Mortals are only 40 minutes away!!  Thank you SO MUCH from the bottom of my heart for your compassion towards our fellow mortals - both furry & feathery!  Love, Sandy     
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	221015		/users/profile/284712	Aimee2012	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	Fellow Mortals is an incredible place.  Everyone that works there is so passionate and truly love what they do.  I am so fortunate to be apart of all the wonderful things that happen there. I have never worked with more extraordinary, hardworking, and dedicated people.  The staff strives to make every animal life count, even if there is a slim chance of recovery they do not give up!  Know that when you bring an animal to us they are given the best of care and when you support Fellow Mortals though donations you are helping to give a wild one a second chance.  Fellow Mortals is truly a great nonprofit!

My wife Dian had painted a 36x48 swan wild life for auction at the event. Dian has continued to donate her work for auction at the annual dinners. Having no artistic talent myself I usually write checks. We have been at the Fellow Mortal's farm many times over the years and have been impressed with the dedication of the professionals and volunteers. Being in sales I've learned  you must ask for the order, Yvonne would be excellent salesperson as she looks you in the eye and asks for what the animals need whether it is a washing machine or funds to support a beaver. You just can't say no to her. We are delighted to one of her many donors.  Jack Simpson, Wind Point WI

Yvonne Wallace Blane and her husband Steve, have worked in service to all forms of injured wildlife since founding Fellow Mortals in 1985.  One only has to read some of the stories penned by Yvonne to realize the depth of commitment she assigns to each animal brought to the wildlife hospital.  Her story, An Insignificant Life (http://fellowmortals.org/insignificant/ ) brings tears and an awareness of why Fellow Mortals has such a unique mission in wildlife rehabilitation.  Core values stated at the website reflect the values of both Yvonne and Steve: Value and care for the individual life comes before all else All species admitted for care are treated equally Fellow Mortals will not euthanize a healthy animal Fellow Mortals strives for the highest standards and professionalism in animal care and all other areas Fellow Mortals does not accept support that could cause us to compromise our values

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	214791		/users/profile/278091	slcarroll	Client Served	5	09/11/2014	Ever since I first became aware of and involved with Fellow Mortals in 2003, I have seen firsthand what competence and sincere compassion can achieve hand in hand. An enterprise such as FM (and there are others, but far too few and too far between) makes the difference between encountering a wild animal in dire need and *wishing* there was something you could do... and being able to actually do something - with their help. I have had the privilege of partaking in the eventual release of wild birds I had brought to Fellow Mortals for care and treatment, and those were some heartbreakingly joyous moments in my llfe, let me tell you. If you believe that wild animals of all kinds truly are our fellow mortals, individuals as worthy of empathy as you and I, please support those who take that philosophy into living action and make our world a better place in so doing. My world is certainly a better place thanks to FM. Yvonne and Steve and their staff are real people. Real good people. Angels upon the earth, as far as I'm concerned. Let's help FM help us to help those alien familiars we marvel at every day, the ones without civilization and technology. Let's lend them ours in their hour of need, in exchange for what they do for our lives every day. It starts with compassion, but it takes skill and dedication to make a difference. Fellow Mortals has all three and bridges the gap. Sean Carroll

We found Fellow Mortals nearly 8 years ago, after we saw ducklings lose their mother on a busy highway and had no one to turn to.  These tiny peeping balls of fluff started a relationship that has continued strong for us ever since for a large variety of animals.  Fellow Mortals is a wildlife resource, a leader in healing and care as well as education.  They focus on helping the animals first and foremost.  Many times it means taking the reins of the critical care required, and sometimes it means education and advice for humans on how best to care for the animal in its wild habitat.  It is so evident that their hearts and souls are in their work.  Injured and orphaned wildlife seem to find us, and while we can't care for them personally, we are forever grateful for the care and love they receive at Fellow Mortals.  The hospital is humble, resources are always tight, and yet each animal gets what it needs for the best chance it can possibly have.   I can't describe the feeling that comes with helping something that cannot help itself, and knowing that when the transfer over the counter is made in a little shoebox, or a clothes basket, or a cardboard box, or a blanket, or a pet carrier, the little creature inside that you're helping couldn't have a better chance at getting better.  My husband and I will continue to support Fellow Mortals, in our faith in their care of the animals we find, and financially as a way to help in a world that too often loses sight of Nature's innocence and beauty.  If you are looking for a charity to support, believe me when I say that you can donate confidently, knowing that your dollars are being spent in benefit of those who need truly need it.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	230855	2	/users/profile/88090	Mary Ellen,	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	The staff members at Fellow Mortals are the most dedicated, hard-working, and compassionate people I know.  With them, the animals always come first.  All patients are given the attention and respect they deserve, whether big or small, furred or feathered.  I first went to Fellow Mortals when I found a dead opossum mother with what I thought were two surviving babies.  (There were actually seven more babies still tucked in the mother's pouch.)  Now I am a volunteer, and I can't imagine a better use of my time.  My life is richer in so many ways because of my association with Fellow Mortals.  This organization deserves everyone's support, whether it be gifts of time, talent, money, or all three.

I am grateful  that I've been able to volunteer when my schedule allows. Every little creature is treated equally from the tinniest mouse to the grand Bald Eagle. Thanks guys! 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	67411		/users/profile/73681	Lynn	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	I have had the privilege of volunteering at Fellow Mortals in the past for about 8 years. It was a life changing experience.  The staffs commentment to the animals they care for are amazing.  Working long days everyday of the year they do not stop until every animal has what it needs and more.  They are my inspiration.

The compassionate and knowledgeable Wildlife Rehabilitators and interns, work long hours to help insure that each animal that is brought to them has a chance to heal and then be released.  The hundreds of animals that are helped each year by this organization are impressive; especially when you consider the time and cost that is required. Fellow Mortals works hard to educate the public on many wildlife issues.  What a person can and should do when they come into contact with an injured wild animal, from the initial phone contact to literature that is given to each person that brings an animal to the shelter, is enlightening.  Fellow Mortals is also using Facebook as a tool that is fun and informative.   Fellow Mortals is a wonderful organization doing an amazing job.  
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	164268		/users/profile/36284	410-crabtree-lane	Donor	5	08/06/2013	I have been friends of Fellow Mortals over the past 15 years or so.  I have been blessed with the privilege to watch them continue to serve the birds and animals who have a special place to go to heal.  These injured and orphaned wildlife critters receive top notch professional medical attention increasing their chance to return to the wild.  Giving the wilds ones admitted for care a second chance at life is the #1 priority of the staff and they do everything they can to give the beings the experience of their freedom once more.    Thank You Fellow Mortals for being there for the wild ones who would otherwise not have a place to go.  Thank you also for providing such beautiful stories as your writing brings a voice to those who do not have one.  Your gift of speaking for the wild ones is truly a treasure.  Anyone who is reading this please look up some of the past newsletters where Yvonne and other staff have shared their hearts and touch ours through their words.   
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	35454	6	/users/profile/36284	410-crabtree-lane	Volunteer	5	04/11/2010	Fellow Mortals is a very special place.. When a wild animal or bird is injured there is a somewhere they can go to receive the care they deserve as beings who do not have a voice for themselves.  The staff at Fellow Mortals treat each wild creature admitted with such deep compassion and the deep respect they deserve.  I am always moved in my heart to witness their dedication and devotion to the wild life we all share our lives with. There are so many touching stories that can be told about the many, many encounter's with the spirit of the wild animals and bird's who make their way to the facility for care and rehabilitation.  Yvonne is a master weaver of words and her writing is truly a gift to the world. Yvonne has been consistently publishing newsletter's to update and inform the public of the accomplishments, and state of Fellow Mortals as well as generously sharing her experiences, feelings and perspective's through her stories. I am always encouraged to look deeper within myself as I read her words of wisdom and how she shares from her heart.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	164266		/users/profile/218298	Ckstackhouse	Volunteer	5	08/06/2013	Fellow Mortals was the first wildlife rehabilitation center I ever worked with. Outside of zoos I didn't realize there were professionals who dedicated their lives to keeping wild or exotic animals healthy. Fellow Mortals opened up my eyes to the many ways everyday people can help wildlife to thrive. I was an intern at Fellow Mortals right out of undergrad. The volunteer intern experience was hands-on, with lots of animal handling and husbandry duties, caring for baby rabbits, birds, geese, ducks and whatever else came through the doors. The other interns were all dedicated and hard-working, and Yvonne, the founder and director of FM, gives clear directions, makes sure you're comfortable with your duties, and puts in just as many (if not more) hours and effort as her team.  Working at FM has cultivated a lifelong interest in wildlife for me. 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	164252		/users/profile/218266	birdnerd	Volunteer	5	08/05/2013	Fellow Mortals cares for sick, orphaned, and injured wildlife that is typically in need of care by a human as a result of human actions, and although no one wishes for such instances to happen, when they do, as they inevitably will, there is no place like Fellow Mortals. You can put your utmost trust in that the animal they take in to treat will be given the highest level of care, respect, attention, and dedication to the animal's full recovery. They will give every living creature a chance to make a return to the wild. This is not a day job for the staff, this is their livelihood and passion. I worked for almost a year with the wonderful staff of Fellow Mortals, and not only did I learn how to care for the animals at the facility, the staff were inspiring, they make sure every person that works with them, or drops off an animal, understands the need to care for every living creature that we share our backyards with. Cheers, FM, and keep up the amazing work!
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	162311		/users/profile/215389	Darcy Minkler	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	I can't remember the date of the first time I took an animal to Fellow Mortals, but I will never forget being so grateful to find out that such a place existed. It is a place where all life is treated equally important, regardless of species. It truly is a beautiful place in a world where life is so carelessly disregarded and blind eyes are turned to suffering. It is a place full of hope, caring and compassion. I have learned so much from Yvonne, founder and licensed wildife rehablitator, who in a busy day, during a busy season, when injured and orphaned animals don't seem to stop coming all day long, will stop to answer a question I have because she knows I care too and am eager to learn as much as I can from her in what little time I have to give. I have seen Jess, a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, trying to piece back together a broken bunny hit by a car, with so much gentleness that to this day when I think about it, it brings tears to my eyes. And just for perspective,, I had been there 11 hours already that day and Jess had been there hours before me and would be there hours after I left. Yet her kindness and compassion and patience never wavered. I have seen Karen, a licensed wildlife rehablitator, give her very breath to bring warmth to a cold baby bird, literally breathing life into him. I have been privileged to see that same baby bird grow and fly free. I have seen all of them at Fellow Mortals ( interns included ) on their "day off" stop in as they were running errands for Fellow Mortals while out taking care of their own. I have seen animals come in so injured that I thought their lives were surely over. I have seen Yvonne, Jess and Karen give them everything they have; time, knowledge, care and compassion to try to give them a second chance. And I have been blessed to be there to see many of them set free, returned to the wild where they belong, made whole again because of the fact that Fellow Mortals exists and because of these people who dedicate their lives to them. I know that every animal that comes in to Fellow Mortals does not make it. But I also know that those who don't are not suffering long, slow painful deaths. They were brought in by someone who saw their suffering and cared. And they are being gently released from their pain by kind hands with as much dignity and respect as possible. I am so grateful to have found Fellow Mortals. They breath life, love and hope not just into the animals in their care but into the world at large. Please help if you can because everyone at Fellow Mortals donates much of their time and every penny counts and is truly needed and appreciated.

Then I didhit one and did not kill it. When I picked it up and it wiggled in my hands in pain, I thenrealized I was supposed to protect it not shoot it.  I still tear up thinking about it. So whena rabbit got hurt we had to take it somewhere to fix it up. That was Fellow Mortals.And wow what a job they do protecting the wild animals that not enough of us care about, but more seem to be changing their thinking. Fellow Mortals and what they do to fix and release up to 70 percent of wild animals, with passion for each, should be cloned in every county in the entire US and probably the world.

The luck of injured animals and birds changes instantly when the person finding them thinks to take them to Fellow Mortals.  Not only is the medical attention the best (by staff or veterinarians when needed)  but attention to their comfort now and to thoughts of their possible future is all part of what happens here.  No one animal or bird is more important than any other  and compromise is not an option.  Five Stars is a no-brainer for Fellow Mortals!

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	153240		/users/profile/36270	marisa3	Client Served	5	04/07/2013	Fellow Mortals is an absolutely remarkable place.  They are one of only a handful of fully licensed wildlife hospitals in the United States.  They have a professional staff and facilities, habitats created for specific species as they recover and veterinarians who perform surgery when necessary.  Most people are familiar with rehabbers that often take in only one species and operate out of their home or garage.  Fellow Mortals is truly a hospital environment and caters to multiple species with facilities designed to triage, treat and rehab.  Their release rate speaks to the outstanding care....over 80% of injured or orphaned wildlife is released back into the wild. Fellow Mortals relies soley on donations from the public, there is no government funding or grants.  Please help this incredibly worthy organization.  They give wildlife a second chance at life and their success rate is incredible.

Over the years, I have taken in several injured wild animals, and they have served each and every one with compassion.

The operation is well run and orderly in the in-take process. Like everywhere, they could use more funding, but what they do get is given to a priority-list everyone can find before giving.

We checked into Fellow Mortals and found that they were everything they said and more helping injured and displaced animals survive, releasing them when they could, providing a permanent home when they couldn't.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	125805		/users/profile/170988	Akitaannie	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Fellow Mortals is a non profit organization that takes care of wild birds and mammals.  They operate only on contributions.  This group is full of caring people whose first interest is the patient.  This is not a "zoo" type that says, "Come see the animals".  In fact, only in a very superized enviroment may the patients be seen.  In addition to taking care of these animals their mission is to treat and rehabilitate them and release them to a safe wild environment.  Fellow Mortals is also educating the public about the care of an injured animal with their educational programs.  Please donate as they are deserving of funding in any amount.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	112252		/users/profile/152725	blackcrow77	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	I live in an apartment and about a month ago birds started nesting in the bathroom exhaust vent.  I promptly requested maintenance to remove the nest and install a bird proof cover, before the birds started laying eggs.  Unfortunately it took a month for them to get the work done, and by that time the birds eggs had hatched.  I missed the maintenance guy but a few minutes.  When I returned home I found three young starlings and the remains of their nest on the ground, a drop of about ten feet, fortunately to grass below.  The chicks eyes were not even open and they barely had any feathers.  I was horrified anyone could be so heartless as to just pluck them out of the vent and throw them to the ground.  Since I requested the work, I felt responsible, eventhough I requested it well in advance which would have prevented this disaster.  I contacted Fellow Mortals and they had me bring the chicks in.  They described them as in critical condition and said they had just recently hatched.  The woman I spoke with at Fellow Mortals was very friendly and returned my calls promptly.  I was glad they were willing to take the birds in, eventhough they were just three baby Starlings.  They could have easily turned them away as I'm sure there are thousands of Starlings born every year, but they didn't.  They were willing to make the effort to attempt to save these three young fragile lives.  I really appreciated that.  I would highly recommend Fellow Mortals to anyone who finds an orphaned or injured animal.  Call them right away and they will tell you what to do.  And PLEASE, do make a donation of cash or other items they might need.  They are a wonderful organization and doing the world a great service!

We could see it in the manhole. Public works came out and removed it but that was it, it needed help. So I called fellow mortals and I was able to bring it out.  The goose was ok and released.  When I brought it there I was told they take in 3000 animals a year with an 80% release rate. This was several years ago so it could have changed.  Today I had to bring 2 baby squirrels in who the mother had abandoned.  It sure is nice having somewhere to bring wild animals who are hurt or abandoned and hopefully released when they are ok.

Unfortunately, it is located on a busy road and pheasants are sometimes hit by vehicles. I have stopped on occasion to pick up the dead birds and bury them near my home.  One day I stopped to pick up a beautiful adult male pheasant that looked like it had just been killed. I picked it up and placed it on a towel that I had in the trunk of my car. Imagine my shock when he opened his eyes and looked up at me. I am certain that he was as surprised as I was. I took him home and called Fellow Mortals. They asked me some questions about his injuries and told me to bring him in. I knew he had a wing injury, because I could see it. I loaded him into a cardboard box and transported him to Fellow Mortals. I later learned from Fellow Mortals that he had several fractures and had to be humanely euthanized. Although I wish he could have been saved, I am grateful that Fellow Mortals was able to examine him, determine that he was terminal, and that he needed to be euthanized to end his suffering.

She had found the bird on our back patio.  The baby was so tiny she thought it had been a leaf at first.  It couldn't have been more than a couple days old.  I didn't know what to do at first, but I called Fellow Mortals right away.  They did not answer the phone but I left a message explaining what had happened.  In the mean time I kept the baby safe in my hand. I could tell it had a little blood on its wing.  Anyway, Fellow Mortals called us right back and told us to bring the baby bird in right away.  We did that, after wrapping it in some tissue and placing it in a small box.  We were so relieved that they were willing to help.  A couple weeks later we got a letter back from Fellow Mortals telling us the baby had survived and that it was a Common House Sparrow.  It was great news.  We will always call Fellow Mortals in the future if we find another animal in need.  Thanks.  Also, after dropping the baby off my daughter picked out a little puppet from the gift shop and my older daughter bought a necklace made out of a bottle cap.  She wears it every day.  What a wonderful experience.

We walked a little closer and seen it was some sort of bird of prey with a injured wing. We got a box and a towel and as carefully as we could, captured it. Called animal control and they said they don't deal with wildlife and they suggested Fellow Mortals. I called Fellow Mortals and left a message, when they called me back they asked if I could also bring baby ducks that were recovered from a sewer drain. I said yes of course! Boy, was that a fun 45 minute drive! Hit a bump, ducks quack/chirp then the bird would poke its head out of the hole in the box. Arrived at Fellow Mortals and handed over all my new found feathered friends. I received a letter about a month later that the bird, a male American Kestrel Falcon, did not make it. The ducks however, were thriving with a foster mom. Without Fellow Mortals, the Kestrel Falcon didn't even stand a chance and the baby ducks would of been euthanized by animal control. Fellow Mortals is truly a savior to a great many fellow mortals that we share this earth with.

This is proof that Fellow Mortals has been and will always be a wonderful and necessary resource for injured wildlife.  The round the clock care that is provided for the rehabilitation of the wildlife brought through Fellow Mortals' doors must be exhausting, but they continually take in more animals without hesitation and do what is needed to make these broken animals whole again.  I am not surprised by the tremendous growth of this organization as Yvonne and Steve have dedicated so much of their lives to this cause.  I am truly appreciative for everything they do, and the animals are certainly blessed to have them by their sides.  Thank you Fellow Mortals!

I felt the need to volunteer because I thought, that's the least I can do. I have learned so much about orphaned and injured animals, again, thanks to the staff at Fellow Mortals. They are just such awesome people with huge hearts for animals. If you come across any injured animals, call them and they will talk you through on what to do. Thank you Fellow Mortals for all your hard work and dedication!! You are much appreciated!

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	110534		/users/profile/150476	Freewill	Client Served	5	04/23/2012	  Over the last three years, I've been to your place three times.  The first time was delivering 3 baby squirrels from my bosses house as mama was killed by a bird.  The second was a Canadian Goose that I would see quite often in a pond by a grocery store.  When the time came for birds to leave for the winter, this one was left alone.  From the help of a large dog kennel and me having a pick-up, we took the trip. This year to my surprise as I opened my front blinds, there was a visitor.  This bird had never been here before, so I went through my bird book to find out what was the "norm" and the breed.  As I scrambled to find the answer, he/she went next door without me seeing how he/she got there.  Turned out it was a Grebe.  Upon further and respectful observation, I didn't know if it had a broken wing or something else wrong that I couldn't see.  There are predators during the day and night, I didn't want to take a chance that he/she wouldn't be able to defend itself.  After putting it in a box, off we went to make the trip to Fellow Mortals once more.  Through all three of these instances I had called ahead.  All critters were kept warm and protected.  I even sang to the squirrels and the Grebe, in order to hopefully keep them calm.  Each instance I had no hestitation or long delay from the Angels at Fellow Mortals.  This trip is about an hour away from me but each long drive was worth knowing that whatever I brought, would be better off than the circumstances that they came from.  Being a huge animal advocate, both wild and domestic, doing these deliveries was just another day of rescue for me.  If there's a critter in trouble, they seem to find me.   I am truly honored and ready to jump right in to help!!  If there were more caring and giving people like myself, a few of my friends and Fellow Mortals, the world would be a much better place for all animals and humans.  When my mom or friends find a critter in need, they call me.  Keep doing what you're doing and I'll do the same.  We are unsung heros but where would nature be without us?  Take care.

There is no other rehab center that does as much for so many injured and orphaned wildlife as they do anywhere in the S.E. wisconsin N.E. Illinois area.  I have volunteered, donated and been served many times.  The amount of care and the hours required to give it is beyond most peoples comprehension.  They are dedicated to the animals 24/7 and put in unbeleivable hours to save as many as possible.  I truely beleive they are one of the best wildlife rehab centers in the country.

One time was when I was out on a run along the highway in the country, I came upon a baby chickadee with head trauma.  I carefully carried it home and contacted Fellow Mortals, who eagerly accepted the poor fledgling.  Another time was when I found some baby mice in my basement and the mother, for whatever reason, never returned to them.  They were kind enough to take them in for me, as I would never have succeeded at caring for them myself.  I even took another one in the next day as I missed it the day before.  They never demanded specific monetary contributions.  They only asked for what I could contribute for the animals' care.  I still wish I could have given more.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	108006		/users/profile/146720	laurasch	Client Served	5	03/18/2012	Fellow Mortals is truly an organization with a heart.  It is a collective heart of kind and caring souls who take the time out of this busy world to care about the some of the most defenseless and vulnerable fellow mortals, our injured and orphaned wildlife.  Most recently, I've brought a squirrel that had suffered traumatic head injury when hit by a car.  I found him writhing on the centerline of the road in the rain near my home.  I put him into my car wrapped him in a towel, and put him into a picnic basket I had with me.  I heard him crying all the while as I was leaving a message for Fellow Mortals that I had found him and hoped to bring him in before it was too late.   They called me back and said it was ok to bring him in right away.  He continued to cry softly.  When I got him there, they attended to him right away and I left with hope that he'd make it.  I found out sometime later that he did make it and was able to be released into the wild.  I've got tears in my eyes writing about this and I'm so glad I happened to drive by at that time to help him.  I've also attended the Fall Migration fundraiser and met many others who share compassion and love for these our "Fellow Mortals".  Several years ago I found a rock dove (homing pigeon) on the road.  I called and brought him in because he had also been struck by a car.  He was able to be rehabilitated and because he was a domesticated bird, he couldn't be just released into the wild to fend for himself so I was able to adopt him and 2 others and provide a home for them for several years.  I've donated to the organization for each animal I've brought in and I can think of no other group for which I have the deepest respect.  We are lucky people (and animals) on this earth  to have them.

They have helped many times when I've found abandoned or injured wildlife.   It's distressing to find an animal that needs help and I'm so glad I had them to advise me and accept the birds and squirrels that needed help.  With them, it's all about the animals.  The center is a quiet area, cars must park a distance away to not disturb the wildlife they are rehabilitating.  They work only from donations and they work 24/7, 365 days a year.  They have wonderful postings on facebook and their site so we can see who has been admitted and how the healing is going.  It is so gratifying to hear of an owl being released back to the wild.  They have done so much, not just for the animals but to help educate the public on respect and caring for them in an emergency.   I brought them a little thrush that fell from the nest and was not moving.  Yvonne held it in her hands, and as it warmed up, it literally came to life before our eyes.  I'll never forget that, and will always support this wonderful place so they may continue to educate us and help us help mother nature.

He was dragging himself across the sidewalk by his front legs.  Rather than let his suffering linger, it was such a relief to know that he was taken care of in a kind humane way.   On a happier note, I have brought in injured birds, so very young .   When Yvonne held one little  thrush, it came to life in the warmth of her hands.!  Some are just treated for shock and observed, but it's so good to know that animals get the care they need 24/7 with competence and kindness.  Many of my friends have had similar experiences.

No one anywhere, no vet, no humane society, no wildlife caretaker, nobody.  Helplessly you do what you can,  and you suffer as that animal suffers.    Fellow Mortals changed that.  We now have somewhere to go, not just a place to dump an injured animal, but a place staffed by selfless, dedicated lovers of wildlife where they get REAL help.  I have brought a numbers of birds and small mammals to them, some that I was pretty sure were not going to make it, but I knew Fellow Mortals would do all they could to save them.   It's a long drive for me to get to FM,  some would say why take all that time and trouble for a chipmunk the neighborhood cat got,  or the bird who hit my window.  The little I do by bringing the injured animal to FM is NOTHING.

I have had the privilege of releasing geese and ducks back into the wild after Fellow Mortals did what they do for all that come into their hospital. There is no better feeling than to see them fly, usually for the first time in a long time, and go back to the wild where they belong.  If not for them, so many of our creatures would probably not have a very happy life. Yvonne and Steve have dedicated their lives to doing this.  I have met the interns they get during the year and they also are so dedicated to these animals. If they find a creature that just cannot be released back into the wild, they keep and give them the best life possible. It takes special people to be able to do this kind of work. And these are very special people. The whole organization is run so well and the provisions given to the animals are great. I don't know what our community would do without them.

She was afraid they would be run over by a car so she called my daughter and me to help move the Mallards to our lawn.  Meanwhile, our neighbor accross the street came over and indicated that there had been a nest in her window bay and that the mother had not been back in a few days.  She also indicated that she had moved two of the babys down to a pond that sits in back of our house.  My wife realized that the little Mallards would not survive in the pond so she brought one of the babys from our lawn with her down to the pond and searched frantically for the missing ducklings.  Luckily, one of the missing Mallards responded to the chirping of the duckling my wife brought with her and we were able to rescue it.  The other unfortunately was was never found after hours of searching. For over a week we took care of the 4 little ducks and welcomed them into our family.  We learned more about baby ducks in a few short days than we ever thought we would.  We helped them with their first swimming lessons which was wonderful.  However, we knew these terrific creatures needed far more than we could provide and we were lost as to how to proceed. To make a long story short (if I ramble on it is because we feel these little Mallards were part of our family) Fellow Mortals stepped up to the plate and provided a home for these little ducks to grow up in and have a chance at a full life.  Believe me when I say we would not have turned these baby ducks over to just anybody.  Fellow Mortals is a full care loving facility that performs a service that few organizations provide.  They have helped countless abandoned wildfife in southeast Wisconsin over the years and we are very fortunate to have them.  Thank you Fellow Mortals for being there when we needed you!

This unique windlife hospital and rehab center exists not for profit, but to help, heal and rehabilitate injured animals.

I pulled over, got out of my car, and somehow managed to drag the injured, kicking deer off the road, away from oncoming traffic.   Within minutes, a police officer arrived, realized what had happened, and offerred to shoot the poor animal.  Being familiar with Fellow Mortals, there was no way I could let that happen.  I phoned my veterinarian, explained what had happened, and asked him to come, prepared with appropriate tranquilizers.   Upon his arrival, the vet examined the deer, saw its injured hind leg, and gave it a shot that would last long enough for me to drive the doe to Fellow Mortals.   In the weeks that followed, the deer received incredible care, and although it eventually had to be put down, it was treated with the love and respect that all living creatures, both human and animal, deserve.  Well done, Fellow Mortals.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	78728		/users/profile/86014	llamaman	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	Our relationship with Fellow Mortals began in the year 2000.  I was looking at our bird feeding station in our back yard and noticed what I thought was a dead bird lying in the snow.  I went outside to look at it and found it was a Mourning Dove.  It had a vicious, open wound on its breast and was at the most semi-conscious.  Instead of letting it freeze to death in the snow,  I brought it in the house to at least let it depart this world in warm house.  I had no hope for its survival. To my surprise, a few hours later it would sit in my hand and was quite aware. I then called Bong Recreational Area to see if they knew of any place I could take the dove. They gave me the number of Fellow Mortals. I called and talked to Yvonne who arranged for me to take the bird to a local vet they worked with.  I thought that would be the end of the story.  Much to my surprise, I received a phone call from Yvonne a month or so later THANKING me for bringing the bird to them and informed me the bird was fully recuperated and was scheduled for release that day.  To say the least,  my wife and I more than a little impressed with the dedication and courtesy of that kind of follow through. We decided to offer our services as a release site for them.   Soon thereafter, Yvonne came out with an intern and released a number of animals. Shortly after that, I was to meet the "infamous Steve", Yvonne's husband.  The first day we met we found we were both "reformed hunters" that now resorted to live catching mice that invaded our houses and releasing them in the woods.  However, we were both still avid target shooters and gun enthusiasts.  We both relished the seeming irony and cultivated our relationship with our common interests. The story continues to the present.Over the years we have released forgotten numbers of animals on our land from woodchucks to wood ducks, to turkeys, to pheasants to countless "special needs" squirrels we release in our front yard, five of whom are feeding off my front porch as I write this. One of the most picturesque releases was a Great White Egret released on our pond this last year. Shear poetry to watch him glide across our pond to land in the top of an oak tree. Fellow Mortals fills a much needed role in our community. I have spent my whole working life in the medical field and I can truly say I have never seen more dedication in any organization than that demonstrated by Fellow Mortals and ALL of its working members.

I have to say, I've never met an organization that is more serious about taking care of the creatures that are impacted by both the actions of man and nature than this group.  They have never failed to respond in a timely manner to the needs of the hurt animals we have contacted them about, and always send updates on the animals recovery when we request them.  Working with them also gives us an oportunity to build compassion for all living creatures in our young children.  We donate to this group whenever we use their services and also have given to them on other occasions, and I have always been confident that the money will be well stewarded.

They provide professional, compassionate, humane care to wild animals that have no one else to help them. When I was growing up, I often found myself trying to help injured or orphaned wildlife, but my resources were few and I did not have much success.  I can't express the relief that Fellow Mortals has provided.  Now when I end up with a wild animal in need, I know where to take it.  The staff at Fellow Mortals is invariably responsive within a short time of my phone call, and they are always ready to help.  I especially appreciate the follow-up card that I can send so that I can find out what happened to the animal that I brought in.  Every summer, I end up with at least one or two baby bird nestlings that need help, and Fellow Mortals saves most of them. I have read the newsletters over the years, and I have been impressed by how much they do with no taxpayer funding. I am a dedicated donor to this charity because I know that the money is going to those that so desperately need it; wild animals in trouble that have no other hope for help.  Fellow Mortals, I can't thank you enough!
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	75491		/users/profile/82460	Scott Diehl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2011	Fellow Mortals has been a priceless resource for both the wildlife of their part of the state and the people in their region who care about wildlife for more than two decades.  This is a professional organization fueled mostly by the sheer will, compassion and committment of their handful of staff.  This staff works, long, long hours to make sure the animals in their care are treated with kindness and respect.  Fellow Mortals and their professional, caring staff are valued colleagues and friends whom we greatly value.

I live 50 miles away, but it was worth the trip. The dedicated staff, working in small spaces, treating any and all wild animals, make a BIG difference. Made a difference in my life too. I was impressed and have been donating for the past 4 years. I know every penny sent is used efficiently and effectively. I love being able to support a local organization and see first hand what my contributions do. Happy 25th and many more. patty

It was an amazing experience. It was run professionally. Any information given to people who called was exactly what the rehabilitator told me in response to that particular call. The environment was to be quiet and calm so that it would not upset already stressed wildlife. Only rehabilitators and trained interns were allowed to care for the injured and orphaned wildlife. Even cleaning out where they lived was done by professionals. Cleaning was ongoing. I was surprised at how busy it was. Hundreds of birds and animals come in carried by concerned people who are relieved there is a place like Fellow Mortals. Most impressive was seeing the compassion and how gentle the rehabilitators were with the suffering wildlife. As soon as the bird or animal came through the door it was seen , made comfortable and started on getting its needs met. I liked that they always took the time to educate me on the various birds and animals that came through the doors. So many times I didn't know how the rehabilitators kept going always patient,kind and so concerned for their many birds and animals. Open 7 days a week. Work needs to be done even if someone cannot come in due to sickness or injury. They support each other. I came away from this experience with a great deal of admiration and a debt of gratitude to this small group of healers and their helpers,who have dedicated their lives to saving and easing the pain of our wildlife.  volunteer Jill

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	72561		/users/profile/79323	arris	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	I discovered five baby rabbits whose nest was flooded during a very heavy rain storm. I move them a few feet to higher ground and watched off and on to see if the mother would tend to them. After a cold night and more rain I checked on them and four were on the edge of death. I put them in a basket with a towel and brought them in the house. They seemed much better later that day. I brought them to fellow mortals.  Wonderful people. They informed me later that all five were doing fine.   What a great organization.

I was encouraged to apply for my rehabilitation license and have since been a wildlife rehabilitator since 1993.  I owe everything I know to Yvonne and Steve.  They trained me well.  Fellow Mortals has the highest standards in wildlife care and release.  The animals welfare is put first and foremost!  I give high praises to Fellow Mortals for all that they do for wildlife, the interns that they train, and the clients that bring animals to them.  They do everything possible to help all the animals that come to them.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	71930		/users/profile/78649	Avery	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2011	I always love to take every chance I can get to praise Fellow Mortals.  I had two internships 6 years ago, working a estimated total time of 10 months full time, where I had the unique opportunity to learn to care for wildlife.  I am now a veterinarian, and there are too few of us that know about wildlife.  I work with 5 veterinarians, and even though I am the youngest, they rely on me for wildlife advice, and sometimes even calling me on my day off.  I can honestly tell you that wildlife care differs with every rehabber or hospital, but Fellow Mortals is one of those rare places that cares for wildlife the RIGHT way.  They are always striving to learn more with medical care.  In addition to giving high quality care, they also educate students by giving them internships to learn how to care for wildlife and to carry that knowledge with them wherever life may take them.  Fellow Mortals deserves it.

All animals who are fortunate enough to find their way to this incredible rehabilitation facility benefit from all their resources and are given the best chance for survival.  I have delivered baby birds who just needed to be safely released, a duck with a broken wing, a feisty little woodpecker and an injured 13-line ground squirrel rescued from the side of the road.  All were welcomed with kindness and concern.Because of my strong belief in the important selfless work of Fellow Mortals and my love of animals, I requested that memorial donations be made to FM when my mama passed away last March.  I also consider FM my charity of choice when making my annual contributions.  Most communities gratefully have shelters for needy cats and dogs; it is equally comforting to know there is one dedicated to our precious wildlife.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	71847		/users/profile/78561	E.Nass	Volunteer	5	02/20/2011	When I was a teenager my family found an injured Great Horned Owl and we contacted Fellow Mortals for help.  The owl was successfully rehabilitated and released back at our property.... That was 13 years ago! As fate would have it, five years ago I met my wife, who is a wildlife rehabilitator at Fellow Mortals.  I volunteer for the organization, helping with construction projects and with squirrel releases. Fellow Mortals is a big part of our lives and because of this my understanding of wildlife has changed for the better. The compassion and commitment that these individuals have is extraordinary. I am proud to be a part this wonderful organization.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	71845		/users/profile/78558	Wildlife	Client Served	5	02/20/2011	I am honored to write about Fellow Mortals. Professional care and dedication to wildlife is exemplified by this licensed Facility. Their passion is genuine and admirable. I had contact with them in a professional capacity on two occassions - to take  in swallows due to permitted late nest removals. They took in both eggs and nestlings.  In addition, they took an immature owl that was found by field engineers during work hours. They are the only Wildlife Rehabilitation facilitiy in this area that isn't restricted to a defined boundary. They commit to any injured or abandoned wildlife if they have the capacity and resources to provide care.  I was a licensed wildlife rehabiltator in the past so I know firsthand how hard a rehabilitator works and it's not for the money. The degree of compassion, commitment, and innovative care provided animals by Yvonne and her small staff is impressing.  Others who participated in a volunteer project at FM reported how inspired they were by Fellow Mortals philosopy and wildlife Mission to care for wildlife; interactions with the staff have been very positive. Steve is innovative with how to improve inside and outside facilities to meet the needs of individual species.  Fellow Mortals is dependent on charitable contributions. Their passion is providing quality care for animals in need. Years of experience make them highly skilled rehabilitators, and great educators.  Their greatest reward is releasing injured animals back into the wild.  They are so deserving and I highly recommend this facility for  financial grant/assistance.  
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	71815		/users/profile/78524	akita annie	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	I first had contact with Fellow Mortals when my husband and I found a small owl in our yard.  We thought it was a baby that had not yet learned to fly but instead it was a tiny owl.  We took it to Fellow Mortals, they took care of it until it could safely be released back into the wild. It is very difficult to find vets that will treat birds so we are truly lucky to have a place like Fellow Mortals.   Last December they had an Open House and we went out there both weekends to donate and see the owls they brought out.  It was made very clear to us that yes, a donation or volunteering would be well received, but the thing that impressed me was their primary interest was in the care and condition of the birds.  We were not allowed back in the hospital area - this was no zoo - it was a place where the bird and animal care comes first and nothing is permitted to upset their rehabilitation.   It is run by truly dedicated people and I hope they are able to continue providing the care to the various animals.  They are truly needed in our community.Ann K and Tom K

Even though it was after hours on a weekend, they returned our call promptly and advised us what to do.  We ended up bringing the birds in to their facility.  We were impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the staff that we dealt with.  Being a devoted animal lover, I was so thankful for Fellow Mortals' help and to be able to give these birds a second chance.  I've since become a donor, to help Fellow Mortals continue the great work that they do for all the animals.

Yvonne and her staff care so much for the animals and give everything they have to help bring them back to good health so they can be released back to the wild.

Every day they give compassionate and professional care to the wildlife that is in their care.  A few years ago I received a call concerning an injured young Great Horned Owl in our neighborhood.  Fellow Mortals gave me instruction on how to safely rescue the owl and bring her in to them.  The bird turned out to be a beautiful immature female that had injuries to both eyes and ruptured air sacs and was listed in critical condition.  Fellow Mortals was able to treat her and find a placement for her with another wildlife rehabilitator and educator that could give her a home and use her as an educational bird.  Through their caring efforts they gave her a "second chance".   This they do untiring compassion day after day for wildlife in need.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	68880		/users/profile/75269	ANN R	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	Our introduction and subsequent relationship with Fellow Mortals began with an injured rabbit. Since then we have taken other injured animals to them, and a beautiful little chickadee who had lost a wing. The compassion of Yvonne and Steve was the beginning of Fellow Mortals, and continues to be the driving force behind the expansion of the hospital itself and the increase in the number of people involved. Each injured animal and bird that arrives at their door has a chance, a chance they wouldnt have without them. The world is so surely a better place because of Fellow Mortals!
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	68775		/users/profile/75156	Paul	Donor	5	02/15/2011	       We let our cats out but not overnight, and usually not without one of us with them. We have actually gotten them reasonably well trained to our lot lines. But, and with we humans there usually is a BUT, we arent watching them closely at all times. On one such occasion we ended up with a damaged rabbit at our backdoor. The vet said he couldnt deal with it, but referred us to Fellow Mortals Hospital in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.        We called them, drove the rabbit to them, and found out that they would make every effort to make sure the rabbit survived, and that they would hope to release him at some point in the future. Then is when we really understood the phrase we are caretakers of the space we are living in.  We now try to aide Fellow Mortals financially and physically whenever they need help.  The people that operate this organization are committed to making all animals brought to them feel comfortable even if it is obvious they will not be with them very long.  They also, as a by-product, teach the persons bringing the animals what life should be all about.  So the one rabbit has cost us some donated money and some volunteer time, but when we hopefully look down from heaven, we will be able to say we really did something important.  Everyone should stop, observe, protect, encourage, defer, and love not only the people around us, BUT those birds and animals that we are endangering.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	68739		/users/profile/75108	pickeral2	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	My first encounter with Fellow Mortals was last January.  About dusk I noticed a large bird limping on what appreared to be a broken wing heading to my ground bird feeder.  I was struck by the majestic quality of the bird and the contrasting injury.  On further inspection we discovered it to be a great horned owl.  Not knowing where to turn for help (and being after busines hours) we called the Walworth County Humane Society.  Lucky for us, part of the message was a phone number for Fellow Mortals.  I called and left a message with our emergency.  Within 5 minutes I was contacted by a kind, friendly woman who knew exactly what was going on and what to do.  Unfortuately she had experienced this type of situation before, as it is common for this bird to hunt at dusk and fall victim to the human world of cars.  She gave me detailed step by step instructions on how to capture him, what to expect from him and how to transport to their facilities.  It was an experience both gratifying and heart wrenching.  Later I learned that they were not able to repair the severe injury, but I know that he left this world from a kind and loving place surrounded by love.  I have continued to send financial support and although I was awed by the experience, hope that I will not have to utilize the facility again.  Thank you for who you are and your commitment to the journey you have undertaken with love and humanity

Our second encounter was a visit to the old facilities....an introduction to a rambling woodchuck and a rabbit that had taken up residence in the living room sofa.....at that point, I realized these people were serious about their dedication to wildlife.  Since then, we have visited the new facilities and are greatly impressed with the "before and after".

I've never seen a group of people so dedicated to their job.  As minor as this may seem, every animal has a name. Not only do they all have names, but every staff member could walk up to any bird/beaver/what have you at any given time and tell you its name. This is amazing because to many people a ruby throated hummingbird is just a ruby throated hummingbird. The staff know their "clients" down to a T and care so much about every single one of them. They know when to feed them, why they are at the hospitol, what they need to do to help the animal get out of the hospitol. These ladies have received a lot of education and training and they've put it towards a great cause... if only they would pack up and come over to Canada!

Over the years they have been steadfast in caring for those in need; taking them under their wing and doing all that is possible to care for them and return them to their natural habitat.  A number of years ago I called them for help with three orphaned baby raccoons.  They kindly gave me guidance so I could rescue them and take them where they would receive the proper care.  Over the years I have taken to them a Robin entangled in knitting, baby robins that survived their nest being attacked and a Flicker with an injured beak.  Fellow Mortals gave each loving care.  Our family is so thankful for all that Fellow Mortals does.  They are a wonderful organization.

It all started when we found a small animal in our yard that needed immediate medical care. We took the animal to our local Veterinary clinic, but they could not help the animal, they did refer us to Fellow Mortals and we headed immediately to them. When we arrived there we were met by friendly and very caring personal. They took our own pain and sorrow about this suffering little animal very seriously as they immediately attended to the animals needs. They took the time out of their busy schedule to give us a tour of their facility as well as to make sure we were emotionally comforted. As we left we were amazed at this organization and how it was run. We felt we did the best possible thing that could be done for the injured animal at the same time the personal at Fellow Mortals acted in a very professional manner. Their compassion for their work in helping all wild animals shown through the minute you arrived there. This organization is one of the most caring and unselfish out there, doing the work they do because of the pleasure they get in helping and caring for our fellow mortals.

I cannot begin to write the accolades that will even come close to the work that is done there.  The dedication, empathy, knowledge and warmth shown to the animal and human members or our community are extraordinary.   This organization lives the ideals mentioned in "on becoming human"  written by David Krieger 1999:  "To be human is to be courageous. It is to choose the path of compassion.  It is to sacrifice for what is just. It is to break the silence. It is to be an unrelenting advocate of human decency and dignity. "To be human is the breathe with the rhythm of life, and to recognize our kinship with all forms of life. "To be human is to be aware of our dependence upon the whole of the universe, and the miracle that we are.  It is to open our eyes to the simple and extraordinary beauty that is all about us.  It is to live with deep respect for the sacred gift of life.  It is to love. "To be human is not always to succeed, but it is always to learn.  It is to move forward despite the obstacles."

Last year in my backyard there was an abandoned duck's nest with about a dozen eggs that my husband and I took to Fellow Mortals.  Since the mom had been gone a while, any survival was doubtful and all the kids in my neighborhood were very saddened.  But Jessica gave me regular reports on the eggs' condition and there were some hatchlings, she even took video.  I passed this info on to the neighborhood kids and it brightened their spirits and taught them  a very important lesson about respecting wildlife and finding the right people to help.  Thanks, Fellow Mortals.  The Robinsons

I had heard about the work they do from some friends.   They showed us one of their  permanent residents, an owl that was very comfortable with the person it was with.   They answered all our questions and you could tell they were very passionate about the work they do to help animals.   I feel we in this area are very fortunate to have an organization of this caliber to help us help the wildlife.    Thank you and keep up the great work you do.   I am also looking forward to another open house.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	67555		/users/profile/73836	Amy B.	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	We have taken several animals to Fellow Mortals including injured squirrels, ducks, and baby birds fallen from trees.  Even when Fellow Mortals can't help with the animals they provide information on how to help them, what to do/not to do, and who might be able to help them-such as turtles, racoons, skunks, opposums, etc...some of our latest 'rescues').  Fellow Mortals has a wonderful 'staff' of volunteers who is always friendly and willing to help, they are truly there for the animals.   I especially enjoy that when you take an animal in you are able to get an update if you send a SASE approx 10 days later.  They have always sent the update back when I've sent my request in (which I always do, I always want to know how they are).  They tell the honest truth about what happened.  One of the animals didn't make it (I forget which one this was, it was yrs ago), but they made him comfortable and he had a peaceful death.  Which while it's sad, it is good to know he didn't suffer on the road...with a kid poking at him, which is how we found him.  The birds we brought in, we thought there were only 3 (we took the birdhouse in and thought there was only 2 in there plus the one that was on the ground), turned out there were 5, and only 2 made it, they had West Nile.   They wouldn't have made it otherwise.  Unfortunately I don't think people realize just how lucky we are to have Fellow Mortals here.  They are a blessing to our community!
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	67522		/users/profile/73804	theresad	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	Over 10 years ago I became involved with helping Fellow Mortals and was completely amazed at the devotion and selflessness of all of those involved.  The animals are always first and foremost, and they are given every opportunity to have the best possible lives despite whatever struggles they have come across.  Fellow Mortals does so much with so little, all from donations of those who believe in their work and have a love of wildlife.  I can only hope the organization will be there for my children when they grow up, allowing them a resource and  a safe haven for the injured and orphaned wildlife they may encounter.  They are a huge asset to our community as well as many others.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	67509		/users/profile/73789	ClaudiaKessel	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	I was first introduced to Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital, based in Walworth County, near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, in 1995 when I was in high school. I was moved by their mission to care for injured and orphaned wild animals and became a volunteer for several years, cleaning cages and helping feed and care for deer, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, beavers, songbirds, hawks, owls, bats and many other wildlife species.  Fellow Mortals was founded by a couple-- Yvonne Wallace Blane and Steve Blane-- who began taking in injured wild animals from the local community in the early 80's.  Both became professional, licensed wildlife rehabilitators and founded Fellow Mortals in 1985 and incorporated in 1991. Over the past 25 years, they have selflessly devoted themselves to caring for wildlife from across the southeastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois  region and have gotten by on a very small budget based on donations from local community members. Fellow Mortals is an extremely successful organization, now with a small group of professionally trained wildlife rehabilitators and wildlife biology interns giving care to the injured and orphaned wildlife, working on average 70 hours per week! Every year they receive about 2,000 injured and orphaned wild animals and have an unusually high release rate compared to other similar organizations. They have kept phenomenal data over the years about their success rate in releasing the wildlife back into the wild once healed. They also provide rehabilitation free to the public-- there is no change. They rely solely on donations from the community to continue their work.  Most of all, Fellow Mortals is driven by an underlying ethic based on the belief that all life is precious. Unlike other similar organizations that may be quick to euthanize injured wildlife, Fellow Mortals staff and interns do everything in their power to respect individual animal life, no matter how small. They give every animal that enters their doors the most high quality care possible. 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	67391		/users/profile/73660	slkk	Client Served	5	02/12/2011	FellowMortals has been known to us for over 10 years and i have on many occasions taken injured wildlife there for rescue including a clutch of 10 wild turkey eggs after their Mom was hit by our haying tractor. All were cared for in second hand premi ICU equipment Which i had used years before as a nurse. They all survived and we were able to volunteer our forested land for their release. Such compassion and love of service to their individual animals is special and valued. Yvonne's attitudes and teaching has imprinted many many human beings who will be forever changed in their care of God's animals. $$ is used directly for animal welfare first,no fluf, no exploitation ever.

If more people would show the compassion that these people have whether it be animal or person, it would be a much better world to live in.Fellow Mortals is the greatest and the efforts and work thatthey put into these animals goes beyond what any words couldever describe.   Some people should wish they were an animalrather than a person as i think the animals get far bettercare than what some people do in a health care facility. Thank you Fellow Mortals for all that you have done andcontinue to do.

I can't even begin to count the number of assorted birds and animals in need that I have brought to them for care.  The people of Fellow Mortals, led by Steve and Yvonne Blaine, have a commitment to their calling that I have not seen elsewhere.  Each and every creature is treated as if it were the only one on earth.  There is and unspoken assurance that nothing less than the best is even possible at this facility.  It is evedent on the faces of each and every care giver, and also with the feeling of compassion and peace that wraps around you when you walk in the door.  365 days a year X 25 years is proof that Fellow Mortals is a didication of love and service.  They give the best, and may they get the best in return.  Thank you, Fellow Mortals, for showing us what caring is all about.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	66988		/users/profile/73217	Jim S	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	last fall, just on the edge of winter, I found a sparrow much too youngto be on its own, in the middle of my driveway. I normally drive up tomy garage when I come home, but something made me park half wayup my driveway. I stopped the truck, pressed the garage door openerand got out . As I was comming around the front of my truck I noticeddirectly in line with my right front tire was a tiny ball of downy feathers.My wife and I use to volunteer for Joanne Dean and Wildlife Horizons,so I knew, with the cool fall breeze announcing winter this little guywould be needing three hots and a cot for the entire winter.Joanne Dean specialized in squirrels, and a baby sparrow would bevery time consuming. Some of  the squirrels in her care are veryyoung almost furless, and some have squirrel  pox, needing extracare 24/7. Joanne suggested FELLOW MORTALS. I gave them a call,and as I expected they were the most friendly, caring and unselfishgroup of people who really put their hearts into the nurturing of God'screatures great and small. With out a voice of their own FELLOWMORTALS  is one of the only shelters that gives these almost forgotten creatures a helping hand in getting them to the next  stageof their life. It is said " a people is judged by how it's lowliest creaturesare treated" I give FELLOW MORTALS the highest marks, they listento the ones who can't speak. Without donations, maintaining a shelterfor our lowliest creatures is increasingly difficult, support from our community leaders would lessen the financial burden that these grassroots organizations usually  succumb to. Thank You for being there when there was no one else,Sincerely Jim Syring

They all were wonderful, helpful, and even followed up with me on the little guys recovery. Another time we found a baby chipmunk with both back legs injured and once again Fellow Mortals helped me when my other people in my area that were supposed to help never even called me back or gave me the time of day. Fellow Mortals has always been there for us and the little creatures that need help. Wonderful people, and wonderful mission.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	66636		/users/profile/72832	rehaber	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	My sister and I first became aquainted with Fellow Mortals when she found a green heron on the side of the road that was in dire need of medical attention.  Neither my sister nor I knew of a wildlife hospital or where to take the heron.  In vain we tried to obtain assistance for it from local vets who we found out could not touch it per federal mandate.  It was the next day that we were told about Fellow Mortals and raced up there with the green heron in a box.  Though the staff tried to help the poor bird, they could not save it.  Had we known about this vital institution and not delayed 24 hours, perhaps they could have save this beautiful bird. Ever since, my sister and I have been supporting this important wildlife hospital and rehab center.  There are far too few such places where wildlife animals can get care and half a chance at living a full life in the wild after having their injuries tended to.  The ever expanding hand of mankind has made it far more difficult for wildlife to coexist with humans and though it is not deliberate, yet we have destroyed far too much habitat that is necessary for wildlife to live as they should!  Thus Fellow Mortals is all the more important in assisting injured wildlife to heal their wounds and be released back to nature in order to enhance our world.  It is a pity that there are not more vital institutions like Fellow Mortals around to help injured wildlife.

I was lucky to learn about Fellow Mortals when I found an injured bunny in my yard, and I was so impressed with the care taken by the staff at this wonderful facility.  Years later I had to bring in a seriously injured baby bird, and although ultimately the bird did not survive, the compassion that was evident in the follow-up note I received detailing the care the bird had received made me so glad that I had a place to take the bird so it did not have to die alone and in fear.  We are so lucky to have a resource like this in our community, and I support Fellow Mortals and the organization's mission wholeheartedly.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	66370		/users/profile/72544	Meg Waraczynski	Donor	5	02/10/2011	   I have taken several injured wild animals to Fellow Mortals so they can be helped back to the wild.  The staff are superb.  I especially appreciated how they followed up by informing me of the animals' status.  For example, late one night I brought in a rabbit that had run under my car while I was driving down a rural highway.  I was relieved to learn a few days later that the rabbit had not incurred serious injury and would soon be released.  I didn't have to just wonder what happened to her.  Also, the staff takes the time to educate people who bring in animals.  When I brought in a juvenile squirrel whose mother had apparently been killed, I learned from the staff that this often leads to dehydration as the juveniles miss expected feedings, so I knew what was going on the next time I found another young squirrel in the same condition.     As southeastern Wisconsin becomes more and more "developed" it is inevitable that more wild animals will be injured via encounters with people who live in their homes.  Fellow Mortals provides one of very few opportunities we have to try to alleviate that suffering.   It also provides an excellent training ground for people who want to become wildlife rehabilitators.

One didn't survive the attack, but the other did and was still badly injured. The staff at Fellow Mortals walked me through the care of the bunny until I could reach their facility. When my daughters and I arrived, we were greeted very kindly and the bunny was greeted with great concern. It was obvious that the staff member really loved all of these creatures, but also knew it was important for my children to know the truth of the bunny's prognosis. She looked over the bunny and explained that although they would try their best to save it, the bunny had been severely injured and might not make it. She took the time to explain how we could look for other bunny holes and what to do to protect future nest attacks. This special care helped my daughters and I take more responsibility for caring for our environment and thinking more about what we can do to help before we need Fellow Mortals again.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	65482		/users/profile/71573	Nancy Stanley	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	I am a true animal lover - always have been.  It is my nature, when finding an animal injured or in distress, to try to help it.  When dealing with a cat or dog, there are vet clinics you can consult for help.  However, when finding an injured animal that is wild, it is very difficult, if not impossible to find assistance.  Some years ago, I had an injured swan take up residence on the pond located on my country home.  It was unable to fly, but otherwise seemed fine.  After providing food for it daily and becoming quite attached to it, I knew I still had a lot to learn about swans.  One day something had startled the swan and it took off running down the long road which ended at a busy intersection of traffic.  I didn't know how to catch it properly so as not to get hurt and I had no one to help me.  I had heard about Fellow Mortals so I gave them a phone call and explained that I needed help quickly to rescue my swan from certain disaster.  Within minutes, Yvonne from Fellow Mortals was on the scene and explained what we needed to do.  We followed the swan and she was able to catch it properly and helped me to get it back home once again.  She also provided direction to me on how to handle the swan.  She did not ask for anything in return.  She wanted nothing but to help.  In this day and age, I find this to be something very special.  Her dedication and compassion to helping with the care and well being of all animals is incredible.   This organization is outstanding and the people who lend their help and support make this a better world for us and the animals that share our world.  I only wish there were more places like Fellow Mortals.  It is a true comfort to me to know they are there should I need help again.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	65111		/users/profile/71173	anne	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Since moving to Wisconsin in 2002 I and or my family have come upon a number of injured and orphaned wild animals.  We do not have the expertise nor would it be to the best advantage of the animal to tend to it and have it bond to humans instead of its own kind. In most every instance, time was of the essence since the bird or mammal we found was severely compromised.  You find yourself wanting to help and you don't know where to turn.  Fellow Mortals gave us somewhere to turn. Fellow Mortals took the helpless creature from us and did all they could to restore its life to the one it was meant to live.  I know what they do requires endless time and devotion because I have done it both with wild and domestic animals. You would think that you would grow so weary of all that dedication and giving - but they keep going and giving. Not only do they give of their time, compassion and energy but they also must devote so much time to trying to create all the funding they need to carry on. They put time into programs to educate the public and on top of all that they continually inspire those that already know of them and those that don't through the beautifully written educational news letters they send out. Fellow Mortals, because they exist and do all that they do, grants testimony to the higher good humans can aspire to when it comes to compassion and stewardship towards those that can too often be viewed as lesser than ourselves.

They are singular people with an amazing level of dedication. They have give their lives to wildlife rehabilitation and I have so much admiration for them. The world would be poorer without their efforts. 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	65037		/users/profile/71100	pjaye	Donor	5	02/08/2011	Our area is blessed to have an organization like Fellow Mortals. By saving thousands injured and helpless animals every year, they raise all of us to a higher level. When we show compassion for these poor creatures, it changes us by opening our hearts. 
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	64887		/users/profile/70940	boo-boo	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	What an amazing place! I didn`t know Fellow Mortals existed until I found a small, starving, freezing opposum, and found them through a local vet`s office. They returned my call almost immediately, told me what to do for my small friend until I could get her to them. I couldn`t help but cry when I arrived and realized how truely wonderful this place is. I will do whatever I can to donate, spread the word of their existance for the rest of my life.

I could not even count the number of times I personally was able to fall asleep without worry because I knew the wonderful folks of Fellow Mortals had taken charge of helping in the life or lives of unfortunate wildlife in our county.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	64527		/users/profile/70556	Kourtney F.	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I've been very fortunate to have interned at Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital a few years ago.  I continue to regard my experiences there to be some of the most important, meaningful ones in my life.  There is a true need for a wildlife hospital in so many areas, and Fellow Mortals serves its surrounding community so well.  The staff there are so dedicated to the wildlife in their care, and they are extremely knowledgable and attentive to their patients.  Every year, I look forward to attending their annual auction, because I know firsthand that every penny goes toward the care of those animals staying in the hospital.  
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	64521		/users/profile/70548	Good Steward2	Client Served	5	02/07/2011	Early one morning our cat (on a leash) was sunning on our patio . He caught a baby sparrow and proudly brought it in the house. I made him drop the bird, the frightened little bird hid behind some furniture and I put it in a shoe box. (punched holes in the top and sides before putting the little bird inside).  I  searched on-line for advice and found Fellow Mortals. I got instructions to keep the bird quiet & safe. I put her up in a dark, quiet closet, away from the cat. (Do not feed/water injured animals). I left a phone msg.,Fellow Mortals returned the call early am and I took the baby sparrow in to see the Dr. They were so kind and sweet to both of us. She had puncture wounds & I was informed that cat wounds are very serious and it was good that I brought the birdie in ASAP.  I even got to "name" the little birdie "Charlotte" when I filled out the short form indicating that I wanted an update on her status. I wrote a check for $25 to help Fellow Mortals..(they deserved every penny and then some). I later mailed a SASE so that they could inform me on Charlotte's progress. I am happy to say that 2-3 weeks later they informed me that she was doing well and would soon be released into the wild. What a fantastic experience. My husband and I were so impressed.   PS: Do not hesitate to bring in sick/ injured animals they will not make you feel bad if you can only afford the gas to get there. What a dedicated, caring and generous organization. I wish I had more money to give. So-o-o-o impressed.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	230855	2	/users/profile/88090	Mary Ellen,	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	The staff members at Fellow Mortals are the most dedicated, hard-working, and compassionate people I know.  With them, the animals always come first.  All patients are given the attention and respect they deserve, whether big or small, furred or feathered.  I first went to Fellow Mortals when I found a dead opossum mother with what I thought were two surviving babies.  (There were actually seven more babies still tucked in the mother's pouch.)  Now I am a volunteer, and I can't imagine a better use of my time.  My life is richer in so many ways because of my association with Fellow Mortals.  This organization deserves everyone's support, whether it be gifts of time, talent, money, or all three.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	64418		/users/profile/70434	Seanachie	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	A wonderful community asset that helps care for wild animals that are unable to care for themselves due to illness,  accident, or other misfortune.  Brought an injured squirrel to Fellow Mortals Hospital several years ago and was impressed with the compassionate care the animal received.    Staff members are highly knowledgeable and skillful and are truly committed to the welfare of their animal charges.     Inured/sick animals are welcome virtually at any time.  
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	63995		/users/profile/69955	justboncowans	Donor	5	02/06/2011	I discovered Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital when my cat got out of the house one spring day and injured a young bunny.  I called the local animal shelter and they directed me Fellow Mortals.  I took the bunny as soon as they called me and entrusted it to their loving care.   Fortunately, the bunny's injuries were not life threatening and it fully recovered.  Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital is a guardian angel to the wildlife whose habitat we infringe on with our urban sprawl and dangerous vehicles.  It does my heart good to see the work that they do so selflessly on a daily basis.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	63383		/users/profile/69298	Love of Wildlife	Donor	5	02/04/2011	One afternoon a couple years ago, my husband ran into the house allflustered.  He told me there was a baby bird on the ground that hadfallen from a nest in the tree.  I lifted the bird up and removed it from thehot sun.  I began doing some research to find an organization that couldhelp me with the baby bird.  I didn't know if the mother bird would refuse tocare for it after I had touched it.  I found the name of Fellow Mortals & their number froma neighborhood store that I buy birdseed from.  I called and left them amessage.  Someone returned my call in about 10 minutes.  She advisedme to place the bird back in the nest and then check on the nest to seeif the mother was going to return to feed the babies.  One or the other of us watched the nest with our binoculars.  Behold!  Within about30 minutes, the mother bird returned with food and proceeded to feedALL the baby birds.  My husband & I were so happy & relieved that thebaby was going to recieve sustenance.  I went to Fellow Mortals thefollowing day and thanked them profusely for helping us.  When myhusband & I were so baffled as to what to do, the Fellow MortalsIntern was very calming and helpful.  I wrote a donation check.  WhenI read about the organization and that they work strictly on donations,I knew that they needed financial help if we were going to keep themhelping injured & orphaned wildlife.  Ever since, I have felt blessed tohave such a wonderful, compassionate, hard-working, and educational organization to help our wildlife.  I feel honored to have Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital as a part of my life.

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	62185		/users/profile/67973	Deena	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	I work at a landfill located in Racine WI.  We have a large population of  Red Tail Hawks.  One of our hawks broke his wing and I called Fellow Mortals right away.  They asked that I get him there as soon as possible.  They took him in right away and the next day did surgery.  Unfortunately he had torn ligaments and not broken his wing.  They worked with him and it became apparent he was not going to be able to fly again.  With much work an education program was located that would take our hawk. The time and effort put in by these very special people helps take care of those creatures that would not stand a change otherwise.  I am so thankful for them and their organization and wish them all the best now and in the future. Deena Brehm

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	62091		/users/profile/67874	mrtgirlyg	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	Fellow mortals helped me when I thought I had nowhere to turn.  I found a bird stuck to a glue trap and they were able to remove him and get him on his way to recovery.  Just last week I found a bird with an eye injury.  They gave me instructions on how to care for him until  I could deliver him there for care.  They are wonderful, caring people who quietly work to care for the most helpless among us.  Without them I truly would have had no place to take these injured animals and they would have died.   
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	62076		/users/profile/67852	merrimaid	Donor	5	02/01/2011	I became aware of Fellow Mortals when there was a wonderful article about them in the Kenosha News a while ago.  When I read that they did not discriminate.....they show the same amount of care, love, and compassion to a squirrel, as well as a bald eagle, I was compelled to donate to them.  They keep you abreast of their new " clients": their progress, and hopefully their release back into the real world.  As Mohandas Gandhi wrote,"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."  Well, Fellow Mortals make us look pretty good. What else can be said about an organization that tries their hardest to relieve the suffering of innocent creatures, all while feeling their pain at the same time?

Fellow Mortals, Inc.	58945		/users/profile/63188	Jackie Klish	General Member of the Public	5	12/18/2010	I have brought injured or orphaned animals to Fellow Mortals over many years.  It is a clean and quiet place for animals to recover from injuries or illness, and their one goal is to rehabilitate them to be returned to the wild whenever possible.  The staff is competent and work tirelessly, as there is no off time when caring for so many kinds of wildlife.  It's a real comfort to the community to know we have this resource, as more development crowds out the wildlife.  They do a wonderful job of educating both adults and children.  I don't know how they care for thousands of animals a year with only donations, but I say they do a lot with the little they have, and many local residents will help with building and other jobs because we know what a great job they do.  They are a model for what all wildlife hospitals should be.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	58934		/users/profile/63166	Dana	General Member of the Public	5	12/18/2010	Many years ago I visited Fellow Mortals, after hearing Yvonne on a radio interview.  I was so touched and taken with the extensive facilities for such a new organization with such a small budget.  Yvonne took the time to show my friend and I around and my heart was warmed by the wounded innocent animals that were getting a chance not to suffer and a second chance at their lives.  I will never forget it and have always done my best to contribute to their work.Yvonne and her staff are selfless and genuine in their commitment.  So many injured wildlife are passed by and Fellow Mortals makes it possible to not have to do that anymore.  I feel that we are all better people because Fellow Mortals is here.

I have brought several animals to the hospitalover the years and have always left with a very good feeling knowing the animal will get the best care.  They are the best at what they do. They send out a newsletter a few times a year and what an uplifting feeling I get when I am done reading  their stories.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	36452	7	/users/profile/37239	Theresa	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	Fellow Mortals is an organization that is a huge part of our community.  Without it, there would be no hope for the injured birds and mammals that are found near and far.  They give every single animal a chance that it may never have seen.  The love and care that goes into each and every patient at the hospital truly shows the compassion that man can hold for wild things.  I have been proud over the years to say that I am even remotely associated with such a great group of people.  It is in a selfish way though, as being part of a higher mission only makes me a better person. Every single person that I know who has come in contact with Fellow Mortals has been changed in one way or another for the better.  I cannot express the good they do, and will continue to do no matter what obstacles stand in their way.

At that time we were welcomed by Karen, a most helpful young woman, who handled our frightened rescue with immediate concern and compassion.  She was our first encounter with this wonderful organization, and when we read more about their operation and facility, started by Steven and Yvonne Blane, we decided to do what we could to help.  I volunteered to sew cage pads for the animals, and my husband got involved in some carpentry and outdoor work projects around the place.  We also participated in their annual fundraiser, an outstanding event. Our love of animals led us to support Fellow Mortals, because we saw their genuine dedication to helping injured, abandoned and frightened creatures.  When you picture the hours and hours of all-day feeding schedules for baby birds and animals, you can only imagine the patience, love, and devotion this staff has for their fellow mortals.  My husband felt fortunate to participate in squirrel releases and also some raptor releases, experiences that he said touch the heart deeply.  We will continue to support this wonderful organization.  They are committed to ongoing superior care, they give their time, (and yes, talentsYvonne writes the most beautiful articles about the animals, as do many of her highly skilled staff,)keeping folks informed about the view of life from the animals world.  What amazing and gracious people these are, helping those without a voice.
Fellow Mortals, Inc.	35375	6	/users/profile/36211	joanne-g	Volunteer	5	04/10/2010	Through a rare newspaper article featuring them I recalled their name when I found an injured animal. Because of their quiet insistence that this is a hospital they have no visitors and publicity except word-of-mouth. Care and rehabilitation of the animals is their first and only priority. So my first experience with Fellow Mortals goes back far more than 10 years. Since then I have brought many injured animals and have witnessed that every effort is made to help the animals. Their days are long, their own comforts are ignored and sleep is frequently sacrificed.The interns feel fortunate to be part of the organization and are reluctant to leave when their time is up. When an animal is brought in it receives immediate attention. Love, care and gentleness prevails. Their source of happiness and satisfaction is the eventual rehabilitation and release of the animal - whether eagle or white-footed mouse, bunny or hawk. But if release is not possible, then the animal has a permanent retirement in their care. Without a dime of government funding, their only funding comes from the generosity of local donors.Fellow Mortals and all who live there deserve all the help and support that can be mustered.

They are educating children and our communities, providing low cost vet clinics, advocating for dogs that don't have a voice, and doing rescue on top of it!

Without them I wouldn't have even known this was going on and how it would ultimately effect me because I already owned a pitbull type dog. I went to the meetings to show support and learn more. Luckily, the BSL laws weren't passed but I wanted to educate myself more about the topic and about pitbull type dogs in general. Michelle has a heart of gold and is excellent at explaining the facts. She truly cares not only about these dogs but our community and educating future generations. From there I started volunteering with the resue dogs at Brew City. We then fostered one of the dogs and ended up making him a permanent family member. We love both of our pitbulls and love helping change peoples minds about the breed! Thank you Brew City for all you do!

Brew City is a true advocate for pit bulls in offering our community, schools, and police education on these loving dogs. The owner, Michelle, is as genuine as they come and has a passion to make a difference for the better.

Most of all their passion to make a difference comes through and engages people to listen and to think about their message. I love volunteering for them and look forward to every event and helping being apart of their mission.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	279250	2	/users/profile/369316	Elizabeth204	Volunteer	5	02/07/2016	I first got involved with the Brew City Bully Club a few years back.  I have been to most of their events, and stopped by most of their booths ever since.  I then became a volunteer.  I just had to work with these wonderful people, who are doing so much good!  The dedication of this group is amazing.  They are very compassionate to those who are in need of help, whether it training tips, resources such as vet care, food, etc.  If they don't have the answer, they will find out for you and steer you in the right direction.   With the reputation that pit bull type dogs have had, this group works tirelessly to educate people about the "breed". They are trying to end dogfighting by starting right at the source, educating today's youth about how wonderful and loving pit bulls are, as well as how to care for a dog in their home.   They are helping people who aren't able to pay a vet for vaccinations for their dogs, by having  low cost Pet Health Clinics.  They offer spay and neuter resources, so there are less pit bulls entering the shelters every day.  They also do rescue!  How cool is that?  This group is exactly what pt bulls need.  They actually help the community, while also doing rescue.   I will support them and volunteer until the end of my days...  LOVE the BCBC!!!
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	279238	2	/users/profile/268320	Jeff1234	Volunteer	5	02/07/2016	The Brew City Bully Club is a great organization that helps the Milwaukee area with education and advocacy for bully breed dogs. They are involved in many different programs and work very hard with local organization such as MADACC and local law enforcement agencies.The owner of the BCBC is extremely dedicated to this cause and if you choose to get involved and volunteer some of your time, you will surely be inspired by how dedicated this group is to what they believe in.Though there are some that have had negative experiences with this group, this is a small non-profit that is run mostly by volunteers. In addition, they take a very firm view on the beliefs the organization stands for. Criticism is inevitable in this arena, but make no mistake that this organization is dedicated to its causes and works very hard with the resources it has. It's been a blessing to be associated with this group.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	206024	1	/users/profile/268320	Jeff1234	Volunteer	5	07/14/2014	I have been involved with the Brew City Bully Club for around 3 years.  Our mission is to rehabilitate the reputation of "pit bull" type dogs, educate the general public and make the local communities safer.  The people who coordinate and run this organization are dedicated, passionate, and loving people.   There are several different ways that the BCBC helps fulfill it's mission.  The outreach program goes to public events to help convey clear information about these dogs to the public.  The goal here is to raise awareness about these dogs and help the communities better understand their special qualities. The BCBC also provides owner support.  There are several volunteers with lots of dog training experience that are available to answer specific questions or help your training needs.  One program offered for the public is owner support groups.  These are one  hour sessions that help you form a strong bond with your dog through training and confidence building.  If you prefer something more private, BCBC does private training also! There are many other programs that the Brew City Club offers, most of which are offered to the public at little or no cost.  I have been involved both as a volunteer and a recipient of their services and my experiences have been fantastic.

Brew City Bully Club, Inc	279118	1	/users/profile/369162	Writer	Board Member	5	02/05/2016	The BCBC has grown into an amazing organization - it FAR exceeds anything that I could've hoped for or dreamed of.  The level of dedication that our volunteers, supporters and donors display is second to none.  I've never collaborated with or seen such passionate, generous, hard working people in all my professional endeavors.  This organization is so very young to have accomplished so very much.   Yet, as a united group, they realize that the road ahead of them is long and full of difficulty.  The Brew City Bully Club operates as a family - and I'm so very proud to be part of it.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	279100	1	/users/profile/369144	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/04/2016	Brew City Bully Club is very near and dear to my heart. I grew up in a home with pit bulls and they am a huge advocate of this breed (and all bully breeds, really.) I love this organization because everything they do is for the dogs and educating our Milwaukee community. I wish they had more supporters and a larger reach, because of all the wonderful things they do, but even as small as it is -- this organization is having a HUGE, positive impact in the greater Milwaukee area. BCBC rescues dogs from MADACC, holds educational events about bully breeds in the local community, offers community outreach events with free vaccines and supplies to families that need it most for their fur babies, and many more events. Check out their site to get involved in being part of the solution: www.brewcitybullies.org

I saw little of this at BCBC. I highly recommend talking with people OUTSIDE of the "in group" of the people who  work(ed) at BCBC before getting involved or supporting them in any way.

Volunteer	5	08/24/2014	Brew City Bully Club is different from many other bully breed rescues in that they don't just stop at rescuing, fostering, and adopting. They go above and beyond by educating the public and mass media on the plight of the bullies and how we can better serve and appreciate them. I'm also a big supporter of their involvement with children, taking breed ambassadors into schools, teaching children not to judge a book by it's cover and also teaching them the importance of proper treatment and respect for animals. Way to go, BBC!!! Thank you from a bully lover, for all you do.

Without BCBC many of the dogs would meet an unfair end but since the people at BCBC work so hard for the cause, they have saved many wonderful dog lives and given joy to the people that grow to love those dogs. 
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	212159		/users/profile/275110	Janet97	General Member of the Public	5	08/24/2014	I work with another non-profit dog group (GPA-WI). We are frequently at the same events as Brew City Bully Club.  I have to say how fun and interactive this group is at these events.  They get a lot of people stopping by. I do believe they are changing many people's minds in a positive way about the breed! My breed is a pretty easy because they don't have the negative stigma. I really give credit to all the individuals who give thier time to a more misunderstood breed!  Their facebook website is also extremely well maintainted and entertaining.

Brew City Bully Club, Inc	107762		/users/profile/146320	Leah8	Donor	5	03/09/2012	I currently have 2 pit bulls who are both rescues. One was 5 weeks old and already being taught to fight (Stoli). The other was almost 5 and had lived a very undesirable life. He had "one kill" under his belt (as it was put to me) and spent time in drug houses and even lived in a van (Joker). Both of these dogs are now enjoying the good life. They have 3+ acres to run and play with each other and our other dog who is a chocolate lab. Joker is probably the most gentle soul you would meet - he is a lover and I can't imagine him hurting anything. Both are great with kids. This organization is striving to do great things, and hopefully educate a wide variety of people - from the kids who may live in an area where they have met a Joker who has killed or even a Stoli who is a fighter in training, to the people who are "afraid" of pitbulls but have never met one. Thank you!!!

They cover it all from going out of state to help rescue to local school education. They fully support all the Pittbull owners. And the one thing that I think is most important: they regularly combat the general public opinion of Pittbulls. They take the dogs out into the public streets, the schools & special programs for the public to discover how nice these dogs really are. This is called: CHANGING MINDS.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	107687	1	/users/profile/50766	jim16	Advisor	5	03/08/2012	My special field is therapy dogs.  I helped get the BCBC going with therapy dogs of their breed and they now have many.  This is a very good way to show off the natural temprament of any breed, but it is a great way to combat the public opinion of this breed.  Also, I have 52yrs. in dog training and I have never seen any dog club put forth more effort to get their breed trained and into the public eye.  I know and they know that Pit Bulls are wonderful dogs. The BCBC is the best at proving that.

They wanted to get some of their dogs into this wonderful work. I know a lot about dogs due to my 50years of experience, but I still got an education about Pit Bulls from Jeremy, Michelle & Danielle.  When I observed them with their dogs working with the children for the R.E.A.D. program, I got to see some of the best dog handling I have ever seen.

Their drive and passion for education and proper advocacy inspired me to start up my own not for profit business, and donate 80% of my profits to BCBC to support their mission.  The remainder goes to more supplies so I can continue to make cool stuff that makes a difference.  Brew City Bully Clubs pitbull university is outstanding, and their owner support programs are a godsend to any new pitbull parent.  I can't say enough great thing a about them!

Seeing them out in the community doing walks, having booths at all the local fairs and shows is awesome!! Keep up the good work. I hope to one day rescue a pup from them.

Brew City Bully Club, Inc	205881		/users/profile/268146	nickel	Volunteer	5	07/13/2014	The Brew City Bully Club is a great asset to our community.  They are willing, able, and work hard to educate everyone on pit bulls.  It is not in an "in your face" or "everyone should adopt a pit bull" type of way either.  They work to educate people on the importance of spaying and neutering your pets, they work to stop dogfighting in our area, they visit schools, they have community events such as the Meet My Bully walks held throughout the summer, and they are overall just genuinely caring people.  I felt strongly enough about this organization that I recently started volunteering with them as well.

The organization isn't asking you to go out an adopt a pitbull type dog because that isn't for everyone. BCBC is working to educate the community, reduce fear and control the population. In the process of carrying out its vision, BCBC is helping reduce dog fighting and crime. You may not love pitbulls like I do, but you can help reduce the amount pitbulls and uneducated owners in your neighborhood by donating to this organization. Unfortunately, these poor dogs over over bred, often misused and misunderstood. I received services from BCBC so that I could be a better pet owner and help reduce the population of pitbull type dogs. Keep up the great work BCBC!!

Luckily, one of my teachers was friends with Jeremy and I was introduced to BCBC. We were used to a more "low-maintenance" breed and were in desperate need of some education and guidance with our new puppy. While the end result was not what we had hoped (Nala had a mental disability and we had to put her down), I cannot thank BCBC enough for everything that they did for our family. Their extensive knowledge about the breed, training tips, and "never give up" attitude helped us tremendously. I now own a pit bull mix and am so thankful for the knowledge that I posses thanks to BCBC and I would not be a responsible owner today if it had not been for them.

They do ALL the right things! This nation needs to get back to when Pit Bulls were THE hero dog of WW1 and owned by families as 'nanny' dogs for the children, not the negative unreal picture people have of this breed now. Brew City Bully Club is 10 stars, not five!!!
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	170961		/users/profile/226443	ljw62	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2013	I think many pitbulls need a second chance.  We have a family member who volunteers there and the amazing stories we hear of recovery and adoption are wonderful.  Michele is super at public appearances to make people aware of the breed and how many dogs get the bad rap for their owners bad behavior.  If each dog could speak for itself we would understand but BCBC is their voice.  This is a great organization!  But they are in need of financial help to keep moving forward.  
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	170475		/users/profile/225868	PitLvr	Client Served	5	09/18/2013	Earlier this year we decided to adopt a pit bull.  Although we have owned them in the past this is the first we have looked to adopt.  We found BCBC and an amazing addition to our family.  He could have very easily became another sad statistic without their help. They recognized his enormous potential, worked though his health problems and gave him  second chance.  We recently attended their volunteer orientation to learn more about their organization.  We were impressed that they were realistic about the difficulties the breed and their humans face.  Their PAL (prevent a litter) program has impressive numbers for the number of years they have been around.  We look forward to supporting this organization in the future.

We were first time pit bull owners and just happened to see a flier for one of their events at Bark N Scratch pet store. Needless to say, that was 3 years ago... We've been hooked ever since! They really educated us on the breed and was a great resource. They always respond promptly to any of our questions. Michelle and the rest of the Pit Crew greet everyone with a warm welcome and make you one of the family. I cant say enough about this organization...they have a true passion for the mission!

BCBC works tirelessly to educate the public about these beautiful dogs! Only through hands on awareness, can the minds and hearts of the public be changed! As with any dog, it is the training and education of the human, that will foster the positive and loving attributes of the bully breeds. BCBC is dedicated to changing minds, and assisting pet owners with issues and training they may need. I'm so proud to be able to be a part of this awesome organization, as they work day to day with promoting pit bull awareness, education, and helping owners raise the wonderful dog that pit bulls can be! BCBC Rocks! A true ambassador of pit bull responsible pet parents!

However when I rescued my 2 pitbulls I realized the stigma that exists from non - educated folks for this dog. The media is the #1 reason people are confused about this dog . Pitbulls are the number one breed to enter shelters and the number one to be put to sleep . Labradors's are the #1 dog for bites in the USA. Having said all this I just want all breeds to be accepted and judged by the deed never the breed. I have found an outlet with similar minded people that want the exact same as me, to be able to own and love my dog as poodle owners and goldens etc.. get to . A place to educate and inform the public about this amazing breed .

Every Pit Bull I know is a real sweetheart  and I'd like others to know this. I love their gatherings and walks thru neighborhoods with their dogs to show people what great dogs they are.  I whole heartedly support their great efforts. There are no bad dogs only bad owners. We have so many sweet dogs in our neighborhood and many are Pit Bulls. The clubs help with spay and nutering is  a wonderful service too.  They are always expanding their ways to help our furry little friends, which will make our world a better place to live.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	131710		/users/profile/177287	Anahita D.	Client Served	5	10/31/2012	This is the best organization I have ever worked with.  About a year ago, I rescued a young pitbull puppy from the streets of Milwaukee.  I had absolutely no idea about how to raise a pitbull, how to teach her to interact with other dogs (I have another dog at home), and most of all, how to deal with the intense negative opinions thrown at me regarding my puppy.  I came close to giving her up not because i wanted to but because I didn't know anything about the breed and was facing the wagging tongues of so many uneducated people.  And that is when the humane society directed me to Michelle from the BCBC.  Michelle changed everything.  She gave me her cell phone number, spent hours on the phone with me teaching me all about the breed and how to care for my puppy, brought me out to pitbull events so I could meet other pits and introduce my puppy to other dogs and helped me even educate others on the breed.  What more could you ask for?  And because of her my pitbull puppy, Chole, is now the most beautiful, perfect, sweet, kind, and super loving pitbull on the planet (in my opinion!!!) I actually can't imagine life without her and it makes me cringe to think how close that reality came just because I was uneducated.  We have a pitbull problem in the USA and we need people like the BCBC helping change minds like they did with me so more people can experience the joy of having a Chole.

He sooned developed aggression towards new dogs and went after the neighbor black lab 3 times. I was sent to the brew city bully club and after attending their classes for about a year my dog hasn't gone after the neighbor dog once! They are now buddies and play together daily. If it wasn't for the brew city bully club my dog would be a threat to other dogs and a law suite waiting to happen. They have given me the confidence to work with my dog, recognize his signs of fear with other dogs, and properly introduce him to new dogs.

They came out and gave us their honest opinion on what to do. We were not judged when we chose not to follow their advise and put her down since she was a danger to everyone. They then came back out a couple times to give us advise on how to handle her and how to try to fix some of the issues more manageable. In the end, we did end up putting her down.   I then started fostering for them. I helped find homes for 3 dogs (one is now in my house to stay). I have been to bully walks, adoption events, the Ride to End Dogfighting, etc. They are really dedicated to their cause and to the dogs whose lives they touch.

General Member of the Public	5	03/08/2012	Brew City Bully Club is a wonderful organization run by an amazing woman - Michelle Serocki!  Michelle frequently goes on local news programs to spread breed awareness and dispell myths about pit bulls.  When my older dog attacked my pit bull puppy, I contacted BCBC for advice.  Even though I had adopted my pit bull from a rescue in another city, Michelle was very willing to help us find local resources to help us remediate our pack issues.  Michelle is personable and compassionate and she always has a calm, professional demeanor - despite the constant scrutiny and skepticism she and the breed face.  BCBC is having a wonderful impact on our community by helping to educate children about animal care and promoting anti-cruelty efforts.  They also are doing a great job to help owners care for their dogs properly.  Michelle and BCBC - you're an inspiration to us every day!  Thanks for all that you do! 
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	107706	1	/users/profile/146218	Jamae B.	General Member of the Public	5	03/08/2012	My fiance had the stereo typical review of Pit Bulls when we first met and I absolutely loved the breed. After moving to Racine a few years ago I was doing some internet searching and found the webpage for this organization and shared it with him, he started opening his mind a little and met a business owner here who brought his pits to the store and fell in love with the breed.    He then decided that because we loved dogs so much but really didn't want more to sign up for foster care of younger dogs if Brew City had them and with the local humane society. Jeremy is full of amazing knowledge about the breed and training techniques. He also knows how to teach with compassion and understanding and without forcing the knowledge into people who may be a tad skeptical.   Because I don't live in Milwaukee I don't get to do as much hands on volunteering as I would like, but we buy their shirts, which are so cute, and donate money for their amazing programs.          All anyone has to do is see the things Brew City has planned daily or even weekly, see the numbers for shots and spays, and look at the pictures they post of events and trainings with youth to see the impact they are having in the local communities.        Any organization that can have a mission statement with multiple points and deliver to the very best of their abilities on each point in their mission, especially in today's economy where many people may not have as much money to donate is extraordinary. Brew City Bully Club deserves more public recognition for the work they do so that more people in the areas they work in and affect can know what they do and who they are and all they have given up to our local area communities so that we can get more people behind their mission!

They get foster homes for pitbulls in need, they provide very low cost spay/neuters, they educate the public on this awesome breed and they also fight against the epidemic of dogfighting. I have seen their work firsthand with some of the youth from our inner city. These kids had no idea what to do with a pitbull except to fight it, and once they got with brew city these dogs became family. The love the owners had for  their dogs, and vice versa was so evident. I'm sure I have left out something great that they do, as there is so much, but Michelle and Jeremy are just awesome!

I have personally witnessed the results of this program and these kids and dogs are developing a fantastic bond. Michelle and Jeremy should be commended for their dedication to the dogs of our community. They are knowledgeable and don't hesitate to share that knowledge.

I have since done some fundraising for them and also have attended a few of the events that they have had. I think what they do as far as educating young people about the humane treatment of animals is amazing. I think in order to start changing peoples minds about this great breed starts with educating. The fact that they are willing to go into neighborhoods that are not the safest just to help show people that there is more to these dogs then just looking tough and fighting speaks alot about their commitment to this cause. I think it's great that there is an organization that makes people feel welcome and where you can meet other people that love the breed as much as I do.

Our dog was abandoned as a stray, and she has many fear issues with new people and new situations.  We quickly learned about the stigma that goes along with this wonderful breed.  We also learned about the cruel and inhumane things these dogs are subjected to, including dog fighting.  We were saddened by the way these dogs are over-bred for sport and profit.We first met BCBC at a Pit Bull Awareness Day event in October of 2008.  We were enthused about the steps they were taking to help Pit Bulls in our community.  We joined their bi-weekly dog group, which gave us a chance to get out and socialize our dog around other dogs.  The class is designed to help build confidence of both dogs and owners alike with an agility course, one-on-one mentoring and socialization around new people and dogs.  This exposure helped us, and our dog slowly overcame some of her fear issues.BCBC is working to curb overpopulation by encouraging residents to spay and neuter their dogs.  They are also working to educate people in the community and hosted over two dozen educational booths about responsible ownership last year.  BCBC launched the End Dog Fighting campaign in Milwaukee to address the root cause of a number of problems associated with dog fighting by educating the target community youth groups to love and respect their dogs rather than fight them.  BCBC is dedicated to changing the negative perceptions and stereotypes around this breed to build positive awareness and save lives.

They have clear goals, are well organized, and extremely efficient, resourceful and innovative. They've taken on some difficult subjects and are patient and persistent. They are a pleasure to work with and watch grow.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	50612	7	/users/profile/51133	tumbleweed	Client Served	5	08/18/2010	I learned about BCBC from my doggy daycare provider almost 2 yrs ago.  I had adopted my first dog 4 months before and was looking for additional ways to challenge her and enhance her training.  We started going to the dog groups.  She loved it! I even emailed Jeremy and Michelle one morning while I was waiting for an oil change, the mgr had let me bring my dog inside.  As I sat there inside with my calm and well behaved pitbull, it hit me that all of our hardwork in dog groups was working!  I also had in home training to work with specific issues we were having.  Jeremy took the time to listen to my concerns and walk my neighborhood with me to see the issues I was having.  He taught me how to handle her and helped me learn how to read my dog's body language.  To be able to have in home training that is so tailored to your individual needs is fantastic, and BCBC makes it affordable too!From the very first night of class, BCBC has been a group of welcoming and caring people.  It's the environment that they have developed.  We all love our pitties and we all have the same goal.... to rehabilitate the breed and reduce the fear.  No one judges a newcomer whose dog may be having some issues, but that person and dog is immediately welcomed in and given support and help to correct the problem.I don't know where I would be without BCBC, they have been a very important part of the training and confidence building of both me and my dog.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	50348	9	/users/profile/50937	kizmitt1	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2010	This non-profit organization is vital to my community. They provide much needed education on pit bull dogs in low income neighborhoods. They educate people on the harmful effects of dog fighting. Most people involved in said activity are violent criminals. They are involved drugs and other various gang related activity. They also educate people on the proper care of a dog. Many people think it is OK to just tie up a dog in their back yard, garage, or basement. This drives dogs mad and makes them frustrated,aggressive and want to attack. They also help provide low cost spay/neuter. This is vital in helping the stop of unwanted dogs who end up in the streets where agencies funded by tax dollars are sent out to catch and house these unwanted animals.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	50197	8	/users/profile/50734	kathy29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/10/2010	I have been amazed and impressed by the achievements of this group in the short time they have been around.

After our 2nd week check up they told me he would be "unadoptable" and would be put down.  I couldn't have that happen, so we brought "Buddy" home for good.  After having hime home, and knowing he had an abusive past with men, I frantically looked around to find someone to help.  My vet recommended Brew City Bullies and I have been blessed to have them work with my dog.  Buddy is lovable, kind and gentle, still has some issues with men, but with their help we have made great strides towards a happy dog.  I cannot thank Michelle and Jeremy enough for all they have done for my Buddy.  He just is over 18 months now, and every day we see vast improvement using the methods taught to us by Jeremy.   They are great people with good hearts and a sincere love of the breed.  I can honestly say they have changed my attitude towards the breed.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	50192	7	/users/profile/50730	andrea20	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/10/2010	This organization is phenomenal.  I had the pleasure of working with them first hand, from the beginning, as their lead dog trainer and it was the best expereince I've ever had.  They really know how to find the root to a problem in order to fix it, rather than putting a "bandaid" on everything.  They are so dedicated to their cause and have what it takes to implement every one of their goals.  I personally adopted a dog from them, and they were there every step of the way, on top of everything.  Very organized and passionate about what they do.

The amount of time and energy the founders put into their cause of educating people about pitbulls is in need of recognition and praise.  This group started out as a supportive family with their pet and has grown into full time organization that is planning to open a shelter in the very near future.  This club is very well organized and extremely dedicated.

This group was started by two very caring and dedicated people who are trying to change the reputation of pit bulls. The group is putting on many fundraisers and using the proceeds to help educate people about this wonderful breed of dogs. Furthermore, the founders of the club have started a fostering/adoption program to help save pit bulls from falling into the deadly trap of the fighting ring. Several dogs have already been adopted into good homes and several more are in foster care. This is a wonderful organization that is working hard to make a big difference for the pit bull breed in the Milwaukee area.

Brew City Bully Club, Inc	2129	11	/users/profile/3406	Hugo Boss	Client Served	5	12/12/2008	We cannot express enough how fortunate we are to have found Brew City Bully Club, specifically Jeremy and Michelle Serocki.  Below is our story and why Jeremy and Michelle are truly lifesavers:We rescued Hugo from an unfit home about two months ago with the intention of giving him the best life imaginable. After getting the one-year-old pup caught up on shots and meds, and getting him neutered, we found out that Pit Bulls are on our apartment complex's restricted breed list.  We decided to surrender Hugo to the Wisconsin Humane Society, knowing he would have no problem getting adopted (he is such a lover!).Although the Humane Society's website states that an evaluation of a surrendered pet takes an average of five days, we got a call less than two days later because they considered him unadoptable!!  The reasons they gave us that led to their decision:  1.) Hugo get too excited when people approach him and  2.) Hugo pulls too hard on his leash.  Unbelievable!  Thankfully, we indicated on the Surrender Contract that we would like to redeem Hugo if the Humane Society unadoptable because, according to them, Hugo would have been better off DEAD!!!!The WHS told us we had 24 hours to redeem Hugo, or they were going to put him to sleep!  Needless to say, we frantically called and e-mailed anyone and everyone in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, trying to find a rescue center with room to take in Hugo.  Just when we were about to give up hope, Mindy called a number that she got from someone during our search.  The number happened to be Jeremy and Michelle Serocki's, from Brew City Bully Club, which is right in our backyard.  After hearing this story, Jeremy told us to take Hugo to their house as soon as we got him out of the Humane Society.The next day, we picked Hugo up from the people (WHS) who thought there was no reason for him to be alive and brought him over to Jeremy and Michelle's.  We spent a little time at their home (we even got to meet Capone!), just thanking them and letting them know how much they mean to us and Hugo!  They could not have been any nicer and were more than willing to give Hugo the opportunity at life that he deserves.Since then, Hugo has been getting training and is doing wonderfully.  He is currently going for his Canine Good Citizen certification!!  Good job, Hugo!  We love you!!And we also want to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation to Jeremy and Michelle Serocki, and Brew City Bully Club, for everything they have done for us and for Hugo!!!Mindy LloydCory Noel
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	2078	10	/users/profile/3304	Ibmexubu	Client Served	5	12/08/2008	well... One day out of nowhere i literally had this dog by the name of spot thrown into my hands! I wasn't ready for this commitment! Two days later i knew for sure i didn't want him, but seeing that he was a pitbull I certainly didn't want to give him to just anyone.. I was afraid of his well being.  Time went by and I knew I had to get rid of him fast because he was growing so much.  I found out about the Brew city bully club and they were my last hope they took spot in with no hesitation and i felt so relieved because I knew he would be in good hands.  A week or two went by and i was missing spot sooo much it was heartwrenching... I fell in love with him the time he was with me, I called them back and asked what are the chances of me adopting him? And from there we went through the whole process for adoption, and i have my sweetie back! To me this is a true love story :) I can't stop thanking michelle and jeremy! Brew city bully club is the best thing that has happend for these sweet dogs in Milwaukee. My spot couldn't be sweeter he's just a very good dog truly!
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	2060	15	/users/profile/3260	Tonya	Donor	5	12/03/2008	Brew City Bully Club has done an amazing job of raising awareness, providing support and a multitude of other ressources related to Pit Bull and Bully breed issues in and around Milwaukee, WI.  In a VERY short period of time thay have initiated several programs including fostering & adoption which has successfully adopted several pit bull puppies to acceptable homes.  They have begun fundraising to help in efforts to pay for dogs to be spayed and neutered, particularly female dogs and their puppies who may have been bred accidentally or because of owners being unaware of the benefits.  And closest to my heart, they have shown initiative to determine the best way to approach fighting Breed Specific Legislation and education largely to prevent dog fighting.All in all, this is a GREAT organization of which I am very proud to being a member.  I look forward to many events to come.  Michelle and Jeremy (the founders) have truly shown wonderful initiative and sincerity in wanting to give pit bulls and bully breeds the best possible reputation through education and awareness.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	2057	13	/users/profile/3256	scott35	General Member of the Public	5	12/03/2008	This organization is the best thing that could have happened in the Milwaukee Area.

I am so glad I responded! Michelle and Jeremy are the best. I was having some behavior problems with my male and Jeremy and Andrea (the trainer) came out to my house and sat with me, and my dog to try and help him. They dont judge, they just listen and help. Even though he isnt perfect, I can see a huge improvement in his temperament and the way he listens to me. We still have a long way to go but I feel confident that with their help my dogs and I will continue to build on and improve our relationship. I enjoy the meetings we have and really look forward to the new doggy play groups we will be having. Its nice to know that I'm not alone out there and that there is someone who loves my dogs as much as I do and understands what its like to be a Pit Bull owner.

This club is devoted to the Bully Breed and educating the public to eliminate the "assumed" fear of this breed as well as the false assumptions associated with the dogs.  They focus their efforts and resources to eliminate the "backyard breeding" problem, helping place unwanted animals and raising awareness to eliminate the dog fighting rings.
Brew City Bully Club, Inc	2049	14	/users/profile/3238	andreadogcare@gmail.com	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/02/2008	I can't tell you how impressed I am with the founders of this organization.  There are a lot of "support groups" out there, there are dog play dates, there are trainers, there are rescues - I had my pick at organizations to volunteer my time to, and this was the first one that really got me to respond.  I had been advocating for dogs in general, especially the misunderstood ones - and to find a group that wanted to do just that, especially for a breed that is HORRIBLY misunderstood, I figured I could at least help with fund raising :)  I found people more passionate, and more determined than I ever imagined.  They added a "rescue" part to their mission - but they set themselves apart from all the other rescues by TRAINING the pups in the foster homes, so they have a great start to be ambassadors for the breed - I just think it's fantastic. They are going to actually do it this time - they WILL rehabilitate the reputation of this wonderful breed.

Starfish Foundation Inc	322622		/users/profile/416563	Writer	Client Served	5	02/03/2017	I am forever grateful for the Starfish Foundation Inc. and the work it allows clients to do. For myself it allowed the healing process to begin and continue.  I grew up in a highly abusive and violent environment having experienced real trauma. I have been part of the Center For Creative Learning family since my Renewal weekend in 2005. Sometimes I am the student and sometimes I am a volunteer each time pealing back a layer of the trauma. I found a safe place to process, a safe place to discover innocence and a safe place to be me. At the Center I learned a deeper personal value and worth. I am worthy of connection and have a sense of love and belonging. Because of the Starfish Foundation Inc. each time I drive the 300 miles one way, I am able to navigate my life with more love and less shame than the time before. They say a picture is wroth a thousand words, the first one represents how I felt showing up at the Center in 2005. The second represents the freedom I now feel  having done and continue to do the work that the Starfish Foundation Inc. allows it's clients to do.

Starfish Foundation Inc	298642	2	/users/profile/389533	Ellen's P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/31/2016	As founder and Chairman of the Board of Veterans for Diversity, Inc. I was involved with developing a retreat for veterans. After participating as a staff member and observer in a Healing Warrior Hearts retreat, I decided that rather recreating another retreat to offer financial support to Healing Warrior Hearts. I learned that the retreats were run by volunteers and no one received compensation from participating as staff or instructors.  A registered therapist is in attendance to handle any issues that evolve from participants attending and having additional problems beyond the scope of the retreat.  Also, I found the retreat very interactive between participants and staff keeping the classroom atmosphere to a minimum and allowing the veteran to open up and work on issues from their military service. In developing a partnership, I approached the Starfish Foundation to see if this was a feasible solution to both organizations. Because they handle multiple programs they showed me how they separated funds that are designated for each program and how funds were distributed. Knowing funds would go to where they were designated we formed a working partnership to financially support the Healing Warrior Hearts Program.Since the partnership, I have staffed and been a supervisor within the program. Members of our organization have both been participants and staff members during Healing Warrior Heart retreats. The retreats have been so effective that I have received emails and phone calls from VA staff members to learn more about how the retreats are positively impacting veterans, as veterans have been talking to them about the positive reinforcement the retreats have given them and how they feel better about their transition from military to civilian life.To a veteran or military person having issues with survivors guilt, PTSD, MST or even solving couples issues from  military service, I highly recommend Healing Warrior Hearts as a solution.

Starfish Foundation Inc	298399	3	/users/profile/389254	coffeevet	Former staff	1	07/28/2016	This charity raises funds primarily touting their work with  veterans, yet uses the bulk of their funding for scholarships at for-profit retreats that pay their founder and owner.  She then uses the participants as volunteers for future retreats.  While I do think both of these retreats have been and are helpful to many, I do find this business practice disturbing.  They do not currently have a professional therapist on staff who is guiding these experience.  While Patricia has many years doing these seminars, she is not licensed nor has any formal education for this work.  Another participant ended up stalking me, and she did not assist me in getting him to stop, and in fact invited him to participate in another retreat where there were at-risk participants who were not warned.  NOT okay.

I went into it with the intention of staffing a weekend.  Within the first few hours with the participants, I realized I was similar to them and had a need for further healing.  I decided to participate that weekend instead of staffing.  The weekend retreat was an incredible emotional release of pain that has been building up over the decades.  I learned more about myself in one weekend then I have in months of counseling. Besides the emotional healing, I was connected to an incredible support system and a fantastic mentor.  In fact, it has been two years since my retreat weekend and I continue to stay involved in Healing Warrior Hearts through volunteering at events and staffing other weekend retreats.  I am about to complete my Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology with several years of experience with trauma treatment.  This organization's work is comparable to anything I have seen!!

My husband was so far beyond skeptical i'm surprised he went. He was convinced it would be "lovey dovey hippy ish". But because we really want to make our marriage work, we decided to give it a go. I won't lie, i felt awkward & out of place at first, as did my husband. I wouldn't give anyone more than a hand shake. I did go into it with an open mind though, and was willing to go outside of my comfort zone & try things that have seemed to have helped so many people in the past. I did & said things i wouldn't have ever done or said. As did my husband. We left the weekend with a new love for each other. A more open mind, a fuller heart & hugging everyone!! It was truly amazing!Also, we had to bring out four children to the hotel with us. I had a friend that came down to provide child care, but that didn't end up working out. The staff members saw the stress we had because of how uncomfortable we felt leaving out children with the childcare we had set up. They went out of their way to watch all FOUR of our children for us for the entire weekend. Our children were in great hands. They thoroughly enjoyed their weekend as much as we did. They formed bonds just like we did. We have since received a gift from two of the people who watched them. Which truly meant so much to me. It was a small meaningful thing that reminded them of our children. They also included our children in our graduation ceremony, which was amazing. The people we met there were some of the sweetest, kindest, most supportive & most loving people i've ever met. To be surrounded by people that truly care about you, for not other reason than because they want to help you; that's a feeling unlike any other feeling in the worldI truly can not wait to attend another weekend. My husband will be attending one in just a few months & i am jealous. I also can't wait until we can staff a weekend & be the love & support for other couples like us. Please give these weekends a try. Go in with an open mind. You will truly be amazed by how it will effect you, for the better.

Having just a glimpse of how it changed her more than decades of previous resources had, I decided to give it a chance.  The Healing Warrior Hearts retreat was expertly organized and staffed by the kindest, most professional people!  Patricia and the other instructors along with the volunteer staff were incredibly attentive and insightful into what my issue was and how to help me release it!   The intro to neuroscience helped me understand that I've basically been  "checked out" for nearly 15 years, that I've been blaming myself and living with shame.  Now, I'm learning to recognize the dysfunction and depression that have been holding me back and find new ways of responding to all of that so I can enjoy life and my family while helping others do the same. Forever grateful, Dianne

I wish this program would have been available when dad returned from Viet Nam. I pray that every vet has the opportunity to experience this program. The wounds of combat affect the entire family no matter how hard you try to protect them. Healing the wound is the only way to stop the hurting.

What I found was a safe and loving environment where each veteran was allowed to take as much time as he or she needed to tell his or her story in its entirety. Then each veteran was allowed to do a piece of work to help heal one or more wounds created as a result of his or her time in service. The transformations I saw on that weekend were truly amazing.

This has changed my life and made me realize so much old habits. I got a new attitude and it's shinning bright. I got new habits and I make a difference because someone cared enough to put me back in the ocean. I may have experienced what I did, I am who I am, where I am today because of all of that. This doesn't define me anymore. Amen. 
Starfish Foundation Inc	226628	2	/users/profile/290358	AmberS	Client Served	5	10/25/2014	Until I made the decision to attend Taking It Lightly in November of 2013, I thought how I felt physically and emotionally was normal.  I was skeptical of the program, and I didn't want to share myself emotionally with a group of strangers.  I have attended many professional seminars where the mantra is "You get out of it what you put into it", not taking much away from the programs, so I didn't have high expectations of the TIL weekend.  I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG!    The Starfish Foundation's scholarship made it possible for me to attend the TIL weekend, and I have never experienced so much unconditional love and safety.  I met many wonderful people that took the journey with me, and who continue to do so to this day.  Since taking the weekend, I learned how much I do matter, and that my trust issues are not with others, but are with myself.  I was so amazed at the weekend, I also volunteered to staff a weekend the following December.  I couldn't wait to get back to new found environment of love, warmth, and safety.  I have a long road ahead of me, and I look forward to future programs and staffing opportunities that will help me grow personally and professionally. I am blessed that someone thought enough of me to return me to the sea of love by introducing me to the Starfish Foundation and The Center for Creative Learning. THE ENTIRE STARFISH FAMILY IS AMAZING!  With love and gratitude...Amber S.

It also gives me great pleasure my feelings about the STAFF OF HEALING WARRIOR HEARTS.  I attended the Wonderland Camp Retreat during September 19-22.2014.   The entire weekend was awesome to me and for me.  I never knew such a group existed; until a fellow veteran shared the benefits of attending a session with the HEALING WARRIOR HEARTS.                                                                                                                                                                          During my stay I was guided thru a series  of steps that allowed me to get in touch with my mind, spirit, soul, and heart.  I able to tell my story about my MST, PTSD, anger, anxiety, and grief that I had been carrying around on the inside of me for so long without any resolution.  I was able to freely express myself without shame, embarrasement, or judgement. This really helped me to get some clarity, relief, joy, and peace. The HEALING WARRIOR HEARTS STAFF was totally awesome!

There is not one veteran who serves our country and comes back unchanged, unsoiled, unaffected by all they see and do. Sadly there arent many resources for our vets to have such closure and an opportunity to begin and/or take another step toward integrating in society, their families, and the workforce. I'm very excited that Healing Warrior Hearts is available, free of charge, to aid our proud service men and women in gathering the pieces of the "self" and becoming whole once again.As a volunteer staff person for Healing Warrior Hearts, I am honored beyond words to be able to give back, just a little, to those who have fought and ensured our freedom. The amount of healing I've witnessed in this program is wonderfully overwhelming.... like that feeling a person may get when the room is filled with love, gratitude, joy and celebration!

The program was such a success in the changes that it made in me that I could tell and others that I had interacted with could also, some people say;" Wow this is amazing you are a changed Man". From this I have chosen and decided that Healing Warrior Hearts is to much for me to not share that I share it with all veterans combat and not. I have continued to support and participate in many weekends to support fellow veterans as they progress through their own quest/ journey, by volunteering to staff weekends and spread the word. This program has helped me to overcome so much and along that to see others also overcome many challenges that we believed were going to be impossible to get past with out the power, caring, professionalism, and excellence of all that I have met since this transformation.

It was like I was walking through life with dark glasses almost blind and after the course I had clear vision. After volunteering for a few Taking it Lightly courses I was asked by a fellow Veteran to assist with Healing Warrior Hearts and low and behold at the 11th hour I ended up being a participant in June 2014, not realizing healing is a continual process. WOW, I was even more in awe of this program. I was treated like a Princess and pampered in every way. I have never in my life felt this type of support and comraderie. Anyone who is a soldier knows it's deeper than any sorority or fraternity. It doesn't matter what ERA you served, there is a strong connection. The healing I recieved was PRICELESS. I believe that is why it's FREE, there is not a price you can put on this work. Long story short, I was so in awe of this work and felt it was what I was called to do. I have recently been elected to the Starfish Foundation's Board and was honored to assist in the very first MST(Military Sexual Trauma) Healing Weekend. Many Veterans have said they have had many programs and this weekend of healing surpasses every one of them. It's not just a relief it is truly a release! This healing is on a cellular level and heals for many generations to come. Thanks, Natalie Hayes

I was desperate to find something that could help me in my healing process. I found the Center unlikely enough during a web search  as I researched a new pediatrician (and past graduate) for my son.

It also opened my mind to new possibilities and a new community of folks who strive for similar safe spaces.

This organization has benefited me and the community in positive ways through allowing me to provide love rather than coping in negative ways.

They make it possible for military veterans, sexual abuse survivors, and others who have faced trauma in their lives to begin their healing process.  It is because of this organization that hearts are healing and the world is a safer place.  Bless all of you!

I served during the Persian Gulf War and did not realize how much I was hiding, repressing and denying from 23 years ago! It was a most powerful and enlightening weekend! I regret not having done it sooner. I will come back and staff and my goal is to bring this weekend to Dallas and have it 6 x a year. I would strongly recommend this weekend to anyone who has served, is serving and members of those women and men that have already sacrificed so much! Thank you to all the wonderful participants as we all had each other's backs and understood one another very well regardless of age difference. A huge blessing to the staff who held such a wonderful sacred space for all the particpants and made it that extra special! Thank you for your giveaway and its now time for me to step up and share the gift with other Vets that I received!

Starfish Foundation Inc	104153	1	/users/profile/139632	NavyVet	Volunteer	5	01/22/2012	I'm a peacetime vet and staffed a weekend recently. I saw a men and women treated with dignity, honor and respect the entire time. There was no politics or stance on war one way or another, it was simply a safe place where wounds could be looked at and healed. Often, it was the other participants who provided the authentic perspective so needed for another to heal their own injuries. I saw men release messages about themselves they've been carrying for 40 years. Messages about their own conduct or about "sitting it out" in some cushy assignment while others saw heat. I myself found some peace with my perspective on the military ceremony, saluting and the flag: whereas before it was just junk to me, it took on new meaning as a commonality between all veterans: wartime, peacetime, man, woman, officer, enlisted, survivor, wounded, killed. It felt good to have new messages inserted where there used to be only confusion and pain.
Starfish Foundation Inc	99706	1	/users/profile/120614	jomamma	Client Served	5	10/25/2011	I am a wife of a veteran that went through the program 3 years ago. I cannot say enough about this wonderful organization and the many volunteers that offer so much of their time and unconditional love to veterans. After the vets goes through this weekend experience, they have a graduation	 ceremony for them where family and friends are invited to come. I walked into the room prior to the ceremony and chills came over me and tears immediately came rolling down my cheek. I was filled with a wave of emotion just by entering the room as I knew something had changed. There were many times before this weekend I considered taking our children and leaving as we didn't know the husband and dad we were living with anymore. We just as everyone else had expected him to come back just the same man as when he left for Iraq. This was definitely not the case. War changes a person no matter what their role; combat or not. It was such a struggle watching this beautiful soul who is my husband turn into such a different person. I didn't know who he was anymore and struggled as I didn't want to leave and take the father away from our children even though we didn't know this person anymore. He tried to burry himself in work, college, and a huge overhaul of our home (all at the same time) to keep his mind occupied. I adapted and tried to make things as normal as I could for our family. We started seeing behaviors modeled by our children that we were seeing in him and knew something had to change. I often remember thinking..."what am I doing wrong?" He was involved with the VA and were starting to see some results from his counseling there, however there was something missing. He was realizing the same things. He discovered VJH and noticed there was a weekend coming near and it was held in the Northern Wisconsin Woods, a perfect setting for him. I am eternally grateful for the staff and instructors that weekend that gave him their expertise, support, and unconditional love. It was just the emotional healing that he needed! This gave him the tools he needed to deal with his PTSD as well as the tools he needed to be the husband and dad we knew he was. I am glad to report today that our marriage is saved, he is more of a dad than I could have ever asked for, and an amazing person to be able to share my life's journey with. Please encourage anyone you love to find the nearest program weather they are an OIF/OEF vets, Saudi, Vietnam, Korea, any vet needs to find this program. I have since had the privilege give back to staff one of these weekends, there were veterans that attended from Vietnam that were STILL holding on to guilt or shame from their tour and were able to release that. It was so amazing to me to see the look on a veteran participants face on Friday when they arrived and compare it to Sunday at the graduation ceremony...in many cases you wonder if you are looking at the same person. Incredible and by far one of the best experiences of my life to be privileged to be a part of. I am happy not only to be there to help the veteran but also to represent and help the families of these veterans that are suffering and most likely suffering silently as we were.
Starfish Foundation Inc	52072	1	/users/profile/52875	dan20	Client Served	5	09/09/2010	VJH, Vet's Journey Home, helped me to start the healing.  It opened my mind to new and exciting ventures.  I feel as though I have direction in my life, that there is a purpose for me, and that I am proud of who I have become and the accomplishments I've made.  I had to overcome many barriers and am still wrestling with I few.  I feel that VJH gave me the tools and inspiration to overcome these challenges.  I didn't realize I had so many mixed feelings bottled up within me for so many years until experiencing VJH.  It helped me to release the anger, guilt, and shame I had carried with me for so many years.  After that I felt this huge weight lifted from me and literally felt I could run a mile.  I couldn't remember the last time I felt that  good in my body, that much energy, and that much relief.  Overall, the VJH experiece, had a very deep impact on my heart of hearts and a profound effect on my psche.  I would definitely recommend this course to any vet still suffering from thier military experiences.  Yours Truly, Daniel J. Morrison
Starfish Foundation Inc	34390	1	/users/profile/35215	weilelg	Volunteer	5	04/01/2010	I attended a Veterans Journey Home retreat as a participant in Houston, TX during the spring of 2008 and it was a very helpful experience. The staff was very experienced and knowledgable about the subject matter and made me feel extremely comfortable with sharing my Vietnam experience. The staff's technique and caring they utilized was different with each veteran because each veteran had a different experience. It was gentle and understanding and I feel this helped tremendously with the healing process. It has been two years for me now and I still fall back on some of the tools that I learned at that retreat to help me deal with issues. I'm not sure how it could be improved?

I was attached to a unit that really got into the thick of America's experience with 'Nam. Things happened that I was sure I would never be able to "shake" on a mental and physical level. Being very much in-volved, my family just knew eventualy the 'Nam experiences would dull enough for us to live a normal life-but that wasn't the case for us. God allows each of us a time to heal from what-ever life has presented-for me, Vets Journey Home last Oct.'09, was my opportunity to under-stand myself. I came to know that what had happened to me was a severe case of guilt-survivor's guilt. But I was able to take it all, put it aside and know what I had carried for over 40 yrs. was a completed task-and God would say, "Well done-my faithful son." The load had been lifted and no longer would any one hold us accountable for what happened in VietNam. I can't tell you what a release that was-Vets Journey Home has changed my life.JAN.2010 - My beautiful wife and I attended as a couple the Vets Journey Home Couples Weekend & what a blessing this weekend afforded this marriage. The last 43 yrs.of PTSD and all the things I contributed to our marriage were finally gone-a fresh start & now a new rela-tionship with my "bride" makes life so new, so blessed. Our 40 yr-old son, 38 yr-old daughter & 30 yr-old second daughter have noticed a dif-ference in Mom & Dad's marriage.THANKS TO ALL who are involved in the network of Vets Journey Home. The "process" of going thru the different exercises is rough-but "nothing ventured, nothing gained". With regards to the instructors: words CANNOT describe our gratitude! The rewards are breath taking!!! I really thought my life was over-BUT NOW my life has just begun!! What an adven-ture is ahead - WOW!!!!SANDY & DEAN FULKERSON    HOUSTON, TEXAS

Starfish Foundation Inc	33672	2	/users/profile/34487	nancyt1	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	I was able to attend the Veterans Returning program with my husband.  This was the first time wives were able to attend with their spouses.  I was able to meet others with problems that sometimese seemed like I was alone trying to face.  This program was fantastic!  It helped my husband and myself face problems and really TALK and UNDERSTAND about the stresses and difficulties that were tearing our family apart.  We were helped to open up and share what was hurting us.  In that same process we were able to hear from others having similar problems and realize we are NOT alone.  There is help for us.  I hope this program will be avaliable for everyone to participate in.  I can't say enough about what a help it is.

As a civilian of "draft-able age", I saw many of my friends taken into war, and returned with deep emotional and physical wounds.  This weekend gave me some closure around my experiences.

Starfish Foundation Inc	33292	1	/users/profile/34103	dan5	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I am a 20 year retired vet. My experience with Vets Journey Home started with it's predacessor, Bamboo Bridge. I'm the guy always with his back to the wall, always vigilant, looking for the unexpected threat and a way out, or at least I used to be. Since attending that first weekend, and staffing many weekends since, my life is so much different. So much better. I can't say thank you enough.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33193	1	/users/profile/34012	cachap59	Volunteer	5	03/14/2010	I am female Army veteran and have staffed both Vets Journey Home and its predecessor, Bamboo Bridge.  Every time I staff I come away with a profound respect and awe for what other veterans have endured in both their military and civilian lives.  I have watched vets heal some of these wounds right during the weekend -- becoming lighter, happier, more at peace.  As I continue to meet veterans and active military enduring the trauma of war, and of sexual harassment and assault, I am so thankful that I have this program that I can recommend to them to help in their healing.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33181	1	/users/profile/34002	brigidbrett	Volunteer	5	03/14/2010	My role was two-fold:  I was on the staff as well as being there to observe and write about the Vets Journey Home.  I have been to other retreats/weekends for veterans and families and this was unique in many ways.  Because the group was so small -- 8 partipants and about a dozen staff members -- there was an intimacy that helped establish an atmostphere of safety and trust that is crucial if there is to be kind of opening up and healing over a short space of time. All the veterans were dealing with issues relating to trauma and therefore, so were their spouses. Patricia Clason is obviously highly skilled in her work, and it became apparent almost immediately, that the particpants were in good hands. She set the tone of safety and trust, of strong boundaries and structure from the beginning and was consistent throughout the weekend. For this community, who all struggle with trust and safety issues, this was crucial. Facilitator Judge Mattocks' skill, wisdom and compassion was evident throughout, as he helped the particpants through some difficult and painful process work.  All the staff members showed a level of caring and compassion that was palpable, and the particpants seemed to feel it throughout the weekend.  Because the process work is so intense and can be so depleting, it was very important that there be times of refueling and restoring. Mealtime was one of those times.  The food was not only delicious but was prepared with love by staff volunteers. For the veterans who have experienced the ripple effects of trauma and a sense of being betrayed and not being cared about, this was important and meaningful. Mealtime provided an opportunity for laughter and letting down, for staff and participants to get to know and enjoy each other. The weather made it difficult to have time outdoors to walk, rest and restore.  More time in the fresh air would have been good.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33170	1	/users/profile/33990	wolfie	Volunteer	5	03/14/2010	The Vet's Journey Home provides an opportunity for veterans to be welcomed home in a safe, trusting and nurturing environment. The staff of caring men and women is highly motivated and skilled to allow the participants to heal old wounds and traumas, tell their stories and feel like they are deeply connected to others who have endured similar circumstances. I have been deeply moved by the strength, honesty, courage and miraculous healing that this workshop evokes.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33136	8	/users/profile/33959	amomtomany	Volunteer	5	03/13/2010	My first staffing of VJH took place when my son was in Iraq.  I was not only able to give my time, talent, and hope to the vets, I gained so much more for myself in understanding what these wonderful soldiers face everyday of their lives after experiencing war. My son will be leaving for his 9th deployment soon.  I feel my volunteer work with VJH is a way of contributing back to the families who have sacrificed day to day life while the soldiers are deployed.  It is also a way of saying thank you to those same soldiers who have given so much and can't always find who they are after deployment until they experience the Vets Journey Home Weekend.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33132	5	/users/profile/33953	ladyvet	Volunteer	5	03/13/2010	I was a participant of one of the Vet's Journey Home Weekend's a few years ago.  It was the best thing I have ever done for myself.  I was a woman in combat in 1991 during Desert Storm.  I have a bad case of PTSD.  These people understood and helped me adjust far more than any V.A. program ever designed for us to date.  Before the weekend, I was on the verge of suicide.  Since, I have written 2 books and produced over 180 short films.  My life went from having no meaning to finding abundance.  I have continued to go back and volunteer at every possible weekend since.  I get a lot from volunteering and knowing I helped make a difference in another struggling veteran's life.There aren't enough words in the English language to sing the praises of VJH and the Starfish Foundation Inc.  Patricia Clason and Gene McMahon are wonderful healers and should be afforded every opportunity possible to keep doing the work they have dedicated themselves to by helping veterans.With the troops coming home from two wars, they provide an invaluable service.  Please help them keep healing us.

I was so impressed with the depth of their work, that I raised funds and did a documentary which they now use on their website to promote the work they do with Vets.  They have a weekend workshop which truly begins to bring soldiers back from their war/trauma and experiences by using a combination of  well orchestrated exercises-- that really take people back into their most difficult moments and then transform and re-frame the other memory with the help of the compassionate people in the room staffing.  It is deep and miraculous work.

Starfish Foundation Inc	33126	1	/users/profile/33945	petergraumann	Volunteer	5	03/13/2010	I volunteered to be a staff person at a Vet's Journey Home weekend in San Diego in 2009.  Not being a military veteran myself, I was still anxious to support the men and women who had served in the many conflicts to which our soldiers have been ordered since World War II.  My experience was positive; I was able to see how vital this type of process is for some Vets.  There were tears and many stories recounting loss, fear, regret and guilt felt by different veterans.  There was also an atmosphere of complete acceptance that allowed for healing, for moving on to the present and getting on with life.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33119	1	/users/profile/33752	iceman64	Volunteer	5	03/13/2010	After returning home from my tour in 'Nam, I stayed drunk for many years, hoping to forget. The only joy I had was through my children. I did finally quit drinkin, and the pain continued. I still had the issues, dreams and pain. It wasn't til I heard about Vets Journey Home, it was called Bamboo Bridge at that time, 1997, that I did any real work in my issues. A buddy told me about the weekend and I decided to attend. The Fridayy evening of the weekend, I got so scared of facing my demons, that I left and didn't come back that weekend. Some time passed, the pain increased and the dreams kept me from functioning in the world. I decided to face my fears and attend another Vets Journey Home weekend. This one, I saw thru. I faced the worst of my dreams, talked about it for the first time in many, many years. That weekend started me on my path to self recovery. With the help of the very concerned staff, I was taken back to 'Nam and talked about what happened. After that weekend, I still have the dreams, and they don't have the charge they had, nor do they own me any more. It has been my honor to staff many Vets Journy Home weekends. Giving back the the orginazation that, litteraly saved my life and sanity.

As a Viet Nam vet i only spoke about my war experiences to a select few, mostly other VN vets. My experience that weekend was profound and healing. Since that September day I have staffed over 30 of these weekends and each one has been exceptional. On a graduation ceremony last year we had a 3 star admiral attend who stated to the group that this work we are doing is vital and ground breaking.
Starfish Foundation Inc	33044	1	/users/profile/33870	rubentb	Client Served	4	03/12/2010	I am a disabled Vietnam Vet suffering from PTSD.  I was in the very first PTSD group in the nation.  It was in Milwaukke, WI, in 1971.  I was in a PTSD group from 1988 to 1989.  I also had many 1:1 sessons through out my life dealing with PTSD.  In 2002 I was in an in-patient, 60 day PTSD group.  I continue to be in a group for the last 3 years.  Yet I continued to carry alot of guilt, shame and sorrow that came from some experiences that occured while in Nam.  I went to a Vets Journey home weekend in October of 2009.  Through the processes and staff help I became relieved of the shame and guilt I had been carrying for the last 40 years.  It was an epiphany. I was able to forgive myself and my PTSD symptoms have decrease as did my depression.  I recommend the Vets Journey home program to any combat Vet that feels they could benefit from some intervention.  The staff are extremely kind, gentile, supportive and professional.  The staff go out of their way to make sure that the participants are in a safe environment.  AND YOU GET A REALLY COOL T-SHIRT.BREEZY BRZESKI

The facilitators and the volunteer staff demonstrate a deep appreciation for our veterans and compassionate understanding for the challenges that come with reintegration. I think having veterans give back to the program through volunteering is the greatest evidence of the powerful work that gets done with VJH.  I remain in awe of the excellence and loving atmosphere that is veteran centered.
Starfish Foundation Inc	32989	6	/users/profile/33817	hal2	Volunteer	5	03/11/2010	I was invited to participate several times before I went through this wonderful program we call Vets Journey Home.  After going through as a participant and being helped to dump 30+ years of guilt and total silence and keeping everything buried deep inside, I got to tell some other Vets and some very caring staff members my story.  It was a wonderful journey and the GREATEST welcome home I have ever recieved.  Actually it was the FIRST welcome home I ever recieved.  What a wonderful program staffed totally by Volunteers a lot of whom are Veterans themselves and have been through the program as a participant. They now want to share in this great work as a volunteer staff member to help bring any other Veteran of any branch of service and from any war or combat theatre give them all a HEALTHY, HAPPIER and more steady footing for their new life.  It also gives the Veterans family a new, more loving, sharing start.I cannot count all the blessings I got by going through the program and I now volunteer to staff any VJH home weekend that comes up.  It is always FREE for all vets.  We feel that they have already paid their price!Sincerely,Hal A. Irwin

I am going to go back as many times as they will have me.  The healing work that is done by vets and supported by staff is deep, profound, and much-needed.  The vets who attended this great weekend, which is free to vets [as VJH says, Vets have paid enough] ranged in ages from about 23 who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, to an 80 yr old who had served in Korea.  The safety and intimacy of the weekend allowed those vets to share things that they had carried silently for years about their experiences.And each was welcomed home with gratitude and joy by the staff all weekend, and by staff and visitors on Sunday.  It was a beautiful, moving experience for me.  I judge that it was even more powerful for those vets.  VJH is essential for vets to "come back" home, even decades after they left the combat zone.I have not been a part of anything that has had more impact and importance than Vets Journey Home.brad jones

I first participated in The Bamboo Bridge in May of 2002, when I finally realized that even though I had escaped my tour in Vietnam physically unscathed, I had not escaped emotionally unscathed.Bamboo Bridge helped me begin my healing journey. So I continued it by, among other things becoming a volunteer and staffing weekends to help others and continue my own healing work. Later, when Bamboo Bridge transitioned into Vets Journey Home, I made the transition as well.I have witnessed and experienced much emotional healing at VJH weekends and seen many a wounded warrior from wars as diverse as Korea and the current conflicts (as well as those in between) find a measure of peace and reconciliation with themselves and others over what they had done and what was done to them by war.I plan to continue this work as part of my healing. Beyond what I have written here, words cannot express how valuable I believe this work is for a returning veterans from humanity's wars. It needs to continue until all wounded warriors have experienced it.In the military, we have a code that includes not leaving fellow service members behind in combat zones. What many outside the society of veterans do  not realize is that this obligation remains with us till the day we die. When a brother or sister has not yet emotionally come home from her or his war, we still need to be there for them, find them, and help them to come home.

Patricia and other staff members helped me understand the depression and PTSD of the military sexual trauma I'd experienced and  started the healing process I desperately needed.To continue my healing and help others do the same, I have volunteered for many of the program's supported by Patricia and the Starfish Foundation and find them to have impeccable integrity, compassion and a true gift for helping people deal with the toughest of situations with excellence and elegance!Because of my involvement with this organization, I am finding new joy every day and the courage to live life fully!
Starfish Foundation Inc	32953	9	/users/profile/33783	vroddy	Volunteer	5	03/11/2010	As a military mental health technician with a specialty in combat psychiatry I was trained in clinical theory.  As a Veteran working in the Veterans Community I have seen how Post Traumatic Stress has affected Veterans and their familys daily lives.  Traditional interventions are often not enough.  Vets Journey Home helps Veterans reach into the body and soul of their experience to begin the healing process for themselves and their families.  It returns honor to what it means to be a Veteran.Please help support Vets Journey Home through the Starfish Foundation.Best Regards,Vera RoddyUS Air Force, 1977-1992, Cold War/Desert Shield/Desert StormBA, Psychology, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee

Starfish Foundation Inc	32830	3	/users/profile/33661	Starthrower	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	The Starfish Foundation has made it possible for us to heal deeply wounded hearts from military combat/experiences. Vets Journey Home (http://www.vetsjourneyhome.org) receives hundreds of volunteer hours from all involved and every dollar the Starfish Foundation provides goes directly to program delivery.  To hear the vets speak of their first full night's sleep in 30 years, or feeling connected to their families again, is so very rewarding and worthwhile. They were willing to give all. Thank you Starfish Foundation for making it possible for us to give back!

I have had opportunity to provide respite to parents with special needs children and it is such a blessing to find a ministry like Snappin' that serves and supports parents who are often overwhelmed with the demands and challenges of raising  specially "blessed" kids.  I am so impressed with the efforts of the founder to reach as many parents and families as possible.  I hope they  continue to grow to reach and minister to more and more families.

Snappin is a well organized ministry with a well needed focus on the needs of parents raising kids with special needs.  The ministries advocacy efforts and information sharing have helped to raise awareness on many issues.

My first experience was at a member event in which we went bowling.  Not only did my family have fun bowling amongst others but we received companionship with other families in our same situation.  I have also been blessed to attend the mothers day retreat, on the planning committee and have my daughter attend a respite event.  This last year I was involved in the Facebook book club and face to face book club which the topics, and discussion I felt blessed to have others to share my opinions and feel supported at the same time.  This organization really is helping the community rooted in the Christian faith with the needs that families like ours so desire.  I now serve on the board and plan to help with the Mother's day event this next year.  This is a special organization  for many families including ours.  They are serving in ways that no one else does!  Love Snappin!

I am a parent of 3 children with special needs and participated in a small-group book study.  It was such a positive and helpful experience, not like many of the other groups I have tried where I left feeling worse than when I arrived.

Snappin Ministries Inc	243812	3	/users/profile/330649	jenniferajanes	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	I am both a volunteer and client served, and I consider Snappin' Ministries one of the top ministries serving families of children with disabilities. They have provided support and encouragement both online, through phone calls and emails, and physically with one of their famous care baskets. Snappin' Ministries is always there when we need them, whether it's prayer support or just a listening ear we need. I don't remember what it's like not to have them at my back, and I don't want to go there again!

The best part is that the people of SNAPPIN, particularly their leader / founder Barb - are living in the trenches every day - raising a child with a disability.  They embody compassion, empathy, and encouragement.

Snappin Ministries Inc	209068	2	/users/profile/271829	Kurt R.	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	I have had a great experience with Snappin' Ministries in multiple ways and opportunities.    The one I am going to emphasize in this review is the pleasure I had working with them in one aspect of their summer picnic.     They invited me in to help them bring their picnic from an indoor concept to an outdoor concept and include adaptive water skiing.     They joined USA Water Ski to do this thoroughly and take command of the whole dynamic of doing this.      With the success they had in providing water skiing on sit skis and a few cases of stand-up skiing, there is already talk of considering this for next year. Another proverbial feather in their cap is they do everything they do, and now they have proven that they can also deliver adaptive water skiing to add yet other way that families that have a member with a disability can benefit.
Snappin Ministries Inc	209064	2	/users/profile/271832	ejkrill	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	Serving with Snappin' has been one of my most joy-filled volunteer experiences.

Snappin Ministries Inc	209062	2	/users/profile/271830	Missy15	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	We have a son with a chromosome deletion with this he has autistic tendencies so for 10 years we were living in Camerons world...never getting a break. When we moved to Wisconsin we heard of Snappin Ministries through our local church and we were pleasantly surprised at what they offered. Not only did we want to receive services....We wanted to find out how we could help serve. They provided proper training so we knew the expectation and learned how to provide an exciting time for the kiddos while the parents get a breather. Working with the other volunteers and with the kiddos has been very rewarding. We can truly understand the value of 5 minutes of normal to a family that has a child requiring special needs. I highly recommend this program to any family looking for an outlet.

By the time event actually happened, I found out that our own little baby-to-be would be one of the special ones.  Fast forward to a couple of weeks after Tobias' birth and we were already stationed at Children's Hospital so that he could be treated for a respiratory illness.  Snappin' Ministries sent a care package to our home that provided not only gift cards to various businesses, but also some toiletries and other items.  Tangible and practical love was given through that package, and with no family living near us, we truly felt like the care package was a hug from above!

Snappin Ministries has helped our family through a few crisis situations and most importantly, day to day troubles. They have provided us with friendship and spiritual leadership. The family events they hold are wonderful. Our children are able to be around other families with special needs. It is so nice to be able to talk with other parents and share our challenges and celebrations. It is one of the few times we can relax and let our children be children without being judged by others.

Snappin Ministries Inc	198568	2	/users/profile/259311	tnurse17	Volunteer	4	04/22/2014	My husband and I have volunteered with Snappin Ministries several times this last year, the events are very well organized to give the parent of a child with special needs time to not worry about the care of their child. They can be assured they are in good care with the volunteers. As a mother of a 15 year old daughter I know the anxieties being able to have a night out and would have loved to have that as my daughter was growing up. Now she joins us volunteering at times and loves doing that. I truly enjoy this program and will continue to volunteer when I am able and in any other ways I can support Snappin Ministires. Sincerely Tammy Ligman

This non-profit has a huge heart and a reach far greater than than their budget indicates. Volunteers give of time and talents to provide quarterly respite and family fun events in Wisconsin. They also send gift baskets to families around the country, provide awareness of special needs resources via social media and encouragement via their top notch blog. They also train parents of kids with special needs to mentor other parents with special needs to reduce isolation and build connections for families. Snappin' truly is a great non-profit.

In both capacities, Barb has been a woman of vision with a deep desire to meet the practical and spiritual needs of parents of kids with special needs. Her efforts on their behalf are tireless, even as she cares for her own children, two of whom have special needs. Barb has created an organization that meets parents where they are at and connects them to resources and groups able to ease their burden and give them hope. Being part of Snappin' as a board member is an exciting and fulfilling endeavor.

As a leader trying to kick start churches in my area to recognize and act on this issue, I have come to cherish the leader articles on their website/Face book.   They have a unique combination of personal sharing that I can relate to, but also provide exceptional practical tools for all who work in this ministry area.  As I do not have a child with special need myself, I value the insight this group provides, so that I may better serve those around me.

Snappin Ministries Inc	165875	2	/users/profile/220375	Deborah68	Client Served	5	08/22/2013	Snappin' Ministry has been a great and valuable resource to my family and I several times in the couple of years we've known about it. Here are two instances that I hold on to dearly: In 2011 I received a care basket full of items like gift cards, lotion, a candle and inspirational/encouraging literature. It came at a great time when my family and I were experiencing a great waiting period about our living situation. It really was exactly what we needed in our special needs journey to help us remember God was in control and was taking care of us at the time like He always has and always will. Recently in 2013 I received another care basket from Snappin' Ministry after I posted a facebook status update expressing my frustration with the special needs journey my husband and I are on with our daughter, Aria. I really didn't want to be up before dawn preparing life sustaining medication for Aria and I was overwhelmed and frustrated about doing again for over 9 years straight. Barb Dittrich read my plea and responded with kind and encouraging words in a private facebook message and again a few days later with a care basket full of familiar goodies. It's so wonderful to know that there are people in a ministry hundreds of miles away from us that are there to pray for us and encourage us on this journey that is also familiar to them. We are so grateful for Barb and all those that help to make Snappin' Ministry possible. Families like mine can always make it another day because of them.

I have a wonderful mentor and friend who has selflessly guided me along this journey and carefully brought me little nuggets of her experience and guidance that she learned along the way....priceless! Our family feels so loved by this organization that says you are important and you matter and "we get it."  Although each special needs parent has a unique journey, there are just longings and heart cries that resonant the same desires and needs for all our children.

Snappin Ministries Inc	156068	1	/users/profile/207076	AmyDunaway	Volunteer	5	04/24/2013	I have worked with Barb of Snappin' Ministries for almost two years.  Barb has helped me to grow in special needs ministry leadership skills which  will allow me to better assist the families in my region of the country.  I am also part of the Snappin' Ministries mentor development program which trains mentors to support special needs parents. This type of ministry is quite unique.  The needs of families who have children with special needs often have needs which go unmet.   Barb works tirelessly to reach, teach and encourage others in ministry even as she deals with the special needs of her own children.  With innovations in social media, Snappin' Ministries has reached others nation-wide.  It has the potential to have  world-wide impact as a unique ministry to parents by parents who share in the journey as parents of children with special needs.  As a parent of two children with special needs, I know how difficult the journey can be and just how important this ministry to families such as mine.  Snappin' Ministries is working diligently to fill a void too long unnoticed serving the "least of these."

Through some of the most dedicated volunteers out there, parents of children with special needs are served in unique ways.  Most recently, the organization launched a faith-based parent mentor program that is one-of-a-kind in the nation.  Parents can meet with their mentor right from their own home, no matter where they are in the country.  A new smart phone app is also being launched to assist parents whether they're at home, in a doctor's office or at a hospital.  People with skills ranging from having a love for children, to graphic artists, to licensed professionals make this all happen.  What an organization!

Barb Dittrich jumped right in with a short, simple financial aid application, which the mom completed, and in a very short time, the family had received some financial assistance from SNAPPIN MINISTRIES, and the child could continue his therapy with us.

This is so needed and so important. As a mom, a caregiver and a registered nurse, a ministry such as this is a blessing to so many in such a specific way. keep it up! We love you! 
Snappin Ministries Inc	55896		/users/profile/41869	chelseamb	Donor	4	10/29/2010	SNAPPIN' Ministries is so much more than a charity. It's a ray of sunshine on a dark, stormy day. It's a glimpse of hope when a family is in despair. It's a kiss from heaven during someone's hell on earth. As a mother of two kids with special needs, a donor to this worthy nonprofit, a friend to another mom who received a basket, and a grateful recipient of a Mother's Day spa treatment. I heartily endorse this work.
Snappin Ministries Inc	55893		/users/profile/58150	steve	Volunteer	5	10/29/2010	I have worked with this group from day one. I keep working with them because when I see the people Snappin serves, it gives me the perspective I need to know that my situation pales in comparison to the needs of others. Snappin has showed me the fact that it is a blessing to give. I have seen the look of gratitude when a family recieves a gift basket, a meal dropped off, or just the acknowledgement that someone actually cares. When raising a special need child, Snappin sees that it is not just the child that needs special care, the parents are also in need of some support. This ministry lets me know that someone else understands how difficult is is to be the parent of one of these prscious children. 
Snappin Ministries Inc	55860		/users/profile/58107	mbberns	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2010	I have seen Snappin' Ministies grow from a grass roots effort to an organization that soley seeks to help the families of special needs children.

Snappin Ministries Inc	55768		/users/profile/57997	Talking is Golden	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	Again and again I have seen this nonprofit reach out to parents that are struggling and offer help and hope.  They offer aid to families suffering through all sorts of disabilities, physical and emotional.  They "get" all the areas where parenting a special needs child is hard -- the financial issues, the loneliness, the fear, and the isolation.  They have programs for respite, and programs for helping families in crisis obtain needed medical services when finances would otherwise cancel them.  This isn't an institution -- it's a group of caring individuals that have come together to offer what they can, and what they can is an awful lot.

Snappin Ministries Inc	55471		/users/profile/57620	FroggyPrinceMom	Client Served	5	10/26/2010	Snappin' Ministries is a wonderful organization that is always striving to help meet the needs and lift the spirits of struggling special needs families, whether that is through formal acts of the non-for-profit, or through all the personal kindnesses on the side that Barb Dittrich, who runs things, can fit into her own life, on behalf of others.  Never satisfied with what she, or the organization is already doing, there is a commendable aspiration to find new, better and more ways to reach out to anyone who needs an understanding and supportive hand.What makes Snappin' Ministries stand out even more to me is not just what they do, but how they do it.  They are a faith-inspired organization, but they share their faith without ever imposing it.  They do not ask what you believe, or pressure you to believe what they do.  They simply act to their best conscience, and hope their example, directly or indirectly, benefits you.  There is no judgment before or after rendering of services.  Accepting charity can be touchy enough for most people who need it, without bringing in religious guilt, so that this organization gives religiously -- literally -- without forcing anyone to accept strings that might be hard for them to swallow is something that really sets them apart.

I had a local problem school/religion issue that they helped clarify and I am now working on another, "In God We Trust" that showed up on my city's police cars this month.  I lived through a religious over throw of a government and am acutely aware of the danger of religious dogma in large letters over our law enforcement cars.  The most important thing the FFRF does for me is let me know that I am not alone out here.  Smart, sharp organized people are working hard helping anyone who wants to stand up.

FFRF remains a presence here countering the religious zealots that poison ideas like live and let live. Schools are scrutinized and people like Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church were met with a huge protest where FFRF was definitely in evidence.

Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319226	1	/users/profile/410598	Aunt-Buzz	Donor	5	11/20/2016	     I've been a member of The Freedom From Religion Foundation since January of 1983. Right from the beginning I knew I had found a "home"; a place where I could be open about my atheism.      Living in a small community of mostly white Christian conservatives; the same village I had been born into, I thought nobody else in the world was a non-believer --- until I started college! Imagine my relief to find a copy of a humanist magazine in the college library one day, discovering that there were at least tens of thousands of folks like me!           Today I live in a rural Amish area. I feel more at home here than I ever did in the community in which I was raised. These folks are very religious, but not one of them has ever proselytized or made me feel unwelcome. If all Christians were as Christian as my Amish neighbors, what a wonderful world this would be. (Thank you, Sam Cooke.)     The day my copy of the FFRF's "Freethought Today" newspaper arrives is usually the brightest day of the month for me, and I read it cover to cover the day it hits my mailbox.

FFRF achieves this daunting objective with a small, but dedicated legal and administrative staff.  Their work is critical to the future of religious freedom in this country.  They handle thousands of constitutional violations.  Their success rate is astonishing.  FFRF a key player in preventing the United States from turning into an oppressive theocracy.

Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319177	1	/users/profile/410537	Catherine95	Donor	5	11/18/2016	Tireless efforts to separate church from state at every level of civic life and for all Americans. Defender of free-thought and free-thinkers from the state-supported religion. Funding of legal defense and political action in support of people and groups discriminated against by religion using the power of government to enforce their religious beliefs and traditions over all others onto the citizenry using all taxpayer dollars to do it. Proponents of free thought (including atheism, agnosticism and skeptics) over religious dogma as the the way to maintain true freedom from tyranny. 
Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319176	1	/users/profile/410536	glennxyzallen	General Member of the Public	1	11/18/2016	Seems as if a typical religion wanting to pray before Congress and proselytize for their beliefs. Mischaracterize U.S. Constitution as "Godless" even though several founders wrote letters indicating United States would only last as long as the people remained God-fearing. Are an extreme, left-leaning, liberal, now so-called progressive political movement. Seems as if their religion is subsumed into their liberal/progressive/dishonest/immoral political agenda. Fundamentally dishonest people. I thought they would be intellectually honest.

FFRF!I live in a Sr. Residence. In 2008 I started  a group, "ATHEISTS ANONYMOUS".  GREAT speaker every month for 3 years. Every religion, Non religion, Atheists, well represented. Pushing 90 now (in 1 and 1/2 years), and not up to the difficult work of finding TOP SPEAKERS. The only kind I want.16 at the 1st meeting. Standing room only 1/2 way into the sessions. PBCS filmed us, showed us on TV.  Another Channel filmed us as well. IT WAS NOT EASY! In trouble from the beginning with the 'Powers That Be' here.  Andrew Seidel was instrumental in keeping the 'course' going.Many calls from all over (Paris, etc.) Letters from Atheists stating that they would love to come to a THINKING Sr. residence. "Up to now, I thought Sr. Residences were all faith based religious entities. Thank you".FFRF is a necessary and needed organization.  Into my 8th year here. Have run out of money.Social Security doesn't go up, but the monthly here does. I KNOW a book of my crazy life would be a best seller.....My friend, Gore Vidal could have helped me. He certainly gave my friend, Scottie Bowers a boost for his book, "Full Service". Best seller NYTIMES many weeks.ANY of you folks out there, wondering where to GIVE/leave $$$$$$.....FFRF! You couldn't find a more worthy cause ANYWHERE! Love,Brigit Clarke-Smith

By joining FFRF, I no longer feel alone.  I am relieved to put my faith in science instead of in faith, and relieved to be free of the terror imposed by the religious.  It is enlightening to rely on reason and to trust in the glory of nature, free of superstition.  This organization is well run, very informative, and is peopled by a host of brilliant pragmatists & idealists alike.  I highly recommend joining FFRF.  It is a bulwark between government & church, protecting our precious constitution from theocrats. Thanks!

The FFRF fills an educational service long overlooked.Individuals have, over time, exposed the evil found in all religions, but I am unaware of any organization, other than the FFRF, whose purpose is to inform all of the rank conduct of religious sects. It's work is vital. The execution of its goal is flawless. Judge (ret.) Dennis DePorter, Illinois

It continues to educate everyone about the fact that we were founded as a secular nation and FFRF and its members will continue to keep that "wall" stranding despite the constant bombardment from those who would make this country into a theocracy.
Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319142	1	/users/profile/410499	ProChoiceLiberalAtheist	Donor	5	11/18/2016	FFRF works hard to protect the separation of state and church.  I've supported this group for years, and not only do they help out students in school districts, or adults with city council prayer concerns, or stop restaurant church bulletin discounts which discriminate against those who don't attend a church, but they have different campaigns on a secular donation page so people can help others in need without any religious component.

Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319140	2	/users/profile/410497	Teresa103	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2016	Last year I joined the local chapter of the FFRF because I believe that church and state should remain separate.  We are deep in a fight against Islamism (the merging of Islam with government) and we must guard against falling victim to Christianism here.  Religion has incited more horrific violence and nasty judgemental dogma than any other belief system, and I belief the best future for humanity is in learning how to be moral based on science and reason, instead of having to believe in some chastising deity.  The FFRF has a terrific team of lawyers that assist when people are ready to bring charges based on the Establishment Clause of the constitution, and they are looking out for our free speech rights.  In the days to come when right wing Christians are running both houses and the executive branch of our government, we can expect agnosticism, atheism, and secular humanism to be attacked while Christianism will be enshrined.  FFRF has their work cut out for them and they can use all the support that you can give.This photo shows a status of Jesus on public land that stands still in spite of the FFRF's efforts.  Just two days ago I heard a story about a woman who works for the state in Swain County NC whose entire department has a prayer session at 10am every work day.  If she chooses not to pray, she does not get a break but is expected to continue working.  This kind of institutionalized religion violates labor laws and the constitution,  yet it is pervasive.  To the degree that we can bring our workplaces and public spaces into non-religious behavior, we will have a civilization nation that respects all its citizens.

Freedom From Religion, Inc.	319138	2	/users/profile/148330	S Moritz	Board Member	5	11/18/2016	I was a member of FFRF for 10 years before I became a board member this year.  I have always been impressed with the total dedication of the co-presidents, Annie Laurie Gaylor and Dan Barker, and the staff.  No one works harder to educate about, and affirm the constitutional separation of church and state.  No violation is too small to escape FFRF's notice, and they have a very good track record in getting violators to see the error of their ways.  The Legal Department is kept very busy and their work is likely to increase under the new administration.  This organization continues to be one of the major players in the First Amendment arena.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting to keep religion out of all levels of government.  Request a free copy of their newsletter at ffrf.org and see for yourself.

They actively involve local free-thinkers as well, so the organization is not monolithic or exclusive. They dedicate themselves to preserving fundamental freedoms and educating the public about those freedoms and their frequent violations. These are tasks that I wish I could do myself, but cannot, for practical reasons. I'm glad FFRF fights for what I believe in on my behalf. They do a fantastic job, and when I have my millions, I will fund them much more substantially than I can now.

With a strong emphasis on education, they strive to help the people obtain new skills (and the equipment to do it) to be able to better their standard of living, and, in turn, help others. They often will learn a new skill themselves before traveling to Nicaragua to pass it on. They travel with suitcases full of donated goods - from renovated computers to sports equipment.

I first learned of this group on a local TV news story and it caught my attention because I was already planning a trip to Nicaragua. I soon learned of the organizations benefits for the many peoples in Nicaragua. In Wisconsin many donated items are packaged up and prepared for transit in shipping containers. These are shipped via US Armed Services at no cost to a port near Nicaragua. Once received, the items are distributed out to the many different learning centers all over the country. The neat part is they are used to educate and inspire others to better themselves, not just a gift that might not get used. When I was in Nicaragua, I helped with some learning centers and helped build a new cook stove for a Managua School. A great organization with amazing people in both countries working together to make a difference for so many.

I have had nothing but positive experiences with the Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas!
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298304		/users/profile/389149	Juan24	Volunteer	5	07/27/2016	Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners of America is a seed of hope and progress. I personally have seen the positive impact that Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners have done in rural community of Nicaragua. Llano Largo is an example of a new growing community where a sewing project is starting changing the live of many young women by giving them the opportunity of learn a craft that will help them to improve their live style. Through my experience of working with Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners, I have learned the great value of doing volunteer work. Giving back to the community is a generous work to do. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298234		/users/profile/389080	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	This is a very dedicated group of volunteers, who always seem to go an extra step to solve problems they face in Nicaragua.  Whether the work is done here or in Nicaragua, it is always done on a person to person basis, working with the people in need, not a bureaucratic agency.

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298216		/users/profile/389062	Writer	Donor	5	07/26/2016	I recently donated some items for this agency and attended their warehouse when they were packing items being sent to the Nicaragua.  I was impressed with the enthusiasm of the volunteers who assisted that day, the number of volunteers, and really impressed with the amount and quality of items being donated.  Our community has rallied around this project, and it was refreshing to see how the items directly benefit the communities and people in Nicaragua.  The agency keeps volunteers and the community well informed via newsletters.  One can feel the  energy of the group once involved and the agency is making a difference in the lives of the people it helps. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298190		/users/profile/389034	eddyg	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/26/2016	The Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas work countless hours to help the people of Nicaragua.  They collect thousands of items, backpacks for students, hospital equipment used to save lives, sports equipment used to build teamwork.  Firefighting equipment used to save villages and lives.  Not only do they supply the equipment, but many volunteers go to teach and help the people of Nicaragua lead better lives.  The Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners Group of Volunteers is a true inspiration to many and is a prime example of what giving is all about.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298184	1	/users/profile/389027	madge-e	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	In the small town of Stevens Point, everything seems to be connected.   We help each other and use our resources to make things better.  We believe in a "helping hand" to aid independence.  And that is true for our outreach programs as well.I have worked during the "packing days" for the Friends of Nicaragua Project and have been truly humbled by the generosity and commitment that this organization Instills. Whether it is the old pump organ that will provide music to a church service or the beds for children or the 10lbs of assorted nails and screws that were sorted and will be used to build and repair or the 40 yards of material that will be made into children's dresses,  there is an identified need for everything .  I have never seen such commitment or such efficiency in the transfer of materials.  As Director, Amy Wiza is a wonder.  Enough said.  Bob Bowen drives a mean fork lift.  Enough said.  This organization channels an amazing amount of necessary support to Nicaragua and does so with an emphasis on volunteerism .  All in all, it is an organization to support with great pride.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298137		/users/profile/168247	laweb	Board Member	5	07/26/2016	I have been involved as a volunteer in W/NP for over 20 years. As a retired educator, I am impressed with the W/NP programs that help students continue their education and become future leaders of their community. W/NP learning center programs are empowering women to learn skills for self-sustainability. This wonderful organization celebrated its 50th anniversary in November. W/NP has made a difference in the lives of many both in Nicaragua and Wisconsin. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	123570	1	/users/profile/168247	laweb	Board Member	5	09/27/2012	W/NP has had a huge impact on my life. I became involved in 1994 and have had opportunities to work with interesting people in Nicaragua and Wisconsin. Through different projects I have acquired knowledge in many areas from square meter gardens to cheese making. As an educator, I became involved in the youth projects. My life has become richer thanks to the school children I have met and come to love. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	298130		/users/profile/327140	Betty42	Board Member	5	07/26/2016	 I am a volunteer for Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners. In particular I like working with the programs that are related to children. It is important to know that some Nicaraguan  children are without school supplies or decent housing  that we take for granted here in the US.We support the backpack project that provide school supplies for children. The stove project not only provides a safer cooking environment but reduces the amount of smoke inhalation by venting The cooking smoke outside the home. This reduces the risk of respiratory problems for all the family members.I am proud to be associated with this organization.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	241042	1	/users/profile/327140	Betty42	Board Member	5	04/12/2015	I recently traveled on a Learning Center Trek to Nicaragua organized through Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners. Each of us paid our own way to have the opportunity of visiting some of the Learning Centers and visit and the very beautiful county of Nicaragua. I have often witnessed people in Wisconsin donating their time, talent and money to this organization. I was pleased and humbled to witness the same dedication from people in Nicaragua. For example there is a widow outside of Managua who opens her own home as a lending library. The library is only a bookshelf full of donated books but it is a library where there was none! She also holds sewing classes on the porch where there are four treadle sewing machines. Plus she sponsors an English teacher to come into her house to teach English to adult and child classes. And there is the doctor and her pharmacist husband who recognized there wasn't a school for the children in their community...so they opened a school.  Not only do they provide the opportunity for learning but they provide meals that are cooked over an open fire. At the centers my fellow travelers and I had the fun of interacting with Nicaraguans by holding several classes that ranged from sewing to first aid and re-cycling bottles to yoga. We found that people traveled a long way to attend the classes and were very patient with my stumbling attempts to use Spanish correctly. Nicaragua is a country of great contrasts from the beautiful ocean beaches to old cathedral that remains closed after the horrific earthquake in 1972.  From the stunning volcanic summits to the poverty of a home made of branches and black plastic tarp. I am grateful that Wisconsin Nicaraguan Partners have provided me the opportunity to be a part of the organization to help the wonderful people of Nicaragua.

Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	I enjoy helping collect items to benefit the people of Nicaragua as they work to improve their living conditions and their ability to provide for themselves. Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners has  provided my students with information regarding their projects in Nicaragua on several occasions. I am most impressed with the excellent organization of donations and development of beneficial projects.

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	124425		/users/profile/169270	fran nelson	Volunteer	5	10/03/2012	Wiconsin-Nicaragua Partners is organized and managed from Stevens Point to allow all the partner cities to develop their own programs, funding projects, local Nicaragua projects and support activities such as collecting and shipping materials, supplies etc that are needed in each of the partner cities.  The overall leadership is vital to provide input from each partner city leadership including the local Nicaragua leaders and to collect and ship the tons of supplies needed in each area.  It allows for an appreciation of the big picture and the requirements of the government and villages as well as locally lead and implemented projects.  The progress among the families of Las Lagunas is only a single example of the good that a small, well organized and committed group can accomplish with year round planning and onsite visits 1-2 x a year.  Education through scholarships has allowed many students to progress from grade 6-high school and others to receive vocational and university education.  Many villagers learn and produce crafts in the learning center and library.  The health clinic is becoming a reality.  The village has a baseball team, new projects in planting, agriculture, water quality and many others are in planning stages.  This is a top organization with the power to bring change person to person while respecting the autonomy of the village and country.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	296160	1	/users/profile/267471	Lisa362	Board Member	5	07/13/2016	The Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners volunteers care passionately about the people of Nicaragua. These volunteers also work tirelessly to help improve the quality of life for Nicaraguans.  This people to people exchange of time and talent builds community here in Wisconsin and in Nicaragua. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	205328	1	/users/profile/267471	Lisa362	Volunteer	5	07/07/2014	The W/NP organization is full of passionate, hard working staff and volunteers who feel a bond to a beautiful country and its people.  I have traveled three times on the Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners Learning Center Treks and I'm always impressed how hard the staff work to guarantee an amazing experience. During the Learning Center Treks we offer workshops to teach skills to Nicaraguan women.  These skills are proven to help empower women who have little opportunities in a very impoverished country.  The experiences I've had have opened my eyes to the challenges that many third world countries face.  I truly enojy returning each year to Nicaragua to see friends that I have made while visiting.  
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	295936	1	/users/profile/386707	CathyE	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	I have been a member of Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners over 20 years and have traveled to Nicaragua several times. The reason I support this organization is because donations of money go directly to learning centers, lending libraries, schools, scholarships and numerous other projects. Donations of materials go directly to enhance projects in the learning centers and communities. Donations of time toward the organization in Wisconsin and by those who travel to Nicaragua directly benefit individuals, families and communities. The connections and mutual sharing between the people of Wisconsin and Nicaragua are inspirational and demonstrate the good that can come from people working together. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	253353	2	/users/profile/267616	Patti38	Volunteer	5	08/19/2015	I attended the last Quarterly meeting held in Stevens Point, WI and again was very impressed with the continuing connections between the people of Wisconsin and the many people in Nicaragua and the excellent meeting format with continuing updates on projects discussed in previous meetings. I cannot say enough about my admiration and respect for the very real personal impact this vibrant, active organization has on both Partners. Wi/Nic Partners will celebrate their 50 Year Anniversary in November 2015. I recently upgraded my status to LIFE Member by paying a one time amount of $500, because I realized I consider myself a member for life and needed to act on this. I challenge other members to take that step and become LIFE Members. My challenge to all involved is to have LIFE Membership grow by at least 50 to start our next 50 years!
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	205448		/users/profile/267616	Patti38	Volunteer	5	07/08/2014	I have been involved with Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners for quite some time. I worked with the Rotary Club of Stevens Point on a very successful  preschool remodeling in 2008-2009, but was unable to travel there until 2013. I returned again this spring for my 2nd Learning Center Trek. I am very impressed with coordination, cooperation and the friendly emphasis on people to people exchange. The trip is in part volunteering--teaching a skill at a gathering in three different Learning Centers, part touring, but very up close and personal that does not happen on "vacation" travel. Many people have commented on the professionalism of the staff and the proven track record of the organization. All those things are very true, but what has impressed me is the willingness of many, many Nicaraguans to help out their community members. The Burn Dressing program is an outstanding example of this. Volunteers fixing machines, sewing the precise very necessary dressings and expanding to meet community needs along with a committed doctor who oversees this program and speaks glowingly about the service for his patients. While there, we heard from a young woman who very bravely shared her story. This is truly an organization that encourages involvement on whatever level you are interested or able and accomplishes amazing small and major projects. It is an outstanding example of Wisconsinites and Nicaraguans connecting in meaningful ways to make all of our lives better. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	249596	1	/users/profile/337424	Nancy Jo P.	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	Several years ago,  the Altrusa  club sponsored a sewing room shower for the Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners,  on a Make a Difference Day.  Soon thereafter, a volunteer from the organization  spoke at a meeting to inform us of the program and its  services, and the club annually made a financial donation, for books for the children's libraries.I personally celebrated a friend  and my birthdays  by providing fund for a student's tuition.  This winter I traveled to Nicaragua  with theWNP on a learning center tour.  In my more than 50 years of international travel,  I have never had such an incredible trip. I was very impressed with the programs provided to the local folks, and the focus on their identifing their local needs.The warmth of the people made the trip a joy.  
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248728	1	/users/profile/336491	JessicaGS	Volunteer	5	07/17/2015	I traveled with W/NP on a medical trip before I started a master's program in international health. I wanted to make sure I was getting into the right field, and this trip confirmed and enhanced my interest. We talked to professionals from a number of different types of medical facilities in various cities, and I was able to see firsthand the challenges of providing care in resource poor settings. I later traveled to Kenya for a master's practicum and engaged in similar activities in that portion of the world (except that time I got credit for my work . . . and had to pay a lot more money for the trip). Some of the other students in Kenya were shocked by the conditions of their medical facilities. but I had seen similar issues in the clinics and hospitals in Nicaragua and was able to compare and contrast the challenges among settings. The trip with W/NP was of the same quality as my practicum and gave me additional experience, which has aided me in my career. (I now work with an international medical organization.)
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248727	1	/users/profile/336490	FNelson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/17/2015	My husband and I are retired health professionals with 4 year opportunity to support our local fund raising and public awareness efforts on behalf of families and organizations in Nicaragua.  We have traveled to Nicaragua each year to fulfill projects we develop with other members, donors and volunteers.  Each year the projects build on previous activities designed to teach women, children and families to build self-sufficiency, obtain better health and health care,  pursue education, network with other organizations and pursue a commitment to themselves, their family and their community.  We welcomed a Managua plastic surgeon and WNP Nicaragua staff to Wisconsin to learn about treatment of burns here (including hyperbaric chamber treatment) and learn about resources and support to continue a unique project of sewing and fitting compression dressings to help burn patients heal with less scarring.  This is the only free program of its kind in Nicaragua and is managed by WNP donations of materials, space and Nica Volunteer seamstresses to work with medical oversight to serve burn patients from all over Nicaragua.  There are many projects and fund raising all year to bring real help and to involve our members, volunteers and local schools, businesses and organizations into this work.   Our Appleton group is very proud to develop our local resources and volunteers and to support and enjoy the expertise of the statewide central office.  The coordination of full time staff and volunteers and staff both here and in Nicaragua makes this a unique and very successful ongoing and amazing effort.  
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248618		/users/profile/336372	rwolensky	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc., had done an outstanding connecting the people of Nicaragua with the people of Wisconsin.  I have been a member of WNP for many years and have traveled to Nicaragua to see first-hand the organization's tremendous work.  From Learning Centers, to Sewing Centers, to Libraries, to Farmer-to-Farmer, Eyeglasses--through these and other projects WNP has made a difference in the lives of thousands of Nicaraguans.  The programs have been in addition to the millions of tons of goods that have been shipped from Stevens Point to Managua, and then on to numerous cities and towns.   The organization is very well run by Amy Wiza, the executive director, and by the board of directors.  These are among the most dedicated humanitarians I have ever met.  They have been in it for the long-run, and they have put everything into it.   It is one of the outstanding voluntary organizations in Wisconsin and the U.S., in my opinion.  
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248606		/users/profile/336354	Pierre2	Volunteer	5	07/15/2015	I've been to Nicaragua twice while volunteering for Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas. The organization  has made itself felt throughout the country. I  remember drinking coffee one morning in San Juan del Sur, having traveled there because of unrest in Managua during the national elections. As I sat at a table outside the restaurant a fire engine came racing down the street, siren screaming,  on the way to a fire. On the side of the old un-repainted engine was the name of a Wisconsin town. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248518	1	/users/profile/336250	hshiralipour	Volunteer	5	07/15/2015	Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners rocks! This nonprofit is powered by an incredibly generous, selfless group of volunteers in both Wisconsin and Nicaragua that work incredibly hard to make a huge difference in people's lives and the environment! I have been a personal witness to this work, which has gone on for decades with little fanfare or spotlight. I worked along volunteers in Nicaragua on environmental issues and hosted several Nicaraguans in my home. Many volunteers in both countries have become close friends -- and influenced my career choices. Financial contributions to Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners (in addition to volunteer work) are absolutely one of very best investments that individuals can make. Few dollars are spent on overhead and PR so donations go far and help accomplish so much good. Becoming involved in this nonprofit is addictive. Once you get to know the heartwarming individuals in WNP and learn about all the good things accomplished, you will never want to quit!! Kudos to the large corps of very dedicated volunteers who make such a meaningful difference. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248494	1	/users/profile/267537	Pattycray	Volunteer	5	07/14/2015	During the past three years, I have had the pleasure of being involved with the W/NP Lending Libraries Program.  A few months ago, Amy Wiza assisted me in negotiating a deal with Scholastic, Inc. to purchase Spanish books for children in Nicaragua for half price.  It has always been my desire to help young people, especially in a developing country, to enjoy reading and expand their learning interests.  W/NP has aided me in fulfilling this goal.  Amy and her staff of volunteers transport the books that I buy to Nicaragua.  So far, I have been able to donate 308 books.  Also, Amy emails me pictures of the children reading the books.  Seeing the smiles on their faces warms my heart and makes me proud to be a part of this wonderful, humanitarian organization.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	205384		/users/profile/267537	Pattycray	Volunteer	5	07/08/2014	I am involved with the Lending Libraries Program in the W/NP Stevens Point Office.  Each month I purchase six to eight Spanish books for children and Amy Wiza and her staff of volunteers transport them to Nicaragua.  So far, I have donated 160 books. It is a pleasure for me to know that the children are enjoying reading and learning at the same time.  I plan to continue to work with W/NP to expand this excellent program.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248470		/users/profile/336203	jtkrohel	Board Member	5	07/14/2015	Nicaragua is a beautiful country that has tremendous resources but has suffered setbacks, both natural and manmade. Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas (WPN) is special to me because it helps the Nicaraguan people to help themselves. WPN provides educational materials to Learning Centers that are established cooperatively throughout Nicaragua. After visiting several learning centers it became clear to me that efforts by volunteers to provide educational materials and requested training to the centers is the type of humanitarian aid that can change the world. WPN is an example of cooperation between peoples (volunteers) of two countries interested in improving quality of life. I feel very fortunate to be a part of WPN.

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	248242	1	/users/profile/335947	wecanstopit	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	As a diplomat I observed the work of volunteer organizations in many countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and I did whatever it was possible as a government officer to assist their efforts.  My expectations for such groups accordingly are very high. In the past decade I have worked extensively as a volunteer with Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners, and the group always has produced results that exceeded my highest expectations.  In its cool, persistent and energetic way the leadership of W/NP has done in my view exceptional work in aiding and actively promoting support for educational work in Nicaragua and for provision of both financial and material support for projects in Nicaragua.  I find these efforts well exceed what is possible between governments alone as they demonstrate the remarkable things that interested and dedicated people can do for each other.

I have also seen how the people of Nicaragua have helped me and others I know. This truly makes it a 2-way street! This summer I was able to take a group of 14 teenagers to Nicaragua on a very reasonably priced trip. The experiences they had working with W/NP and the new friends that they made will never be forgotten! I would highly recommend getting involved in this incredible group. It's a great way to connect with people in your own area and around the world!

Also, for various reasons I have been involved with the Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners. I am impressed with WNP's ability to combine people-to-people relations with economic help. They have a small competent staff in Wisconsin and Nicaragua. Being an Economist I love efficiency. I now have many friends in Nicaragua. Also, through the WNP's shipping program me, my colleagues, Partner friends in Nicaragua have provided many thinks to needy people in Nicaragua. Currently we are packing 23 computers and 14 wheelchairs for the next shipment.

I have traveled to Nicaragua for two of their trips. One is the Annual Learning Center Trek and the other is one of their Eyeglass Mission trips. I have also volunteered for a few packing and shipping days as well. I have always been impressed with their use of resources and the dedication of the staff. Everyone involved really leaves a part of the heart in their work.  From logistics to outreach to sustainable impact in Nicaragua, this nonprofit really succeeds at bringing both and cultural exchanges to this country. The staff in both offices are dedicated and passionate. The volunteers are very diverse yet equally devoted. The impact in various projects, such as the burn center, is undeniable. I will be a life long lover of Nicaragua, it's culture and the strength of it's people and I thank the WNP for that.  Brandon Taylor
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	246306		/users/profile/333608	GrammaJo	Volunteer	5	06/25/2015	The W/NP staff in Stevens Point is composed of two very dedicated and capable people.  Therefore, W/NP relies on volunteers who are willing to share their time, talents and support.  The volunteers never complain while, at times, working in very harsh weather conditions both here and in Nicaragua.  Their gratification comes when they see the eagerness and enthusiasm (from Nicaraguans of all ages) to learn from what we give them to help improve their quality of life as well as improve their financial situations.My first experience was on the Learning Center trip in 2014 and I was very impressed by the people in Nicaragua.  They are very friendly and are very appreciative of our help.The success of W/NP relies heavily on the volunteers.  They are the backbone of this worthy organization.

Many of our faculty members have traveled to Nicaragua to work with the Nicaraguans on agricultural, community development, leadership, organizational development, planning, health, small business development and tourism promotion. WNP has been most supportive and professional in their collaboration and cooperation with the University of Wisconsin.  Currently I am working with Wisconsin beekeepers to teach basic beekeeping to people in Nicaragua to provide them with the education and training to become good beekeepers. The honey from one hive can double the annual income of many impoverished families. WNP has been most helpful in providing the administrative and logistical support for the NicAbeja Proyecto. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	245842		/users/profile/333059	Bobstodola	Volunteer	5	06/21/2015	I have watched the women, and a few men , learn skills in the learning centers for 30 years.  Sometimes the women would like to make a business of their new skills, but lack the knowledge and finances to start.  The start of the Opening Doors to Opportunity project was a small grant from the Madison West Rotary to give some basic business instruction and funds to put their experience to work.  After ten years, some 300 women, and a few men, have had the experience  of putting their ideas into practice.  It is gratifying to visit them in their homes, or just to talk with them to feel the enthusiasm and resolve they put into their work.  Some have invested the earnings into improving their business.  Others have used them for family and home improvements.  Bob Stodola

Amy and the staff here and in Nicaragua go the extra mile to help whenever needed. I enjoy the dedicated volunteers when I am able to make one of the packing or shipping days. I have seen first hand the work done by W/NP and its volunteers in Nicaragua and it is truly amazing. These people are all in great shape because "There is no exercise better than reaching down and lifting people up." and that is what this group does best.Jeff White- Projects for People

Several Nicaraguan firefighters have visited Wisconsin and we would like to start firefighter tours to help Wisconsin firefighters visit Nicaragua.  Through this program, since 2000, 24 firetrucks and 12 ambulances have been shipped to Nicaragua.  Hundreds of sets of firefighting coats, pants, boots, helmets along with hose, breathing apparatus and other eqipment have been donated by fire departments in Wisconsin.  As a volunteer firefighter it is rewarding to see this equipment being used in Nicaragua and to watch as new stations are started across the country.

This has been a dream and a project which is shared with my sister Elizabeth who used to teach there for many years but had to retire due to her illness (cancer). To my surprise I was able to find very close to me this wonderful organization that made very easy for my sister and me to accomplish our dream. This organization believes that helping Nicaraguans and their communities is the best way to improve people`s lives in the world. This was translated throughout the treatment I received as soon as I met Amy  W. and Bob B. They were loving and caring, their actions with me show truth  appreciation to the cause they are working for and match really well my passion and desire to help a small school that is very dear to me and my sister`s heart. I would fully trust and recommend this organization to anyone and I send my special thanks to everyone that works and volunteers for this organization. Thank you WNP - Reyna Jarquin

As a student volunteer, I see nothing but hard work and effort coming from the offices of W/NP.  The full time staff are passionate about helping others and they work together to get work done.  I wish I could do more, but I feel I have done my part by keeping the website up to date and volunteering at a few events.  I am honored to continue to work for this amazing organization and I look forward to what my remaining years in Stevens Point brings.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	205345		/users/profile/267491	whitecat14	Volunteer	5	07/07/2014	This past February I participated in the 2014 Wisconsin Nicaragua Partner's-  Learning Center Trek after being invited by a friend who had gone the year before. It was an amazing experience and one I highly recommend to others who are interested in learning about another part of the Americas.  The trip was very well organized by the Wisconsin Nicaraguan Partner's central office in Stevens Point. The staff at the Center were extremely helpful and offered an orientation to those who were first time participants. It took very little effort on my part in terms of travel arrangements.   The Nicaraguan staff were also professional and welcoming. I was touched by the workshop participants who were so enthusiastic about attending and eager to learn new skills. We were in both rural and urban settings and visited a residence that served as a volunteer fire department with equipment donated by Wisconsin fire and emergency organizations. We also visited a school that was started by a Nicaraguan couple who wanted to bring education to their neighborhood. It was a school that started with a few students and in a short few years expanded to over 300 students. Again WNP was the source of one of their buildings as well as supplies and recorders donated so that the students could learn a musical instrument.  What impressed me most was how small our world really is. The girl's chorus at the school entertained us with their rendition of a song that won an Emmy this year -I Want to Be Royal. I just thought teenagers are teenagers anywhere in the world.  I highly recommend the trip. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	205076		/users/profile/267167	RuthSchauer	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	One of the great things about Wisconsin-Nicaragua Partners is that it has strong central offices in Stevens Point, Wisconsin and Managua, Nicaragua coordinating its many activities--learning centers, farm programs, chica-nica doll project, eye glasses project , burn dressings project, travel programs,  and much more--but also partner cities, which sponsor projects with their own partner city.  For example I have been a member since 2000 of the Fort Atkinson-Puerto  Cabezas , a part of the Partners of the Americas for the Americas for over 40 years.  Our group has supported a learning center, helped to set up a library, sent seeds to many local farmers who had lost crops because of flooding, and given scholarships to students.  Working together we make a difference!

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	204949	1	/users/profile/267027	Newob	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	Fifty (50) years of continuous humanitarian support at the grass roots level of families and individuals in needs says it all.  WNP makes a lasting impact through projects that respond to real needs facilitated  by an infrastructure that works.  Their feedback to support donations is immediate and real.  Your sewing machine donation is registered to a Learning Center or individual and you can even see the results in the Chica Nica link on their website or join one of the WNP tours for a first hand experience.  My tour visits are always exceptional.  A fantastic organization.   
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	204895	1	/users/profile/266963	Rosalind K.	Volunteer	5	07/01/2014	 The most fulfilling part of being a volunteer for Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners is by far taking something to someone who without us could never even dream of what we have brought them. Seeing their eyes glow and their ideas inspired is such a pleasure. Being involved in WI with teaching others of the needs of another country and sharing the opportunities, which can be as simple as donating eye glasses or sending a back pack, yet so impactful by giving someone clear vision for the first time or the opportunity to go to school, is unreal. When traveling there is nothing more wonderful then seeing someone's eyes open to how much more there is in the world. These opportunities here in WI would not be the same without WI/Nicaragua Partner's, they are an incredible organization, doing so much more in the lives of others than they may even realize. 
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	196778	1	/users/profile/257210	MaryV	Volunteer	5	03/31/2014	I have been volunteering for about 6 months now. WNP is comprised of the hardest working group of people I've ever met -- both in the Stevens Point office and the Managua office. My husband and I went on the Leaning Center Tour in 2014 and were so impressed with the work that WNP is doing in Nicaragua, plus we really enjoyed the country and its people.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	180819	2	/users/profile/237521	rwolensk	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners is a tremendous organization run by highly dedicated (and skilled) staff and volunteers.   I have served as a volunteer, as well as an advisor on on one project, and it is clear to me that W/NP has "made a difference" in the lives of numerous NIcaraguan citizens and communities.  The organization has also helped educate and inform Wisconsinites and other Americans regarding the importance of our relationship with our sister state, Nicaragua.   The resourcefulness and dedication of the staff and volunteers, both in Wisconsin and in Managua, is something to behold!   In my view, WN/P is one of the finest organizations of its type in the U.S., and its work is far from done.

Let us have the will of contributing according to our possibilities to keep the organization running in both countries, Wisconsin and Nicaragua.    
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	166767	1	/users/profile/221541	tomref	Board Member	5	09/02/2013	The Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas (WN/P) is an outstanding organization.  My wife first got involved through the Learning Center programs, where volunteers from Wisconsin travel to Nicaragua to conduct workshops and open libraries for the Nicaraguans.  I was a volunteer member and was asked to travel to Nicaragua to do a summary report on a youth baseball program that WN/P initiated three years before.  Since that time we have been back to Nicaragua several times and I now serve on the Board of Directors. Working with the Nicaraguan people is very rewarding because they are so appreciative of everything you do for them.  We are looking forward to our next trip.

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	165459		/users/profile/219919	Arthur E Angove D O  Gen Surgeon  Ret	Volunteer	5	08/19/2013	My first encounter with the Partners of the Americas was in 1969 in Bolivia where I noticed a bronze plaque on a bridge over the Mamore River to Villa Tunari describing the Alliance for Progress which President Kennedy started; then divided that into the Partners and Peace Corp.   In Honduras after hurricane Fifi I'd taken a medical team to help.  We worked with a team from Nicaragua during the day, then enjoyed partying with them at night.  I was made an honorary citizen of Jinotega, Nicaragua in 1976. During their civil war I was president of the Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners and was protected by both the Contras and Sandinistas as I travelled throughout that beautiful nation.  I've learned to cope with some of the terribleness of war, and have used those experiences to better understand our Nicaraguan partners.  As Partners we enjoy sharing ideas, talents, and our love for each other.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	165446		/users/profile/219906	CatyB	Volunteer	5	08/19/2013	Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners is a most impressive not-for-profit organization which is changing the lives of participants in both Nicaragua and Wisconsin.   Programs  that teach sewing and sewing machine repair, bicycle repair, cake decorating, square meteer gardening, dairying and cheese making, firefighting,  sports, and lending libraries give Nicaraguans skills to improve the quality of their lives.  These programs allow a diverse groups of Wisconsin particpants to share their expertise and  interests with enthusiastic, motivated, hard-working Nicaraguans who share those interests.  And ALL the participants benefit from the shared learning experience and human interaction.  It is truly a program of mutual enrichment through person to person interaction.

The organizational support for Nicaragua volunteers is outstanding.  We cherish the friendless and appreciation of the Nicaraguan people we serve.  My wife also collects donated stuffed toys that come into our civic center.  They can be packed almost anywhere in a shipment, and may be used to cushion delicate medial equipment.  One of my favorite sights is a colorful string of stuffed toys that have been washed, and are drying on our clothesline.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	165408		/users/profile/219867	bljohnson	Volunteer	5	08/19/2013	I first learned of WNP from friends who traveled to Nicaragua, and in 2003 I made my 1st of 10 trips to Nicaragua.  All but one was working with the Eye GLass Tour.  We will go to different towns and villages and help people to see clearly for the 1st time in years.  Young and old come out and wait sometimes for hours hoping  to be seen.  When you see the face of a person who just recieved a pair of Lion's Club glasses and their vision has been restored it truly wonderful.  The people of Nicaragua have given me so much more than I can ever give back to them, but I'll try.  This is a wonderful organazation, the people are giving on both sides.  i started as a volunteer after a few years became a Board Member and at the end of this year I'll agin be a very blessed volunteer.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	125108	1	/users/profile/170240	nyliram	Volunteer	5	10/11/2012	Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners is a marvelous organization because of what it does to improve the lives of folks both in Wisconsin and Nicaragua.  The exchange of culture, friendship and material aid enriches us all.  The real backbone of the organization is the people in it, both in Nicaragua and in Wisconsin.   From the directors, and office staffs to the many volunteers and donors , we work  together .  If this body of people, both in Nicaragua and Wisconsin was not so committed to learning new ideas to improve their lives and to share their ideas WNP would not flourish.  So, in conclusion, the two way nature of the program and the commitment of the people in it are what makes it work and makes it great.On a personal level, I have traveled to Nicaragua a number of times and have hosted Nicaraguans in my home.  Each time was a blessing and an opportunity to deepen friendships and cultural awareness.  Then when we meet again in the opposite country the welcoming smiles warm the heart.  It is the best high one ever has.
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	124978		/users/profile/170085	totooc	Volunteer	5	10/10/2012	As a health care administrator, I was shocked when I heard about patients sharing beds and having no privacy. We were able to ship hospital beds, privacy curtains and an ambulance assist this struggling hospital. We were also able to send a group of paramedics to provide training to local volunteers. Our small group continues to offer limited health care to a small mountain village once a year. We learned from one of the women from this village, who was visiting our group, that she needed a surgical mesh to repair an abdominal hernia that could become life threatening. In order for her to have the surgery, she had to provide the mesh. We were able to obtain the mesh from one of the local hospitals and she was able to have the surgery when she returned to Nicaragua. Several retired teachers have organized a scholarship fund to provide educational opportunities to children from this mountain village. A few students have pursued training in nursing after graduating from high school. My wife has been treasurer of our group since it's inception in 1992. We both continue to be highly supportive of Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners and have met many wonderful people from this country over the years.

My experience there was everything I had hoped for and more,  and I am about to return for the 8th year in a row! What makes this organization so special? A group of vibrant, dedicated volunteers who do everything possible to make life better for those they meet (or have been linked with) in Nicaragua. Fund-raisers, donations, and projects in Wisconsin are used to create greater opportunities for employment, education, and income for the Nicaraguan people. The people in Nicaragua also have input into the goals for their community and the projects undertaken, and by working TOGETHER, positive change has occured. I have particularly enjoyed working with the children and seeing them grow into responsible contributing adults. I support a scholarship program (through WNP) that allows Nica youngsters to continue their studies past sixth grade.  Working on planning, establishing, and providing books for a lending library for a small mountain-top community to use has been a rewarding opportunity as well.  Sharing songs, dances, and crafts with the children keeps me busy in Nicaragua and allows  their parents uninterrupted time to attend workshops as part of WNP projects.  It has been a win/win situation for all involved!

Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	124513		/users/profile/169387	kathy nodolf	Volunteer	5	10/04/2012	Being a member of WNP has been nothing short of life changing for me.This organization is run by the most energetic, passionate,  and dedicated people I have had the privilege to meet.  I have been part of a small group of people who have traveled to Nicaragua yearly to work with a small mountain community that we have literally "adopted".  In the 5 years I have been traveling we have worked on scholarships for students, water filtration, building playground equipment, a learning center, a lending library  and refurbishing the school and Health building.  I have been most actively involved in conducting leadership training for the youth and working with the Woman's  Group.  I have helped teach the women sewing and crafting skills to help them personally as well as enabling them to sell some of their products.   Recently , 2 particular moments brought me to tears.  After driving up the mountain to say good-bye we pulled up to the learning center to find men, women, and children working on a variety of projects with the music blaring and smiles on everyone's face - what progress!  Last year when we were able to pay the women for the jewelry they were making they were overwhelmed and said it was the first time  in their lives they had ever been paid for anything they had done.  LIFE CHANGING for all of us!
Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners of the Americas, Inc.	124251		/users/profile/169079	spope	Volunteer	5	10/02/2012	Wisconsin Nicaragua Partners is a great organization.  The partner city concepts is a great way for people to connect between countries in a personal way. Yes, we do many things to assist the people in poverty in Nicaragua, but there is also a focus on developing a two-way relationship and helping them create strengths were the Nicaraguan people can do things for themselves to build up their communities and their nation.  I traveled with the group several years ago, and it was a life-changing experience.  The work they do really has a positive impact on people's lives - for both the Nicaraguans and for us.

I first became involved several years ago after hearing a member give a passionate account of the work WNP does.  After traveling to Nicaragua with the group,  I could see firsthand the fruits of their labor over the years.  I saw children with no means of furthering there education, supported in their community school and finally graduating in professions of nursing, pharmacy and law.  With hopes they will bring back there education to the community.  I saw learning centers, and  lending libraries in poor villages where women came and were taught skills that will help them support themselves, buy a little extra food, and maybe a little better health care.  Maybe some day someone in the village will be able to buy a car to use for medical emergencies.  I saw so many books, chairs and clothes packed up from here and sent.  A smiling community baseball team playing in a cow pasture, wearing donated baseball hats, and t shirts.  All with smiles on their faces.  And so much more.

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	294700		/users/profile/385446	kp816	Volunteer	5	07/05/2016	I volunteered at Variety's Chatter Matters! Camp this summer.  It was  a rewarding experience that I will never forget! I will definitely be volunteering again next year.  Children who are nonverbal and their families had the opportunity to participate in engaging activities such as water sports, games, crafts, and cooking activities with the support of SLPs, and SLP/OT/PT students.  The emphasis was on using AAC devices in everyday activities-  I can't tell you how awesome it was to see children use these devices to communicate outside of the speech therapy room or classroom during activities where they could just enjoy being a kid at summer camp! Thank you for the wonderful weekend, Variety!
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	294180		/users/profile/384901	Writer	Client Served	5	06/29/2016	My family attended Variety 2016 Chatter Matters! Communication Camp! Communicating with non-verbal children is very challenging; the camp showed us that it is well worth the hard work. Stephen Hawkings is only one individual who uses technology to give himself a voice.  If we can all learn to use technology to its fullness, how much better will the world be for all of us? Technology is advancing we need to make sure the people who need it most have access to it. Everyone at camp was encouraged to do so.People are social creatures. Both non-verbal children and their parents are isolated.  Being among others with similar challenges broke the isolation. Everyone was able to find others that they could relate to and share with.The camp was a fun, non-judgmental place were my entire family could have fun while learning. Being among so many non-verbal children allowed us to experience the world differently. Some of the activities were geared to have us adults see the world through our children's' eyes and it was frustrating. My children were able to see the world as one of the "normal" children and have fun.

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	255086		/users/profile/343455	PattyMevis	Client Served	5	09/05/2015	Our youngest daughter, Kira, was diagnosed at age 2 with Rett syndrome, after losing her ability to stand, talk and use her hands functionally.  She has used a low tech communication book (PODD) for 6 years and 2 years ago started using her Tobii, a speech generating device she controls with her eyes.  We were able to attend the Chatter Matters camp this summer and have so much to be grateful for.  The camp was structured to offer Kira a camp experience, much like her siblings, but with significant emphasis on creating opportunities for her to utilize her communication device in meaningful, engaging situations, while meeting new friends and having fun.  The staff was amazing!  There were students who are going into the speech pathology profession, working side by side with veteran speech pathologists and other professionals.  Our days were filled with activities and staff were right there to help.  Parents were offered opportunities to meet with  specialists while kids were actively engaged in  activities with so many volunteers.  Kira requires 1:1 attention and I felt comfortable going to the parent sessions while others cared for and interacted with her.  The camp was a time for Kira to be included in all activities with other children.  Siblings attended and were engaged as well.  It's not often Kira participates in something that I can stand back and let go of my worries.  I am usually trying to adapt whatever "typical" activity is going on, but here was a place Kira fit in, and camp was ready for her.  I appreciated the time spent learning from and sharing experiences with other parents who "get it".  Although our children are different, we all understand the intensity of raising a child with special needs, advocating for their needs and trying to find solutions to any number of situations.  Kira left camp with a stronger understanding of how to use her communication device, and a treasured week of camp memories she has shared with her 3rd grade class.  I left camp with new circle of friends, a bonus I hadn't anticipated.  Thank you Variety, for the opportunity to participate in Chatter Matters!

Since moving to Wisconsin Variety has allowed my other children and Nicolas to participate in dream nights such as the bucks games, and admirals games along with the ren faire these are things that with a child of special needs we as a family can not possibly find the extra money to spend on things like this.  As we are busy buying items for Nicolas' care and as toys for him that are adaptive to him and his needs.  Variety has allowed us as a family to offer a childhood to our other 2 children that in the light of Nicolas injuries we would have been unable to provide and still provide the best for Nicolas.

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	246652		/users/profile/334053	Jim_B	Client Served	5	06/29/2015	Both my wife and I wanted to extend a word of thanks regarding the Chatter Matters Camp our family was able to enjoy this week.  The brief opportunities to share our gratitude kind of took us by surprise - as I'm sure it did for other families as well.  It was tough to process the amount we have to be thankful for during that short amount of time.  Here are a few thoughts... Life as a special needs parent, by necessity, can be quite regimented.  Daily rituals get us through each day, and work and sleep deprivation take their toll.  Even a vacation isn't a vacation, as they are often largely the same regimen in a new location - plus a degree of uncertainty with regard to new locations, new hospitals, new stares, etc.   The opportunities to really sit back and reflect, plan, and course-correct rarely come, and is often done with 'the ball in motion', and some degree of fatigue.  The Chatter Matters Camp was beneficial to us in many incalculable ways.  The opportunity to have our son's needs given a fresh review by so many speech professionals was priceless for him, and reassuring for us.  Our eight year old son's speech began with his first word nearly two years ago to the day.  The long plateaus between any progress in speech always make us concerned about committing extended lengths of time to try anything new.  We see the benefit that this technology can provide Brandon, and I'm not confident that would have happened without this camp.   The opportunity to be with other special needs parents also helped us out of our years-long sense of isolation.  What made this camp particularly helpful was the shared experience of specifically being with the parents of children with extreme communication disabilities.  We don't feel as isolated as our children who can't talk, but we share that sense of isolation the same.   It was a tremendous experience to be among those who 'get it' - both professionally and in their daily home life as well - and to have that opportunity have some community. Safety - a long forgotten sense of safety.  Our son never responds when he wanders off, which always leaves us anxious wherever we go.  The speech professionals, the speech students, the community of families (both the siblings and parents), the predictable and easily searchable facility layout - all made us feel safe for the first time outside of our home in a long time.  The two times our son did wander off this week, it turned out he was simply escorted to the washroom by the volunteer psychologist, and another time he went back into our room, where an SLP was just patiently waiting outside the room with the door open, keeping a watchful I on him until we figured out he was missing.  That was really above and beyond the call of duty and greatly appreciated that. The opportunity to be able to speak with a psychologist was beneficial as well.  A fresh perspective that is experienced, objective, and insightful can be immensely helpful when parents and kids are caught in a regimented daily routine.   We received some great, practical takeaways that we will use to help our son to cope more appropriately in new environments and new social situations that are over-stimulating to him. The siblings were amazing as well. Our son easily gets overwhelmed in social situations and shuts down around regular kids playing at their own pace.  We saw the face-hiding and withdrawal again with an opening soccer game.  It only took a couple of words with these kids and they readily throttled down their intensity.  Within the hour, we saw our son play soccer with kids nearly his own age for the first time ever.  Indeed, it was the first time we saw him engage in a "non-parallel play" manner.  We feel it was a defining, formative break-through moment for him! As a parent of a speech-language pathology student who volunteered, the event was priceless as well.  A university could not have created a more comprehensive pre-professional experience.   Not only was the exposure to top-shelf SLPs a great opportunity, but they also received the experience of being able to dine and listen to parents, work with our kiddos, and interact with their siblings.  Our daughter has already has this experience, but it is not the same until you can break out of your own family dynamic - so this benefitted her as well.  The key difference between being a health care provider, and being a health care provider of excellence, begins a foundation of mercy.  We feel that this comprehensive experience fosters the heart of a true caregiver enormously.   For certain, the perspective made possible to these students during a formative period in their careers will pay dividends to the children and families they will serve in the future. Oh, we could tell that our service dog, Sienna, enjoyed the week too.  Our family routine has kept us from seeing the benefits of all her people-skills and training, so that was an unexpected discovery and bonus as well. Finally, I have to mention the staff and environment of Inspiration Ministries.  The meal planning, food preparation, the easy cleanup, the child-friendly environment; having all of these concerns and activities taken out of our routine for a few days provided us with opportunities to think, and regain some sense of adult community.  There were moments where my wife and I actually spoke in complete, uninterrupted sentences.  We already can't remember what we said, but it happened there!   So again, we have a lot to be grateful for and extend a sincere word of thanks to Variety for making the Chatter Matters Camp happen.  As always, there are just too many individuals for us to thank.  If forwarding this message is possible, we would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you to all who made this past week, both possible and memorable.Sincerely, Jim, Anne, Victoria (Tori), Brandon, and Sienna Behan

From the special location Variety chose, which provided accommodations for those with all kinds of special needs to the range of activities tailored to enable these children to participate--the nature walk and lecture, the arts and crafts projects, the water games, the creative cooking, the camp fire and sing-along, the group talent show--to the Variety staff and volunteers' generosity with their time and their willingness to give of themselves, their expertise, their kindness--what a wonderful program!

She has spinal cord injury and uses crutches to walk. Due to her physical disability, she is limited to the physical activities that she can participate in. Variety helped change that when they gave her a specially adapted bike. I'll never forget the day that she got the bike and rode off so fast that I couldn't keep up with her. She actually had me running after her for once. She was shrieking with pure joy the entire ride. It's an experience that I'll never forget. I am so grateful that Variety gave my daughter the chance to just be a kid and experience the joy of riding a bike.

I love this charity because we see the kids and families we serve -how their life experience is enhanced.  To see the joy in their being (and on their family's faces) is beyond belief! Giving special needs kids  mobility opportunities with special equipment - opporutnities we take for granted like riding a bike, standing up, moving independently from place to place - is so humbling.  Providing dream experiences for them like Chatter Matters Camp, Museums, Movies, fishing trips, auto races etc. that because of their mobility issues - their families would find challenging at best to afford or handle alone - it's amazing to see!  And that's why it's the best - because we see and meet and get close to these very unique and caring kids and their families in a way that I've not see in any other Charity - ever.

I'm a student in speech pathology and not only did this camp provide a great learning experience for me but it really made an impact upon children who needed alternative ways to communicate with other people because of their disabilities.  The camp was highly functional, helping families and their kids to augment their use of AAC devices, but it was also a wonderful, energetic, and fun summer camp that was able to bring people together who face similar day-to-day challenges so they could connect and learn from each other.  It was a moving experience for me as a volunteer and I heard much positive feedback from the attendees as well.  I would not hesitate to recommend this camp to other volunteers or people interested in attending.

I havent been able to stop thinking about the stories, and information about what Variety does for children.  What I think makes your organization so unique is that you arent raising money to help fund research (dont get me wrong, I do think thats important too) but you are just trying to find creative ways to help kids with disabilities feel more like other kids!  What a loving and caring approach that is. So in short, I have been moved beyond belief and I want to get involved!  Please let me know what you need help with!  I think it is absolutely amazing what you do to help disabled children and their entire families!

We could not afford such a bike for him and are so grateful for this organization and what they did for my son and for others, keep up the great work you do!

Variety is excellent at making our family feel as a priority on their list at any time.  May it be tickets to an event or monetary assistance for an item or service.  Variety has helped my son gain his independence and his feeling of inclusion with the children in the neighborhood by helping us purchase a new bike for him to ride with fellow friends.  Thank you Vaiety for being there when our family needed help.

Every day is such a gift but in this beautiful mess of life sometimes, just getting through a week with multiple therapies, work, IEP goals , school appt's, navigating the grocery story can be a challenge - But at the Variety events, all of that is forgotten, it is about support , joy , accessible fun and friendship interaction with the kids. The easiest way for me to say it is, that  this group gives us a place to "belong" and to feel connected. Thank You from our hearts :)

She is a true miracle and has overcome numerous hurdles. She is 13 yrs old now.  We recently found out about Variety Club and have attended a few events.  The events are so well planned and have given our family the opportunity to attend things we would have only dreamt about. The most recent event to Discovery World was phenomenal.  Our daughter has had a permanent smile on her face since Sunday morning when we left for Discovery World Event:)  The other wonderful opportunity was seeing a movie at Majestic Marcus Theatres in the Cinedine at Christmas time.  Santa got an extra kiss  that day. Thank you to everyone who funds, volunteers  and works to give our kids a happy moment which is building a lifetime of fantastic memories.

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	56985		/users/profile/59776	Dr.T	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2010	For many years, Variety- The Children's Charity of Wisconsin has provided significant funding for cutting-edge technology and equipment for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin's Variety Orthopedic Center.   With this funding, together, we have been able to provide children with physical disabilities with state of the art care. This past year, Variety made it possible for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to become the first Children's Hospital in the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains, to obtain an EOS low dose full body radiation scanning device.  This state of the art x-ray type machine provides a 3D clearer image than traditional x-rays and, importantly, with a dramatically lower radiation exposure than traditional x-ray technology (one tenth the normal dose).The variety club has been instrumental in purchasing a variety of diagnostic devices which have helped many children with orthopedic problems; a motion analysis system, which helps decide the best surgical or therapeutic procedure for children with cerebral palsy; Quantec, a device to monitor scoliosis progression which eliminated the need for thousands of spine films, EMED and PEDAR, plantar pressure devices to dynamically analyze children with complex foot deformities. In addition to their funding of equipment in the Clinic, Variety has also helped many Orthopedic Clinic patients by purchasing durable medical equipment that their families could not afford and insurance would not pay for.  We at the Variety Orthopedic Clinic are grateful for Variety's longtime continued support for the children that we serve.John Thometz, MDChief of Pediatric Orthopedic SurgeryChildrens Hospital of WisconsinProfessor Orthopedic SurgeryMedical College of Wisconsin
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	56062		/users/profile/58348	TammyT	Donor	5	10/31/2010	I have had the opportunity to work closely with Variety as a fundraising partner for over ten years and have personally witnessed their work in action. The passion and dedication of everyone involved in this organization is nothing short of inspirational. Gerise and her team are enthusiastic, thoughtful, caring and selfless about their cause. The children and families who benefit from their work are the true evidence of the success of Variety's mission. I haven't been part of a Variety event where every child in the room hasn't had a smile from ear to ear, which certainly speaks volumes. Whether it's taking kids to the movies, providing bikes to children with special needs or securing funding to remodel a home for wheelchair accessibility, it's clear that this organization has it's heart in exactly the right place. I am proud to partner with Variety and look forward to helping them positively impact the lives of more families. 
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	56028		/users/profile/58309	lesmos1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2010	Variety has assisted several of my patients.  Without their assistance, these children would not have the equipment required to make them as independent as possible.  In a world where healthcare is offering less and less assistance, it is a wonderful thing to have such a great charity available!
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	55894		/users/profile/58151	cindy ciardo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2010	Our company has had the opportunity to work with Variety in two capacities as a provider of medical equipment and as a member of their advisory committee.  Both have been positive experiences.  Variety works with a diverse group of vendors to find the best equipment for kids at the best pricealways contentious of costs, but never sacrificing quality or cutting corners.  Their efforts to find the right equipment to meet a childs special needs and their commitment to help the kids and their families--not only with equipment, but with special projects and group outings that enrich their lives --is nothing short of remarkable. It has been very rewarding for us to work with Variety and to see first-hand when the equipment is delivered, how thrilled the kids areand their families as well.  Variety programs are reviewed and validated by professionals working with kids with disabilities to ensure the integrity of the programs. The advisory committee reviews applications, confirms the validity of the need/request, verifies that the equipment requested is appropriate and meets the childs needs, and ensures that Variety is spending their programming dollars as wisely as possible.Everyone working with Variety has been enthusiastic and passionate about their cause. Its amazing how much they have already accomplished for kids with special needs. Plus, they are always looking for new ways to help the kids and to reach out to families in need.  It is both a pleasure to work with the Variety staff and committee members, and a rewarding experience to work with the recipients. 
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	55827		/users/profile/58071	thankfulmom37	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	Over the summer my daughter Hannah was able to receive a three wheel bike from Variety and a very kind donor.  I am a single mother whom was never able to afford any type of bike for her, and she fought for several years learning just how to ride one borrowed usually from the school she attended. But last year, Hannah's world fell apart with behavior problems, weight gain, and overall dissappointment from many reasons.  Her sister is 16 months younger and would always take Hannah out with us on family time on her borrowed bikes.  This was the only way for Hannah to really enjoy time with her sister as Hannah cannot speak.  An unspoken language occurs when they are riding together it makes me heart beat really fast just to be around them.  Alas, I heard of a non-profit business that was picking a few children for a bike.  I raced around praying that my doctors and therapists would see the need for Hannah to have this precious gift.  No matter how hard I worked I could not seem to be able to give Hannah this gift myself because of the need for special adaptive features.  I received that call, and Variety changed our life.  In only a few short weeks of receiving the bike Hannah was able to control her weight better, be more energetic, and she smiles again.  Her school is shocked by the difference, and so am I.  Thank you to Variety and the family whom made our dreams come true.

I have been to the homes of the children we have helpedand met with their families.  The gratitude they express for making the lives  of their children a little better is worth all the effort we put in, in raising funds to be able to help them. When the mom's give you a big hug, it's hard not to shed a tear or two. I will always do whatever I can to help these families. When there is no one else to turn to, Variety will find a way to help improve the life of a family and a child in need.Patrick Downs, Board Member

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	55717		/users/profile/57935	Karen	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	Words can not express the feelings I have for Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin.  My son is 10 years old.  Just about two years ago now we put him on a waiting list for a bike, but never heard a thing.  It was earlier this year in March, my son's therapist recieved a call from Gerise from Variety about seeing his name on that waiting list for the bike.  I was put in touch with Gerise, filled out some forms and just in time for spring he was riding his bike!!  This bike has CHANGED  my son's life.  All of the sudden we saw this boy who clung to his mother take off.  Within two days he was riding up and down the neighborhood with all the other kids by himself.   He has ridden this bike nearly everyday.  I have neighbors who sit out on their porches just watching him go up and down the sidewalks amazed at his new independence.  Infact, just earlier today his dentist told me she was passing by the house saw him on the bike and was so excited she was not watching where she was driving and nearly hit a parked car.   Not only has Variety granted his wish to have his own bike, but in January he will have the opportunity to try snow skiing and snowboarding, something he is very excited about and never thought he would be able to experience.   Did I mentioned he took part in the Fishing Has No Boundries of Milwaukee that Variety is also a sponsor of?  The second year in a row he reeled in the biggest fish, this year it was a 14lb Shinook Salmon and also a Brown Trout.  I am so thankful from the bottom of my heart for what Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin has done for the new independence I see in my son and the future that they may bring to his life.

Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	55678		/users/profile/57894	Brent Emery	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2010	My involvement with Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin  and the children and families they serve has been a fulfilling experience. I run a retail bicycle and fitness store. Over the years we have made a number of modifications to bicycles of many shapes and sizes to allow people with varied challenges use them. Most are bought by the families who can afford them. Some are funded by friends, or the state or organizations. A lot of families cannot afford them. Well, this past spring Gerise LaSpisa, Executive Director of Variety, paid us a visit. We have not been the same since. Variety's mission has inspired us to want to be more involved not just with the fine folks in their organization but more importantly with the children they serve. While the special adaptive bikes are right up our alley as my staff and me are all bike nuts, it is the opportunity to create freedom for the children to explore the world with their bike that has us so excited. Some of the kids now have their own way to get around. Some are able to exercise outside with their friends as equals for the first time. Some are able to free up their family to get outside at all. And some kids are simply excited because they are on a bike and not a wheelchair. Variety makes this all possible for families who otherwise cannot afford to do this. The bikes are only a part of what Variety does. The care and accuracy with which they find individual solutions to assist challenged kids and their families is inspiring. The chance to work with Gerise and her staff and the kids and families they serve gives our staff the chance to be more involved in our community and for that we are grateful.

Unfortunately, we had no way of following through at home. Then we heard about Variety Clubs Bike Day which helped kids with special needs get special bikes. We were so excited when John was chosen to receive a bike, and not just any bike but a bike that was custom fit and custom built just for him. He was so excited when he tried out his bike for the first time. His smile was precious! John had tried bikes before that we got through an equipment loan program but they had never quite fit his needs. Now John has an awesome bike that works for him and us too (it has rear stearing for us)!

They provided an adaptive bicycle for a student with cerebral palsy that I service in the public schools.  His family was looking for a bicycle but an adaptive bicycle was out of their finacial reach.  We turned to variety and together filled out the application for an adaptive bicycle.  The application was detailed but easy to complete the needed information and letters.  Within two months of submitting the application he was pedeling around the neighborhood with his siblings and Mom!   The bicycle works for him now and into the future.  It is a quality peice of equipment with room to grow!  Variety had an event party to deliver the bike to make the family and my student feel super special.  The family also has an additional resource and support through other activities and services provided by Variety.  Thanks Variety!!!!

When interested stakeholders in the community hear about the work of Variety, they want to become involved; thus, Variety is a strong and growing organization.  As a physical therapist, I am grateful for the funding support that Variety is able to provide to children who otherwise would not have access to equipment and experiences that promote independence.  As a Board member, I am proud of the efforts of the staff of Variety to promote the ogranization's mission to community providers that have now become Variety's partners.  Having partnership relationships expands the possibilities available to children and families, and promotes more community awareness of the needs of others.

My son was adopted from Russia at 8.5 months, and has been diagnosed with bone dysplasia and autism.   He cannot go out and play sports like most kids; due to his attention and other constraints.  He is the happiest child you could ever meet, but not when it came to riding bikes.  We tried at least 10 difffernt bicycles, and he was just never able to reach the pedals and handle bars.  This was very frustrating to him, and he would become angry whenever we tried a new bike.  It was always the same old story.  Yes, it could work if mom or dad or big brother pushed him, but he did not have the ability to reach and control the pedals and handlebars for appropriate performance.Then came Variety Club and their Bike Day!!!  I can honestly say that his best Birthday present was the bike he received from Variety Club.  We have neighbors come up to us everyday in amazement.  They never expected to see Joey have so much control, and be able to ride around the block with us chasing him.  Variety Club has put the most beautiful smile on my Baby's face.  He is proud to ride HIS BIKE.  I cannot say enough about the help we were given to adjust his brakes, put additional brakes on, and to size up the pedals and handlebars for Joey's custom bike.

Trevor spent months in the hospital and we do thank the Lord that he survived.  When we saw the time approaching that Trevor could go home there was another huge problem.  There was not way that their home was compatible for a wheel chair and could meet the need of Trevor.  It was overwhelming and we saw no way that things could work out.   That is when Variety Club Children s Charities inc. contacted my brother and his wife.  They came in and renovated part of the house, built a long ramp from the alley, which made it possible for Trevor to go home.  Since then they have also did many things to help my brother's family and to help Trevor.  As a family member we have been very thankful for the generosity and care for our family members.  We would like to say Thank You and want you to know that we really appreciated all you have done.  Randy and Linda Wood
Variety - The Children's Charity of Wisconsin	55078		/users/profile/57067	Mark	Client Served	5	10/21/2010	My name is Mark Wood, I have a son Trevor who  sustained a traumatic brain injury from a 25' fall off a stairway banister while at school on June 9, 2009.  Trevor was rushed to the emergency room at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Trevor was in critical condition when he arrived and they told us that we would have to see how the next 12 hours went. Trevor survived this fall and is continuing his recovery at this time. When Trevor was to be released from the hospital we were told that in order for us to bring him home, our home had to be accessible to him. We were devastated with the task of modifying our home just to have our son home where he belonged. We called different building contractors to get estimates for the modifications. We were told that they would cost around $50,000.00 . We were also told maybe we should just sell our home and find something more accessible for Trevor. We were devastated. A social worker at Children's Hospital came to visit us one day and suggested we call Variety the Children's Charity of Wisconsin. My wife Jennifer called them and asked if they knew of anyone that could help us with the expense of getting a wheelchair van or the remodel of our home so we could get our son home. Gerise from Variety told us that she would make a few phone calls and see what she could do. That was in the evening time, the very next morning Gerise called Jennifer and asked her if she was sitting down. She then proceeded to tell us that she had reached out to some of the friends of Variety Charities for help and immediately was called by Tom the owner of Tri North Builders. Tri North Builders said they would like to come to our house and remodel our house to make it wheelchair accessible so Trevor could come home! Within 3 days our house was being remodeled, we were really wanting to get Trevor home as soon as possible and hopefully by Thanksgiving but that was less then a month away. Needless to say they finished our home and Trevor came home to be with his family for Thanksgiving. Variety Charities was involved every step of the way, bringing over food, offering anything we needed to help out. We gained a personal relationship with all of Tri North Builders and Gerise and the rest of the staff of Variety Charities. Since then Variety continues to be a important part in our lives, We are invited to numerous events and programs that allow Trevor to do thing he may never be able to do without their help. They are the most wonderful, caring and loving people! We are proud to be a part of the Variety family!  I am continually amazed as I see all the help they continue to give out to so many families in need . Thank you so much!!Mark Wood

I had no idea what to expect from the werkend.I learned of VJH by way of another non profit I'm pat of the past 9 years as of Nov '16.This past weekend we were given the opportunity to write a farewell letter to a fellow service member who had 'fallen' in service.Mine was mostly a peace time experience and I had not known a fellow fallen solder.  Immediately I realized I was the man that had not returned home.My body is intact but my truest life ended 43 years ago. My letter was to myself and the life still back at tech school. Mine is about MSA (military sexual assult aka MST or, military sexual trauma ). My letter expressed the great loss I'd come to know after much counseling. My letter ended with me saying to mysrlf; I Cannot leave you at tech school...I Will find a way to bring you (me) home.The VA offers many forms of treatment. One offering was medication. I've chosen other forms of treatment...inner personal healing work.I CANNOT say enough or too much about my experience this past weekend with VJH.I now know I have purpose...Purpose in helpng others toward their healing.Please consider your own steps toward healing by looking at my invitation to take your Vets Journey Home weekend ecperience. Be well.JonnC .

The staff are 100 % committed to helping our vets and what is very important is this: In addition to helping our vets release their trauma and truly COME HOME, no one is paid to serve on the weekend retreats.  This means that ALL the donations go directly to our vets - to  provide them a free weekend that is safe and all encompassing - dedicated to healing the wounds of war.

For the last six years I have been involved in working with veterans and then I met others who were involved with Vets Journey Home .  I am now an instructor and can speak to the well established practices and dedication of the staff to help our veterans come home.  An atmosphere of total acceptance and respect for  the vets and their stories is the foundation for this exceptional program.  VJH-USA has deepened my life, both personally and professionally.  It truly is a beacon for many to come home.

No one is paid. It is an ALL Volunteer organization. Every dollar goes to support our Veterans. Thank you to the men and women who give their time and service to help our Veterans. More importantly, thank you to all our Veterans who come and share their experiences with us. The Beautiful thing is most of the Veterans that come through our program.

As I didn't experience active combat I didn't think I had an issue with my service time. I was wrong. When I read the invitation to attend a weekend, I knew in my heart there was work to be done. The weekend healed some and pointed me in a direction to heal some more. Some of the additional pain was healed as a support member of the weekend team. I will be forever grateful to the Wisconsin VJH. 
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	193440	1	/users/profile/252639	quark12	Volunteer	5	01/29/2014	 My intent, at first, was to help another Vietnam Veteran. After reading the cost, I tearfully realized it was my healing that was needed. Camp Bird is a closed campus which was essential for me, no escapes for 3 days, not need to escape. Civilian and Veteran supports were always there, always supportive. I can't not volunteer after volunteering once. The process is heart opening and is not painless. The healing is opening up and moving through the scar tissue, much less painful than keeping the pain around by avoiding it. Do what you can, nothing more. then help others, simple.

I heard about this program from a veteran friend who benefited greatly from his weekend.  The program was totally free. The instructors and staff were all volunteers, about 20 for our 9 veterans.  Their process,program, allowed me to share my experiences that I had never shared with anyone.  I have never met such a dedicated, understanding group of people that "get it".  I witnessed, not only my own personal transformation, but everyone there shared amazing stories of sacrifice and pain.  It was a great healing experience for us all.  I highly recommend this program for any veteran dealing with service related trauma.

Client Served	5	10/01/2015	As a vet who served in the 60s, and didn't find Vets Journey Home till the 90s, I thought I had dealt with any issues I had around my time in the military. I was very incorrect in that thought. At the VJH weekend I dealt with five major issues I was carrying around with me and minor ones also. I laid them down there with the help of other vets (staff and participants) and non vet volunteers and it changed my life. It continues to have a powerful positive force in my life and I give thanks to those who helped me through the weekend. I have great gratitude for the folks who continue to help vets on VJH weekends and gratitude for the opportunity to volunteer myself. For me, "Volunteer" is a key word in describing the Vets Journey Home. The fact that numerous folks have chosen to take time from their lives (family, friends, leisure, hobbies, loved ones, etc.) to help veterans to get home fully, continues to fill me with hope and gratitude.  The miracles I have witnessed on VJH weekends will stay with me all my days.

Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	258410	4	/users/profile/346901	Gary62	Client Served	5	09/19/2015	I am a MST (Military Sexual Trauma) Survivor, Complex PTSD and am a survivor of multiple Life Involved Traumas.  I have been on a 30 year Suicide mission; until I met my therapist and went to one of the Retreats, which was hosted by Veterans Journey Home.   My therapist and the VA had been trying to get me to agree to group counseling; and until I had experienced the program and processes presented by this Organization I had not a clue of what to expect. During my weekend, in the retreat (which by the way was completely free of financial cost, or expectation of payment of any sort) my only expense was my time and emotional commitment to the process; which did not come easy.      However, during the weekend I crossed so many "Milestones," that I could not even begin to describe. For years I had not been able to sleep on an elevated surface (bed), or in a room with other people;  with the events of the first night and the care, love, compassion, and support of the staff and Instructors, I was able to settle in and found the first night of uninterrupted and uneventful rest/sleep; that I have not had since childhood. The efforts of everyone and care I received in that retreat in February at the Big Bear, Ca. site, was so attentive and full of support that myself and others who participated in that retreat,  formed a bond between all of the participants, staff members and Instructors that I would have never thought was possible between myself and anyone else. I had no idea of what to expect while I was Enroute to the retreat site.  Talking to the person who picked me up, I was told that he was not even going to discuss what the retreat was about or what goes on at the retreat.  He explained that it is different for everyone and that everyone gets something unique and different from the experience.    He could not have been more on target with his description; and I will forever be in his debt for his honesty.    When I returned from my weekend with Vet's Journey Home,  Everyone around me not iced a huge difference in me; including my therapist was not a VA Provider.  She mentioned several times that her job had been made somewhat easier, with the milestones and barriers that the retreat helped me get through.   Since February 2015,  The results of my time at the retreat had somewhat came to be recognized not only by people around me, but also by myself.  The retreat and the efforts of my Therapist in conjunction with the retreat has unlocked so many facets of my life, and my life has become more fulfilled and manageable that I don't believe that this site would have enough band-width to support the documentation, or recounting of. All I know is that giving credit to my therapist, I must also give credit to Veterans Journey Home, it's staff, it's Instructors, and it' s processes have literally saved my life.  Prior to seeking out and accepting this Organizations assistance, I was begging on a daily basis to stop living.  Now, I am finding times that I am celebrating life again. (something else I have not experienced since childhood.)  Thanks Vet's Journey Home! Love You!

But finding out the my grief over losing my twenty-one year old son from an overdose of drugs was causing me more problems than I knew. Good and caring people helped bring me through some of the hardest parts of acceptance in this area.One of the most amazing things was walking into the registration area and finding out that my room-mate for the weekend was also a Shipmate from my Navy days who I had not seen in 32 years! It was more than a coincidence, it was unbelievable. We were not just shipmates we were good friends too! So the re-connection was instant and although it brought back a ton of memories most of them were great and there was a good deal of healing on the weekend. I learned a number of things about my grief, I learned how to look at my relationship with my son in a different light. Just because he wasn't here in the physical sense didn't mean he didn't exist to me anymore. He lives on in my memories and in my heart forever. The staff was caring, competent and really interested in helping. I was asked to go into the weekend with an open mind, that's what I did. I didn't judge what may happen I just tried to allow it and see where it took me. I shared this all in excitement with my wife when I got home, and took it slow in explaining how to connect with our son in a different way. It was a great lesson that I am grateful for and I would love to experience this again to deal with other boulders or blocks that may hamper me from living my life to the fullest. Thank You Vets Journey Home. I appreciate what you do!  - JD

We allow vets a safe, confidential and non-judgemental opportunity to tell their story and get a release from the guilt, shame, and anger that they have harbored for many years. The difference from their first night to graduation is nothing short of amazing.  I give it a 5 star rating.  10 stars would be More appropriate.

I was to represent the women's experience of being receptive and accepting,  during a mostly male workshop. I thought I didn't have any connection to the military except one uncle, but wow, was I surprised at what surfaced for me!!!

VJH does a great job helping vets and family members feel honored for serving and for sacrifices associated with military service. I have staffed retreats on two occasions now. The attendees have been both male and female vets, and some have served in combat zones, some have not. The "work" that takes place is based on processes designed to help vets deal with problematic life issues--service related or not. The aim here is to be of help as these service men and women navigate life's challenges. Vets attend for free. We welcome your support. In addition to staffing, i have also made financial donations.

I asked several Vietnam veterans for ideas, and the name Vets Journey Home quickly came to the top of the list.  I contacted  Founder and Director, Gene McMahon,  who is also a Certified Instructor and Instructor Trainer.  He invited my husband, a Vietnam veteran, to attend as a participant, and me to attend as a staff member.   Gene and his trained staff worked with each veteran, collectively and individually. Within hours,  the participants had bonded like "a band of brothers," already  experiencing changes in their lives.  I witnessed nine veterans who arrived in pain from combat experiences heal throughout the weekend.  By Sunday night, the terrible burden they had carried, some for decades, others for a few years, was lifted.  My decision to support VJH financially and physically was easy.   Vets Journey Home puts veterans back together and makes miracles happen.

We do so much good, and pick up where the VA and other governmental agencies leave our vets with nothing to sustain them. I've heard several grads of the program say that we provide a family, and it's true.

It was started by a Viet Nam veteran that felt a need to welcome home Viet Nam veterans that had gotten no support from the general population. It has morphed into a multi state organization that has brought home many hundreds of Veterans of all services, that have served in war and peace time. A major benefit is the women that attend these weekends. They are able to tell their story in a very safe container. As an instructor for these weekends, I have seen many hurting veterans find the peace they are looking for and have seen them return to the joy that they so richly deserve!

That was the weekend that I started my journey home. I had been lost and shut down for a long time.talking abut my 'Nam experience, and getting out in the open served to start healing the emotional wounds that I have experienced.

The work done at VJH lifts and celebrates veterans in such a way that they often feel it's their first true welcome home.  I was so inspired by the program that I felt compelled to write about it along with  oral histories from Iraq and Afghanistan soldiers returning from war.  I included their program in the book because it reveals the hope that comes from healing wounded hearts.  Anyone who has served deserves this program!  Readers can learn more about it by purchasing my book, Veterans' Journeys Home: Life after Afghanistan and Iraq.  Half of the royalties from this book are donated to VJH!!

It was an intense weekend in Wisconsin's Northwoods.  The campsite was awesome and the food terrific.  The staff/volunteers were so KIND it was almost uncomfortable.  (I got used to it).  The eye to eye contact was also a bit overwhelming to me.   I think the biggest thing I had to work through was staying on task and not switching subjects to avoid my PTSD issues.  And breathing.  The weekend  was exactly as the name of the of the non profit suggests-vets returning home-to their hearts. I am grateful to have attended and I know I have some more healing to do.  It was amazing to watch many hardened vets let go and take off their masks.   I was very appreciative of the free weekend.

VJH allowed me to open myself to the many buried emotions I had as the result of being the child of a vet with PTSD.

The camaraderie, the warm support and welcome experienced within the context of a safe and nourishing environment are just a few of the benefits of participation.   I am now a proud volunteer.

Vets Journey Home is an exceptional opportunity for Veterans to experience a true healing!  I am the volunteer Site Coordinator for the Northwood's Vets Journey Home in May each year at the Camp Bird site in Crivitz WI.  This weekend has truly been a gift and blessing to those who participate in the experience.  We are truly gifted to have this national program available in our local area.  Kudos to Patricia, Gene and the VJH board members!
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	100049	2	/users/profile/121530	Nancy T.	Client Served	5	10/31/2011	My husband and I were both participants and then later were able to volunteer also.  We were blessed with the opportunity to be in the first couples group.  My husband had attended before, but both of us being able to go was fantastic.  He still doesn't talk about "stuff" much, but we were both able to see some of what was happening to each of us without the assistance of Vets Journey home.    The excersizes organized by Sam and the rest of the coordinators of the program provide each individual the opportunity to come out of the shadows and fear.  Even if it's just a step at a time.  They provide a safe atmosphere and encourage trust.  The participants are there for themselves and are not having to worry about anything else for a time.  I would like to mention the food is pretty good too. My husband was the original "victim" , but as his spouse I became another victim who suffered also.  Thanks to Vets Journy Home I was able to find others to talk to and share concerns and fears.  Until you experience the "aloneness" you may not realize how desperate you can become.  Vets Journey Home was able to start us both on the road to recovery.  I thank God this program has been able to expand and take in the secondary victims - spouses and family.  We need more programs like this.  There are so many silently suffering from battles and thinking that there is nothing that can be done.  Vets Journey Home is a Godsend.  They don't promise miracles, but miracles do happen thanks to that program.  Thank you all for your help and support.

I personally started the healing of emotional wounds I've carried for over 20 years, and have witnessed others do the same thing with emotional trauma's they've carried even longer than I have. It's not magic, but it's definiately a life changing experiance, and I recomend this to anyone who spent any time in the military.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	100045	1	/users/profile/34168	dszper	Volunteer	5	10/31/2011	I have staffed Vet's Journey Home several times.  I am a civilian with a family member currently serving in the Middle East.  In addition to the remarkable healing I have witnessed among the Vets in this program, I also experienced deep healing from the emotional trauma of my own experiences watching my friends who went to serve in Viet Nam and how they were changed while I stayed here "safe and sound".   This program is a powerful service to the Veterans who have served our country.  We owe them so much for the sacrifices they have made and continue to make for all of us.

Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99774	1	/users/profile/120839	Larry F.	Board Member	5	10/26/2011	My experience with Vets Journey Home has changed my life and that of my family in an amazingly positive way. I returned from Iraq after a 16 month deployment and thought I would just move right back into my "normal" life as a husband and father. Five years later I woke up one morning and did not recognize the man that was looking at me in the mirror. There were problems in my family because of how I had changed. It was that day I decided I needed some type of help. After participating in the VJH course, I began to move towards a more positive lifestyle. VJH not only gave me hope of a more fulfilled life, it gave me the tools and support to cope with issues that I had bottled up for such a long time. Every day I wake up a happier man. My wife and two daughters are much happier now that they have their "old Larry"" back. Thank you Vets Journey Home for making it possible for me to heal my heart and begin anew! Sincerely, Larry Flaskrud - US Army 14 years of service, WI
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99752		/users/profile/120736	livingspiritually	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2011	This program deserves immense support. I have witnessed transformational experiences in every participant I know who has been through the Vets Journey Home program. This is just as true for staff as it is for participants.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99745		/users/profile/120716	Nance N.	General Member of the Public	4	10/25/2011	I was introduced to this program through my nephew, who went through the VJH program. He is an Iraq vet and was suffering from PTSD. The experience of completing the program made a tremendous difference in his life and in his family's lives. He became more able to adjust back into daily life, enjoy family gatherings, be in crowded places without getting extremely anxious. He could sleep better and found a calling to help other vets do the same.He is now volunteering to work with his brother/sister vets and helping them in their assimilation back to a more normal life after their military experience. This program works with small groups of vets and letting them tell their story in a safe space and to heal some of the wounding from their experience. We owe this to the men and women who fought and continue to fight for our freedoms in all wars.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99738		/users/profile/120699	captainsearch	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2011	I have personally seen very positive results as a result of Vets Journey Home from let's just say a relative.  One who is like a son to me.  He has worked very hard on his PTSD through VJH and has made amazing progress.  His family has benefited greatly, he has become a role model for his family and all around him.  He is positive, energetic, spiritual, engaging, non-judgemental, and very helpful to other veterans.  I couldn't be more proud of him.  We all have Vets Journey Home to thank for his transformation.  I highy recommend the group and the programs that they sponsor.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99705	1	/users/profile/120614	jomamma	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	I am a wife of a veteran that went through the program 3 years ago.  I cannot say enough about this wonderful organization and the many volunteers that offer so much of their time and unconditional love to veterans.  After the vets goes through this weekend experience, they have a graduation ceremony for them where family and friends are invited to come.  I walked into the room prior to the ceremony and chills came over me and tears immediately came rolling down my cheek.  I was filled with a wave of emotion just by entering the room as I knew something had changed.  There were many times before this weekend I considered taking our children and leaving as we didn't know the husband and dad we were living with anymore.  We just as everyone else had expected him to come back just the same man as when he left for Iraq.  This was definitely not the case.   War changes a person no matter what their role; combat or not.  It was such a struggle watching this beautiful soul who is my husband turn into such a different person.  I didn't know who he was anymore and struggled as I didn't want to leave and take the father away from our children even though we didn't know this person anymore.  He tried to burry himself in work, college, and a huge overhaul of our home (all at the same time) to keep his mind occupied.  I adapted and tried to make things as normal as I could for our family.  We started seeing behaviors modeled by our children that we were seeing in him and knew something had to change.  I often remember thinking..."what am I doing wrong?"  He was involved with the VA and were starting to see some results from his counseling there, however there was something missing.  He was realizing the same things.  He discovered VJH and noticed there was a weekend coming near and it was held in the Northern Wisconsin Woods, a perfect setting for him.  I am eternally grateful for the staff and instructors that weekend that gave him their expertise, support, and unconditional love.  It was just the emotional healing that he needed!  This gave him the tools he needed to deal with his PTSD as well as the tools he needed to be the husband and dad we knew he was.  I am glad to report today that our marriage is saved, he is more of a dad than I could have ever asked for, and an amazing person to be able to share my life's journey with.  Please encourage anyone you love to find the nearest program weather they are an OIF/OEF vets, Saudi, Vietnam, Korea, any vet needs to find this program.  I have since had the privilege give back to staff one of these weekends, there were veterans that attended from Vietnam that were STILL holding on to guilt or shame from their tour and were able to release that.  It was so amazing to me to see the look on a veteran participants face on Friday when they arrived and compare it to Sunday at the graduation ceremony...in many cases you wonder if you are looking at the same person.  Incredible and by far one of the best experiences of my life to be privileged to be a part of.  I am happy not only to be there to help the veteran but also to represent and help the families of these veterans that are suffering and most likely suffering silently as we were.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99685		/users/profile/120510	zavman	Board Member	5	10/24/2011	I experienced VJH shortly after my wife and I seperated. VJH helped me gain tools to help me better cope with PTSD and how to deal with post military life. I served in the US Marine Corps and I truly had a hard time adapting to civilian life. I was angry, scared, and frustrated with myself, family, friends, and even my God for the madness I felt on a daily basis. At VJH I found out that I was no longer alone that their were other vets dealing with the same pains as I was. I truly appreciate VJH for their work with Vets. Sincerely, John Zavala Jr. (Board Member VJH Texas)

General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2011	I have had the great privilege to not only meet a retired Marine but to actually get to know him on a deep and personal level.  He has told me about what this organization has done and continues to do for him.  He is now a volunteer having worked two weekends.  Although I haven't had the opportunity to volunteer yet, I do look forward to the day that I can.  I am so thankful for the staff and what they have done for my friend and for so many others.  I recommend this to all vets that have experienced any sort of trauma or life changing experience.

This is an amazing program for veterans that allowed me an opportunity to began my healing process. I am so very grateful to Sam Luna for inviting me to come and be a part of my journey home. Patricia Clason is an amazing woman that every person ever served in our armed forces should meet. Thank You for caring about us. The staff and volunteers were so very kind to me. Words cannot describe the impact this program has had on my recovery. Again, Thank You!
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99587		/users/profile/33959	amomtomany	Volunteer	5	10/21/2011	I staffed Vet's Journey home the first time 6 years ago.  Since that time I have been at more than 12 weekends.  Not only do I have the opportunity to be a small part of the healing that takes place I also am there to listen, love, and welcome the Vet's home with open arms.  VJH has also helped me to feel closer to my son (even though he is far away) who has been deployed many times over the last 10 years. As a family member of a serviceman I get a chance to give back just a little of what they give to our country. This is the most loving, open and welcoming program I have been fortunate to volunteer with in over 30 years of volunteer work. The transformation that takes place for the Veterans is amazing.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99583		/users/profile/120133	bluemarbledesign	Client Served	5	10/21/2011	  I "did" the weekend back in 1997 when it was called The Bamboo Bridge. The name has been changed however the objective and amazing results are the same. After doing the weekend I assisted at several following weekends and found that it didn't matter much whether I was a student of the weekend or an assistant. The healing and growth kept on coming.  I spent a year in Vietnam in a relatively safe environment and realized years later that I had this guilt of not being part of the horrors of battle that affected so many others that were over there. The weekend helped me actually see what really mattered. I did the best job that I could do with the tasks that I was given. I realized that my duty from that point on was to honor every person that was and is in the service for standing up and doing what they are asked to do. I often ask the men and women that didn't make it back during the year I was there if I am living up to there expectations. I really feel that they deserve the best out of me as they gave up all that they could be keeping me safe over there.  They'll let me know if i did ok when we all get together again.
Vets Journey Home USA, Inc.	99578	1	/users/profile/120118	DaveShep	Board Member	5	10/21/2011	I started out w/ Vets Journey Home as a volunteer & staffed my first weekend in the spring of 2009. I saw the powerful difference it made in the lives of the participants & thanks to Gene, received healing that I didn't even know I needed after my time in the Navy in the early '80s. Since then, I've staffed each weekend that's taken place here in Maryland. Each time reinforces why I support VJH - because it definitely helps heal the wounds of the soul that veterans & others impacted by the trauma of war have received. I cannot recommend the weekend enough for those struggling with the aftereffects of war.

International Children's Fund	318980	1	/users/profile/410308	Writer	Donor	5	11/16/2016	What a fantastic and inspiring organization!  This summer several of our volunteers had the opportunity to attend an I.C.F. Brat Fry.  Not only did we have the chance to observe their process, but to witness their passion and dedication in doing God's work.  It was truly heartwarming to see how we in part, are able to help this cause.  We could not be more proud or honored to work with such a wonderful organization.  De Pere Christian Outreach

International Children's Fund	314567	1	/users/profile/243843	Irene Elizabeth	Donor	5	10/26/2016	Love this charity!   I am very careful about what charities I support.   I want the money I give to be used for those who truly need it and not to those in charge .  There is too much of that in a lot of charities.  I have seen the warehouse and office that ICF works out of.  It is very basic.  No frills at all.  I have checked on Charity Navigator and was pleased to see almost one hundred percent of what I give goes to those in need.  That's what I call a topnotch organization!   I not only give money but volunteer when I can.
International Children's Fund	230841	1	/users/profile/243843	Irene Elizabeth	Donor	5	10/30/2014	ICF is a wonderful organization that puts the needs of others first.  They not only send food, clothing, medical supplies and more but most importantly they have partners in Africa that expose the people they are helping to the gospel of Jesus Christ.  I am thankful that I can afford to send a contribution to people in need.  So it was very important to me to be sure that the money I send is not being used for anything but that!  I checked Charity Navigator and when I read that ICF has a 5 star rating that verified that this was an excellent organization.I have had the opportunity to visit the warehouse from where the items are sent.  I have seen the small two person office in this old warehouse.  Instead of spending money given to them on improving their working conditions they give to those much less fortunate.  This is an excellent organization!
International Children's Fund	186836	1	/users/profile/243843	Irene Elizabeth	Donor	5	10/31/2013	Very good charity!  Over the years I did not realize that a great amount of donations go to those who are in charge of the charity and very little goes to those in great need.  When I found out about ICF I was impressed that nearly 100% goes to those in need.  When I send my donation it pleases me and I am sure it pleases our Lord that this organization is working not only to feed, clothe and teach others but more importantly to tell them about the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

International Children's Fund	314560	1	/users/profile/244049	Thomas30	Board Member	5	10/26/2016	I have been with ICF over 20 years and there never seems to be a dull moment.  The things that the org does to help the needy is overwelming to me sometimes in that I don't know how we get the work done with such a small amount of volunteers!   It is a real JOY to get a call from the office and hear "we have a container to load can you be available on such and such a day?   I can't wait to get down and meet with the guys...  I am so blessed to be a part of this truely Godly ministery and the things we are able to get done with the support of our donors.... 
International Children's Fund	261701		/users/profile/244049	Thomas30	Board Member	5	10/05/2015	ICF started with a committed man who had a vision to help people around the world and it just so happened the Lord spoke to him about Africa.... The rest is history.  He has been at it well over 35 years and and with the dedicated volunteers, there is no stopping him until Jesus comes home to take him or we are all carried out in the rapture.   I personally have been with the organization for about 20 years.... Wouldn't change a thing!!!!!! 
International Children's Fund	228238	3	/users/profile/244049	Thomas30	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I have been full time volunteering with ICF for over 15 years now and it just seems to get better and better with the new faces that come in to help and certainly the oldies too.  First I think, we know the reason we are doing it and then the attutude of the volunteers is amazing as they are asked at times to do some pretty diffucult things.  That is where the rubber hits the road on the stick i out attitude comes in.  We love what we do and why we do it.  It is as simple as that.  It is hard to find willing people to have a stick to it attitude when so many other things can be distracting.  The "work" cannot get done without the help.  Feed the hungry, clothing the naked, giving them, shelter and giving them the Gospel is truly what it is all about.  We will burn out and not rust out, is our motto!!!!!  PTL

Without sounding predigous, This  org is one of the best of its kind!  Friendly help.  Always have FUN doing what we like to do and the volunteers that come in, are truly the best!  We are always changed for the better after leaving the warehouse from doing the work that needs to get done.   The joking around with everyone envolved helps us take the edge off and makes everyone feel comfortable while getting the work done.  I am truly blessed to be a part of the org. ICF.  
International Children's Fund	309985	1	/users/profile/401334	LANNF	Board Member	5	10/12/2016	I have been with the organization since 2007.  It has been a pleasure and a true blessing to see the faces that have been helped and to get to know first hand the partners ICF works with overseas.  I especially love that over 98% of every dollar given goes directly to those we serve.  What other organization can say that?  Trust is key and donors can believe that their support is truly making a difference in countless lives.

I am not only impressed by the incredible faith, compassion and sacrifice of these two wonderful human beings, but have also become a donor by designating a significant portion of our annual family giving to ICF. Lori and Dave, along with their dedicated team of volunteers, set a wonderful example of how an organization dedicated to serving others should be run.They are truly doing God's work on earth and are angels among us.

International Children's Fund	295566	2	/users/profile/244528	GhansahEY	Client Served	5	07/12/2016	I have been associated with ICF for almost twenty years now. I have nothing but praise for them. Through them we have supplied quality medicines and medical supplies to hospitals  and health facilities even in remote parts of my country. New and better orphanage buildings have been constructed, not to mention food items and clothing supplied to the needy. Currently we have finished drilling an hundred and sixty feet deep well for an orphanage to provide them with good clean water. All I can say is God bless International Children's Fund.
International Children's Fund	187507		/users/profile/244528	GhansahEY	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	I came in contact with this organisation through its founder in 1999. I have since worked with them in helping to build orphanges and delivering their shipments to needy institutions such as orphanages, rehab centres, hospitals and clinics in cities and remote rural communities of my country and even our national disaster management organisation and MOH in my region. These shipments have come in the form of food, medicines, medical supplies, clothing, vehicles, etc.  What an opportunity to work with such faithful and committed servants who make sure you properly account for all donations received and visit to check on your work to see that reports are a true reflection of what is being done on the ground. I would rate them highly and say thumps up all people for ICF.

International Children's Fund	261803		/users/profile/350437	Writer	Donor	5	10/06/2015	The cheery voice of the Founder of International Children's Fund comes over the airwaves of my car radio as I make my highway commute to church each Sunday. He opens the broadcast for the weekly updates about International Children's Fund with the familiar greeting "Good news!!, Good news!!" and then makes every moment count as he dives into the interesting facts and tales of what the organization is up to, who he was meeting with, difficulties being encountered by people of other countries, and what is coming up in the future for ICF and how we can help. He then turns to his co-host and President,  and she adds more interesting information about what was happening with the things she is involved with. Their passion is contagious and full of facts and HOPE!!!I began hearing that they were actually located not too far from me - and I made a promise to myself to stop by to see about how I could make a donation, to meet them if that was possible. This is after all "INTERNATIONAL" Children's Fund....like the people at the top would have time to meet with me - someone who making a donation. This place sounded like such a "well-run machine"! Huge! I was pretty sure meeting them would be out of the question, but one could hope! The day came and I set off to see what one of these places is like. I took with me some things I heard they were looking to send in their next container shipment overseas. I had some school supplies and I wanted to make a donation.  I arrived at this enormous brick factory-like building, I pulled into the parking lot, walked up to the door and went toward the office. There was loads and loads of stuff to be packed. I was told their dedicated crew of highly experienced packers could get these containers packed in no time flat and when they finished you'd be lucky to squeeze in an extra piece of paper. Making the most of EVERYTHING was top priority here, by everyone. They are PRO's at making  everything count!! They have been at this long enough that nothing at all goes to waste. Incredibly, I got to meet the Founder and the President that day! Unreal!! The timing just happened to be right and they were able to give me  a little background of ICF. I learned that the Founder has personally accompanied containers to their destinations. He and the President work directly with the people receiving the donated goods. This is a hard working, dedicated group of folks that does the work of many on a shoestring budget! They have successfully carried this out for many, many years now. I pray you will help this group continue this much needed work of getting supplies, food, medicine, clothing, and goods into the hands of the people that desperately need them!! They have consistently  received  very very high ratings from Charity Navigator over the years. They are a wonderful charity - please consider helping them to help others.
International Children's Fund	261714		/users/profile/290931	Kristiane K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2015	I was lucky enough to get to know all the good folks involved with this charity and saw myself how all the volunteers worked so hard to load up containers bound for Africa - it was amazing!  All the people involved with this wonderful charity give freely of their personal time to ensure that the goods are packed properly and shipped overseas to help those in need.  They also showed the local folks in Africa how to dig wells, since water contamination from domestic animals is quite frequent there.  They are responsible for providing the poor with mosquito nets so that the spread of malaria can be halted, saving many lives.   Yes, this charity is wonderful with the great works that it does for the underprivileged, and the leadership, Dr. Dave Bruenning and Ms. Lori Fulcer are simply amazing people who are totally dedicated to the mission of the charity.
International Children's Fund	227202	2	/users/profile/290931	Kristiane K.	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	I was fortunate enough to get to know Dr. David Bruenning a number of years ago and helped to found his German organization for ICF - a bit later on, I also got to meet volunteers in Neenah that work on behalf of this charity, pro bono.  I was able to see how they load up containers bound for Africa - and found them to be amazingly well organized and professional.  Lori Fulcer is a wonderful leader and has been Dr. Dave's right hand person for a number of years (of course in addition to his wife Marcy).  This is one charity I would heartily recommend to prospective donors - the good that it does in Africa, showing people there how to become self-sufficient, how to dig wells away from domestic animals, building schools for the children, turning a container into a library by putting it on its side, filling it with shelves and books for people to read who would otherwise have no opportunity to do so - simply marvelous acts of charity!

International Children's Fund	261621	1	/users/profile/350239	Writer	Donor	5	10/05/2015	I am personally acquainted with the leaders of ICF and can vouch for their great concern and compassion for the peoples of Africa.  They see the need and commit to help, by way of driving wells, taking medicine, filling containers with clothing and food, taking mosquito netting, and on and on.  They go into ebola and malaria areas of the world to help the most needy without worrying about self safety.  ICF is worthy of my support and yours.
International Children's Fund	261490	1	/users/profile/350105	Writer	Donor	5	10/04/2015	Great charity.  Dave and crew still sort and load donations and show you what they do with it.this is one charity that I know keeps the overhead cost low.  A true non profit.
International Children's Fund	261405	2	/users/profile/292786	Dawn94	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2015	My children love putting together shoeboxes every October to donate to ICF to bless the children they assist with holiday gifts.  When we drop the donations off they are so grateful and make our kids feel so good about being giving people.  They are a wonderful organization and are well respected in our community.
International Children's Fund	229124	3	/users/profile/292786	Dawn94	Donor	5	10/28/2014	We continue to support ICF because we know that every penny donated is used to help those way less fortune than us.  The leaders Dave and Lori are wonderful, Christian people who are well respected in our community. My children love putting together their shoe box every year for a child in Africa for Christmas.  ICF has helped us show them how good it feels to give to others.
International Children's Fund	261290	1	/users/profile/349888	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	Please consider taking your clothes, blankets, medical supplies, anything that can be used in 3rd world countries.  ICF delivers full semis to many people displaced in camps.  We have so much in the USA, and these people have nothing.  There are no high paid CEO's, in fact most of the work is done by volunteers.  They also take school supplies, books that aren't X rated, pots and pans, bikes.  If you have sewing machines that don't need electricity please consider ICF.  ICF also sends tons of packaged food over, so they could use any donation. Just think if you had nothing, what could you use?  ICF will send it.  It's easy to find - about 1 mile from Hwy 41.  No, I am not employed by them, when I found out what they do I try to take items there as the need is great.  
International Children's Fund	261066	1	/users/profile/349658	Writer	Donor	5	10/02/2015	Great local charity! Trusted, hardworking and fun group.

I am greatly honored to support ICF! 
International Children's Fund	260800	1	/users/profile/349388	Writer	Advisor	5	10/01/2015	As a outside observer and annual contributor to this charity, I am consistently amazed at the work and reach that this organization provides. The ICF exhibits an inordinately high ratio of program services provided against contributions. And the organization accomplishes this with nearly all volunteers, emphasizing Christian principles of serving others to provide basic needs that all people deserve: food, clothing, clean water and a place to live. The ICF is a 4-Star charity in every respect.
International Children's Fund	260348	1	/users/profile/348934	whitelake	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	Great organization, great people, caring and very money minded, always looking for ways to save and stretch every penny to the max.

International Children's Fund	230677	1	/users/profile/294303	lcjoettel	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	I've been with ICF for over 35 years.  As I look back over the years all the people we have helped I am thankful that I could be one to help in this work.  Now that we have started to work in Haiti I'm looking forward to doing more work there.  ICF has built five homes.  Praying that we will be able to continue to build more in the future.
International Children's Fund	228914	2	/users/profile/292591	NaturalHealthyConcepts	Donor	5	10/28/2014	I've have never seen such a fiscally responsible charity that goes above and beyond to make sure all donations get to the people they serve.  They walk the talk and work tirelessly to do the job! If more people and charities were like them, the world would be a much better place! Blessed to know them!
International Children's Fund	227933	2	/users/profile/291644	Brian115	Donor	5	10/27/2014	We have been a neighboring tenant for the past two years and the ICF is such a refreshing organization.  Dave, Lori and all the volunteers are excellent and its obvious they care about making a real difference.  All of our donations go their way...and so should yours! =)
International Children's Fund	227901	2	/users/profile/291618	RichardF	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I believe in ICF 100% because the organization uses their resources fully. Anyone can donate food and medical supplies but ICF follows up to be sure the items donated are getting to the people with the most need. On a personal note, I donated a boat and was actually able to see it in photos and in a report that it was being used to help people in need! To know that what is given is being used by those that it is intended to is what I love about the organization.  What a blessing and wonderful cause. 
International Children's Fund	227739	3	/users/profile/291463	Crystal58	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I chose this charity to donate to based on their great record. I have been sending a monetary gift each month for the last few years and feel my donation is well spent. 
International Children's Fund	227720	3	/users/profile/291446	Susan354	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I came across ICF approximately a year ago through a mutual friend and I got involved once I did my homework on ICF and I was impressed.  I met Dr. David Bruenning, the Founder, and spoke to Lori, the President, and the two of them are wonderful Christians.  What impressed me most about ICF is the monies they receive from donations, the items they collect, go directly toward their missions and I am so happy to be able to partner with ICF.  ICF exceeds my expectations of any charity I ever was involved in.   I plan to continue to partner with ICF until my Lord and Savior decides to call me home.  Thank you Dr. David Bruenning and Lori Fulcer for all you do and to all the volunteers, donors, etc....together we can make a difference and are making a difference.  Blessings, Susan

International Children's Fund	227649	3	/users/profile/243593	Dave N.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have been volunteering for years at ICF. Great group of people. Example as of recent. The partners in Liberia re working directly to help feed the Ebola stricken people there so as a result shipping containers to the region have been going out at about the rate of one a week lately to keep supplies flowing. However the BEST part of all. Is the opportunity that they have on the ground to share the salvation found only thru Jesus Christ .     Can I get an AMEN!!! :)  
International Children's Fund	186582	2	/users/profile/243593	Dave N.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	A friend clued me into ICF several years ago. I liked the notion that they can make use of many things that others will consider useless. (i.e.  used but functional items from tools to crayons)   One day I was asked if I could give a hand to pick up some clothes from a nearby thrift store. I volunteered when available back then now I arrange my schedule around the needs they may have whenever possible.  As I learned more of what is accomplished with so little overhead I was changed from a donor, to a volunteer, to an advocate.   If you have had any doubts as to the impact of this organization I will simply say to check it out a bit closer. You wont be disappointed. 
International Children's Fund	227485	3	/users/profile/291216	Paul151	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	This group is committed to their mission, laser focused on helping those in need and above board in all they do.  So grateful to work with them and to see others do the same.
International Children's Fund	227475	3	/users/profile/291206	Patty U.	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I have known Dr. David Bruenning and the work of the International Children's Fund for 30 years. I have been very impressed with the work he and his Board have done over these years.  The addition of Lori Fulcer as President of ICF has added to the impressive list of aid and assistance  ICF has provided to those who need a helping hand up.  This has been accomplished by meeting real needs with real necessities. They have done this work around the world from a small office located in the midwest with people  that join them in partnership to make a real difference in the world.    
International Children's Fund	227425	2	/users/profile/291154	TrevorDouglas	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I have known Dr. David Bruenning over 26 years.  God has used him in so many ways to help people all over the world and so them Christ thru example.  I was shocked to find that he did not draw a personal salary for decades.  The money that is donated goes to the causes.  Not like some other organizations where you are lucky if 10 cents on the dollar actually makes it to the causes.   International Children's Fund is amazing, they do so much...they teach the people how to fish, not just giving them the fish.  They drill fresh water wells, teach the locals how to farm and raise livestock.  In one case ICF help build a brick factory so that people could sell the bricks to a construction firm, with that money they could build a church a school and more.  ICF helps make them self sufficient.  Now with Ebola hitting Liberia, ICF is shipping medical supplies and HAZMAT suits and doing all they can to help.  ICF walks the talk and they always have!

And I found out though a mutual friend she helps with ICF and I immediately wanted to help, I got to help once and wow was it fun we drove in this. Truck up  to crivitz area to pick up books to deliver to Africa! It was so nice to know instead of the landfill children somewhere could use these books.  ICF has a lot of amazing people volunteering there, you always feel like you have been there before! Love this group of people.  I also like the brat frys!  A and w fundraiser nights!

International Children's Fund	187306	2	/users/profile/244301	david-2013	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I have been involved with this organization for about 2 years, I have found it to have a love for those they help, and show respect and compassion to all.  They are a fun group, yet hard working, very organized and have great relations with other organization they work with to be able to complete their ministry unto the Lord Jesus. They are people of prayer and dedication. I have somewhat known the director, David B. for more than 20 yrs, and find him and this organization faithful in Christ. I so much enjoy being apart of this group.
International Children's Fund	187255	1	/users/profile/244254	Paula42	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have always been very cautious of charities or organizations. The whole pretense of what is said and what really happens too my hard earned money that i want too see do more good for others, ends up in the pockets of the top people in the organization..and helps them build million dollar homes. But that turns me too the reason why i am writing this today. At a time when i was travelling around the US i was able too see many organizations of various types at work. But i had never seen an organization with such a broad understanding of what the needs of so many children under dire circumstances needed..From a piece of clothing too medicine, to a bowl of rice. From books to churches. And the ones that coordinate everything not only make the plans they travel too these destinations too make sure it does. The money goes where the money is stated. It is more than self evident. I would never give too another organization without checking into everything first. And i know IFC welcomes that you do that indeed. I proudly volunteer when i am able. And nothing can replace the joy in my heart when doing so... this is such an amazing organization fighting to provide the needs we here completely take for granted,, 
International Children's Fund	187223	1	/users/profile/244221	Kenya0828	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	My daughter and I have helped out with ICF. It was great for her to learn more and get an understanding that the world is as she sees it, and their are people hurting for help. With this growl up she was able to get a better understanding and we have attended event they have had. I believe this is a great organization and I would recommend to people as I already have in the past. :)

International Children's Fund	187035	1	/users/profile/244036	THOMAS CHAIRMAN	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	I have been with ICF for over 15 years. It has been some of if not most blessed times of my life volunteering with ICF. The people I work with are/have the best spirit I have ever experienced. The work gets done with enthusium and fun and most of the times, there is never a dull moment. After work is done, the organization treats the volunteers to lunch as a token of appreciation for there support. It is truly, in my opinion one of the few of this kind that gets the most for the least!!! The donors are GREAT and are amazed at what gets done for the little amount of money that is spent for expenses. Truly frugal with their money. 
International Children's Fund	186787	2	/users/profile/243791	Dave and Linda	Donor	5	10/31/2013	We learned of ICF through Charity Navigator several years ago when we was checking into how various charities utilize their donations.  ICF had an amazing rating then and still does today.  They have become our favoriate charity.  We live about 100 miles away, but have made numerous trips to their facility to deliver donations.  They operate on a shoestring using volunteers and donated services.  Nearly 99% of everything donated goes directly to those in need.  They have established clinics, orphanages, libraries, schools and so much more in several countries in Africa.  Each month the volunteers come together and fill a huge shipping container to the brim with donated practical items that many of us take foregranted here, but that are so needed and valued there.  These items cross the ocean and go directly to those in need.  There are so many ways to help, and our whole family has gotten involved.   In the fall each year, we put together 70+ shoebox gifts packed with goodies to go the children in these countries at Christmas.  It is a wonderful feeling to know that some child will probably get to open and enjoy their very first Christmas gift.    ICF is so effective and efficient.  I can't say enough good about them.

International Children's Fund	147260		/users/profile/194548	Terry34	Donor	5	12/26/2012	I chose this charity to donate to for many reasons: 1. Its focus on children internationally.  2. Its high rating on charity navigator. 3. Its a local based charity (I live in Wisconsin). 4. 98.6% of its expenses are for the program itself. 5. The CEO only takes 0.06% of expenses as compensation.  6. The other positive reviews written about this charity
International Children's Fund	126096		/users/profile/54359	encycloman	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	These people really DO have a heart for their mission. They do not try and make themselves rich, but instead try hard to make every donation go as far as possible.
International Children's Fund	53277		/users/profile/54359	encycloman	Volunteer	5	09/24/2010	I have seen this organization grow over 35 years. I personally know the founder, and canstate that this is one of the best organizations I know. This group sends more aid and help for each dollar than any other I know, and uses people who are already citizens of each country they help. They are especially good at getting donated supplies and equipment to those who need. NONE of their gifts end up on the black market being re-sold. They have gotten commendation letters from leaders of those countries as well.If you are looking to help Africa (especially), and want your money to go to where it will help, rather than an expensive head office, salaries, etc. then this is the place to give!

I was shocked at the difference in quality.  Musical Pathways is amazing!  The teachers are phenomenal.  They are well trained and have a strong background in music and the development  of the young child.  They are not only interested in having fun and passing along a love of music, but are very focused on helping you help your child grow physically and mentally within the classroom and without.

Not only has it helped me bond with my children individually, but the teachers and support staff constantly display a level of care and compassion for their students and families that goes beyond what would be expected from a music and movement class. My sons loved their classes, but it is through kindermusik that I am really seeing my daughter shine. She is developing social skills, critical thinking skills, and physical abilities, all through this program. The teachers are well-trained, continually helping us by describing what is happening inside our children's brains as they play. Kindermusik is the best hour of our week!

When I learned of the science behind Kindermusik, and how it helps the brain's neurological pathways connect and develop more successfully, that sealed the deal for this mom.  Our home is almost always a musical experience as one or both of them are singing and dancing nearly all of the time, and in the car too!  The teachers are incredibly knowledgeable and WONDERFUL with the children, AND the parents!

We have learned so much about child development from all of the helpful information they provide and explain during the Kindermusik classes.   We have also been blessed to be able to take part in their Parent Education courses (Conscious Discipline)  over the past 4 years.  Musical Pathways is truly a wonderful organization with Educators who care deeply about all of the Parents and their Children (the clients they serve.)   I also really like that they put the profits right back into the organization in order to help those who are less fortunate to be able to experience their Kindermusik program, (which helps to develop all 6 regions of the child's brain - cognitive, language/speech, social, physical, emotional, and musical development.)    
Musical Pathways Foundation Inc	126963		/users/profile/97957	Colleen Kenney	Client Served	5	10/18/2012	Kindermusik classes at Musical Pathways Foundation (MPF) are the best thing I have ever done for (and with) my children.  A friend whose child had been in it for about a year recommended it, so I started my daughter Clare in classes right then, when she was 15 months old. The activities in the weekly Kindermuisk classes at MPF foster nurturing and bonding between me and my daughter, but at the same time she has fun, while the activities & curriculum provide learning opportunities in the areas of cognitive, physical, emotional, language, and musical development.   Throughout each year of her classes, Clare easily learned many skills that have proven important for achieving success in school.  Clare is now 5 yrs old and received her first report card.   She excelled in every aspect of social and emotional development as well as mathematical development.  Her teacher told me that Clare listens well, shows empathy, and had good self discipline skills.  I know for a fact that she learned all of these valuable skills at Musical Pathways Foundation.  My son Jack is also in the Kindermusik program at MPF, we started when he was two months old.  I love being able to bond with him in such a warm and caring classroom environment.  He enjoys the take-home instruments, books, and cds that give us a chance to play and learn more together at home, in between our weekly classes.  I also appreciate the weekly e-newsletter that MPF also sends, which has helpful child development information for all ages and stages.  MPF is such an important part of our lives, and brings our family so much joy, that I highly recommend it to anyone who has children!  ALSO, because of all of my positive experiences with MPF over the past 5 years, I choose to help out the Foundation by volunteering my time to help coordinate as well as work at their annual Fundraising events.

I see that the "Foundations of Learning" that are instilled each week in our classes are helping my children to grow cognitively, physically and emotionally.  And it warms my heart to know that as a not-for-profit organization, MPF gives back to the people it serves in many ways, such as new programs and education for not only children but parents and elders, too...  They also provide free or minimal cost classes to those who can't afford it, so that the benefits are truly recognized by families in need.

She even gave me ideas as a parent how to tailor what we were learning in class to my daughter's learning style.  Now, when we go to Kindermusik, my daughter gets so excited and starts to dance around the room. She picks up anything I put into a song so quickly. It is so amazing, I feel like Kindermusik is helping me give my daughter what will hopefully be a life long love of learning by making it FUN! This is an amazing program that I would tell any parent to try.

Musical Pathways Foundation Inc	87256		/users/profile/97891	Mdsats	Client Served	5	04/26/2011	I am a parent of 2 Musical Pathways students.  We LOVE the program.  When our youngest was a toddler, we were amazed at how quickly he picked up on the lessons.  Before we knew it, he was saying the word "high" in a high pitch and "low" in a deep voice.  We knew we would enroll our youngest as well.  He enjoys the interaction with the other students, is learning to share and take turns.  We are having a wonderful time in class, and taking the fun songs home.  And he is in love with Miss Amy.  She is wonderful with the little ones!  Our little guy lays on his back and takes his legs up and down just like Miss Amy does, and he looks at us with a big smile on his face as he sings "up/down" in rhythm.  The great thing is that he really understand the concept and says up on each step going up and down as he climbs down the stairs.  Our 4yr old is enjoying class with Miss Ann.  She captures his attention and gets him to focus during class.  I appreciate that she gives the children choices, and I know find myself giving him the same kind of choices at home.  "It's time to get dressed, you can pick out your clothes, or I can."I love the singing and movement that we do in class, but I really value that my children & I are learning how they learn, and they are learning self-control...when it's time to stop dancing, singing or playing.  Oh, and another great benefit is the clean-up song!  We sing that at home all the time and they know that it's time to put toys away---how great is that for 2 little boys?

This foundation has the most complete developmental offerings for both parents and children that I have ever encountered.  They offer Kindermusik, a whole-child development program, for parents with children ages 0-7, and the way the Foundation offers this programming goes above and beyond a typical Kindermusik class - it is a one-stop shop for early childhood developmental questions and play.  Elite Artistry is the division of the Foundation dedicated to nurturing students in a private studio format, but again following the child to develop a life-long love of the instrument vs. an early childhood experience only.  Elite Artistry is for ages 7 to adult - it's never to late to develop your love of music.  Lastly, the Foundation offers parent study clubs on topics such as Conscious Discipline.   What a benefit to be able to discuss and enjoy learning how we can best incorporate discipline with our children. Priceless!
Musical Pathways Foundation Inc	87229		/users/profile/97861	Amber L.	Client Served	5	04/26/2011	Kindermusik has been so much more than a music class for my 4-year-old son.  He's been in class for 2 years, and these are just some of the skills he has learned: how to get along with other kids in a cooperative setting; inhibitory control (learning that if you stop doing something fun now, the toy or activity will come back later); tempo of music, and that it can change; how to move his body to music; imagination and story-telling ability; personal confidence; a love of music and singing.  Musical Pathways, specifically, is so engaged that I can hardly believe it. Every week we receive a detailed email, telling parents what skill your child is learning that specific week. Often, it's not obvious from the class activities - it just looks like pure fun! But the email will tell us what social, spatial reasoning, singing, self-control, imaginative skill that we are building this week. The emails also detail where we are in the developmental continuum over the 7 years that Kindermusik is available to each child.  For me as his mother, Kindermusik has literally changed the trajectory of my parenting. I have learned how to let go of the tension of wondering why he is not at a certain milestone that I make up in my head.  Instead, I learn to meet David where he is at the moment, engage with him in a fun and playful way, and then guide him to whatever the activity is that I want him to try. I use this approach every day in my parenting, as well as giving choices, i.e. "Do you want to put your coat on upstairs, or downstairs?" as opposed to "Get ready to go now! I told you a thousand times!" I have also learned that music education is a journey worth savoring, and that the most important element of any education is teaching kids to LOVE learning. Kindermusik is an experience that every, and I do mean, every parent of a young child should invest in. It will change your family for the better.

I've watched him develop over the course of a year and a half.  He has an appreciation for music, he loves to dance and just started singing, too.  He loves the music (provided to participants on CD) that accompanies the class - more than most of the adult music I play.  Some of the songs are sung by children, and I think he relates to that.  Songs or rhymes sometimes involve silly noises, which are a big hit at his current age.  As a new parent, I appreciate learning rhymes and songs I can continue to sing to/with my child.  Some of the songs I had forgotten from childhood - the reminder was helpful.   I can't say enough about the opportunities this organization provides children and parents to experience music.

Our traditional school system offers little to continue this type of education.  The Conserve school has an incredible environmentally based education program.  Not only are their academics second to none they use it in a way to educate students in regards to the responsibility as stewards of this great Earth of ours, and have fun doing it!!  I highly recommend this school to anyone who is interested in an outstanding educational experience.

I spent possibly the best 4.5 months of my life there in 2013 as a sophomore in high school. At Conserve we were outside everyday in our classes and with friends in a beautiful wilderness setting. We had group projects and activities planned on weekends, like a trip to the Rhinelander goodwill or just mountain biking the trails on campus. The opportunities and experience you get there will leave you centered and full of ideas for the rest of high school or college! The community aspect is huge because you are living and learning with 60 other people who will become your family, and the fact that we have diverse interests but all looked at the environmental issues of our time with critical minds for solutions. 10/10 would recommend it for all 11th and 10th graders- let yourself live outside and surrounded by friends while learning a lot!

Coming from a small public school I was incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to learn alongside such amazing peers! Having students and teaches who actually WANTED to be the and wanted to learn all of the things in the curriculum made all the difference in having a great experience and learning new things.

Conserve School	203994	7	/users/profile/266027	kbcibelli	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	Our son recently attended the Spring semester.  His experience was life changing.  He left his sending private school with a very high GPA and very involved in high school sports and a very busy schedule for a complete change of pace and life in the north woods.  As a sophomore, we worried he would be able to handle life on his own and manage his own schedule.  He did that and more.  The academics were challenging, but in such a unique way.  Each day was an "experience" rather than just going to school.  He couldn't wait to tell us about how they re-enacted whatever book they were reading, or about a science experiment or writing assignment.  This in itself was such a change from his sending school where he rarely spoke about school in general.  Here, he was excited to share his experiences.  The staff became family and his new friends are truly life-long ones.  He learned, matured and realized that he can be on his own and be successful and as a parent this is one of those prideful moments where you can look back and say you must have done something right.  The experience changed his life and we can't recommend it enough!

When I arrived at the school I was so very refreshed by all of the people who surrounded me. Because of my homeschooling background I was already accustomed to people thinking outside of the box, but the teachers and the students that I met at Conserve were above and beyond this. I felt so invigorated and inspired by the people around me. But while I believe that it's the people who make an experience the surrounding environment is not to be overlooked at all. I spent hours outside wandering around the lakes, sitting and talking, rolling down the sledding hill, taking pictures of the fall colors and the glistening ice on the lakes, reading in the climbing tree, stargazing at night, and so much more. Rolling out of bed in the morning to go to classes was totally worth it. EVERYTHING I did at Conserve was hands-on-feet-in and I loved every second, but it was the people I met. I still keep in touch with the friends I've made and I've even visited some of them! The semester was indeed life changing according to the box that I just checked and that's an understatement. I can't imagine not experiencing the things that I did at Conserve. I wouldn't have it any other way.

These people actually made me think - after being the smartest person in the room my whole freshman year, i now felt my mind being stimulated in so many exciting ways by people that were so much more clever than me.Everyone asks how it was, and i always respond with ,"It changed my life."

The Field Instruction class (for gym credit) taught me how to hang a bear bag, the importance of filtering water, and how to pack a frame backpack to protect your back and be able to fit everything you need. At the beginning of the semester, I was nervous about the prospect of going on camping solos-- 24 hours alone in the wilderness-- but after almost three months of preparation, I felt completely comfortable living on my own.  My favorite thing about Conserve School is that although it feels like we're just there to dance through the forest and sing songs, we were still able to receive the education we needed to progress our high school career. I learned a lot more than in the traditional setting of my local high school, and I enjoyed learning more. The topics we covered were interesting and applicable. It never felt like I was wasting my time when I was in class. The friends I made at Conserve are the closest and best friends I've ever had. I was able to grow at Conserve, and the family I made there was able to grow with me. Leaving campus after graduation on the last day was so hard. But now, I had friends across the US, and the friendships I made will last me the rest of my life. One semester really can make a world of difference in the Northwoods. I can't recommend it enough.

The success of having staff members attend a conference on innovative education can partially be measured in the number and quality of sessions attended, being a presenter at a session with good audience feedback, the notes taken, and the techniques, computer software, and new ideas learned. All of those things have been a huge success! However, there are other factors that can also determine the success of attending that just cant be measured. Because my small school district encourages educational options, it is more important than ever for us to be able to make connections with schools and people that are also striving to innovate and create new opportunities for student learning. Attendance at these conferences successfully provides staff members with countless collaborations, including helping to foster and grow the Innovative Schools Network itself - the great nonprofit, teacher-driven organization that puts on the conferences!

I don't often find myself having extra money, but when I do, I try and send it here. I know, without question, that every single cent will be used to help someone in need. I imagine real items, like a bed, a wheel chair or a repaired car being given to a family that needs it.  It means a lot to be that my donation is not lost in administrative fees, but becomes something tangible. I wish I could give six stars.......
The Time Is Now to Help	261487	1	/users/profile/350102	Todd40	Donor	5	10/04/2015	This is by far my favorite nonprofit. In my humble opinion, Sal, his family and all the other volunteers are candidates for saint hood. Each time I donated I always knew every cent went to help a real person. You can't really say that about too many places these days.  I wish I could rate them 10 stars.......

They help people in our surrounding communities and that is a comfort.  Not only is it a totally charitable group, but I get my tax document every month for my donations.  I am not a large contributor, but it is important for me to do what I can.  To know that I am able to make a big difference in my community because my donations are added to many others is extremely satisfying!!! They are supported and recognized by many other larger charitable groups because of the tireless work of Sal Dimiceli and his family.  Sal has devoted his life to helping others.

I reached out to them for help with my son obtaining a wheelchair and received a call back within a couple days.  Sal not only took much time to talk with me and my son, he bought my son Michael a brand new wheelchair and had much needed repairs on his van taken care of so my son would have a safe van to travel with his daughters and back and forth from doctors appointments.  I had the opportunity to meet Sal and his family and the love they have for people I can't even express.  So loving, giving, caring, devotion, selfless and God fearing people.

The Time Is Now to Help	140684		/users/profile/186888	forthewildones	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	The Time is Now is an exceptional organization run by compassionate, intelligent professionals who volunteer ALL of their time for the sake of the less-fortunate among us.  Thanks to this organization, there are thousands of stories to be told that start with homelessness, poverty and despair that end with hope and promise for a better life.  Everything good you have read about the Time is Now is true.  Every penny you give goes directly to those who need it.  Like everyone else who knows the founders personally, I am in awe of the depth of their giving of themselves, as well as of funds and services.  My favorite story about Sal is how--after a very long day working to help people, he went out after dark to find and rescue an injured Canada goose, and then brought it to a local wildlife hospital for care.  True compassion understands that All Life is precious and a miracle.  The people touched by the Time is Now are better--not just financially, but spiritually.  If you are looking for a very special cause, this is it.
The Time Is Now to Help	288910	1	/users/profile/379112	theresanico	Client Served	5	05/06/2016	I don't usually write reviews for organizations, companies or products ... however I can't say it enough... Sal Dimiceli is by true definition a HERO. I had the honor of personally meeting him in 2008 when I volunteered at a local Lions Club. He was a guest speaker, sharing his personal story of growing up in poverty, his devotion to himself and Our Lord, giving insight on the Charity he began more than 20yrs ago, The Time Is Now to Help.  Last year, I reached out to him, this time because I had nowhere else to turn.  I was desperate, unable to care for my granddaughter's, needs like medical care and clothing/ food. She was 3yr old, diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, Sensory Sensitivities and constant panic attacks. I have legal custody of her and being a single grandmother, I am her ONLY care-giver. Her father had died shortly after her 1st birthday and her mother was struggling with her own issues. I was unable to hold steady employment because I couldn't find childcare. She was in 2 different centers, however BOTH Director's ask that I find more 'suitable' providers that are better trained to care for disabled children.  Unfortunately, there are none in the area where we live. I worked closely with the local school district for 8 wks and eventually she qualified for the Early Child Program (Special Education).  She was given a great opportunity that would help in so many ways  However, financial problems were making it difficult for me  to give her the help she needed...I WAS WITHOUT A VEHICLE FOR 12 MONTHS.  There is NO public transportation in the rural area we lived in. Moving wasn't an option since the School District had the best program for her needs. Also financially strapped, coming up with the costs of moving wasn't an option either.  After writing a letter to Sal, it was atleast 3 wks before I heard from him. Meanwhile, I had given up hope, thought I was facing another rejection. A few days before Christmas, I get the call that has forever changed our lives. Understanding now, why it took as long as it did, I am grateful to the businesses & individuals who contribute to this fantastic Charity.  Donations are used in the SAME area where there is a NEED. When I wrote a letter to Time Is Now to Help, funds were low where I live, the reason it took awhile for a return call. Sal does ask ALOT of questions, he digs deep into personal and financial matters. He is cautious with every phone call and letter he gets. There are so many who write to him, the need is often times greater than the help that can be given. As much as Sal would love to help every person he meets or talks to, its impossible. If he weren't cautious, if he didn't dig deep... this Charity would't have the success it does. Donors would be hesitant, communities wouldn't be as confident, everybody would wonder what the funds are being used for, who is being helped, did money go to those truly in need or was fraud involved? Nobody needs to question this Charity, without a doubt every $$$ goes towards giving families/individuals HOPE when once there was none. Christmas Eve, I picked up my new vehicle, with the help of so many. My granddaughter has received the medical care she needs from neuropsychologists,  therapists, pediatric dentists (oral surgeons) . She will be entering 4K in September. Another example of how Sal Dimiceli impacts the lives of so many.

This man nor only those that can't help themselves but donates 20% of the profits from his real estate business to the cause as well as having put several millions of his own money. Not only did he help my wife and I when we couldn't afford to fix our car but also runs a homeless shelter, pays utility bills and puts food in  empty pantries. On top of that he does not expect others to do all the work. He personally visits the unfortunate people who need his help and drives them to the store, utility, or wherever necessary to provide assistance. He has also instilled the gift of charity to his children who are following in his footsteps to serve this poorly under served community. Besides my wife and I he has helped no less that at least 5 other members in our community we know personally. Some men just talk the talk but Sal and his charity walk the walk and truly give of themselves 7 days a week. He deserved the CNN nomination for person of the year several years ago and deserves the recognition.

If i didnt  need  the help i never  would of took the little bit they offered. I was talked down on for being a young single mom with a dui on my record from a mistake i made at 21 yr old. Never  been in trouble other then the dui. And sal was so rude to me and judged me over a phone call. No one came to my house like u read in the paper. I got a single phone call. Was told he wouldnt help with gas or anything to do with transportation because of a dui i had that was 9years ago. I dont even drink and i havent sence i got that dui at 21 yrs old. I have 4 sons living in walworth co without transport or fuel money is impossable' its not like therez public transportation out here. I payed and went to all classes an was a valid driver it didnt matter to him tho.Then when i started crying the man on the phone asked if i took depressants in a very harsh voice. He then told me all he can do is send a gift card for food in the mail. Ive never asked for help after that. I never had  felt so degraded for asking for help in my life. I wounder how many others were treated like this but not speaking up because he is well known in the area. Money is power n the root of all evil. Im not afaid no more. I will no longer allow anyone to degrade me and my family because were poor..

The Time is Now not only helps them in the short term by paying a bill or buying food, but also helps them find more long term solutions to the situation they are in. I have been fortunate to meet Sal and his family and can attest to their compassion for all living things and their passion to help those in need.

The Time is Now to Help provides tangible services to hundreds, perhaps thousands of people who find themselves in a place where they can no longer 'go it alone.'  This organization gives the hand up when it is needed most, and often when all else has failed.  They are seen as 'angels,' and indeed they show God's love through their compassionate and unselfish acts.  It is not just about providing funds, but about providing friendship.  Reading about the positive changes they bring about in others' lives inspires all of us who know this organization to try to do more when we encounter someone in need of help.  Even the gift of a smile can make a difference to someone in the dark.  Thank you the Time is Now to Help for making our world a kinder place.

The Time is Now has never lost sight of the individual, even while the ability of the organization grows to help more and more people struggling with poverty, homelessness and despair.  The founders continue to be as involved today as they likely were with the very first person whose need captured their hearts.  To be able to sustain the kind of compassion, grueling schedule and personal attention that is required to perform their loving work is a miracle in itself.  On top of that, the founders and their organization work miracles in countless lives every year, and inspire the rest of us to help where we can.

When things get too far out of control for some I know I can contact The Time Is Now To Help and they are always willing to hear the person out and do whatever they can to help. I had a resident facing eviction and The Time Is Now To Help stepped in and found this poor woman a place to stay and helped her get back on her feet when she had NO ONE to turn to for help. I can't express what it means to me to have them to turn to when no one else cares, and to know they will be there time and time again.

The Time Is Now to Help	167115	1	/users/profile/221962	Lisa264	General Member of the Public	5	09/04/2013	The definition of the word charity is generosity and helpfulness especially toward the needy or suffering; also : aid given to those in need. The Time is Now to Help is that and so much more. Not only does Sal and his team provide THINGS that people need they also provide something that many other charities don't provide, they help give people their dignity back. Poverty strips people of so much more than material possessions and The Time is Now recognizes this and addresses it. Yes, people need food and shelter but they need to be treated as and made to feel like they matter, that they're important and that they aren't worthless.

It matters to me that every single cent I donate goes to help someone and does not become a paycheck of an overpaid administrator. Sometimes I read the stories Sal posts and imagine its my money helping someone fight homelessness or starvation. It makes me feel good. To have a nonprofit run on zero percent overhead is only possible because of the selflessness of everyone involved. 
The Time Is Now to Help	165744	1	/users/profile/220243	Patty26	Donor	5	08/21/2013	This is a TRUE, Genuine GREAT team of people! Sal and his people touch so many lives in so many ways EVERYDAY SINGLE DAY! Am PROUD to be a donor and one of The Time Is Now's biggest fans! We have seen 1st hand the immediate and caring response to those in need they provide. Sal has given us great leads to GREAT employees. There aren't many organizations out there that I am aware of that return a call for help immediately and as affirmatively as The Time Is Now. They inspire my Husband and I to try to "pay it forward" everyday.
The Time Is Now to Help	165720	1	/users/profile/220222	John179	Donor	5	08/21/2013	When giving to a charity it is important to know that most all the money goes to those in need, TIN does exactly this.  Further, instead of just giving money, food, shelter or clothing; TIN goes further and actually verifies what would most help and works with those in need to not only solve the immediate issues, but to better their situation going forward.  I read weekly in the paper how TIN has helped someone and often find myself in tears knowing that there are so many people walking among us in such a wealthy community who with a little help from those around them would be in a much better position.  Last, whenever we donate and regardless of the amount, shortly after a letter arrives in the mail letting us know exactly where our dollars went to help. God Bless You Sal

Reaching out and helping those who are less fortunate, whether it be by donating a toy to a local shelter or buying someone a much needed cup of coffee,  is something The Time is Now takes to a whole new level... helping families get back on their feet, making sure they can celebrate the holidays sheltered in warmth with good food in their bellies. The work of Sal and Corrine (and their team of volunteers) is wonderful and I am sure can be equated to a miracle in the lives of those they help.

I promptly put a $20 bill in an envelop and mailed it.  I didn't expect to hear anything back but was pleasantly surprised when I received a thank-you and update from Sal Dimiceli.  My $20 provided 132 pounds of food!  Wow!   I have no doubt that this is one organization that really does make every cent count.

General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2012	I read this newspaper column for years (sharing how clients were helped)  and have been so moved at the compassion and individual support that was offered to each person or family in need. Families that had lost hope--and this man enters their life and gives them necessities along with replenished hope for their future and in other people. I love the fact that he visits these families personally and figures out what is the best way to get them back on their feet. When you give to the Time is Now to Help, you know that you will be making a real difference in people's lives who truly need it.

Since joining this foundation I feel part of a family that understands what I'm going through and I'm not alone anymore. So few Doctors know about APS and even fewer have any idea of what to do.  Having others to share with has taken some of the fear away and incouraged me to keep trying to find a doctor who understands.

They are the only site that I have found that has comprehensive knowledge backed up with studies on not only APS but also other common autoimmune conditions. I also joined their support forum at that time and have made wonderful, knowledgeable, life-long allies and friends. The Facebook group had continued the tradition of support and sharing of information.  I would definitely recommend this site to anyone with APS!

First and foremost this group provides valuable, up-to-date information about APS that is not anecdotal, but research based.  The group forum is the first place I go with questions about symptoms and treatment to get users' personal perspectives.  It can be very reassuring to learn that I am not the only one who has a particular feeling or opinion.  The forum is a place to empathize and cheer on people who are in a difficult state related to their APS.  It is a place for the newly diagnosed, as well as people who have been through it all.  It seems there is always something new to learn.  My experience with the APS Foundation of America has been nothing but positive and empowering.
APS Foundation of America, Inc.	239008	3	/users/profile/324558	DeeDeeRambo	Client Served	5	03/09/2015	With the APS Foundation of America & the assistance of the staff, I would never be where I am today.  For numerous years, I suffered Blood Clots, Seizures, Transient Ischemic Attacks, problems with thinking clearly, headaches/fatigue & other neurological symptoms such as dizziness & vertigo.  My problem; I lacked an answer & a direction to my health issues.  Unfortunately, numerous doctor doctor appointments with Specialists left me without any conclusive results, ending my journey to place a name to my ongoing issues.  Stronger medication seemed like the only answer, leaving me with feelings of hopelessness.  This process endangered my life & most importantly, my family.  We suffered through financial issues as my health kept me from being competitive in the job market.  We were losing faith until someone told me to check out this website. What a difference maker!  After a couple of calls with the Foundation's President, everything changed.  We started placing names to associate my symptoms.  We created a plan on how we should move forward & get the answers we need.  We changed everything from local Doctors/Specialists I was currently seeing & changed them with specific Doctors/Specialists from a different location to give me a chance to find answers I have been searching for.  The Foundation's President attended every doctor's appointment I had.  After years of frustration & a lack of answers, it took less than 6 months to get the correct diagnosis to my ongoing health issues:  APS.   The Foundation's President also helped with legal issues concerning both Long-Term Disability to Social Security Disability Insurance.  With APS being a rare autoimmune disease, lawyers & judges were at a standstill how to move forward with both of my Disability cases.  The Foundation's President spent numerous amount of time with APS information, how it affected me & how it would keep me from being competitive in the job market.  Phone calls, e-mails, written testimony, you name it.  She even served as my SSDI Representation!!  In both disability cases, I was found credible & won, resulting being legally declared disabled.  She was there for me from start to finish.  My family will always be in debt to her.

Many doctors that I have spoken with since I learned about my disorder know little-to-nothing of my condition, and many aren't willing to work with clients who have APS. Their Facebook page and Website have helped me understand my condition immensely. I'm glad to see that they work hard to find grants that will aid the study and treatment of APS and help to give information to the public, doctors, and patients. They regularly connect with people who have APS, and give far more information than many other sites who also focus on the disease, and have financial transparency along with a 501c3(a must for any organization who wants to raise awareness for a disorder like this). When I found out that I have APS, they were the website that gave me the information that I needed to get a handle on what I was reading. Thanks to APSFA, I now have a better understanding of APS and what I should look at in new doctors.

Suffering with this not-well-known disease was difficult.  I felt alone.  I am thankful to have found the APS Foundation to have the support and resources to help me, my family, and even my employer, help understand this debilitating, silent, invisible disease.     As a patient, the support and understanding has helped my family and me better understand and cope with the sudden limitations placed on my life.  The Foundation members are thoughtful, compassionate, educated, up-to-date, and have their "finger on the pulse," of any/all new updates we, as sufferers of this disease, need to know.  Additionally, the APS Foundation is an excellent resource for any aspect of APS -- the patient or physician both can utilize.

I'm not a napper, I don't lay down unless I feel awful.  Over the weekend of the headache, I was in bed most of the time.  I finally went to the emergency room where they discovered that I had blood on the brain.  Further tests revealed that I had a blood clot in the vein that drains blood from the brain.

APS Foundation of America, Inc.	42989	1	/users/profile/43743	cab	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	I was so relieved when I found the APSFA after suffering from numerous blood clots and finally getting my diagnosis of APS.  My doctor didnt explain the disease, just handed me a prescription for Coumadin and said I would be on this medicine for the rest of my life, and I would need to be careful because it was a powerful drug with potentially deadly side effects.   I was so scared.  I went home that night and started searching the web and read everything I could get my hands on.   The APSFA is the one and only foundation that provided me with what I desperately needed at that point in my life.  Their web site had an easy to understand glossary and description of APS.  I found professional looking brochures that I printed and gave to my family.  I read newsletters that had stories of other APS patients that I could relate to.  I also found a support forum on their web site.  There I met the most wonderful, caring, understanding people who helped me cope with the devastating news of my recent diagnosis of APS.APSFA has also provided cited medical information to several of my doctors who have used this information to improve their treatment of my condition.

My "team" has included an excellent rheumatologist and the APS Foundation of America.  Because of the honest information I received there, I learned questions to ask my rheumatologist, the most current research on treatments and, maybe for me, hope that I could go on and lead a normal life.  Yes, it would take monitoring and medication, but I could work and still be me.  Since then, I frequent the site often and have tried to be an encouragement to others as they have been and continue to be to me.  I would recommend this foundation to anyone dealing with aps.

There is not a lot of good information out there to help people with APS but the APSFA is full of much needed information and I use the site daily. In addition I use the forum on the site to get support, we do a weekly check in and I have found friends with APS so I no longer need to suffer with APS alone. There is no charitable organization more deserving than the APSFA that I know of. I have a lot of medical issues other than APS and I can even get links from the staff at the APSFA to find out about those issues. I am hopeful that the APSFA will win this money as I need them as do many others who use the site. It is important to note that my doctor even uses the site to get information that he can't find elswhere.

I had recently been diagnosed with APS and joined the support forum and used their site for information to take to my physicians.  After a short while I began to notice that there was only a small group of active members on the forums and they were often very negative towards others who had ideas/suggestions/recommendations that differed from theirs.  I myself ended up disagreeing with one of the primary posters in defence of another members statement and was in turn publicly put down on the forums and made to feel as if my opinion was "dumb" or "stupid".  Since that time I did not return to the site.  I do not feel as if the primary members of the support forum truly do provide support.  They use the forum to promote their treatment beliefs on others without having respect for other people's opinions.  Several times members were removed for disagreeing with the moderators for simple statements that were in opposition to the admins/moderators.

I joined the support forum and found the negative bashing of healthcare providers contagious. Those who do not follow to the letter the ideas of the founder find themselves attacked by the few frequent followers. In the other communities it is known that MANY in need of support will get over their flares only to become strong and want to help more. They are eventually banned if they hang around long or leave disgusted with the experience. Unfortunately most that have been mistreated will not take the time to give a negative review so this group will receive credit from the few and not the masses.

APS Foundation of America, Inc.	42911	1	/users/profile/43653	melissa25	General Member of the Public	5	06/03/2010	Hi, I have lived with APS for over 26 years now. In 83 I had clots go to both lungs. I was carry a baby at the time (6 months). The babies heart beat was 50 bpm and mine was 30. This was before Hughs syndrom, sticky blood or APS was even known. I have had clots to the lungs, miscarriage, and the latest was dvts. I had so many medical problems and when I had the dvts, over 9 years ago is when I was told that I had APS. I went to a thrombosis research doctor and that is how I found out. He told me that I have had this for most of my life. It is a hard disease to diagnose. I have found out that even within the last 9 years, there is still many medical personal that really  knows nothing about it. I think also that people that has it and is not able to work that it would be easier to get disability. The SS disability personal does not understand it either. My doctor does not want me to work. I wish that I could help with getting the word out about this disease so that it would help others and myself. I love the APS Foundation of America. My Daughter did a research paper for one of her collage classes and received an A+. I love reading about others and knowing that I am not the only one going through this. Not only is it hard on the person with APS but also the families. I pray for all that goes through this.
APS Foundation of America, Inc.	42889	1	/users/profile/43637	melanie7	General Member of the Public	5	06/03/2010	I have been diagnosed with APS after 4 strokes and one spleen infarc. (between November 09 and April 10). I was on comaudin for a few months and still had strokes. The hemotologist finally deemed me a comaudin failure and I now inject Lovenox 100 mg twice a day. That is a life long prescription. I got home from my last hospital visit 5 weeks ago and found the APS organization. I am so grateful for having this information available to me and to help others by sharing my story. I know now that I have had a few strokes in my lifetime but I was always treated for anxiety or migraines. Thank God I now know the symptoms of a stroke and immediately get help. They listen to me now.  The doctors and nurses had never heard of APS so we all learned together. Thank God for this website!!

I found it by chance surfing the internet looking up information on this crazy disease I have.  The members of the foundation work tirelessly to provide and maintain the forum.  The foundation has provided me with information to educate myself with and the support of good friends suffering the same illness as myself.  They have been there for me during one of the darkest times in my life and have cheered me on on the happiest days as well.  I would be lost without all of there hard work and dedication.

I was 48 and in moderate to good health. After much perserverance of my neurologist and the hemotologist he brought in and a battery of tests. They took blood until i thought i'd had no more to take. I was finally diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome. After 1 month in the hospital and rehab. With several months of outpatient rehab to go my search to find out about APS with the help of my family began. that is when i found APS Foundation of America.They provided me with the information in needed and info I could share with my medical team to understand this under diagnosed disease. After reading more and more about it I feel I may have had this much longer than suspected. APSFA has been very helpful to me my doctors and family in learning about this disease.

Nobody seemed to know ANYTHING about this disease and I had to do the research myself. APSFA provided great information, reading recommendations, support materials to give to my doctors and have a wonderful patient forum. At one point, my doctors were tracking my PT/INR with a finger stick machine and the APSFA was where I found out that finger stick machines don't work for APS patients! They can give an incorrect reading. They pointed me to the manufacturer materials that stated the machines were not for APS patients. Now my doctors always check my levels with a blood draw to insure a truer measure. This could be the difference between health and another blood clot.

She had some unusual symptoms but we never knew what they were from. After her diagnosis, we were able to find so much helpful information from the APS Foundation of America. This organization is an important resource for a condition that is under recognized and poorly understood in much of the medical community.

One doctor told me I should never try to have children and another told me I didn't know what I had because they couldn't find the APS diagnosis in their medical database. I found this website while doing my own research and was so glad that I did.  I was able to talk to other people who had gone through similar experiences as well a those who have been affected by APS much more than I have.  I have gotten a much better understanding of symptoms and what to watch for in the future.  Through the help and information on this site, I was able to have a healthy and safe pregnancy.

My head felt like it was going to explode, When My parents placed a cold washcloth on my forward I was finally able to close my Eyes. As I layed there, There were what seemed like fireworks going off in my head. I believe this was what I believe to be my 1st TIA. At this time my mother took me to the Doctor, There were no answers, only questions. I showed up to have "some kind o venereal disease. I was only 13 at the time, very much a Virgin. My parents did not know what to think. My mother at this time was having one of the first Hip Replacements at USC. I believe she also had APS, first diagnosed as childhood RA. She had been on prednisone for most of her life. She had been diagnosed with diverticulosis. I believe this was due to her Lupus and the combination of the cortisone.I am now going to flash forward to my 1st born son. For some reason I started labor at 7 months. He was born at 5.5 pounds, Incredibly healthy yet Jaundice. At that time no red flags went up to any of my Doctors. I have been a dance Educator, and a certified Aerobic step Instructor. At age 47 I had my 1st Stroke, and no answers to the reason why. Finally my neurologist sent me to UCSF where they finally diagnosed with APS. This is when I became aquainted APS Foundation. I am so glad they were there. I live in far Northern California, Arcata CA. There is no information locally about this disease. Because of APS  & Facebook I have been able to educate my friends and Family about this Disease. I don't know what I would have done if they were'nt a strong Non-Profit.

Most APS patients feel that way when first diagnosed...alone, helpless, confused, scared. The APSFA helps them realize they are not alone - there are others out there who live with this disease, the same symptoms and the same struggles with doctors. The APSFA strives to provide the most up to date and cited information for APS patients. We spend countless hours working behind the scenes so that the website is accurate and the support group is a save haven for APS patients. I have made many good friends through the APSFA and the support forum and have found comfort in the fact that we are not alone, others feel the same way and when you're diagnosed with an autoimmune disease like APS, that's important.

Their several environmental projects are comprehensive and expansive.  They include many educational components and impressive outreach programs to the neighboring communities.  Five friends and I also had the privilege of joining their semester abroad course to the Galapagos which we all agreed was one of the most exciting, informative and well-run endeavors we have ever enjoyed.  Anyone who could be part of their projects or courses would be extremely fortunate.  Ceiba in an excellent educator of the need and  "how to's" to protect the environment
Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	37696	4	/users/profile/38396	cftc	Former staff	5	04/30/2010	The Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation is an extremely productive, well-managed and successful conservation organization that does most of its work in Ecuador.  Conceived and run by Joe Meisel, Phd Zoology and Catherine Woodward, Phd Botany it is an extraordinarily successful conservation organization. It started small by replacing a lost boat to a protector of the manatees.  From there they saved approximately 300 hectares of cloud forest, situated in the midst of 1200 hectares of forest, from being destroyed by the lumber companies trying to buy out the owning familys property.  After seven years of working with the family, sending several members to school and other training programs so that they could manage the property, developing the property into an orchid reserve with a visitors center and orchid garden and promoting tourists visits and volunteer aids, this forest area called El Pahuma has become a viable means of support for the entire family who has owned the property for generations.   Their latest project is the Lalo Loor Reserve.  Bundling and connecting forest fragments, Ceiba has established a coastal corridor in this dry forest that is large enough and connected in such ways that its bio-diversity can be maintained and sustained..  Ceiba has the support of the mayor of the neighboring town and the landowners whose properties abut the forest corridor.  Again they have built a visitors center which now operates education programs for local students and teachers.   There are continually volunteers and Peace Corps workers incorporated into this program.For the past several years Ceiba has run an environmental ecology semester abroad program in Ecuador for college students.  They also have a month long summer course for interested students and Ecuadorian scholarship students.  The leaders have consistently gotten rave reviews from their students, many of whom go on to volunteer in Ceibas projects and to pursue a science curriculum.Through all of these programs, this organization has had an enormous impact on the environment.  They have worked diligently to save many acres of land, educate the local people about the importance of the land, and the various ways it can be protected and useful at the same time.  They are continually educating students of all ages about the importance of protecting these amazing resources.  Through the diligence, devotion and energy of its leaders, Ceiba has developed into an extremely important environmental organization.
Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	263806		/users/profile/352516	Writer	Client Served	5	10/13/2015	The two weeks I spent in Ecuador with the Ceiba Foundation study group and instructors Catherine Woodward and Joe Meisel were exceptional.  As a long-time educator, I looked for and experienced things that I consider integral to a high-level learning environment. First, the entire trip was meticulously planned and organized to offer a robust overview of the culture, the ecology, the wildlife, and the aspects of the land and sea that we must protect and preserve.  In addition, the balance of listening, observing, questioning, and interacting was excellent and provided situations where deep and lasting learning was achieved.  The instructors were well-prepared, cordial, caring, professional, and astute leaders.  They love their work and their mission, and it is so apparent.  They were able to personalize the study to the participants whose ages spanned more than fifty years.  Certainly that is no small feat. This was one of the finest learning experiences I have had.  The work is important and should be supported to enable it to continue for years to come.

I had an amazing experience exploring the plant diversity and plant uses in such a unique region of the world. The staff at Ceiba, both in Ecuador and in the U.S. are incredibly caring, helpful, knowledgeable, and passionate about their work. The Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve is a big part of nearby coastal communities in Ecuador, and it employes several local community members. This not only provided an enriching cultural exchange during my stay, but it demonstrates Ceiba's approach as a non-profit to work closely with communities and inspire residents to take ownership of projects impacting their environment. I would highly recommend interning or participating in one of their study abroad courses!

Catherine was our professor and was by far the best teacher I have ever had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the people, the culture, and the nature that we experienced. I wish I could have stayed longer, but I learned a great deal in the short amount of time that we were there and I can definitely see why Ceiba works so hard to conserve this absolutely stunning part of the world. They are doing amazing work in Ecuador and I'm glad that I got to be a part of it.

It was with out a doubt the best 4.5 months of my life. I met life long friends and had a truly unique experience. I learned so much from the two most knowledgeable and caring professors I've ever had. Whether I was navigating the streets of Quito, hiking through the cloud forest, bird watching from the crown of a 45 m tall ceiba tree, swimming with caiman in the Tiputini river, swimming with sea turtles and sharks in the Galpagos Islands, or just relaxing on the beach, I was always aware that Ceiba had thrown me into the adventure of a lifetime. That list seems pretty good but it doesn't come close to capturing all the experiences I had in my semester in Ecuador. This trip changed my life. Do yourself a favor and just go.

It was quite simply not only a spectacular experience, but a reinforcement of the crucial need for biodiversity.   There is no better way to learn then hands-on instruction by experts.  Any one involved in this program will be spurred to conserve tropical treasures by seeing and experiencing the incredible beauty of the natural world.  The program was extremely well run and packed with activity and challenge combined with tons of fun.   I am encouraged by the work of the Foundation to believe we can preserve fragile environments for future generations to enjoy.

They taught us about a broad range of ecosystems: plants, animals, insects, climate. As well as teaching us about the social and economic issues involved with protecting ecosystems in developing countries. The professors are intimately involved in protecting these amazingly biodiverse places with close involvement with the native people whose homes and livelihoods depend on these places. Further, they were spectacular teachers. Any and every question was welcomed and answered and every moment, activity, sighting, was turned into a teaching moment. It was truly a living classroom. My experience with Ceiba changed my life. When I returned to the U.S. I changed majors to Environmental Studies and today am in grad school in environmental studies as well.

Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	98904		/users/profile/117717	elind	Volunteer	5	10/03/2011	Studying abroad in Ecuador with the Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation was the best decision I ever made with regards to my education. The program plunged me into many different areas of science and I saw hands-on conservation strategies going on right now around the world. With the help of my professors and others involved with Ceiba I was able to conform any of my assignments into something I was interested in. Whether you are interested in animals, plants, the community, the environment or anything you want to pursue, its possible through Ceiba.My favorite memory was one of my first weekends in Ecuador. Our group went to Ceiba's El Pahuma orchid reserve. I was walking up a steep climb for over an hour, exhausted from carrying my pack. With every step up the mountain the clouds became thicker and the vegetation lusher. When we got to the top I remember seeing a giant bromeliad and a tree fern engulfed in fog. The scenery was magnificent, like a step back in time. I don't know if I ever would have had an experience quite like it if I hadn't decided to study abroad with Ceiba.

Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	34800	4	/users/profile/35661	jrcarroll	Volunteer	5	04/06/2010	I volunteered with the Ceiba Foundation at their Orchid Reserve just outside of Quito, Ecuador. After many years of working with a local family, Ceiba created a locally owned reserve where the land-owners were able to self-manage (and conserve!) precious montane forest that would have otherwise been destroyed. Their method of conservation can succeed in the long-run because it has personal incentives for the local people involved. Ceiba is a wonderful organization working for conservation in a country that has some of the most precious landscape remaining!
Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	98359		/users/profile/116801	bottleneck262	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	I had an excellent experience as a student on the Ceiba Foundation's Tropical Conservation Semester program.  The course offers a unique combination of cultural immersion and practical instruction in field ecology.  Students are paired with host-families in Quito, where they get an intimate experience of Ecuadorean culture and an intense sink-or-swim Spanish language immersion.  Classroom lectures give students a nuanced perspective on biodiversity and evolution.  Group discussions explored many of the complex social and ecological challenges of conservation programs in developing nations, with a sensitive look at the interests and agency of the indigenous population. The program's time in the field constitutes a second kind of cultural immersion.  Students explore an incredible diversity of landscapes.  They learn to identify the organisms, observe patterns, become comfortable in the field, and design and execute experiments. The program culminates in a month-long internship with the conservation-related organization of the student's choice.  It is a phenomenal opportunity for hands-on, direct action, and it endows students with a sense that they have the capacity to affect positive change.  It also provides them with unique insights into the human experience of poverty in an environment rich in endangered natural resources. Above all, they grow their own visceral sense of biophilia; the experience as a whole nurtures a deep appreciation for the intrinsic value of biodiversity.  Students will carry this appreciation with them to any future career, and it will color their opinions about conservation and their decisions as workers, donors, citizens, and voters.  I cannot overstate my gratitude to the Ceiba Foundation for my experience as a student, and I cannot recommend the program highly enough.

I met really great people who I'm still in contact with including students from the trip and both of my host families. Traveling to the cloud forest, paramo, dry forest, rainforest and the galapagos. At the end of the classwork we all had internships of our interest. I worked in the cloud forest with 2 Ecuadorian students collecting caterpillars and studying there parasitoids. My months in Ecuador were life changing and I learned so much. Before my trip I never understood how important conservation and all the facets that are needed to make a successfull program.

It was an experience of a lifetime. Not only was I taught to appreciate the wildlife but I was also introduced to a culture extremely different than my own. I see the world differently now and am truly a better person because of it.

We went all the way to the Amazon, saw parrots, sloths, snakes, armadillos, river dolphins, frogs, peccaries, Ceiba trees, and so much more while learning about the ecosystem of the rainforest. With hands on mini experiments, we learned more than we could ever by reading a text book because while we were there, in addition to the science course, we saw the impacts of humans, how locals viewed the forest, and how the government and corporations are changing the landscape.But this is maybe like 20% of the trip. It gets better, much better. The Galapagos, after the cold nights in Quito, was like a vacation inside a 'vacation'. And I say vacation, because even though we learned A LOT, it was much much more fun than the amount we learned. The instructors have experience, they know how things are done, they know what they're talking about, and they know how to enliven their students. The internship at the end was a very nice way to tie up all that we had learned and to use it practically in a way that each of us wanted to, because we could choose from a variety of programs dealing with a variety of things. There was a lot of freedom for such a structured program, which I personally loved.

The things I learned and the people I met changed my life. My favorite parts were getting to see and experience the conservation projects that Ceiba has undertaken in the country and the huge impact that each project has had on the communities in which they have been located. Ceiba is an amazing organization.

Ceiba has struck a perfect balance between challenging coursework and exhilarating field work to make the semester educational and fun. Specifically the internship portion of the program allowed me to apply what I had learned about sociology, ecology and conservation in class to a community.My global perspective on conservation developed as we visited different Ceiba conservation sites and directly saw the challenges that arise when talking about conservation on a global scale. I learned that stakeholders and their culture need a primary voice in any conservation effort and feel empowered to include conservation in whatever I choose to do professionally.Academically the program gave me the opportunity to get to know two incredible professors and learn from them in an extremely hands on fashion. The enthusiasm they have for conservation and learning in general was contagious and methods I learned from them will certainly contribute to my future academic success.Professionally I now understand the relevance and importance of addressing conservation in every career. A fire has been lit inside of me to seek ways to problem solve across boarders without being afraid of the challenges cultural differences may pose. I have been inspired to travel, and to work with the global community on conserving our planet.
Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, Inc.	37691	5	/users/profile/38391	jlklinge	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2010	My experience with Ceiba was life changing.  I've always wanted to join the Peace Corps, but was always undecided about where to go and want I would do.  But, after my time with Ceiba, I would really love to go back to South America and work on forest conservation and education.  The program teaches students about the ecology and biodiversity of Eucador, while also explaining the challenges that face conservation. I think the work that Ceiba does is so important.  They work directly with local people to give them more sustainable and economical options for their land.  For example, they provide training and support for people in eco-tourism and reserve management.  I also loved my experience at the Tiputini research station in the Amazon rain forest.  We saw an anaconda and so many wonderful birds and monkeys.  I really miss seeing monkeys everyday.  That was great.  If anyone wants to donate time or money to a nonprofit organization, I would recommend Ceiba.  Your efforts would definitely get to the areas and people who need it most.

The experience was wonderfully educational; I learned techniques for studying the environment; assessing water quality; identifying flora and fauna (including different types of monkeys); how to catch bats; how to catch a panther on camera, and much, much more.  The food we ate was wonderful and memorable, especially the homemade yogurt;  I learned what to be afraid of (urticating vines) and what not to be afraid of (venomous snakes - we didn't see any)...The trip up to the paramo was beautiful (if a little chilly.  The orchid preserve was exotic and beautiful.  The river dolphins were particularly special.  I whole-heartedly recommend the CFTC to anyone who would like to learn the facts surrounding envionmental issues in the rainforest.  Catherine and Joe know their stuff, and they make great hosts.

The work we have been doing, both learning about the natural environment and engaging in conservation efforts has profoundly affected my view of the world and my desire to spread the word of change to everyone I meet. The foundation has allowed me to do research projects in Amazon rainforest and the Galapagos Islands, places I never previously dreamed of visiting. They have also allowed me to participate in a rural internship, working in a location of my choice for a month, using the tools I have aquired after a 3 months of study. The members of the board are all wonderfully friendly and concerned people, interested in making a difference on the local and global scales.The foundation could work on incorporating the students of its study abroad programs more into the local culture and the projects it is doing with the community. It waits until the end of the program for their interships to allow this and I think more immersion throughout the semester would be more helpful.

We admire their hard work and enthusiasm to achieve tropical conservation about which they (and we) feel very strongly and care deeply. We are currantly working with them on a new conservation project and are impressed with their professionalism. Today, more than ever, it has become a necessity to preserve whatever land is left in its pristine state. There are people in the world, like the founders of Ceiba Foundation, that believe in this need and are working to protect the rapidly reducing environments. Ecuador, the country with more species of orchids than any other country in the world, is still a paradise of pure nature. Before it goes, their (and our) commitment is to help save it.

Our group studied conservation biology, zoology, ichthyology, entomology, ornithology, forestry, land management, as well as many other important techniques dealing with the human wildlife bond as well as human kind's impact and association with the environment. This program enabled me to open my eyes to the world around me, the impact mankind has on our environment, and the critical thinking involved in attempting to problem solve.

This course exceeded my expectations in every way possible. The founders of Ceiba are two of the most incredible people I have ever met, and have truly been an inspiration to me. What I find so unique and interesting about this organization is their ability to incorporate the locals in their conservation efforts. This has largely contributed to their huge amount of success with a number of projects, including El Pahuma Orchid Reserve and Lalo Loor dry forest. My experience with Ceiba was truly unforgettable. I cannot give enough praise to this organization.

Ceiba does a superb job in practicing what they preach - they are dedicated (and very good) at working with local stakeholders and residents in order to achieve conservation while improving social well-being.  The people running Ceiba care deeply about tropical conservation and the local people that such actions may affect, and do a great job integrating both objectives to work towards sustainable conservation solutions that really work.

Staff and volunteers are always busy keeping things immaculate.  Dogs and cats have individual kennels with all sorts of creature comforts to reduce their stress, and each cage/kennel is completely emptied and cleaned from top to bottom every day.  Dogs are walked and exercised by volunteers, and if there aren't enough volunteers, the staff pitches in.  Cats have their own type of volunteers who take them out for one-on-one socialization...petting, grooming, play.  That's what I do, and it is more rewarding than I could have imagined.  I expect that the every volunteer, in every category, would say the same thing.  The staff is amazing and dedicated.  Potential adopters are assisted by an adoption counsellor to ensure a good match.  This is a very impressive shelter, and deserves high praise.

They have served me, my family and many other members of my family with the gift of our special pets.  I have had such a great experience that I tell all that I can about the kindness, devotion  and love you will recieve when looking to rescue a new member of your family.  My recent pup (7 years old now)  was adopted at 8 weeks old and he is one of a kind!  My buddy is our life here at our home and he and the Washington County Humane society has changed my life. I would also like to share that Marne Brown is such a devoted woman to the animals that she goes way above and beyond to take care of her animals even after they are adopted.  I worked at a retirement community where a senior had adopted a dog named "Peg" and they were inseparable and then the unheard of, the senior had to go to the hospital and Marne took "peg" in and took care of her till my friend returned back to his apartment, where he could take care of "Peg".    This kind of devotion to me is unheard of and Marne  continued to be there for my friend and peg to the day Peg got so sick that she had to be put down to keep her from any more pain... and guess who was there for that difficult day?  Marne was there, we cried together, held each other and helped each other thru this difficult time.   So if someone wants to know what I think about the Washington County Humane Society... I can only say they  are THE BEST! Thanks Marne for you and your organization, and you are never far from my thoughts and how YOU MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE in our  community!   Thank you so much for making my life complete with my dog Buddy!

Currently, I have my cats, Trix and Jax (used to be Reebok).  As a teen I volunteered for them doing special projects and had a very positive experience.  They really motivate you to want to learn more and help their cause.  WCHS  has always remained exceptionally clean and organized and am confident each animal kept there is in the best place possible before their forever home.   The staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly to the animals and adopters.  They do great promotion of their animals through their website, Facebook, numerous fund-raising and awareness events.  Their turn-around of animals seems very quick, which is wonderful!  I personally love them on Facebook because every time they promote a particular animal that may be there longer, we can share it on our personal page to get them adopted even faster.  If you have a behavior problem with your adopted animal (I did), the staff takes the time to really help you and teach you how to fix the particular issue.  They're great about keeping in touch with you to make sure you and your pet are happy. My kids are 6 and 10, and I am highly encouraging them to volunteer for WCHS when they are old enough!

THANKS to the barn buddy program she is now fixed and free to roam and mouse to her hearts content without worry of more kittens (cute as they are).  She's the best mouser out there.

In 2008-2010, during the span of approximately two years, I lost my cat (old age), my momma Akita (old age and health issues) and her pup (cancer).  I couldn't image life without a companion animal, and I didn't do well with the lose of my pets in such a short amount of time. The staff at Washington County Humane Society were amazingly compassionate interacting with me. I had gone to their facility to look at two dogs who had been at the shelter for many months, and I ended up adopting both of them - brothers who had been surrendered. From start to finish, my experience with the Shelter and staff was nothing short of professional and welcoming. I was able to take time in the yard with both dogs to see how they interacted, I was given a bit of information about their background - though they couldn't provide much past the basics of age, current health, etc.  I was impressed by the amount of vetting they do with potential owners, the amount of resources they make available to people, the process of adopting from their shelter - and perhaps most important - their willingness to work with my schedule and board the "boys" for an extra few days until I could bring them home.  We continue to support the Washington County Humane Society and I encourage people to support this shelter as often as I have the chance. I recently started a tiny business, and portions of the sales proceeds are dedicated to the Shelter for their continued support and immense care of the animals in our community.

I'm so proud to be associated with this loving, committed group of people. Everyone at WCHS seems to be working toward the same goal: to provide a safe, warm, healthy, nurturing environment for each animal - for however long it takes to find its forever home. And sometimes, it takes a long time. Our kitty had been at the shelter for eight months when we met and adopted her in 2007.Thankfully, the WCHS welcome mat has no time limit. Today, as a volunteer, I see many of the same animals at WCHS week after week, month after month. Outsiders may have a tendency to feel sorry for these long-time shelter residents (I did, at first!), but the fact is, these animals are well cared for and get a lot of attention during their time at WCHS. I have to believe that in many cases, an animal's life at WCHS is the best life they've known.  So if you're looking for a pet, searching for a volunteer opportunity or considering making a charitable contribution, choose WCHS. You will not be disappointed.

Washington County Humane Society Inc	154846		/users/profile/205711	Judy71	Client Served	5	04/15/2013	Everything about our experience in adopting a new cat was wonderful. Every person we met was helpful and friendly and genuinely seemed to want to be doing what they were doing. The facilities were clean and inviting and were geared the animals comfort and safety. I think what impressed us most was that they were very busy and yet everyone really cared that we found the right match for our family. I could see that attitude in every employee and volunteer that seemed to care that this was a life decision. 
Washington County Humane Society Inc	154708		/users/profile/205556	Jennig2000	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	I am a police officer in a near by jurisdiction. I have had the pleasure of working with a few of the members of Washington County Humane Society a couple of times. They have always been willing to assist whenever I have called. Three members of the facility came out and helped remove dozens of cats out of a residence a couple years back. They maintained their professionalism while attempting to catch these cats, many feral, some deceased, all while explaining the process to the homeowner and helping keep them calm during a traumatic event. The individuals were hoarders and appeared to be experiencing some mental health issues. The members of the WCHS have always been willing to help, whether it'd be answering any questions I had or by loaning out live traps to assist with catching a loose animal. Every time I have spoken to someone there or have visited the facility, I've been greeted with a smile and an eagerness to help.  This organization is always trying to improve with the limited resources it has. Their priority is to find loving homes for their animals. I'm amazed at what they are able to accomplish. WCHS took in a mini potbellied pig that no other animal shelter in the area was willing to accept. Not only were they willing to help this animal, they found Wilbur a loving home in a very short amount of time!  I can't say enough good things about this organization. They are truly deserving of this acknowledgment and would utilize it to help benefit the animals. 
Washington County Humane Society Inc	154658		/users/profile/205506	Princessferf	Volunteer	5	04/14/2013	I started volunteering with WCHS in 2010.  Their volunteer coordinator, Kerry was very welcoming and flexible in finding opportunities based on our skills and availability.  Every time I walk in the doors everyone is friendly and appreciative of the help.  They have such success in finding the animals new homes that they are able to help out other areas of Wisconsin who may have more animals than adopters.  The animals are always well-cared for, I recommend them to everyone!  In fact, my mom adopted a dog from them a few months ago. 
Washington County Humane Society Inc	154541		/users/profile/205374	Volunteer2503	Volunteer	4	04/12/2013	I personally was involved in the Feline Intervention Program (FIP) and I found the requirements of even the volunteers were set to expectations and the facility provided a fantastic environment for the volunteers and the animals themselves. The facility really has captured the state of being that the animals need to connect with people again and vise versa, and brought it to life. In my position, I dealt with older cats and cats that may have been in the shelter for a notable period of time, and pretty much just socialized with them so when the right person came along they would still have the "social" skills they need to catch the person's eye. There are specific rooms for this program that I find very useful and complete with the appropriate materials needed to properly socialize the cats. The overall environment is truly unlike any other. A shelter is a place where animals and people should bond and come together, and at the Washington County Humane Society that's exactly what is being executed.
Washington County Humane Society Inc	154350		/users/profile/136738	Susan66	Volunteer	5	04/11/2013	Washington County Humane Society is a great rescue group.  The staff and volunteers truly have a love for the animals they care for. There is no time limit on the animals they care for, they will wait for the right match for the animals to find their forever home. When I looked to adopt, I found my dog here. Plus their adoption fees are not as much as many other groups.  They help educate the community , offer services such a dog training, feral cat program, barn buddies ( spay/neuter) , youth summer programs and visitation to area nursing facilities. If you are looking to adopt, this is the place to shop.
Washington County Humane Society Inc	103087	1	/users/profile/136738	Susan66	Volunteer	5	01/09/2012	I have been a volunteer at the Washington County Humane Society for a number of years after moving to this area about 20 years ago.  I have seen the shelter grow and improve their services during that time. I am a volunteer dog walker and help with special fundraising events.  I also served as a foster for a mom and her pups. I ended up adopting one of the puppies. I truly believe that the organization has the best interests of the animals in mind. They reach out to the community with educational programs in the schools. They have a volunteer Pet-A-Pet  program where screened animals visit people in extended care facilities.  They have dog training programs open to the public at very reasonable prices. The facility is kept very clean and best possible facilities are used to house the animals. My one suggestion would be to post a list of strays brought in on their website. This could help those looking for lost pets and cut down on the phone calls they receive. Overall, I would recommend adopting a pet from this shelter and are worthy of your support.
Washington County Humane Society Inc	154325		/users/profile/205155	sherri729	Volunteer	5	04/11/2013	WCHS is one of the best! I am fairly new to the area and within my first year I had heard nothing but rave reviews about WCHS. My first visit was to drop off a stray calico kitten. They were very busy on this Saturday afternoon and the staff was very pleasant and professional.I have since become a volunteer at WCHS and am very glad I chose to do this. The love and attention the animals receive at this site is amazing. Every animal is loved and cared for each and every day. We always have a new variety of dogs to walk because sop many of them get adopted out. The staff are also very professional and caring in how they match animals to family's. They really care about the relationship and the situation needs to be a match for the animals personality as well. I am proud and honored to be a volunteer at WCHS :O)!

Washington County Humane Society Inc	125825		/users/profile/138168	orel	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Washington County Humane Society in Slinger Wisconsin is such an amazing place.  The way they go out of their way to help all the animals that come to this shelter is unbelievalbe.  I have never seen such a caring staff.  They have taken in many wounded, sick,  and mistreated animals,  that no one else would take and nursed them back to heath with everything they are able to offer.  This is not a fancy shelter by no means,  They need alot of things and more room,  but you would never know it from the wonderful staff they have,  the incredible director  Marnie Brown, and the whole team that help run this humane society.   Our community is so proud of this place.  They have done some miraculous things for the many animals they take in and for the people that come through the doors.   One of their main goals is to always ensure the dog, or cat gets with the perfect family. They don't shove the animals out the door to just anybody just so they can open up space.  They want to make sure the animal is in a caring and loving home.   That is what made me be a volunteer there.    They are so deserving of this award. 
Washington County Humane Society Inc	103535		/users/profile/138168	orel	Volunteer	4	01/17/2012	WCHS is probably one of the best humane societys in Wisconsin.  I have volunteered there for 4-1/2 years.   They have a very compansionate and caring staff for all the animlals.  They don't have alot of space and need some new equipment,  but none the less,  they do a wonderful job with the animals.  They try very hard to find the right family/person for the dog, cat, etc...,   and make sure they end up in a forever home,  it is not about  just getting the animal out the door.   They truly care about where the animal goes and the family that takes them.   They use every dollar they get in caring for this place and the animals.  Please help them in any way you can.  They ar so deserving of it,.  They are a no kill shelter and do everything they can for every animal that enters their door.     Vicki P. 
Washington County Humane Society Inc	105226		/users/profile/141297	nfyksen	Volunteer	5	02/01/2012	WCHS is an amazing animal welfare organization! One step into their facility and it is apparent that their animals are very well cared for and loved. Each animal has a bed to lay on, soft blankets to keep them warm, and toys to keep them busy. The staff and volunteers are educated, professional, and really pride themselves in making good animal-human matches. I have adopted 5 animals from them throughout the years and each counseling and adoption experience I've had with them was wonderful! I give them an A+!
Washington County Humane Society Inc	104851		/users/profile/140709	volunteeratWCHS	Volunteer	5	01/29/2012	The Washington County Humane Society (WCHS) of Slinger, Wisconsin is a great organization dedicated to the welfare of the homeless animals that come through its doors. They help the sick as well as the healthy animals, love animals and truly care about the animals'  well-being.   The volunteers & staff do a great job of keeping the cages & facility clean. WCHS has a free Trap Neuter & Release program for cats which helps a great deal to keep the population of feral (those cats that have never had & will not accept human contact) down. There is also the Barn Buddies program to offer low cost spay/neuter & vaccinations for friendly outdoor cats. The more we can convince people to spay/neuter cats, the easier it will be to place the existing cats in loving homes. The adoption counselors are dedicated, friendly people who volunteer their time to work to match the adopter with an animal that suits them & their lifestyle. A good friend of mine & my sister have adopted cats from WCHS & are totally pleased with them. I would highly recommend the Washington County Humane Society to anyone looking for a pet, wanting to volunteer or wishing to make a donation.

WCHS has a wonderful website, we could look for a cat that would get along  with our only kitty.  Our new addition was well socialized, microchipped, and within days became a cherished member of our family.  The staff was very helpful, letting us see various cats so we could choose one that would be the best for our home.  If we ever needed a new pet, WCHS would be the first place we would go!
Washington County Humane Society Inc	103398	1	/users/profile/137738	bobaru	Client Served	5	01/13/2012	WCHS has been great to me. They care so much about their animals and want the best for them when they leave. Unlike other local shelters they make sure the fit is right. They also give you all the time you need with no pressure. I have adopted four cats from WCHS and they always do a detailed background check on me and my animals at home.  This is one of the few shelters where you can walk into a room full of cats and interact with them directly and they are more than happy to show a cat or dog in a private room for their caged residents. I highly recommend WCHS and i appreciate all they have done for me.
Washington County Humane Society Inc	103392		/users/profile/136851	tanjarinie	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	I came to WCHS in 2006. I had lost my cat Earnie that year and it was very hard on me. The hardest thing for me is he was taken so suddenly that I never really got a chance to say goodbye. I didn't realize the last time I petted him would be THE last time, they told me I could pick him up in the morning.  So I was in a state of shock.To deal with my grief I started coming to the shelter and sitting with the animals in the rooms where they are able to roam, petting them and talking to them and sharing special moments and purrs with them.  The staff recognized me and would smile and ask me how I was doing but while they never directly asked me why I was there, I think knew I was grieving for my passed animal.  And the cats sensed the sorrow in me and always had a kitty kiss or nuzzle for me. And honestly, how many cats will pass up a free scratch? I saw many cats be adopted and the wonderful work that the staff and volunteers did but I also saw they needed more help. I was amazed at how friendly all their animals were and how well care for there were, how much effort and love went into taking care of the animals and helping people with adopting a new member of their family. In 2007, I decided I would start volunteering and helping the animals and people who helped me. I wasn't personally ready for another cat at this time but thought that I could have many cats for a short period of time while I volunteered and help those animals find homes.   I started to volunteer and found that it was a wonderful place to be a part of... The staff and volunteers genuinely love the animals and give them the best care they are able to while the animals are there. It may not be the sparkliest or the richest shelter but its full of sparkle and richness from those who give their time by work or volunteering.  In 2008 Squiggy chose me, and I took him home. And then just this past month, I decided it was time to get him a sibling. Leonard and Squiggy are now inseparable. In fact Squiggy is singing to Leonard as I write this.  But even though I have opened my home to two cats, I will always give my time to WCHS and share the love I have in my heart with all the animals still looking for fur-ever homes because there are many more.  All the volunteers and staff give 110% to what they do, no matter what their job. They truly believe in what they do.

We've been in the obedience classes, attended some of their events, and even called a couple times  to talk about a dog behavior question.  Their compassion and professionalism is fantastic. In 2004 we had to put a dog to sleep, and they were so kind when we brought him in to be cremated. I can't say enough good things.

Also have experience with other shelters and always send everyone to Washington County. They are ethical, they make a very big effort to match each animal well---no pushing them on only to have it fail later. Their no-kill policy regarding adoptable animals means	 they do everything in their power to find each animal a new home, even if it means medical treatment or fostering first. I have now lived in other states and am amazed at what I took for granted with the Washington Co. shelter. There are just so few other shelters out there that do what they do to find each animal the best home possible.
Washington County Humane Society Inc	103359		/users/profile/137662	tracystas	Client Served	5	01/13/2012	My family adopted our first dog from WCHS in 1983.  My grandmother has consistently been donating and adopting cats from WCHS the past twenty years.  In 2010, my husband and I adopted two puppies from WCHS.  It was very important to me that we adopt from WCHS given the history my family has had with the organization.  The folks who work/volunteer at WCHS are wonderful!  They not only provide fantastic care for the animals, but they are truly invested in the well-being of the animals and want them to end up in a forever home.  The day we took our pups home, the staff all came out to cheer and say goodbye one last time.  This is the only shelter I recommend to my friends and family who are looking to give an animal a forever home.  This organization is absolutely worthy of your support.

Literacy Green Bay Inc	318393		/users/profile/409561	cwilda	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	About three years ago I signed up for a tutor training session at Literacy Green Bay Inc.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had a vague feeling of wanting to "give back", "to be of service", and "to make a difference".  I stepped forward, unsure of what this would look like or if I would even be able to do it.  The training I received was thorough and is ongoing.  The staff and other volunteers from Literacy were (and are) really terrific.  They have given me so many tools and resources to help me in my tutor work and are always ready with an answer for any of my questions.  More than that, they are supportive in less tangible ways, giving me the confidence to move forward into new areas of learning.  I will never forget a particular time when I ran into one of my tutor trainers in a city park. At the time, I was having some doubts about whether or not I was on the right path with my learner.  She listened to my story, gave me advice and offered her encouragement.  What a great conversation!  And what a testament to the level of commitment and passion on the part of the staff and volunteers of this organization!Of course, the real payoff with Literacy Green Bay comes from the relationships forged between matched tutor and learner.  I am continually inspired by the efforts of my learner to better himself in order to make a better life for his family.  He  works difficult hours at his job and in his studies, and yet maintains such a great attitude of optimism and hope.  When I witness his efforts, it makes me want to "double-down" on my commitment to this organization and especially to his learning.  My time at Literacy Green Bay Inc has been more rewarding than I could ever have imagined when I began almost three years ago.  I plan to continue volunteering with this organization for a long time and strongly encourage others to consider doing the same.

The small staff who make everything happen are very dedicated and professional. They provide training, ongoing assistance, and professional development to all their volunteer tutors and always with enthusiasm and a smile. I am truly happy that I got involved with Literacy Green Bay.

Literacy Green Bay Inc	250707		/users/profile/338595	1andtototoo	Volunteer	5	07/30/2015	What a wonderful 20 or so years I've had as a volunteer at Literacy Green Bay! I started as a tutor, taught classes, served on the board, managed the workforce development program, and participated as a tutor trainer, which I still am today. I'm so proud of the hard work my students have put in reaching their Literacy goals. We can never do enough to support Literacy in our community. It builds character, creates good citizens, and connects us as family. Hooray for our volunteer tutors and the program staff at Literacy Green Bay who make it all possible.Dorothy Seehausen
Literacy Green Bay Inc	243744		/users/profile/233965	thesuetucker	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	I really enjoy being a volunteer tutor for Literacy Green Bay.  All materials and training are provided to help me teach my motivated, adult-learners the English reading/writing/speaking skills they need as members of our community.  By removing communication barriers, Literacy Green Bay learners can achieve faster job promotion and salary growth.  While working together, I gain knowledge of and even share in some of my student's wonderful customs and am always amazed to hear my learners become more and more proficient in their 2nd or even 3rd language!  Literacy Green Bay is about improving quality of life for our students and their families.  It is a great team to be a part of!
Literacy Green Bay Inc	216980		/users/profile/233965	thesuetucker	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	Literacy Green Bay helps adult English language learners by giving them initial English language instruction and then by pairing them with a volunteer mentor who has been trained to help the learner read, write and speak the English language and improve their math skills.  Literacy Green Bay supports tutors and supplies them with curriculum at the learner's level.  I have met weekly with two learners, one from India and one from Mexico, over the past three years.  My learners are exceedingly motivated, completing their assignments despite their busy home and work schedules.  The improvements they have made in their English language skills have translated into job promotions with higher pay and a higher quality of life for both them and their families.   Learners can also study for their GED or for citizenship exams.  As a volunteer tutor, I have the opportunity to make a new friend and learn about another culture while sharing my English language skills.  I cannot speak highly enough about  the good work of Literacy Green Bay that helps learners gain the skills to make life-long improvements in their lives!
Literacy Green Bay Inc	177412		/users/profile/233965	thesuetucker	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Literacy Green Bay helps adult English language learners break down communication barriers so that they can use their skills to improve the quality of life for themselves, their families and their communities.  Literacy Green Bay expertly prepares and equips volunteer mentors to teach English language skills and GED preparation.  Literacy Green Bay also partners with  other local agencies so that  the children of their adult learners can be simultaneously engaged in learning.  As a mentor, I've found my students to be highly motivated and have enjoyed learning about their cultures as we work together.  I find it truly rewarding when students surpass their learning goals or receive job promotions due to their improved skills.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	217011		/users/profile/280535	Nancy Chuck W.	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I have been a tutor for 8 years, working with a woman from Mexico.  She wanted to be able to speak, read, and understand English to better function in the US.  She has met many of my goals for her, but not all of them for herself, so we continue to meet twice a week for 3 hours.  The literacy organization makes my job easier by supplying materials and advice and a place to meet, plus sponsoring events throughout the year that help both the tutors and the students.  They provide such an amazing service for the immigrants who want to fit into our society.   I receive so much satisfaction from my interaction with my student and all the kind folks at Literacy Green Bay.  I hope to be able to tutor for many years to come.  
Literacy Green Bay Inc	216882		/users/profile/280406	Bobbi E.	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I have been involved with Literacy Green Bay for close to four years as a volunteer tutor.  From the first communication I had with the organization expressing interesting in becoming a tutor, everyone has been professional and helpful and that continues on today.  Even when I had to step away from tutoring for a while, they were accommodating to my needs.  The work they do with the adult learners is exceptional.  Adult learners are reaching the goals they've set for themselves; earning their GED, advancing in their employment, or becoming US citizens.  It's a great organization and one I'm very proud to be associated with and supportive of!
Literacy Green Bay Inc	210129		/users/profile/230968	lindsaybarber	Board Member	5	08/11/2014	I have been a board member of Literacy Green Bay for five years and I am always impressed with the organization. We have many volunteers that donate several hours of their week to Literacy Green Bay and it shows...we have a great success rate of students achieving their goals, they are offered jobs, receive promotions and many have learned to read to their children in English. We are also helping adults receive their GEDs, which allows them to apply for better jobs, which results in better wages for them and their families. If you can't read, it is hard to succeed; we help people read and write so that they can accomplish all their dreams and goals! Beyond that, our tutors continue tutoring for years and years, forming lifelong friendships with their students. 
Literacy Green Bay Inc	174660		/users/profile/230968	lindsaybarber	Board Member	5	10/07/2013	I am board member for Literacy Green Bay because I believe in the organization, staff and volunteer tutors. Our volunteers spend countless hours every year tutoring adults and children. Adults are assisted in basic skills, such as reading, writing and math, that help them attain better jobs, be better parents and contribute to society as a whole. While parents are being tutored, young children are cared for and/or school age children receive tutoring as well. We empower, we are inclusive and we collaborate with other agencies to help build a great community of citizens in Green Bay.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	209551		/users/profile/272313	Gina4210	Board Member	5	08/08/2014	I have been involved with Literacy Green Bay for almost six years and I continue to be amazed by the support our organization receives both from the community and individual volunteers giving their time to be tutors.  Our current Executive Director has been involved with Literacy Green Bay for over 20 years and she is as passionate and energetic today as she was when she started.  She has an in depth understanding of the needs in our community and what our organization needs to provide to meet those needs. It's so rewarding to see the impact that our services have on the lives and families of our students.  They are so determined to work hard to improve their English Language skills enabling them to provide for their families and be active, contributing members of our community.  The pride and confidence that is gained through their education is very inspiring.  
Literacy Green Bay Inc	209409		/users/profile/272175	tatwell	Board Member	5	08/08/2014	I was attracted to the Literacy GB board of directors because it was a chance to become involved in an organization tackling a fundamental issue for NE WI. Literacy GB gives the students a chance to improve the english (and other) skills that are crucial for their advancement in their educational and workforce careers. While area classrooms and workplaces benefit from better communication, the whole community benefits from the increased opportunities for day to day human interaction.  As Green Bay moves forward through the changing social and economic patterns of the mid-21st century, we have to strengthen our community by increasing the cooperation and interaction between the diverse cultural and ethnic groups. Removing language barriers and allowing involvement in work and school life are key to pulling the community together. The staff and tutors are dedicated to the cause and it shows.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	209222		/users/profile/271994	clhujet	Board Member	5	08/07/2014	I am extremely proud of my affiliation and Board Membership with Literacy Green Bay.  Sometimes I feel that people underestimate the important work Literacy does and the contributions they make to our community.  It is so inspiring to hear how the classes, tutors and staff have helped people not just with their English skills, but with helping them to integrate into our community and become active participants.  It helps to make them better, more productive parents, employees and citizens.  It helps them to truly feel part of their community and this country.  And the pride that they exhibit tells us that what we are doing is truly meaningful. 
Literacy Green Bay Inc	209201		/users/profile/271972	Ra2DaCobb	Board Member	5	08/07/2014	Ever since I became a member of the Board of Directors for Literacy Green Bay I have been impressed with the amount of life changing programs that are offered by the organization.  We are meeting the needs of an often overlooked population in our community and for that I am proud to be associated with this organization.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	209121		/users/profile/222314	dmaedke	Board Member	5	08/07/2014	While there are other great non-profits out there, Literacy Green Bay is my favorite!  I joined the Board of Directors almost six years ago and have enjoyed seeing this organization give so much back to individuals as well as strengthening the members of our Green Bay community.  The work that the LGB staff, volunteers and board members do gives me hope that we still live in a world that truly cares about helping others become self-sufficient and better geared to be fully functional adults, parents and employees.  I look forward to staying involved in this organization after my second term is up, becoming a tutor to continue to give back to this great non-profit.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	167448		/users/profile/222314	dmaedke	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	There are not many organizations within Green Bay that provide the type of services that Literacy Green Bay does that can essentially change the lives of the participants which in essence, reshape the community that we live in.   Literacy Green Bay not only provides participants with skills training in many areas but also the encouragement that is necessary to help individuals want to become better parents, employees as well as community members.   I am lucky to be on the board for this organization to personally hear about and view the progress that is made daily  by those who participate in the programs as well as the devotion of the staff and many volunteers that the organization needs in order to keep the mission alive.  
Literacy Green Bay Inc	201522		/users/profile/263011	JoBrad	Volunteer	5	05/31/2014	I began tutoring for Literacy Green Bay about six months, the 12-hour certification was a valuable experience for anyone who wishes to teach, the experienced instructors share their wisdom and emphasize learning style preference for engaging students. I was impressed at the commitment to quality instruction that the organization and the volunteers commit to before every entering a classroom or tutor session. I meet with my student regularly at the Literacy Center and all of staff have been helpful answering questions, providing information and resources. The center is a humming with activity everyday, with students of all ages with diverse backgrounds and educational goals.  It truly is a place where students are inspired daily and they in turn inspire their teachers and volunteers. My student wants to obtain his GED and is more dedicated to his homework and our classtime than any student I have ever had.

Literacy Green Bay Inc	177822		/users/profile/234412	The Shadow	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	About a year ago I entered the world of the tutor of English as a Second Language.  I started with the twelve hour certification training program.  It was very well organized and presented positively to my group of about ten potential tutors.  After completion I was given three options of three very different individuals to choose as my first learner.  I selected a gentleman from Puerto Rico and have spent the last year with him.  My personal journey to Literacy Green Bay took about two years after I retired.  It is the right fit.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  I rest my case.  
Literacy Green Bay Inc	177722		/users/profile/234303	SLSP	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I tutor an ELL student who's goal is to earn his GED.  My student has four children and a full time job.  He is dedicated to learning and has steadily advanced.  I know that he will be able to achieve his goals.  It is a rewarding experience to be able to help him fulfill his dreams - the American Dream.  Literacy Green Bay makes this possible for my student and many others. 
Literacy Green Bay Inc	177454		/users/profile/234011	cheagle	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Before even starting my tutoring experience, I already feel that the time spent in training has been a valuable one to help understand the needs of adult learners and the value of giving my time to a student. Literacy Green Bay volunteer instructors do an outstanding job of preparing you for the role of tutor. They instill a passion for assisting others on their road to learning the English language and becoming productive and contributing members of their community. It is evident that everyone involved is dedicated to providing all of the support that is needed to both tutors and students and they do so in a way that helps you to validate that the time spent giving back is valuable and worthwhile.
Literacy Green Bay Inc	171276		/users/profile/226823	smstein	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2013	The combined efforts of the staff and scores of volunteers at Literacy Green Bsy is an exemplary model of changing lives.  With a modest budget, and steadfast dedication to literacy, LGB provides opportunities to adults with a commitment to making a better life for themselves and their families.  As a former board member and volunteer tutor, I have seen first hand the life changing results of this organization's tireless work.  Literacy is the gateway skill to productive employment and responsible citizenship.  Community members can point to Literacy Green Bay with pride

I am an undergraduate student at Colorado State University studying Equine Science and Business Administration with a Pre-Occupational Therapy focus. I hope to one day work as an Occupational Therapist specializing in Hippotherapy. When I began my internship, I was immediately given great trust and responsibility; the staff is incredibly friendly and function like a well-oiled machine. The teamwork demonstrated among this group of professionals is unparalleled. As a volunteer, I was welcomed as part of this family-minded team and was constantly encouraged to challenge myself and share my ideas. Nature's Edge feels safe and comforting, providing an excellent atmosphere for therapy and an engaging environment for learning.  The experiences and wisdom I have gained from my time as an intern with Nature's Edge can only be described as life-changing. I was not simply "the intern"; I was a member of the team and part of the Nature's Edge family. I was given the tremendous opportunity to make meaningful connections with both staff and the clients I worked with throughout my time at Nature's Edge. In seeing the  hope and happiness this center brings to its clients and their families, I have found passion and motivation to provide the same level of expert care in my future career in Hippotherapy.

My husband and I had been struggling on what to do about our sons meltdowns. It's hard to watch your child go in a downward spiral and not have the tools to help him. The second day we were at Natures Edge he had a full meltdown. Becky and her staff were great. They calmed him down and showed me what I could do for next time. We worked together on what we could do when I returned home. Since we returned home his meltdowns are much milder, and far and few between. The services we received at Nature's Edge has changed our lives and have made a positive change in our son. We now have a renewed excitement and hope that things are going to continue to get better. Thank you to everyone at Nature's Edge. You can't put a price in that kind of therapy. We can not wait to return and show them our progress. I highly recommend Nature's Edge.

Nature's Edge Therapy Center, Inc.	243973	2	/users/profile/330827	bflouro	Volunteer	5	05/30/2015	What a rewarding experience to be a volunteer at NETC! Everyone is incredible to work with and, of course, all the animals! With being a retired Spec. Ed. teacher, I truly realize the importance of quality learning for children and adults with special needs.  I was involved in the 2014 summer programs for the Social Skills and Staying Active groups, along with sharing laughter yoga.   With my passion for horses, it has been exciting to be part of the hippotherapy program as a sidewalker and an active participant in the therapy sessions.  The progress of the children, their connection with the horses, and the strong parental support are absolutely amazing in this natural ranch setting.  I am thrilled to be on the NETC staff as an Equine Massage Therapist and Volunteer Coordinator.  I love massaging the horses, and even Buddy, the 3-legged dog.  It provides many benefits to maintaining their health and well-being, enabling them to be therapy animals for years to come.  I am a Pet Partner team with Bandit, Natures Edge therapy dog.   We visit area nursing homes and senior citizen facilities, bringing joy and healing to the residents.

We had tried a clinically-based agency with only minimal results.  After four years of trying many things, we had hit a point in March of 2015 where he refused to go to OT anymore.  At a conference, we found Nature's Edge and we haven't looked back since!  Christian LOVES therapy because of the animals and being outside.  He's an animal-lover and has a blast "playing" with the animals.  Little does he know he's receiving top-rate Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy during his playdates with his animal friends.

Client Served	5	05/20/2015	On March 17, 2014, our daughter, Brianna, was involved in a terrible car accident and was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, polytrauma, shattered pelvis, left clavicle fracture, critical illness polyneuropathy,right-sided foot drop, and diabetes insipidus. Brianna started speech and occupational therapy at Natures Edge four days after an almost four and a half month hospital stay. Brianna made amazing progress from thevery first visit. As Briannas mother, I do not feel Brianna would be doing as well as she is or be asengaged in her therapy if it were not for Natures Edge. We feel like we are with family at Natures Edge andwould recommend this type of therapy to anyone who wants to make huge progress in record time.

He started without saying our names to speaking full sentences, responding to us verbally and is able to participate fully in school. It meant much for us to hear him talk to us, he now tells me I'm his friend and he loves us.  Simple words that can be taken for granted, that now mean the world to us.   Becky and Heidi have spent countless hours helping us get assistance for Colten and working to help him .

When we first started I was the only one who could understand what he was saying.  He would become very frustrated with himself and the person he was talking to.  Becky has helped him so much.  She has also taught us the skills we need to help Brandon out at home.  Becky is not only a gifted therapist but also a wonderful person.  She truly loves her job and is a strong advocate for each person she serves.  Brandon's life has truly been changed at NETC.  He loves "his farm" and is going to be a GREAT volunteer there someday!!

He has been in speech and cccupational therapy.  They are absolutely AMAZING in what they do.  The way they work and make them selves available to not just the kids but also provide a wonderful support system to the parents.  Ethan LOVES going there and really strives on making them proud of him.  We have seen MANY improvements in his behavior and more in his skills.  He is 8 years old and we have been working for years to help him tie his own shoes...Heidi(OT) had him tying them within a half hour.  It was a proud moment to see the look of accoplishment on his face.  They have given both Ethan and myself many tools.  The ideas they come up with and the skills they teach you couldn't get in a "regular" facility with the same programs.  The patience and love that comes from them is honest and rare.  We LOVE them and are very grateful to have found them:)

At 34 months old shewas diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to complications duringdelivery. Physical, occupational and speech therapies were ordered for her.  I found NETC through our school and was amazed that such a center operated relatively close to our home. Kayleigh started seeing Becky and all the animals and has never been the same!She started therapy as a very unintelligible little girl who usedalot of her own sign language to make her needs and wants known. She has grown into a more confident, talkative, social butterfly.There are no words that can sufficiently express the gratitudeand love we have for Becky, Amanda and everyone that works and volunteers for the Center. God gave us two miracles, the first named Kayleigh and the second named Nature's Edge Therapy Center.

We are amazed with the progress that she has been making! She truly enjoys going to therapy and never says I dont want to go! The therapists make the experience fun and engaging using traditional therapy techniques along with animal assisted therapy. Thats Taites favorite part, of course!  Taite has been receiving various therapy since she was 13 months old. We have been to several different therapy centers but NETC is by far the best yet! We feel so grateful that Heidi, the OT, was able to identify issues with Taites vision and make a referral to a vision therapist. We had no idea she had vision problems and no other OT (or doctor or neurologist or school professional) had even mentioned that perhaps she had vision issues. Heidi is wonderful at engaging Taite in therapy and always has practical suggestions for carry--over at home. I admire her ability to be patient and stay focused especially when my daughter isnt!  Becky, the speech therapist and Director, has helped us to better understand Taites speech problems. She has a very comprehensive approach that doesnt just focus on articulation but other parts of language as well.  I believe this is why Taite's speech has been progressing so well since coming to NETC. We have seen improvement in her overall language skills and I am amazed at Beckys creativity to engage Taite in a task that could otherwise be very dull. She also has practical suggestions for home and was very open to working with us on creating an intensive therapy schedule for Taite this summer.   Becky and Heidi are not only amazing therapists, but amazing people as well. Its been a true pleasure getting to know them and working with them together to help my daughter. Its what makes coming to NETC special and above the rest.  I am so grateful that they were open (and excited) about doing two week intensive therapy with Taite this summer as I believe its already made a difference in her!

The Center strives to personalize each session so the patients enjoy coming. I've seen the staff utilize everything from the plants, dogs, cats, a talking parrot,  the horses including two Icelandic Horses (which are my personal favorites as i am part of the Untied States Icelandic Horse Congress) and even a chinchilla  to motivate and facilitate patients to reach their goals of  better living.

Our family was struggling just to make it through each and every day - we were exhausted and my son was frustrated.  We had so many questions, no real answers, and our son just kept slipping father away from us.  Then over a year ago when our son had just turned five we found Nature's Edge Therapy Center, and our lives have been changed ever since.  The staff is caring and dedicated to each client and family's success.  They answer any questions we have, give us resources,  and teach us techniques we can transfer over to our son's daily life. We have seen an impressive improvement in our son's communication skills, socialization abilities, behavior control, gross motor and fine motor skills, increase independence in activities of daily living, and safety awareness just to name a few.   Most importantly we are seeing how proud he is of his own accomplishments!   We are now able to go out to eat for dinners as a family.  Such a minute task for other families is a great triumph for ours, and we give a lot of the credit to Nature's Edge Therapy Center.  Thank you Nature's Edge Therapy Center for giving our son his smile back!

He has autism and needed speech therapy to help improve his communication.  He made tons of progress, but we also received help in working through his picky eating....finally!  We carried the ideas introduced during his therapy sessions out at home.  He is now able to eat what the rest of his family eats and is willing to try new foods.

At 3 she  had just been diagnosed with PDD-NOS, an Autism spectrum disorder.  All we knew was that we wanted to get her as much help as possible.  However, living in a rural area, that wasn't easy to do.   We were told about Nature's Edge and as soon as we talked to Becky for the first time we knew we had found someone who could help.  When we visited Nature's Edge it was beautiful!  For our daughter, it was a comfortable in-home setting where she could practice speech and language, paired with the challenge of outdoor activities and experiences with the animals that were truly therapeutic.  There were real social experiences that you just can't find in a clinical setting.  It was really refreshing!  We've been going to Nature's Edge for 3 years and our daughter has made great strides and is going into second grade with her peers!  We know it is thanks to the hard work, creativity and expertise of Becky and the staff at Nature's Edge!

I love watching the patients respond to them and to the animals and to being out in nature.  Therapy is still hard work, but it's also fun at Nature's Edge.  The entire staff is very supportive of the patients and their families.  And of course the animals are the best.  It's such a positive environment to help patients progress toward their therapeutic goals.  Nature's Edge is a great alternative to traditional, clinical therapy!
Congo Initiative	300687		/users/profile/121460	NCGrandma	Volunteer	5	08/16/2016	As volunteers for an international outreach committee of our church since 2011, we have come to know some key leaders, staff, and volunteers of Congo Initiative, both in the U.S. and in Beni, Congo, including the extended Kasali family, Cullen Rodgers-Gates, Kyle and Emily Hamilton, and members of the current Board of Directors. This is a truly amazing and transformative initiative in a troubled nation by people who truly love their neighbors. In the past few years, the Bilingual University of Congo has made amazing physical progress, adding solar energy, completing its community center (with four new classrooms for training over 300 more students), adding faculty for research, theology, and psychological counseling, and developing a new law degree program. Most importantly, Its graduates have become leaders and advocates for human rights, improved  agriculture, communications, and community development, to name a few of their accomplishments.

Isn't that what God has called us to do?  Bring light into the darkness and expose those things in our lives that need to be changed, that we might  be transformed!  This is exactly what UCBC (Congo Initiative) is doing.  There is so much work to be done, to some it may appear impossible, but nothing is impossible with God!  We are grateful to Him that we can join Him in supporting an organization that is so positive.

Congo Initiative	271985	1	/users/profile/360913	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/13/2015	Congo Initiative has an inspiring vision for transformation of the nation of DR Congo through Christ-based transformation of its future leaders.  By establishing UCBC -- a new university in Beni, in the Eastern part of DRC -- and developing other community-based programs in the city (programs for women and children, social justice, primary education, spiritual renewal, agricultural support, radio broadcasting, environmental care, etc.), Congo Initiative is doing hard and important work, and I am proud to support the ministry through time and giving.  I have been inspired by the vision of the founder, Dr. David Kasali, and the committed work of the people that work for the ministry.  I have also had a chance to visit the campus in person to see the fruits of the ministry's effort first-hand, and that was truly amazing.
Congo Initiative	271930	1	/users/profile/143784	Sarah49	Donor	5	11/12/2015	I've been supporting Congo Initiative through their Kipepeo project since 2008.  The reason I started was because I wanted to give something back after having been given, debt-free, an excellent education at Wheaton College.  Knowing how much Wheaton impacted my life I was inspired by the idea of giving the same opportunity to students in Congo, even though I've never visited that country. I've faithfully supported Congo Initiative from a distance (I live in Guatemala, Central America).  However, what helped me to understand the project deeper was to read Dr David Kasali's biography.  I received it in the mail and set it aside  One day I just started leafing through, and I couldn't put it down!  I read the whole thing and even cried through parts of it because of how real and beautiful God's working has been in the lives of the Kasalis.  Thanks to Congo Initiative for being such an innovative, excellent and faith-filled group of people. Sarah Agee
Congo Initiative	106429	1	/users/profile/143784	Sarah49	Donor	5	02/14/2012	I support Congo Initiative as a Kipepeo partner, giving a small amount monthly to help students with their tuition.  Having gone to a Christian Liberal Arts college in the US, I know how formative the college years are, and how important it is to have professors who integrate Christian character with good scholarship and social concern.  As an American, I have been overwhelmingly blessed with educational opportunities, and one of the small ways I can "give back" is by helping those who, because they live in another country, have not been given the advantages I have.  I want these Congolese young people to grow to a holistic understanding of God's goodness and grace for them and for their whole country.  This is why I give to the Congo Initiative.
Congo Initiative	271925	1	/users/profile/360842	W Michael M.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2015	Republic of Congo... what a place!I have taught in U.S. colleges, in Uganda, and in Congo.The difference was huge.My students at the University were gems to teach. They were so hungry for truth and for education that would help them to succeed for themselves, for their God, and for their country.I would gladly teach them anywhere and anytime. Sometimes I felt helpless in Congo. I was not helpless for myself... it was for the whole situation. Dr. Kasali and others were there for me 24 hours a day and I never felt in danger or in any way unsupported. Looking back on it I have realized that everyone was sacrificing more than I did just to have me come over and teach.I taught Christian Formation....a course about growing in Christ and working toward more holiness throughout one's life. The windows were behind my students,,, so as I taught them I saw other students making concrete blocks across the campus and nearby women and children gong to the spring to draw water. The pregnant woman with two small children helping her to carry water was the most poignant example of the depth of the tragedy that is Congo. I will never drink water, read scripture for the water of life, or shelter from the rain without remembering UCBC.(It was like watching two worlds at once. The women and their little children drew water into large plastic containers because they were thirsty, and the students were just as thirsty for the water of life... while other students were making building materials that would keep rain off their heads.)Beni is such a heartbreaking city with a light of great hope in it. I was blessed to be part of  the teaching. I would recommend it to any Christian teacher who wants to volunteer somewhere in the world where it will make a profound difference on you to go there. I recommend Dr. David Kasali, his staff, and the students to you. Teaching at UCBC  or supporting the effort is prayer and money well spent. My health will not allow me to go back.  Will someone volunteer in my place? Dr. W Michael McCrocklin
Congo Initiative	144911	2	/users/profile/191463	Richard and Martha	Donor	5	11/30/2012	Congo is one of those places that both captures our imaginations and breaks our hearts. It feels like a place where the Light sometimes stands little chance against the dark.  So rich in natural resources but so damaged for so long by colonialism and warring factions, Congos needs sometimes seem overwhelming.  Then along comes Congo Initiativeoffering real hope in the shape of a new generation of leaders  and offering people like us an opportunity to make a small but meaningful difference.  Founder and Director David Kilgali was once a guest in our home, and he impressed us with his vision and integrity.  In addition, a friend of ours believes so much in the work of Congo Initiative that she has given up her career here and moved from the U.S. to Congo to invest her life there.  We get regular updates from her about the good, if challenging, work of Congo Initiative. Even without these personal connections, giving to Congo Initiative would have been an easy decision for us because we believe that one of the best ways to achieve lasting change in Congo is through accomplishing CI's mission of raising up new leaders. 
Congo Initiative	142826	2	/users/profile/189262	Megan40	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012		We give because we see the huge potential for future transformation of the Congo through students who go to UCBC.  My husband Josh has been to UCBC four times, from 2008 and 2009, and I joined Josh for one of the trips as well.  He was fortunate to spend a number of months there and really get to know some of the students while helping promote agriculture and sustainable land use at UCBC.  He worked with the students during their work programs: cutting grass with machetes, breaking the sod with hoes, and planting crops.  The work program at UCBC is so important because educated people in the Congo are normally seen as people who direct others, and are not always willing to get their hands dirty.  By stressing hard work as well as academics, UCBC is training a new class of Congolese university graduates who are ready to really do some transforming work as they graduate and go into communities with the values and education they picked up at UCBC. 	I was still in school when we were visited, and Josh went back to school for my PhD when we returned.  At this time when we are unable to be in Beni at UCBC, we still really believe in the work there and want to support it however we can.  We know the building fund is important, but supporting the students is what we really connected with.  Many of the students really struggle to get the school fees necessary to attend UCBC, often having to ask relatives for support, and the student's families often have to make huge sacrifices for the opportunity for their children to attend.  By setting aside money each month, we are able to support the great work UCBC is doing whileJosh is finishing school.  By being a Kipepeo partner, we hope to help Congo become a better place through a student we help support.  
Congo Initiative	120028	2	/users/profile/163187	jessica.shewan	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2012	After hearing about CI's great work in Beni several years ago, I finally had the chance to visit in June 2012.  While I was only in Beni for a few days, it was important to see and hear from the administration, faculty and students how they are practically realizing their mission, specifically of raising up new Christian leaders at UCBC to lead the transformation of Congo.  One of the distinctives of CI is their emphasis on developing Congolese leadership, and I saw this modeled by the godly leadership of UCBC's administration.  I was glad to see how international partners are included in supporting roles, and now I hope to find a way to return and contribute!  I was also blessed by the incredible hospitality I received, and the eagerness of my hosts to make me feel welcome.
Congo Initiative	117520	1	/users/profile/159769	Awet A.	Volunteer	5	07/02/2012	I visited Beni for one month (June 2012) and taught two courses at UCBC, in the Faculty of Theology.  I was richly blessed by the experience, and hope to continue working with Congo Initiative.  First of all, as others have pointed out in their reviews, this is an organization with a bold vision and a radical dependence on God.  Secondly, it represents a true partnership of individuals and groups from the global south and north, with Congolese staff at the forefront.  This was the impression I had when I first heard of Congo Initiative, and this impression was confirmed by my actual visit.  As an African myself (though not Congolese), I was inspired to see how CI is finding a new way, challenging standard NGO models, and demonstrating innovative servant leadership by Africans.  Because of UCBC's aim to transform the Congolese educational system, I was encouraged and given tools to help me implement creative approaches to teaching that enabled students to be empowered agents in their own education.  The staff and students are very warm and welcoming, and I had a good balance of guidance/support and room for independence.  The university is in the midst of developing a strategic plan, so some of the issues that they will need to address in the coming years, as they grow and expand and refine the implementation of their vision, are already well-known to the staff.  One of the challenges they face is that everyone has too much to do, due to financial limitations which do not permit expansion of staff and facilities.  Beyond the university, CI has a number of centers which are just as active, in their own way, as the university.  While this is wonderful, and they are doing amazing work, I sensed that the decentralized format combined with the need for greater central coordination meant that some resources in personnel and diversity of gifts and talents are not always fully utilized.  Coordination of communication is also an issue, although I think part of that for me was the fact that I am an outsider and still learning how the mechanisms for communication (among staff, between administration and staff, to the students) functions here.  I hope that they will be able to provide more of a participatory role for the students themselves, so that they feel greater ownership about the policies and activities of the university.  The service-learning project (e.g., in the class on DRC Realities) provided an excellent example of the effectiveness of student participation.  Also, in my class, the students presented a chapel service to demonstrate and disseminate what they had learned about reconciliation and conflict (and, simultaneously, about theologies of music and worship).  They did an excellent job, and introduced creative innovations which have the potential to impact the status quo at the university and in the communities in which they live and work.  One other issue is the bilingual piece.  On the one hand, I think it is an excellent goal to educate students to be able to participate in the anglophone and francophone worlds, which is critical for the development of DRC.  On the other hand, UCBC has not yet gotten where it needs and wants to be in terms of bilingual education.  I taught my courses in English, and had a translator, which made things easy for me (I speak some French, but am very far from fluent).  However, I noticed that some of the students whose English skills were not as strong as their colleagues struggled somewhat with the English portions of the course, even when a translator was present.  The university is new, and I am not sure if the bilingual piece is something that just needs more time to develop, or if more effective mechanisms need to be put into place to ensure that all students achieve proficiency in English.  Also, if funding could be expanded, it is important that more Congolese and other African faculty can be employed on an ongoing basis, with visiting faculty in a supplementary role, and all faculty be provided with training and support to enhance their pedagogical effectiveness and improve the implementation of UCBC's innovative vision for Congolese education.  This is already being done, but could be done even more extensively and regularly.  I understand they are working on improving their faculty development.  Mary Henton has done a great job facilitating this, and I learned a lot about the UCBC models of pedagogy from her.  All this having been said, it is clear that the road to meaningful and sustainable transformation in the DRC is a long one, and I greatly admire the work the Congo Initiative is already doing.  I pray that God will enable them to continue on this path, growing and learning as they go, and I hope to accompany them on that journey, in whatever ways I can.
Congo Initiative	111744		/users/profile/152144	Brittany4	Donor	5	05/10/2012	Since Congo Initiative was in its early stages, I've been compelled by the authentic partnership and deep compassion at its core. Congo Initiative relies on existing visionary leaders to call forth and empower a new generation of creative, passionate leaders who will work for renewal in Congo and all of East and Central Africa. My own university experience formed my mind and spirit to do the work I love today, and I am honored to be able to make that possible for young leaders like myself in Congo. The Kipepeo Partners program makes that connection possible.
Congo Initiative	110876	1	/users/profile/150925	echanning	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	I visited UCBC in March 2012.  I was able to teach a class to theology students and lead a few basketball clinics.  The leadership is solid, passionate, and full of vision for the future.  God is using this university to change the face of Congo.
Congo Initiative	108283	2	/users/profile/147380	Lisa78	Donor	5	03/25/2012	As a monthly donor, I have found that Congo Initiative is a professional and transparent organization.  CI clearly communicates with me as a donor and have shown me the direct impact of my donations.  Without a doubt, I will continue to support this organization and the great work they are doing on the ground in Eastern Congo.

The passion of staff and students is extraordinary and the opportunities they have to change this country for the better are great. I will be counting the days until I return for a longer time. This organization is what international partnership and sustainable development looks like!

I had the privilege to participate with Engineering Ministries International in helping CI develop a master plan for their campus in Beni, DRC.  I was extremely impressed with the great work they are doing in that war torn country.  They are definitely taking education to a much higher level than is currently available.  They are truly making a difference.  Right now, in addition to their academic building, they have a partially complete community center.  Once this center is complete it will greatly increase their service to the local community.

I remember first hearing about the vision for UCBC in the beginning.  It was thrilling and overwhelming.  I couldnt help but shake my headit seemed impossible, undoubtedly a God-sized task.  But then, as a friend put it, God eats impossible for breakfast.  That the Lord is in the business of redemption and restoration everywhere is true.  I have heard of and wept for the sorrow and ruin in the DRC, but here is a new thing filled with hope, filled with joy, filled with life!  
Congo Initiative	106545	2	/users/profile/144003	Davita M.	Donor	5	02/16/2012	As soon as I found out about the work of Congo Initiative, I started giving to their programs monthly, and praying for them. While I have never been to the D.R. Congo, it means so much to me that Congo Initiative is working to build up strong and courageous women and men who will lead the D.R. Congo's future generations. I am inspired that Congo Initiative is promoting justice and nation-building on their campus...a campus where women are being respected, valued, and equipped for leadership! And, I am grateful that Congo Initiative is caring for disadvantaged women, and teaching them important skills. I wish I had even more to give. Being a Kipepeo Partner is the least I can do to help. Davita MaharajMasters candidate in International Human Rights LawOxford University
Congo Initiative	106519	1	/users/profile/143954	Trustoverfear	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	My husband, Kirby Frank, and I committed to a trip to DR Congo to visit our daughter, Chelsie Frank, who has worked here for 4 years.  Our trip was a sensory overload of sights, sounds, smells, and feelings.  I almost did not go on the trip after reading a little about the country, its poverty, violence among tribes and faction groups, its political corruption, and health issuesalmost letting fear get in the way of a great learning and growing experience.  Im glad Spirit led me past this fearSights:  Beautiful green scenery, with blue, sun-filled sky; dust everywhere from unpaved roads, women carrying laundry, or water, or SOMETHING on their heads, while carrying a small child on their backs, small children (8-12 years or so) carrying water, pushing bikes with bananas to the market, garbage everywhere on the main roads, men and women sitting along the side of the road, selling their fruits/vegetables, and also in the huge marketplace, earning about $20.00 a month, not seeing very many elderly persons (average lifespan male is 40 years old, female 55 years old); seeing the clinic/hospital with minimal means of caring for people but dedicated, compassionate health workers doing their respective jobs with joy, church worshippers singing loudly and joyfully with hope and faith, UCBC leadership challenging students to look beyond what they know to a vision of hope and change, UCBC students taking them up on that challenge and learning and growing in leadership, service to their communities, and knowledge in their particular major field, with dreams and goals to make their country a stronger, better place; meeting NGO (non-government organizations) workers with commitment and care working with the Congolese people, the tree supports of buildings, mud huts, thatched roofs, Sounds:  Motorcycles (the main mode of transportation); music, radio, Smells:  Charcoal fires, great food, dust,  It was recommended that we not take pictures in DRCongo, except inside UCBC, or at Chelsies home.  So, I dont have pictures to share, only in my mind where they are seered forever in my memory. There are also locked gates, overnight guards, and a cautious attitude about walking the streets at night.  This was reality that I didnt get used to in my short stay there, but upon further reflection in the USA we have apartment/condo entry systems (locked gates?) and a 911 system, and police/fire system in place to monitor and watch over us (guard?) and I dont walk the streets after dark in too many places, unless I am with someone) so, it isnt so different. Also, these things took a back seat to the very warm and hospitable welcome we received from EVERYONE we were introduced to, and the call to relationship that each person invited us into.  The UCBC, funded by Congo Initiative,  is an incredible place. The students we spoke to really have caught the message of the mission, and are hopeful and dedicated to making positive change in DRCongo with their leadership skills and passion for their chosen field. The staff there are faith-filled, hard-working, inspirational, dedicatedmostly Congolese professors who witness what hard work, education, faith, forgiveness and resiliency can bringThere are gardens that help support the universitys food supply, goats, and chickens, toothere is a radio station, library, small computer lab with limited internet service, classrooms of 12-15 students, except for a few larger auditorium classroom lectures, 500 students and staff that fill up the space with learning and hope.  The stories of the service learning projects that many classes have participated in were inspirational and courageous.  One group reached out to the deaf student school, where they participated in mentoring and teaching and helped raise some money by making soap, af ter learning the teaching arent paid, and tuition is waived for parents who dont have means to pay. They became  aware of how these students are alientated from others. And learned that Disability doesnt mean Inability. Another group went to the local movie theaters to challenge the owners to offer more than the violent, immoral types of movies that are mostly offered.  Another group built benches on the campus for students to sit on under shade.  The concept of service learning appeared to be a new one for the students, and I can already see Spirit working as a domino effect and this will spread far and wide over the next years as the students, then the Congolese people, are empowered to effect positive change with a dream, a little effort, a little faith and thus a stronger, better community! Kudos to Chelsie Frank for her vision and leadership in putting this program together, along with the other USBC professors and staff.   After taking in all these moments, I found myself leaving DRCongo with a change in perspective:  I came feeling despair and fear; believing that what the Congolese people have been through, and continue to have challenges about, was too overwhelming, too entrenched to be much different.  I left feeling a great faith and hope as I witnessed the staff and students commit to a vision faith in a God who loves and cares for them, a vision of integrity, honesty, hard work, and a vision of change for a better DRCongo.  I asked David Kasali, the UCBC President, if he was afraid of doing what he was doing--for himself or his family-- because change is always threatening to people of influence and power.  His reply, I am more afraid of NOT doing what I doout countrys future depends on it.  Spoken just like our OT prophets, and of Jesus himselfand why the Scriptures have more passages with the message Be Not Afraid more than any other subject matter.  I left feeling humbled that I could even sit among these people, grateful for the opportunity as it leaves me feeling empowered and renewed to be open to Gods challenges in my own life, and hopeful for our world and the DRCongo that peace and goodwill among men (and women), is possible if we but trust and work for the kingdom here on earth.    
Congo Initiative	102068	1	/users/profile/132051	Francine Nabintu	Volunteer	5	12/09/2011	 I am Francine NABINTU, I have graduated from UCBC in communications. Actually, I am one of the rare Congolese women who are skilled in multimedia and journalism. I got my state diploma in 2000 and did not have any vision for my future life, except getting married and take care of my husband and children as any authentic African girl could think. But, coming to UCBC had changed my vision, perception and hope about myself and my country.I was challenged by an American multimedia professor, Anne Medley, who came to teach us at UCBC thanks to some donors. She showed us pity stories of Congo that had been told by foreign journalists. The most heard stories of Congo are: war, corruption, rape, bad management or anything of such kind. She asked us why we cant tell our own stories to change the image of our country. Since than I am getting more and more interested in writing stories, www.francongostories.blogspot.com; editing audio, video, photos about my community and my country.Thanks to UCBC I now have a vision for my country: to speak for those who suffer in silence. Since women have suffered a lot in my country, I have joined the office of Gender Advisor at HEAL Africa. I am dealing with Gender issues within the organization and networking with many women associations. I am applying my communication skills for advocacy and mobilization to change the perception of womans place in the society. I thank Congo Initiative for the seed of hope that they have sown in me and in the life of many Congolese women and men. I do not have enough words to thank anyone who contributes to support ever so little UCBC. May the lord continue to touch and bless you as the fruit of your work will benefit a whole nation.  
Congo Initiative	99870	1	/users/profile/121233	Cullen R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2011	I have the privilege of working on behalf of Congo Initiative, and have done so for more than 3 years. My role has been to assist in coordinating communication and development efforts in the United States--raising awareness and resources, as well as human resources and other administrative responsibilities. I have also had the opportunity to visit Beni last year and to spend some time with our General Assembly (Congolese Board of Directors) as well as our incredible leadership team. What I find so compelling about Congo Initiative is its commitment to genuine, international partnership. "Partnership" is a term that is used quite loosely in many different settings, but Congo Initiative is really trying to live out what it means for a North American entity and an African organization to work side-by-side, not above or below the other, but truly in mutual collaboration and dialog. It's much harder than it sounds, and messier than we might like to admit. From my vantage point, I get to see the inner workings of it all, and I can attest to the fact that it can (and does!) really work, IF an organization and its people have the patience, grace, humility and shared vision to see it through for the long haul. Its far too easy for North Americans, despite every good intention, to assume control of an international organization, and far too few organizations are really doing the hard work of collaboration that is reciprocal between offices in the Global North and those in the Global South. Congo Initiative, however, is doing this, and doing it well, albeit imperfectly. Others have articulated better than I how life-changing and transformational CIs education, leadership development and community initiatives are. I echo all that has been written in other reviews along these lines. For sure CI has a long way to goother than UCBC (Christian Bilingual University of Congo), none of the other Community Centers have been officially launched, although some are active periodically in hosting workshops and seminars of various kinds. We still have a lot of construction on campus that needs to be completed. We have a brand new radio station, but we need permanent staff to manage it, and we need many more permanent faculty for the university, not to mention staff to lead and organize each of the Community Centers. Despite all of this, however, I am amazed at the courage and resiliency of our Congolese leadership to press on. Our students are filled with real hope that they can actually be part of bringing change to a broken country. Even a brief visit to the campus in Beni leaves one with the palpable feeling that the staff and students truly believe in their motto: Being transformed to transform. More than just a catchphrase, these remarkable women and men are living out this motto on a daily basis through their hope, perseverance and faith, even in the midst of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  I strongly encourage you to support this initiative. It is a unique example of an interational partnership forged to bring about holistic transformation in a country the size of the U.S. east of the Mississippi river. A vast land with enormous potential to shape the future of an entire continent. Can you aim any higher than that? 
Congo Initiative	99366	1	/users/profile/119140	whbrown	Board Member	5	10/17/2011	I visited UCBC in Beni last year and spent the week in meetings with the Congo Board and attending the convocation ceremony to open the new school year.  Having lived and worked in Africa for over 30 years, I can truly say that I have never been anywhere in Africa that was so full of hope, excitement and potential for transformation. The UCBC campus is a beacon of light to the community and is poised to become a model of 21st century education for Africa. As a US board member I am honored to be part of an authentic partnership with the Congo board and part of a real transformative organization.
Congo Initiative	99355	2	/users/profile/119054	danilynnwalker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2011	I came to Beni to visit Congo Initiative's program at UCBC with the Service Learning Coordinator, Chelsie Frank. I work in Kampala, Uganda with a nonprofit organization called Cornerstone Development, which works in 'youth leadership development' in East Africa. One of our programs, African Youth Leadership Forum (AYLF) has included students from UCBC who have started their own branch of AYLF on campus.  While visiting UCBC, I immediately recognized the shared values of our organizations and was very impressed with the commitment to invest in young leaders with high potential and high character. The students and staff at UCBC are clearly dedicated to their country and community, with a vision to encourage leaders with integrity, which I believe is a top priority in moving any country forward.  I was particularly impressed with the staff's commitment to continually evaluate and improve their programs. During my visit, I saw their brand new radio station that will be used to educate the community about UCBC's programs, about how the community can be involved in spreading their vision and values, and to give students valuable experience in working with a radio program.  I'm certain that this program will contribute greatly to the positive development of each student and the region as a whole and I look forward to further partnering with Congo Initiative.
Congo Initiative	99341	1	/users/profile/119001	christophersnielsen	Donor	5	10/16/2011	The Congo Initiative's UCBC Service Learning Coordinator, Chelsie Noel Frank, is my personal friend.  I have known her both state side in the US as well had the privilege to connect with her on a mission trip to the Eastern DRC.  In both capacities she has shared the vision of the local Congolese people and the ground swell of their passions to transform their society and their country.  The CI and the UCBC are manifestations of such visions.  I also had the privilege to get to know UCBC's Academic Dean Honore Bunduki Kwany.  His calling and life commitment to the CI and UCBC is filled with hope and compassion for his people and it is contagious. While the CI and UCBC desperately need our help, we in turn need theirs.  It is in the true exchange of finances and relationships, that both of us can become something better and beautiful.  I encourage anyone called to check it out and give of yourselves, you and they will never be the same.-Chris Nielsen
Congo Initiative	99334		/users/profile/118978	Don Moore	Volunteer	4	10/15/2011	I visited Eastern Congo in 2004 with Dr. David Kasali and Pastor Dick Robinson and an Elmbrook team on a vision trip.  The upstart was, the planting of a seed to sow the future of the University Christian Bilingualof Congo UCBC.  The Congolese seem to be a happy family oriented people, but 50 years behind in commerce, educational opportunities and technology.  The young clearly want more.  They want educational opportunites, business opportunities and political stability....the establishment of UCBC is a big step in that direction.  The task was daunting with little money, little political support and problematic communication (no English).  However, moving ahead 2011 graduated the first class of 100 students, due to the exceptional volunteers-architects, technology support and monies provided through grants, trusts and generous personal giving.  Congo Initiative is a charitable organization supporting this effort. There are many parts of the university not completed, technology not installed and students not enrolled because of the lack of financial support. Congo Initiative needs your help!
Congo Initiative	99278		/users/profile/118875	beroronald	Donor	5	10/13/2011	I had the honor of visiting Beni, Congo with a few pastors and several businessmen prior to the establishment of the school.  In addition to spending extensive time with David we visited with numerous pastors, area businessmen and local politicians.  I have continued to follow the progress of the school from afar and have both donated to the Congo Initiative and provided some financial assistance to visitors over the past several years.  What has been accomplished to date is truly amazing!

Congo Initiative	98922	1	/users/profile/117768	rws1	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2011	Last year the president and founder of UCBC, Dr. David Kasali, came to the United States to share the university's mission with educators at some American colleges.  He requested them to consider sending faculty and providing professional development.  He asked Mary Henton, my sister-in-law, a Congo Initiative board member, to assist him in making contacts and providing transportation.  I travelled with them as they followed up on their contacts.  As we met with college presidents, faculty, and others involved in higher education, Dr. Kasali captivated his audience as he told UCBC's story, sharing Congo Initiative's vision that education is the key to building Congolese leadership. David Kasali is a master at telling the story of UCBCs beginning.  He told of hiding from rebels in the Congo bush and of his vision from God that education was a way out of the problems the Congo was having.  UCBC has come from that vision, and it has been blessed with a reputation that allowed it to be accredited much more quickly than what is the norm. In a few short years the school has been established, teachers have been engaged, and students have enrolled.   In addition, the service-learning model used at UCBC has attracted the attention of the Democratic Republic of Congo Ministry of Higher Education. UCBCs students learn to deal in very practical ways with issues within their cities and communities. This past July, the first graduating class left UCBC to begin careers in communications, applied sciences, theology, and economics, well equipped to pursue their areas of expertise and to impact in positive ways the communities in which they live. In March, my wife and I were privileged to host Honore Bunduki, UCBCs Academic Dean when he came to the United States to generate new contacts and to exchange ideas with American educators. Honore and I visited local universities and met with small groups of interested individuals.  In each context, Honore demonstrated a breadth of knowledge in education policies and philosophies, an ability to articulate UCBCs mission, and a style of communication that connects with a variety of audiences. The time I spent with Dr. Kasali and Honore Bunduki made clear to me that they have passion, integrity and commitment to excellence which will enable them to lead UCBC to a future that will impact the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In addition I believe the quality of leadership embodied in these two men ensures success of UCBC and Congo Initiative.
Congo Initiative	98455	3	/users/profile/116926	daniel.e.arnold	Volunteer	4	09/28/2011	I volunteered with Congo Initiative for a year teaching courses within the social sciences and assisting UCBC's administration with curriculum development. In addition, Congo Initiative has given me the opportunity to continue working with them, this time from both Congo and the US. The differences to Congo Initiative and UCBC in Congo from just one year to the next were profound. The quality of the students, academic buildings, student resources, and teaching had risen so much, and I felt more than ever that this was a university.  This encompasses how I see Congo Initiative and UCBC. It is a young organization and university, and change is happening very rapidly in large part to the desire of the Congolese students to learn. In the Congolese context, which is also changing rapidly, I am very excited to know that more and more UCBC students will be seeking the same changes they went through but in the whole of DRC. Watching Congolese students decide how to reconstruct their home continues to be formative of how I learn and work in the US and Congo.
Congo Initiative	98161	1	/users/profile/116527	Jim Kielsmeier	Board Member	5	09/26/2011	I joined the US Board supporting the work at UCBC in Congo after meeting the dynamic president, Dr. David Kasali. He has a bold, clear vision for creating a university backed by a substantial personal history in higher education and ministry. In 2010 I witnessed UCBC at work in war ravaged eastern Congo - very close to the border with Uganda. There is no question this well managed higher education community, which graduated its first class this June, is building a dynamic cadre of nation builders. It is being watched closely by the Democratic Republic of Congo Ministry of Higher Education in Kinshasha which sees in the integration of high quality academic training with a commitment to community engagement through service-learning a model for higher education throughout the country. I recently retired - after 28 years -  serving as founding CEO of a national NGO ( National Youth Leadership Council) with outreach to every state and more than 30 nations. UCBC is a sound investment in a region in great need of what UCBC offers. My suggestion to potential donors is go to the Congo, see for yourself. I also suggest financial investments over several years to support scholarships for students and salary for faculty. Whatever resources are invested will receive the highest level of accountability.

Congo Initiative	97529	2	/users/profile/115003	Katie23456	Volunteer	5	09/16/2011	I had the opportunity to visit CI-UCBC in March 2011.  This was my first international missions experience, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  We were greeted by the students and teachers of UCBC with open arms.  They treated us like we were family, and allowed us to immerse ourselves in their lives for two weeks.  I found through both conversations and observation that they truly live their motto, "Being Transformed to Transformed."  Every student I spoke with has a desire to transform the Congo by bringing their education back into the community.  Their unwavering spirits and love for their community is so inspiring.  I believe in the mission of UBCB, and feel that the education these students are receiving will have a powerful impact in Congo.
Congo Initiative	97318	2	/users/profile/114136	sconrad1	Donor	5	09/09/2011	I have worked with several non-profits/organizations in sub-Saharan Africa, and CI-UCBC is truly special.  This is an organization that is all about equipping and empowering young Congolese men and women to transform their country.  "Being transformed to transform" is the motto that is posted in every hallway and classroom. I was struck by the fact that students are not pursuing degrees in order to be able to take care of themselves but are pursuing an education that will allow them to invest in their communities. I am a part of the UCBC scholarship program - making a regular monthly contribution that provides scholarship help for students that cannot pay the full tuition.  Each scholarship recipient is expected to work each week for UCBC to improve the school and community.  It's a fantastic program.
Congo Initiative	97250	1	/users/profile/113996	Meredith  Knuckles	Volunteer	5	09/07/2011	CI-UCBC is training and empowering future Congolese men and women to change the DR Congo.  It has been an incredible experience to be a part of CI-UCBC for the last 2 years. I have treasured every minute of it. I love how the students have the desire to learn and grow through the education and Christian principles they are receiving.  The faculty and staff are a blessing and have shown leadership that is influencing the rest of the UCBC and Beni communities.  The vision and mission of the university is what is drawing more and more people to be a part of this effort to build future leaders. 
Congo Initiative	97249	1	/users/profile/113994	LexiSoldo	Volunteer	4	09/07/2011	Going to UCBC for the first time, I didn't know what to expect. But walking in as a complete stranger, I could feel that something special was happening in that place. UCBC is unique in not only its teaching style, but also because of its students. Each person had such a unique story and was incredibly welcoming and loving to us newcomers. After only two short weeks of being there, UCBC had a special place in my heart. Amazing things are happening there because of the amazing people who fill it.
Congo Initiative	97212	1	/users/profile/113880	chelsienoel	Volunteer	5	09/06/2011	I love working with CI-UCBC. I believe that their approach challenges the conventional development model. UCBC is building youth capacities, partnering with civil institutions, and community-based organizations to effect change in DR Congo. I have worked with the Service-Learning program for the past two years. During this time I have been impressed with the self-less leadership provided by the staff and administration, especially the Academic Dean, Honore Bunduki. 
Congo Initiative	88528	2	/users/profile/1322	revnomad	Board Member	5	05/10/2011	I have been connected to Congo Initiative since it was simply a dream in the heart and mind of its founder, Dr. David Kasali.  Growing up in Congo as a child, going through the conflicts of Independence, reading about and praying for DRC - Democratic Republic of the Congo - and its peoples, and visiting eastern DRC numerous times in the past fifteen years, it is clear to me that what is needed is a revolution, not of tribalism with guns and machetes, but a revolution in ethical, principled leadership.  This is what Congo Initiative is doing through its diverse programs, serving university students, women and children, the church, and emerging leadership.  There are many good organizations working to improve the lives of those in Congo who have suffered greatly; Congo Initiative is not simply a good organization, it is GREAT, with principled leadership and a far-reaching vision that is being lived out daily. 
Congo Initiative	88448	2	/users/profile/99566	Justin H.	Volunteer	5	05/06/2011	In October 2007, I arrived in Beni, DRC to teach English as a second language at UCBC for a year.  Little did  I know my one year plan would turn into three years and provide the opportunity to work in various capacities with an initiative and University making significant impact in eastern DRC.   Higher education is often set aside in "development work" for the sake of immediate and urgent needs.  Moreover, until recently, discourse surrounding international development and all its elements (education, conflict resolution, humanitarian aid) has lacked critical reflection on its western roots and management.  In eastern DRC, NGOs and the UN are met with skepticism, and the desire for Congolese founded and run organizations and institutions is desperately needed.   This is precisely why Congo Initiative - UCBC is so unique, offering the younger generation opportunities to receive practical education and skills in order to help there communities flourish.  Students learn social research skills to help identify the needs of their settings and ways research may lead to solution.   Additionally, the University provides a platform and space to dialogue across tribal and national identities, class, gender, and perspectives, creating a diverse community centered on one goal, to bring about change in DRC.   As noted, western aid and development is often still rooted in power dynamics and lacks critical analysis that takes into consideration the realities and needs on the ground.  I believe strongly in the role of education.  As important as it is for students (including myself) to travel to places like eastern Congo and research and participate in its change, first and foremost, opportunity should be provided for the young Congolese passionate about transforming their own communities and nations.  I have had the privilege of witnessing the university's development from the beginning stages and look forward to participating in the first students' graduation ceremony on July 30, 2011.  Their sacrifice and commitment to their educational development exhibits resiliency and I have no doubt the future of DRC is found in their minds, hands, and faith.     There remains many challenges and the Congo Initiative - UCBC will strengthened by development of consistent resource channels that will help sustain its functioning.  The students (and their families) contribute immensely to their education, but in order to provide the best, scholarships and endowment funds are necessary.  Additional faculty and faculty development remains one of the greatest needs.  This includes Congolese faculty as well as international faculty that can contribute diverse perspectives in respective fields and create an atmosphere of research and learning together.  
Congo Initiative	88271	2	/users/profile/99208	mhenton	Board Member	5	05/02/2011	Congo Initiative has been a gift and an opportunity to learn and grow.  Our Congolese sisters and brothers are living examples of what it means to seek to be transformed in order to transform. They are examples of love and commitment: - D. and K. left the safety of Kenya to return to their home country during the height of civil war to serve as salt and light and agents of transformation.- J. survived atrocities of conflict, and now embraces as sisters and brothers, those from the group that had destroyed his village. - A. is studying to be a counselor and work with those who have been traumatized by war and abuse. - D. and A. give their time to run programs for local children (one a soccer program the other an after school Bible program), even though they can barely pay for their own tuition. They give of their time for others before they worry about their own needs.- Many students have left their families, including young children, to study at UCBC. They know the quality of the education and the integrity of the work will develop their skills and cultivate their minds and hearts to be bearers of truth and light and leaders of change.

My son and daughter started learning at AAMAN in 2013.  My son was 5 years-old and  entering Kindergarten. My daughter was entering 3 year-old preschool.  They both knew their alphabet and a few site words. Of course, our son knew more because he was older. But, neither of them were reading above their grade levels when they started at AAMAN. After graduating from the program, they were both reading above their grade levels. My daughter actually skipped 4-year-old preschool and enrolled directly in Kindergarten, primarily because of her advanced reading skills.  Both kids have been strong readers ever since.

It is a tribute to Val and Cecil's passion, kindness, and devotion that program is such a success.  They create an environment of safety and love for everyone at the school while at the same time fostering an incredible learning environment.  I have seen 4 year olds performing at levels I would expect from 7 or 8 year olds!  Not only that, but these kids are excited to come learn and have fun doing so at Clara Fields.

I was able to see what the teachers had to contend with: 16 students in a class, each with varying degrees of reading skills.  These were 5-year olds, some of whom didn't even know "the ABC song!"  When I volunteered at the Clara Fields Literacy Program this past summer, I could see a world of difference.  I helped 3-year olds learn to recognize and write the capital letters, then progress to lower-case letters -- always making sure that they could write those letters.  It is a step-by-step process, but before long those 3 and 4 year old children were able to read words -- and then BOOKS!  What an amazing and dedicated group of people!

Instead, I found inspiration, passion, self-confidence, and a second family.  At WILS, you are not taught "rules on being a good leader".  Instead, you are taught how to use your own personal strengths and weaknesses in order to lead not only peers, but lead your own life.

I am now in my junior year of college pursuing a Biology-biomedical sciences concentration and Spanish double major.  I am currently studying for the MCAT and preparing to apply to medical schools this summer to pursue a career in Obstetrics or Neonatology.  I am certain I wouldn't be where I am now without WILS.

The seminar takes individuals that already exhibit leadership characteristics and exemplifies those traits by surrounding the participants in an environment that encourages individuality and diversity. My perspective of what a leader looks like changed that week, and that shift was definitely for the better! 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282469		/users/profile/372624	Writer	Client Served	5	03/15/2016	I was a WILS attendee in 2013 and I can say it was absolutely the most memorable event of that entire summer. I met wonderful people that welcomed me like family and learned about different leadership skills from many different community members. Thank you so much for putting all this time and effort into making a difference in leaders' lives.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282468		/users/profile/372623	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	WILS honestly changed my life. It was an incredible organization that genuinely wanted to help me become the absolute best person I could be. They instilled a confidence in me that no one else could, and for that I'll always be grateful. It's why I keep coming back - because I think other kids deserve to have that same experience.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282459		/users/profile/372615	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	WILS is the highlight of my life.

Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282412		/users/profile/372570	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	WILS is an organization that has introduced me to inspirational adults as well as students my age that not only teach me about becoming a better leader, but also how to be more myself. I'm forever grateful for the opportunity to be connected with people as amazing as everyone in WILS.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282405		/users/profile/372562	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	WILS is an organization that is constantly changing my life and the way I view it. From meeting amazing adult role models, to peers your age to connect with- it's an amazing organization that brings people together to volunteer, make better leaders, and direct new generations on a path to success. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282402		/users/profile/372559	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	I have been part of WILS since 2008. I currently work at a university in the state of Wisconsin and can honestly say that WILS lead me to where I am today. It showed me what it takes to be a good leader, how to be myself,  the importance and need for volunteering in our community, and allowed me to make numerous friendships. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282399		/users/profile/372555	Cassie12	Board Member	5	03/15/2016	I have volunteered with this organization for over ten years. As an educator, I come across programs for everything under the sun. This organization, WILS, is one of the finer ones. I put my time and energy into WILS because of this. The programming and thoughtfulness of the staff is amazing. Each year, the staff reads and evaluates the student and volunteer feedback. Programming changes are made each year so that the seminar is alway top-notch. The large alumni base and return of volunteers year after year prove how wonderful this organization is. Thank you for continuing to serve our youth and make the world a better place!
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282397		/users/profile/372553	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	I have been apart of WILS for five years now, from being an ambassador, to a junior staff member to now a facilitator. WILS has given me the tools to become a better leader, student and community member. I have made great friendships along the way that are sure to be lifelong. I will always be greatful for the one weekend when I was 16, it changed my life.  
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	282391		/users/profile/372548	Devon6	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	I've been involved with Wisconsin Leadership Seminars for years. I have never met such amazing people! Everyday I am thankful to have the people of WILS in my life.

Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	278738		/users/profile/368724	Michael378	Volunteer	5	02/01/2016	From a parent perspective, there is no other organization that combines the power and energy of youth from across the state into one amazing group of future leaders.  I have been volunteering and contributing for 10 years and each year I leave the summer seminar filled with hope for the future from a great conglomeration of high school sophomores.  Many have gone on to do great things with their careers as I hear stories and meet the alumni each year.  More power to WILS.Mike Skupien, parent of board member and original WILSer in 2005.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	278729		/users/profile/368713	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/01/2016	This organization, honestly, changed my life.  I attended WILS in the summer of 2014.  Going into it, I was quiet shy and did not view myself as a strong leader.  After, I was a new person.  I learned not to be scarred (scurred) by what others think of me and not to limit myself by creating a box to hide inside.  I also learned what type of leader and how to adjust how I work with others to lead a productive group.  I now play a more productive role in groups in school and work, and attribute my confidence to that fun weekend with the greatest people in the world.  Thank you WILS for not only giving me an opportunity to grow as a person and make new connections, but for giving me an outlet to help others do the same.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	278693		/users/profile/368670	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/01/2016	I have been a part of WILS since 2005. I have been a student leader, junior staff and facilitator. I have been a part of a handful of student leadership organizations, but nothing compares to WILS. This seminar is run completely by volunteers and students do not have to pay anything to take part in the event. There is one student chosen from each HS in Wisconsin, so most students don't know anyone when they arrive. This experience is something I look forward to each and every year. I have learned so much about myself, gained so many useful life skills and have made life long friends. If I hadn't attended WILS all those years ago and continued to stay involved I can honestly say that I would not be the person that I am today. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	278677		/users/profile/368651	Star S.	Board Member	5	02/01/2016	I attended WILS as a student leader in 2006. It was absolutely eye opening. From 2007-2010 I returned as a Junior Staff member and since 2011 I have returned as an adult staff member, even joining the Board of Directors in 2014. WILS makes it possible for many students to not only learn more about themselves and what kind of leader they are; they are also exposed to different mindsets and opinions of peers their age from all across the state of Wisconsin- all free of cost! This is truly an outstanding organization. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	271036		/users/profile/359795	Writer	Donor	5	11/03/2015	I've been involved with dozens of high school and college leadership development events and organizations, and there are so many organizations doing great things for emerging leaders.  I have committed a significant amount of TIME and ENERGY and MONEY over the last 15 years to WLS because they are exceptionally well-run, efficiently managed, and have an absolutely outstanding reputation. I have remained connected to HUNDREDS of alumni and they continue to credit WLS with exponentially increasing their leadership capacity.  I no longer live close enough to speak at the annual seminar, but I still have money and love to give to them.  
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	266571	1	/users/profile/355335	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2015	I have been involved with this organization for over 12 years in several different roles from camper, junior staff, facilitator, and speaker/presenter.

Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	266160	1	/users/profile/354928	Murphy D.	Board Member	5	10/21/2015	Wisconsin Leadership Seminars has given me the tools to carve a path much different than I anticipated.  After attending in 2009, I gained the confidence and social support to unleash my leadership potentially.  As I am entering my my seventh year with this organization, I have had the chance to further my own leadership development by taking on roles in the Alumni Association, the Board of Directors, and as seminar staff.  These roles in turn have allowed me to support other Wisconsin high school students as they undergo the seminar experience and really begin to critically think about the issues in our communities and understand that they have the power and voice to make waves. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	265997		/users/profile/354746	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	WILS is truly an outstanding organization that positively impacts of not only the students it serves, but also the volunteers who run the organization.

Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	265917		/users/profile/354665	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	I know it may sound cliche, but WILS has changed my life in countless ways. I attended the 2014 seminar, and I have only grown as a person since. It taught me how to be a leader of my peers, myself, and simply everyone around me. WILS also gave me connections with people that I will have and cherish forever. This is a one of a kind organization that always has ways to say involved and keep in touch. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	265911	1	/users/profile/354659	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	What an outstanding organization that impacts so many students each year. As a student, this organization helped me become the leader I am today. Personally, I would not be the same without the continuous leadership opportunities and the chances to be so many great individuals. WILS is utterly amazing. I am very excited to have been apart of it and continue to grow with this organization.

WILS has been a crucial part of my development as a student, leader and member of society. Every year, I anxiously wait to go back to seminar and meet the new group of WILSers.
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	265872	2	/users/profile/354618	Writer	Client Served	5	10/20/2015	When I was chosen to attend a leadership seminar in 2008, little did I know it would change my life forever. Wisconsin Leadership Seminars, Inc encourages young adults to take ownership of their ideas and opinions while offering them space to be themselves. It is a totally unique experience. I loved my seminar experience so much that I have come back every year as a volunteer to give high school sophomores the same experiences I had. I have made life-long friends and found a cause that I am passionate about to give my time and talents too! I'm so grateful to everyone in Wisconsin Leadership Seminars who set the path before me and to everyone who will come after. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	265737	1	/users/profile/354481	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	WILS is the highlight of my year. This program is dedicated to shaping the leaders of tomorrow. The environment created at WILS gives students the ability to deepen their skills and understanding in diversity, leadership, community service, and open-mindedness. 
Wisconsin Leadership Seminars Inc	246986	4	/users/profile/334452	angsmith	Client Served	5	07/01/2015	WILS is an all-volunteer, state-wide organization dedicated to providing leadership opportunities to high school sophomores and beyond.  Through the annual seminar and follow-on alumni activities, it provides on-going leadership skill-building and support.  Students that attend the program often return to their communities and run for school offices, organize volunteer events, and spearhead local initiatives.  Having attended WILS in the 1990's, the highest endorsement I can provide is that I hope my pre-teen daughter will be lucky enough to attend the program in a few years. It will change her life, as WILS does for all others who have participated.  Please consider donating to this worthy cause and helping high school students reach their full leadership potential.  - Angela Wellsmith

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199831	2	/users/profile/260869	Jennifer325	Volunteer	5	05/07/2014	There is something special about an organization that, when you try to bless them, you leave feeling more like they did YOU a favor. I am so impressed with the way they run their work with heart, creativity, humility, and excellence. You won't find a more wholistic--or effective--program addressing homelessness out there. I'm proud that it calls Green Bay home. I only wish it were larger, so it could impact more families, since too many have to go on the waiting list. Maybe this is your invitation to join the effort.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199618	1	/users/profile/260588	brovoldjess	Donor	5	05/04/2014	The Freedom House is a wonderful opportunity to help families get back on their feet again, assisting their families with opportunities for educational advancement, along with providing the necessities (clothing, food, and household items) to get their lives back on-track.  The love and support of those volunteers at the Freedom House, along with the numerous donors makes this all possible.

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199425	1	/users/profile/238881	tina.dix1	Volunteer	5	05/01/2014	I have been volunterring at Freedom House Ministries since 2010.

Every event and opportunity is life changing.  I love to serve and to talk to the residents and hear their stories.  I walk away feeling extermely blessed and grateful for all i have and don't have. It has taught me alot. 
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	182118	1	/users/profile/238881	tina.dix1	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I was meeting a friend for coffee one evening and she told me that she received an email from Robyn Davis (a friend of hers) that very day. The email was asking for help in locating a Humana employee that would be a charity sponsor for Freedom House.  I told my friend that I would think about it.  As we drank our coffee and continued our time of fellowship, something inside of me was very excited about this opportunity and I knew this was an excellent opportunity for me.  I contacted Robyn Davis at Freedom House the next day and told her I was interested and she asked me to come in to meet with her and tour the facility. As I toured Freedom House, Robyn gave me some background information about the organization; I saw the need and knew that I could help out.  As I went into work the next day at Humana I decided to become a Corporate Charity Sponsor for the Freedom House. So I connected with HumanaShares and signed up. In this role I plan, organize, and have several successful fundraising events throughout the year for Freedom House.  I am also very happy to help volunteer or find volunteers anytime during the year for Freedom House.    Celebration of Hope for 2013 was outstanding! I also volunteer a couple times during the year in meal preparation and serving through my church Destiny Church. It is so great to serve and fellowship with the families at Freedom House.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199417	1	/users/profile/260351	wisquist	Volunteer	5	05/01/2014	My kids and I have been volunteering for 3 years to help provide child care.  We get the joy of playing with the children who live at the Freedom House while their parents get to take classes.  Like they say, the families are getting a hand UP not a hand OUT.  The programs at the Freedom House go beyond the basics of food and shelter.  They teach the life skills families need in order to NOT return to homelessness.  One the most incredible things that the families are taught is to pay their blessings forward.  How incredible is that!

Through the years my support has been in various forms (encouraging staff people, praying, making financial contributions and some material gifts); to me, the Outstanding Hallmark of Freedom House Ministries has always been AND CONTINUES TO BE the Excellent Way in which this ministry lives out the Truth of the Bible in the lives of everyone who comes to them seeking help!!! I feel as though our LORD gives me the privilege of being involved in this crucial ministry, and I recommend Freedom House Ministries to any and all people who truly care about the well-being of people in need, as they offer a most excellent opportunity for people to live their Christian Faith (beyond just speaking about it)!!!!!!!

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199200		/users/profile/260099	Kristen2014	Volunteer	5	04/29/2014	The Freedom House is a nonprofit organization that is second to none. Over the years my family has contributed many goods to the Freedom House, knowing that they are being put to good use by other families in need. We do not live close to the Freedom House, but it's so rewarding to drive the distance to help out others who are getting back on their feet.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199199		/users/profile/260097	MaxMunbo	Donor	5	04/29/2014	I go back to the days when Freedom House came to their current location and facility.  Gary LaFave was the president.  I was invited for a tour and was blown away by what I heard and saw, not only from the staff but from people who were staying there.  God has chosen Freedom House for His glory, and has blessed everyone who has been touched by it.  Forget all the self-help ways people try in this world, only God can create a NEW person from the inside out.  And that is what Freedom House strives to do - create an environment where families can find shelter from the storms of life, to heal, and to be restored to all God would have them to be.  Freedom House brings more people into relationship with God than ANY church.  I am sure when I stroll over heaven that I will meet hundreds of people who are there because of Freedom House.  EVERY Christian in this community should be supporting Freedom House.  God bless Robyn Davis and staff!

The commitment of the staff and volunteers to assist in turning the lives around of families that find themselves in an unfortunate situation is incredible! I tell all that will listen to what Freedom House does for our community and encourage them to donate (time, materials or money). In all the years I've worked with Freedom House, I've never had anyone come back and tell me of a bad experience!

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	199150		/users/profile/100007	Barth Wolf	Board Member	5	04/28/2014	I am a board member and volunteer at Freedom House.  I love the mission of the organization and the staff's focus on attaining the mission.  The focus is not just on giving a homeless family a place to stay, but also to help them with life skills and spiritual guidance to help them be successful when they leave the program.  There is a sense of positiveness that pervades the staff that gives dignity to the residents and a sense of hope.  It is a great place to volunteer at as you feel you are making a difference for the residents.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	181005		/users/profile/100007	Barth Wolf	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	I recently went on the board of Freedom House. Before agreeing to do so I wanted to check out what this ministry was about. I went and had a tour from an amazing staff member who was a former resident. The love and concern she and all the other staff I met expressed for the residents was amazing. They provide more than just a place to stay, but programming to help the families succeed, and most importantly love from the staff and volunteers  to let them know they are important.  
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	198856		/users/profile/259667	Kati5	Board Member	5	04/24/2014	Wow, what can I say about Freedom House Ministries that will even begin to touch on the lives they change? The staff and volunteers at Freedom House Ministries are so dedicated to the mission they serve, and they are really making a difference. By giving residents the tools they need to break the cycle of homelessness, they are changing the Greater Green Bay area one family at a time. I truly believe that Freedom House Ministries will help eradicate homelessness in our area by continuing their mission. Thank you staff and volunteers for creating a positive change!

During that time I have witnessed a committed staff minister to families in need with kindness and compassion.  The programming that Freedom House provides is truly transformational and is the main factor in the overall success of the ministry.  More than "just a shelter", Freedom House prepares families for a bountiful life after homelessness by focusing on the whole person.  This is a wonderful ministry doing wonderful work.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	182957		/users/profile/239848	katidonaho	Board Member	5	10/28/2013	The Green Bay community is so lucky to have an organization like Freedom House. This amazing non-profit is giving their residents a hand up - not a hand out. Their goal is to break the cycle of homelessness and give the residents the resources needed to better their lives. Between the mandatory financial and parenting classes, chores and family time- they are showing these families a new way to live their lives. Thank you to the staff of Freedom House for the great work you are doing! 
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	182553		/users/profile/239380	Janis2	Board Member	5	10/25/2013	back in the 1990s my husband, daughter & i were weekend house supervisors for 3 years 1 weekend a month.  It was very rewarding helping the families get their lives back together.  It also was a real reality check that depending on any one circumstance, our family could be that family.  Then about 6 years ago my employer asked if i would be willing to help with the bookkeeping which i gladly agreed to.  I then became a board member.  I am not the bookkeeper anymore but still remain on the board and a supporter.  This organization is well worth any and all donations.

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	181654		/users/profile/238380	bryantrenn	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	Wow, this organization is amazing! With over 200 homeless families in Green Bay they are constantly helping families get back on their feet. They focus on not just providing food and shelter, but also classes, day care, job placement, and training. This approach takes many single and repeat homeless families and ensures it will not become a recurrence. Please continue the great work.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	180709		/users/profile/237399	Becky53	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	Freedom House is such an amazing place! The first time I volunteered there was for a community service day through my church. Since then I have gone back to volunteer with my bible study group. The staff at Freedom House are so wonderful and dedicated to making it a great place for families to be for extra support as they transition. Both times I've volunteered I have prepared and served lunch. We were able to eat with the residents and take time to chat with them. We felt very welcome! The little boy smiling and yelling goodbye to us out the window melted our hearts and will definitely bring us back to Freedom House in the future!

Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	180208		/users/profile/236869	Dmccole	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	I started volunteering at Freedom House this past summer where I helped out in childcare while the children's parents were in a financial planning class. It was always bittersweet seeing the kids go because over the weeks you would build relationships and look forward to seeing them, but ultimately you are always happy to see them go because you know that they are moving on to better things. Everyone there is completely committed to helping these families as they come through, and it's very rewarding to be a part of that environment. I plan on returning to help out again over my next winter break.
Freedom House Ministries, Inc.	179722		/users/profile/236362	lw915	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I have been privileged to teach the Financial Planning course to the residence of Freedom House for 3.5 yrs.  It is a course that all residences benefit from, learning to write a resume, to updating an existing resume, and financial  budgeting.  It is so heart-warming and thrilling to see the smile on their faces when they graduate and hold their certificate.  It is pure joy to know at Freedom House we are all working together to bring everyone no matter what their circumstances from the basement to the roof-top.  The staff are truly angels here on earth doing Christ's work helping others to have a better life.

Sharing time with the families can be so rewarding for the volunteer more so than the residents. Recently I have been in the child care program with the children from ages of  few weeks to 12 years of age. One can so be touched there, when, you have the time to play or TALK one on one with the children. I have seen siblings so love one another and protect each other. Have also seen the opposite.When I was there last week, one of the children asked "are you going to come every Tuesday & Thursday"that particular week I was there both days because of the shortage of volunteers. The look in their eyes searching for some constant in their lives pulls at ones heart. So if you do have an extra hour or two,  I strongly suggest coming to Freedom House and feel the warmth of these families. Doesn't happen overnight but it will come, I promise.

This organization is truly dedicated to giving families a temporary home that provides education and assistance to those in need.  The thing I like most about Freedom House is that as much as they want you there, they do what they can to help you leave because having a family leave Freedom House means the family is stable and ready to start living life again on their own.  As a volunteer, as much as I missed those families that left the home while I was there, I was happier to see they have met their goals and are finally starting a life on their own.

To that goal the Sailing Center provides  affordable lessons  and scholarships for children  and teens,  as well as a  complete range of  on-the-water and classroom learning experiences for adults.  With the insistence on safety first, MCSC provides the boats, the docks,  the staff and the programs to help  ANYONE learn how to sail competently. All one needs is a willingness to learn and an aptitude to have a good time.  The emphasis on Community means no one who wants to sail  is left at the dock.  Friendships abound.  MCSC  provides volunteer opportunities to share sailing with children and adults  with disabilities and other challenges. A full schedule of classes, events, social gatherings and volunteer options is available all year round. One can learn about the history of  sailing for exploration, commerce, military use, for travel and sport;  one can learn about  ghosts, legends and ship wrecks,  about environmental and conservation concerns and much more. I knew nothing about sailing when I took my first class several years ago.  Now I have a passion not only for sailing itself but  for helping achieve the mission of the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center--to share the joy of Lake Michigan.

They also make Lake Michigan accesable to people that might not otherwise be able to get out on the water.  Things like the kids program, and the help I have seen given to people with disabilities. There is both a paid staff and a large group of volunteers that keep the many programs running.

There are so many opportunities for people in surrounding communities to go beyond learning basic sailing skills - ranging from advanced sail handling, racing, maintenance, coaching, outreach programs and more.  As for myself, I was introduced to my first sailboat experience close to 20 years ago during a open house event- I was hooked!  Shortly after I took my first basic sailing lessons where I was out on the water within the first two days.

After graduation, a sailor may continue to develope skill sailing and learning as a graduate of the MCSC's U.S.Sail Certified Sailing School in the MCSC's Open Sailing Program. All of the above advantages are made possible due to the MCSC's status as a well run and well organized Milwaukee community supported nonprofit.  Due to the well deserved credibility the MCSC has garnered over decades of community nonprofit service, the center has been placed on the most picturesque lakefront sailing venue in Milwaukee. Come and enjoy a true gem in the world of sailing.

It lives up to the title of "community" through outreach to the entire Milwaukee area from from providing sailing opportunities for those with disabilities, for children from the central city, and others as well as excellent sailing instruction at all levels for members on and off the water.  MCSC has a large fleet of sailboats including Pearson Ensigns, J24s, Solings, and various dinghies available at no cost for members with appropriate sailing ratings.  If you are a member, there is no reason to own your own sailboat.  MCSC is a  crown jewel of Milwaukee.

Many courses available throughout the season to teach you how to sail safely at increasing levels of competence.  The instructors are AWESOME!  After you qualify to sail, use of the MCSC boats is open at no charge as part of the membership.  Look online to see what commercial outfits charge to rent an Ensign for a half day - $250+?

Milwaukee Community Sailing Center Inc	214862		/users/profile/278175	Jacqueline22	Volunteer	5	09/12/2014	A friend asked me to assist him in updating his resume back in 1991. At the very bottom of his page, under volunteer activities, he had written: Volunteer Board Member for the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center. When next I spoke with him, I asked him about that group. He told me about his work with the group. A non-profit community sailing center open to all adults and youth. People pay a low-cost annual membership fee, which gives them free access to a variety of boats for two hours at a time seven days a week, without needing to own their own boat. People can sail with others as crew, or pass sailing tests which allows them to be rated as a light, medium, or heavy wind skipper. Classes are held year-round, both on water and on land. Classes are offered for all age groups, grade school through adults. Special classes and programs are held for people with disabilities, also. All of this information prompted me to contact staff at the Milwaukee Community Center in May 1991, and after a brief conversation, I signed up for the next available beginners class. I was hooked. Our class that year was known as the class that lucked out -- many classes on the water were cancelled due to stormy weather. Or no wind! Both banes of sailors. Gratefully, our instructors offered make-up classes and make-up on water practices, and we all completed the classes satisfactorily and received our ranking as light sailors.  That summer of 1991 I was free enough to go sailing for the two allotted hours almost every single day. I spent three weeks as part of my doctoral studies in Seattle, Washington, and spent several of those days with friends who live in Seattle and own a sailboat. They invited me to sail with them several times, and offered me the privilege of skippering the boat on Puget Sound, on a gloriously sunny day in August of 1991. Over the past 23 years, I advanced to medium rating, and have taken classes for heavy rating. Unfortunately, testing dates, weather, and my own schedule have not coincided for me to take that test. In the meantime, I have skippered boats with crew made up of family, of friends, of co-workers, and occasionally even of strangers, as part of the Spinniker Club.  My husband and I enjoy sailing together on lazy summer afternoons. We have enjoyed the Full Moon and Blue Moon cruises with other sailing center folks, those who own large sail boats and willingly donate the use of these boats to the Sailing Center for these special events. Our family has enjoyed participating in Sailing Center activities, too. One of our sons took part in the youth sailing classes when he was in high school and enjoyed it very much. One year, my mother and daughter and I spent a Fourth of July at a picnic sponsored by the Sailing Center, and then enjoyed an evening of fireworks while seated in a sailboat anchored in the harbor watching this spectacle over Lake Michigan, a very special time for all of us. Our extended family has gathered on the sailing center grounds on other Fourth of July occasions for picnics and fireworks.  Members of our family also volunteer at many of the events held at and/or by the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center, including some open houses, other special events, and for a number of years, at the Annual Lobster Boil. All of these activities help invigorate current members, introduce new folks to the highlights of the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center, and most importantly of all, raises funds for important Sailing Center programs. Two of the very best of these programs include those programs that focus on youth, offering classes and sailing opportunities for children who come from poor and disadvantaged families, often through neighborhood community groups, and those programs that provide a sailing experience for children and adults with significant disabilities of all sorts: cognitive, emotional, medical, and physical. Sailing soothes our souls, provides a time for family enrichment, a time for sharing with long time friends, and an opportunity to meet new friends. Sailing offers a way, too, to connect with our environment is a manner that leaves a very small footprint on our ecosystem.  All this, because I asked what someone meant by his reference to his work as a Board Member almost 25 years ago. I highly recommend the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center for this award. Respectfully, Jacqueline HaesslyMember of and volunteer at the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center since 1991

Their Around the Dinner Table forum provides a moderated venue to get support and advice from other parents and caregivers 24/7.  As research changes our general knowledge about eating disorders, FEAST has partnered with a top-notch advisory team to create pamphlets that explain the neurobiology of eating disorders, how to choose treatment providers, and how families can come to terms to help their child.  FEAST believes parents are a key component of the treatment team and provides resources to make us more effective team members.
Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment of Eating Disorders	220710	2	/users/profile/284386	BJMDF	Client Served	5	10/07/2014	In my humble opinion, FEAST hosts the single best website for obtaining the most accurate and up-to-date information on eating disorder research, education and treatment.  FEAST has helped educate thousands of care providers, sufferers, practitioners regarding eating disorders.  There is so much misinformation out there and it is very refreshing to finally have a place where you can get accurate information, which has saved countless lives.  Also, being put in touch with other families and caregivers going through what you are going through is a huge lifesaver and makes you feel not so alone in what is usually a very isolating disease.  FEAST empowers families and caregivers to speak up on their loved ones' behalf and ensure they are getting the most-up-to-date treatment rather than relying on old outdated and antiquated treatment.  FEAST provides so many services that it is difficult to name them all here, but it is an invaluable resource and I am grateful every day that it exists.

People had links to resources, they had explanations that made sense of what we were going through. Most of all, they had been there themselves. There is nothing like the peer support provided by FEAST, anywhere else that I know of.

A 9 year old girl and her brother were on the verge of being placed into care, separated from dedicated, exemplary parents. Psychiatrists, paediatricians, psychologists and Social Services could not recognise that the starving child had an eating disorder and the mother was under extreme suspicion.  The mother, who thanks to FEAST was better informed than any of the officials, was losing a 2-year battle to be believed. Meanwhile, the little girl was so weak she had to be carried when the family was out and about, and she suffered horrific nightmares.  FEAST parents had no trouble recognising the signs of an eating disorder in a young child. They gave the parents information and support, and finally the mother was believed, the Social Services case dismissed, and the little girl got treatment. As a mum who wishes she had found FEAST much earlier, I have referred parents, clinicians and teachers to FEAST and to its ever-so-supportive forum Around The Dinner Table. I have benefited from so much wisdom and experience from other parents there. It is a blessing that wherever you are in the world, people have access to this treasure trove.

Thanks to the advice and support I received on the FEAST site, I learned to navigate the Anorexia treatment world.

I learned from other parents' experience and from the excellent articles and books that were recommended. I am extremely grateful. FEAST is a top-notch nonprofit and I cannot praise them enough.
Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment of Eating Disorders	214690	1	/users/profile/277977	AnnieK	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2014	The support and evidence-based information that I received (for free) from http://feast-ed.org has been by far the most helpful, profound and life-changing that I have ever experienced from any organization. My daughter had been ill with various eating disorders since age 11 when I discovered F.E.A.S.T. when she was 21. I had almost given up hope when an internet search for a forum for parents of those with EDs turned up the Around the Dinner Table forum and the F.E.A.S.T. website. From that very day I was able to read about the most up-to-date studies and correct info about EDs, and I started tapping the vast experience of the dedicated parents who frequented the forum. A person with an ED suffers every minute of every day, and often even the most knowledgeable professionals aren't able to help parents with the enormous difficulties of caring for their child with an ED. But the parents on the forum knew, and the example of those who had found effective treatment and were helping to bring their children to health were an inspiration to me. Even though my daughter lives out of our home, I was able to find ways to get her into good treatment, and I am happy to say that, 6 years later, she is living a much healthier and happier life, dealing well with her EDs and her several serious comorbid psychological disorders. I served as a volunteer forum moderator and attended two of the F.E.A.S.T. international conferences and have been enriched in so many ways because of this organization.  Thanks F.E.A.S.T. for giving me the tools that I needed to be able to find proper help for my long-suffering daughter! I shudder to think where our family would be without you. I give F.E.A.S.T. the highest recommendation possible and then some, because they help not only to save lives, but they help bring previously very sick people to very high quality of life.

Whether posting on specific issues or challenges or just reading others stories has inspired me to keep going when circumstances have been bleak.  ED is such a heartbreaking illness in so many ways and cuts such a broad path of destruction across families - it is made more difficult by the lack of understanding in our medical community and community at large.  Often, caregivers are left to their own devices to sort through ED issues, manage the caregiving, other siblings, medical staff, insurance and so on.  ATDT has been the best forum I have found to get real feedback from those who have been through what I am going through - that is invaluable. Dad of Daughter with Anorexia

I  fought with my son's pediatrician to make him "understand" that my son's ED was not a phase, and that he could not "just" decide or choose to get over it.. could NOT just go home and EAT MORE... I fought for us to have the Maudsley and FBT.. The pediatrician finally handed my son's file ( 3 months after his hospitalization) to an other doc.. a psychiatrist, much younger and aware of FBT and MAudsley, and only then did my son start to do better and slowly gain some weight.. my son was discharged in October, almost 10 months in the hospital.. I taught he would never come back home.

Far too many clinicians in the eating disorder world follow treatment protocols that are outdated, ineffective and without regard for what cutting edge research has taught us about eating disorders. Thanks to the fantastic people at FEAST, parents are empowered to become the driving force in saving their child's life. Time and again, I have seen parents realize that when clinicians tell them their child has to want to be helped before treatment can work they are wrong; those who turn to the internet in the search for answers and find FEAST understand this is not true and there is tremendous support and guidance available to help their loved one recover.

He spent 9'years in the Marines and 2 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.Being There Reaching Out has become like a family to me.This is a group no one wants to share Grief with, but is glad they are there for families like mine and others to share our personal grief with for lost of loved ones from the war.I come from a mixed family of my brother being in the Navy, my uncle in the Army, and my husband, B-I-L, and my son and nephew being in the Marines.So, no matter what branch of service you are from, this group is there to offer support in whatever way we can.
Being There Reaching Out Inc	194746	2	/users/profile/254507	candle	Board Member	5	02/23/2014	Hello.  I've been SO BLESSED to be a part of this Mission of Love!!  I've lost troops in the US (CONUS - Ft Hood and to suicide) and Overseas (OCONUS).  They remain in my heart and prayers as do ALL the Families of the Fallen.   Please know that the troops who have served with your loved one, grieve too.  Our Fallen are our Brothers and Sisters in Arms.  We loved them and we mourn with you. Please also know, we Serve because we really, really want to!  I've been blessed to have served in 3 theatres of war.  I may have been scared sometimes but I was never prouder than to serve for Our Country.   That is why I'm Still in after 28.5 yrs.   But, I'm still not the oldest in my Unit (smile!). May God bless you all.  Thank you for your sacrifice.  Freedom is not free. With love, LTC "Marge"

I have met the most incredible families who like their loved ones are my heros.  They are just like all of us but with one thing in common.  They have lost a large chunk of their hearts.  I only hope I have been able to give them the opportunity to know that their loved one will never be fogotten and I will do everything I can to make sure there is someone to listen to and be there for them when they least expect it.  I love these families as my own with all my heart.  God Bless them all.   Dorothy

This group,based in Wisconsin, through opportunities and activities/meetings they provide, help us to heal the aching, gaping hole in our hearts from the losses of our loved ones.  They don't push an agenda or ask for membership dues; they let you know you can share, laugh, grieve, or obtain help at one's own rhythm. They care; we care. They/we all have a special connection, a bond of a loss of a fallen family member; there is unconditional love, compassion, care, and support to entire extended family members. Through this group and all the activities they provide, friendships evolve. We have opportunities to reconnect, to decompress, to share, to laugh.We can't always be at every event, but our entire family wouldn't want to miss our annual Families of the Fallen/ Being There-Reaching Out gatherings. We've had excellent speakers, great locations geared for families, activities (baseball, golf,making hats, bracelets, tours of Lambeau, camp outings,grief sessions, etc.), meals, raffle items. We have a network of support groups, people who care, such as The Safe House in downtown Milwaukee, Kapco of Grafton, Wi; Dry Hootch in Milwaukee, WI that assists our veterans, the Patriot Riders and many more. We look forward to a Fisher House of WI being built at Clement Zablocki VA Center; the same VA center where we have our annual "Walk for the Fallen" in August.We are so fortunate to have this group touch our lives. Our veterans of past conflicts, especially the Vietnam War, did not have the opportunities we have with Being There-Reaching Out. Like our sons, daughters, husbands,wives, brother, sister, grandchild, aunt, or uncle who "gave their all", who have made a difference in the lives and places of the less fortunate, Being There-Reaching Out also makes a difference to each and every one of us. We thank them.

Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	This organization provides a loving safe place that helps the families of the fallen on many levels.The lifestyles and freedom we enjoy come at a heavy price. The children, wives, parents and families of the soldiers who fell here and abroad have a group and a place where they can be with others who share similar loss. We can't bring back the fallen, but we can try to help the families heal and cope. There is much love and appreciation for the families and the founder of this organization.
Being There Reaching Out Inc	179819	1	/users/profile/236462	Emilie B.	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	It seems unbelievable that our son, Samuel,  left for recruit training 11 years ago! Tragically, he died there at MCRD in San Diego, CA only 39 days later.   Our oldest son, Steven was already serving active duty in the Marines.  He was preparing for deployment.  Sam's sudden death was an icy and shocking wake up call to the realities of "the ultimate sacrifice".   We were terrified of losing both of our sons. Thankfully, Steve was relocated to a base in the States, fulfilled his commitment and returned home.......Five years after Sam's death I learned about BT RO from another Gold Star mom from Kenosha.  She got me in touch with Judith.  A week or so later my husband and I were attending our first BT RO gathering in Appleton, WI.  I remember seeing the Patriot Guard Riders on the sidewalk holding American flags as the families entered.  I cannot put into words how solemn, respectful, meaningful, inspiring, touching and thoughtful every aspect of that weekend was.  The hugs were as plentiful as my tears!  We met other families grieving their loved ones and instantly felt a bond...   Judith, Joe and the Board Members and volunteers give so much time, energy and compassion to this organization!  Not to mention the donors and behind the scenes people all giving for a worthy endeavor.    Thank you for the years of love and caring!
Being There Reaching Out Inc	179656	1	/users/profile/236303	Amy_120	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	Being There Reaching Out (BT-RO) is an exceptional organization that supports the WI families of our Fallen Military Heroes.  No one wants to be a part of the group, but once your loved one has made the ultimate sacrifice, you are so glad Being There Reaching Out is there to support you.  I became involved after my brother, SSG Andrew Bossert was killed in Ramadi, Iraq on March 7, 2005.  I was able to meet other people who could understand what I was going through and feeling.  BT-RO organizes events throughout the year to gather the families together to allow them to mourn their loved one, cry, laugh or whatever  the person needs.  Parents, spouses, children, siblings, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles and beyond are supported in their grief through Being There Reaching Out.  It is such a special place for the families to be to feel safe and to feel understood and be able to mourn openly and everyone is there to support.  Unfortunately the group has grown due to the increasing deaths from the war or due to the war.  We all share a very special bond that connects us and Being There Reaching Out has allowed that.
Being There Reaching Out Inc	179585	1	/users/profile/236229	Peggy32	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	Well 1st let me say, this is no ordinary non profit group. This group was created for all the reasons you don't want to be part of any group whatever, and it is certainly not a group that I thought I would ever be part.  This group offers more than support to families that have lost loved ones due to the conflict of War. This group does not only offer support but it offers the one thing that is free, LOVE and Compassion and we are all for the same reason. We all lost someone due to this conflict of War. War that has been around for many many years. I love when we can all get together and bond as a family, a much bigger family than you could ever imagine. We all come from different walks of life and different areas in Wisconsin. When we are together you can not only see the love but you feel it. Every time my boys and I leave an event we talk about the people we have met the stories we have shared with each other and we go home stronger. The board members are beautiful people inside and out. The compassion they show the love the give is like no other you will receive anywhere else. I wish that I was not a member for the reasons I am, but I am proud to have met such wonderful people that I will know the rest of my life. ~ Peggy Naseman
Being There Reaching Out Inc	179436	1	/users/profile/236082	vwichlacz	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	I am a volunteer board member of Being There Reaching Out. I came to this group through losing my son LCPL Travis Wichlacz in Iraq in 2005. I have watched this group grow from a fledgling group of a few families that had lost a loved one to war to a much larger group with a larger purpose. This group brings together the families of the fallen. Whether it be a death in theater or at home through accidents and even suicide. Families can find comfort and healing. The group reaches out to spouses, parents, grand parents and healing events accommodate children, grand children, nephews, nieces. All those touched by the loss are invited. Through the comfort and healing, families have gone on to do great things for others in the fallen ones name. The networking has been phenomenal for spurring ideas of scholarships, golf outings, walks and other functions raising money to benefit others in our community and state.

It brings together families that share the terrible experince of loosing a loved one in the service of our country. I lost a son who was killed in action in Afgahnistan in 2011 and had deep feelings of guilt and depression, but with the contacts I made through this caring organization I was no longer alone and could share my feelings with other parents of lost children. Judith, who is the head of this organization pours out her soul to all of us in her effort to bring healing to us as if we were part of her family. I have formed many lasting relations not only with other family members who have lost loved one, but I am able to reach out to so many Vets and active military because of what I have learned about living with the loss of a loved one. It is all because of this organization I have the strength to reach out to others.                    Richard R

Our family was devistated, Ryan who had just been home two months earlier and was two weeks from returning home left a unfillable hole in the hearts of his family.  Being There Reaching Out offered me a place that I didn't have to explaine how I felt and gave me hugs and love that was second to none.  I have developed great friendships in this group that no one ever wanted to join but now that we are a part of it .......would never want to be apart from the wonderful people and honor that this orginization brings to our families.   After 7 years I consider these families part of my own family.  Judith Singer and her board of directors put their hearts and souls into everything they plan for us.  I know that with the right funding and help from others that care about our families this orginization is on its way to being the best families of the fallen orginizaiton in any state.  I wish that every state had a BTRO that they could be a part of.   A truely special orginizaiton with people that care about us and love us right where we are.....and sometimes that is not a very happy place to be.   I would urge any family member that has lost someone that served in the Military either KIA - DIS - or because of the open wounds from WAR - to join us in this orginizaiton to be lifted from the pit of hell with loving and caring arms of people who know what it feels like to SACRIFICE!

This is an amazing group that no one wants to be part of. As a group we share our loss of our heroes together and no one judges us. We are all in the same boat.  Its a group I am so glad I found and so glad to be a part of. I am so thankful for all of them to help us on the journey of love and loss.
Being There Reaching Out Inc	32852	4	/users/profile/33680	goldstarmom	Board Member	5	03/10/2010	I am a member of Being There Reaching Out and it is the most wonderful organization.  I lost my son to the war in Iraq and they have helped with the pain of losing a child.  We gather to share our pain, memories, and most of all being there for each other.  This is a group no one wants to be a part of but once you are they are family.  The group helps everyone deal with the pain of losing a loved one to war.  We are all at different stages of our grief but somehow never having met each other prior to this we have become friends. Our goal is to have our loss never be forgotten, because having paid the ultimate sacrifice is something we live with each and everyday and this organization is there for us.

We are part of the organization which you don't want to be member as a Gold Star parent.  We lost our Son in Iraq in 2005.  The loss has been a big hole in our lives.  BT-RO has given us hope thru supporting all the Gold Star families, weather you are a parent, spouse, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, grandparent.  BT-RO gives us the support and helps open up to share our issues and grief.  All the members embrace our ups and downs and can relate to our issues.  We can lift each other up at times.      The leadership is excellent and treat all the membership with the upmost respect. Don and Kate Jansky
Being There Reaching Out Inc	179045		/users/profile/235676	LittleYadda	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Having an organization that schedules events for those of us who have lost military family members is so much more important than I can even put into words. Having others around you who truly understand your feelings and can help you deal with them has been the most amazing gift. After the loss of my brother, my mom joined BT/RO. I never thought it would be something I was interested in, but I have found it to be the most amazing group of people I have ever met. Having group activities for the Gold Star families helps us in so many ways, and we are all able to talk about our loved ones in a way we can't always do on a regular basis. It's a sad way for such a wonderful group of people to come together, but I feel so fortunate to be a part of it.

Even though our son was killed on leave in a car accident here at home, this group has helped us deal with the loss of our son and also connected us with others going through the same pain. I thank this group a million times over for all the help they have given us. My husband who has a hard time talking to others has done a great job with this group, it has helped him very much. I could go on forever on what this group means to us, just want them to know they are our back bone.. Love to all if them and they really dont get enough credit for what they do...

Castner, was killed in Iraq in July of 2006, we were invited to join BT-RO. I cannot put into words what the various associations with others who have lost their sons and daughters has meant to us. When I meet them, I know that they know exactly what I an feeling. I don't have to explain anything to them. They know. I cannot overlook the tremendous effort that Judith Singer has put into this organization. She started it, and she is the motivating force behind the activities. We all owe Judith more than a huge thank you. I am honored to count her as a true friend as a direct result of my association with this organization. This organization is unique. It has helped me move a few steps closer to accepting my son's death. 
Being There Reaching Out Inc	173277		/users/profile/229395	Christine90	Client Served	5	10/04/2013	I have been a member of Being There Reaching Out for ten years now, since my step-son was killed in Iraq.  Since he was only the fourth Wisconsin soldier killed in Iraq, BTRO has been a big part of our healing for ten years.  Every year Judith Singer, one of the original founders, flawlessly, and seemingly effortlessly, organizes the most thoughtful and meaningful events for the Families of the Fallen.   Judith has quietly amassed an army of volunteers and people who show up at our events to support us and help us in any way they can.  It has been wonderful to see how people with ties to the military help each other.  And we help others, as evidenced by the fledgling Fischer House, which is being built on the Milwaukee VA grounds, as well as Dry Hootch coffee shops which service Veterans with PTSD. There are just so many wonderful people who have touched our lives because of BTRO, including Joe Campbell, one of the founding members, and Dorothy Moore, our President.  Joe knows many Vietnam era Veterans, and Dorothy knows many in state and local government, and the support for the families who have experienced terrible tragedies really helps to heal us.   BTRO makes a difference every single day.

They coordinators lovingly pursued me and my son and welcomed us into the group with loving arms. We have been attending gatherings regularly in the past year and are incredibly grateful for their ability to meet us where we are.

For the 1st year after his death we tried to get through the darkest hours of our lives and we were not successful.  We did hear about Being There Reaching Out but declined to attend the 1st year and then we realized that we had to find a way to deal with this tragedy.  We decided to attend our 1st Being There Reaching Out in the spring of 2012.  The moment we arrived we knew this was the place for us.  Everyone was just like us trying to find some comfort and a way to continue on.  We most certainly found it there.  The people who run B.T.R.O. are the greatest, always comforting, offering advise and ways to cope and the families who attend are more than willing to help you through the dark hours.  All events are so well planned, including special things for the little ones, different activities that appeal to everyone and best of all people willing to listen to your story.  Every fallen soldier is honored in so many ways and every story is unique.  This has been our lifeline and we wouldn't trade our experiences for the world.  We will always attend  their events because it brings us peace, comfort and the will to go on.  Hats off to the men and women from B.T.R.O. & thanks for all you do..Dale & Mary Coleman

To see the help and support they give to the families through a variety of means makes us want to be able to do even more.  Bringing the Gold Star families together helps them work through their loss and gets them in touch with others who have experienced the same loss.  I wish there had been a similar organization in the 1960's and 1970's to help the families of some friends I lost so they would not have felt so alone.

I was immediately deeply touched by the caring, loving, supportive atmosphere.  It was palpable as I entered the room.  I knew right away that this is a vitally important organization, one that provides a safe, caring, understanding haven for families and friends of fallen loved ones. A place where they can be with other people who know the inexplicable, never-ending, horrific pain of this kind of loss. I can't imagine.  I think about how hard every day must be and how it goes on and on.  Loss is a profound experience, one that I believe we need to share with those who personally understand the particular kind of loss we are living.  And when it comes from war, and a war one may not believe in, wow!!  Being There Reaching Out is the place families and friends can find that kind of understanding, that kind of special love, that makes a huge difference in their struggle to heal!!

Never once did BTRO differentiate between our loss and that of a family who lost a loved one in combat.  It has been almost 16 months and we struggle daily with our loss.  We can not begin to describe the support and love that is shared by everyone.  The BTRO organization, while small in numbers, does the work of many.  We are hopeful that one day we will be able to pay forward the support that we've received and can only hope this organization is still going strong.

Being There Reaching Out Inc	32811	4	/users/profile/33644	andjustmiskye	Board Member	5	03/09/2010	Loosing a child is undefinitive. Loosing a loved one while they are in the military and serving or have served is in another category. When words cannot help, being with someone who "knows" the depths of emotions is like circling the wagons. 2004 we lost our Marine hero PFC Andrew J McFall Halverson and 6 months later accidently walked into a BTRO gathering, and have been involved ever since. Through BTRO and the heartfelt effort of their founders; Our heros are honored and remembered. which is one of my concerns...I will never forget Andrew's sacrifice..but what about our Country and those he went to defend. The families are given opportunities to share the story of our hero and have someone to listen without judgement or looking at their time piece. It is nice to know that God puts people into our lives to be an extension of his arms. I Thank God for BTRO.

Being There Reaching Out Inc	32805	1	/users/profile/33637	shari11	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	My experience with volunteering with BTRO is over the top heart warming and at the same time heart wrenching. These families have found one another only through the efforts of this organization. The families are neatly organized to come together at least quarterly. Age appropriate activities are carefully planned for young and old. Details for gatherings and fund raising are carefully thought out and taken care of so families can simply come together and share. BTRO was created out of insight, empathy and hard work. The organizational roots are firmly planted. With families becoming more involved and educated, they become active on the board and stronger within the organization. The families are now 'reaching out and are being there' for the new families in that are losing loved ones in the war. This is a very fine organization that has become an extended family and for some the only family that understands.

It is a great place to catch a show.  It's small, intimate and offers a close up experience with the performer(s).  Highly, highly recommended.

It was a concert by John McCutcheon. This is a fine venue with good acoustics, seating and view of the stage.  The old opera house has been lovingly restored and I  look forward to attending more events there in the future. The calendar of events lists many well known performers from a variety of musical tastes. It was well worth the drive from Madison, Wisconsin.  I encourage everyone to attend events at the Thrasher Opera House in Green Lake, Wisconsin.
Thrasher Opera House Corporation	61835		/users/profile/67563	Mary	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	Thrasher Opera House is a gift to our community that keeps on giving.  My family has benefited from a wide array of experiences in a beautiful setting.  We've heard George Winston perform during the Christmas holiday season.  We have had the pleasure of listening to numerous other talent musicians. We've attended Missoula Children's Theater performances when our daughter was very small and watched her blossom as an actor in 8 productions put on by Missoula Children's Theater over the last 6 years.  Our independent small business believes this is such an amazing opportunity for local children that we have begun sponsoring this program whenever possible. Just this month we've gone to Thrasher Opera House twice for very diverse evenings:   a children's performance of the Frog Prince through MCT and a screening of an independent film, Feed the Fish, which was made in Wisconsin.  Both were affordable experiences in a lovely venue within 20 minutes from our home.  The arts are a very important part of our lives and we look forward to continuing to benefit from Thrasher Opera House as a part of our community.

Board Member	5	01/30/2011	When I look around the audience at any of our performances, I see total engagement in peoples faces, whether the venue is Celtic, folk, country, pop, jazz, theater or comedy.  This to me is the reward of all the hard work that it takes to keep the doors open of such a gem in our small community!  Many of these faces in the audience belong to those that have traveled often many miles from our neighboring states to see their favorite artist perform. And, each performer finds the warmth, acoustics, and overall experience of Thrasher to be so unique that repeat performances are almost always requested by the artist.  If you haven't experienced Thrasher, this MUST be put on your "A" list!

The programming has always been diverse and very entertaining. My family and friends look forward to the performances. The staff does an excellent job of involving the community youth in many educational and fun projects. All of our local businesses have benefitted from the extra activity The Trasher Opers House created.
Thrasher Opera House Corporation	61471		/users/profile/67109	scolumbus	General Member of the Public	5	01/28/2011	The Thrasher is definitely a FIND.  The building is well maintained, acoustics are great,  soft great chairs, wine and beer are available which is a nice touch, the staff are always very kind and helpful, and the PRICE is right.  They offer very affordable events so one can truly experience new ventures without hesitation.  We drive one hour to come to the Thrasher and it is well worth it.  We have a lovely dinner at a restaurant nearby ant then walk over to the event.   We have seen a jazz singer, Eric Bibb that we had seen in Liverpool, England where we sat in a large stadium and he was quite far away to sitting just three rows away from him at the Thrasher!!!!  For St. Patty's weekend we saw a wonderful riveting irish band, and recently we saw the two men from Switchback who sang a mix of their own songs and Christmas songs.  Even our 21 and 34 year old sons thoroughly enjoyed their phenomenal voices and  instrumental talent.  We are incredibly fortunate to have the Trasher available and one that is able to search out for a wide variety of talent.  We have NEVER been disappointed yet, and doubt we ever will be.  Because we have never been disappointed it also encourages one to try new events that you may not have thought about going to.  We are anxious to see and hear our next event.  We have been telling others about this "find" and will be bringing more with us as we continue to venture to this beautiful town.  
Thrasher Opera House Corporation	61282		/users/profile/66882	Susan	Client Served	4	01/27/2011	We have enjoyed many musical events at Thrasher.  Almost all have been artists we would not have been aware of, or unable to see because of cost of tickets, and distance to travel to a larger venue.  It is a rare occurrence to be disappointed in the performances that we choose to attend.  We love everything about Thrasher- the outstanding acoustics, intimate atmosphere, comfy seats, as well as being able to meet our friends who also enjoy the music here.  Very often the artists comment on how much they love to perform at Thrasher. They seem to deeply appreciate our small town charm, friendliness, outstanding welcome they receive, and our love of their music. It feels very cool to be a part of this 'inside' perspective. There is always an opportunity to meet & speak with the artists who perform here. I think they view it as a 'getaway' stop while on the road.  We love Thrasher, and wish it a long, prosperous run.

Every time we attend a performance we have a wonderful experience. the performers like playing in an intimate setting, in front of an enthusiastic crowd and the result is a great live performance.

Certainly, we've enjoyed the intimate atmosphere, allowing us to have a closer, more personal experience with the performers. We've also enjoyed the historical integrity preserved in the renovation of the building.  Our son, now 13, has developed a love of music, performance and theater, partly because of some of the interesting and entertaining events he has been able to attend at the Thrasher Opera House.

Although the non profit organization is managed by very loyal and supportive volunteers and a small staff tickets are purchased by people throughout Wisconsin and many other states.  Those attendees travel significant distances to follow their favorite performer(s) and the small city of Green Lake comes alive as they also patronize motels, hotels, restaurants and shops.  What a profound change this has made in our community! Certainly all arts should be supported in both down and up economic conditions.

The presence of this venue has given us the opportunity to enjoy music of all kinds (classical to folk), comedy, lazer light shows, vintage and independent films, theatre (from childrens to community to professional), lectures on local history and current issues, literary readings, and more.  Thanks to Thrashers presence, weve had the pleasure of opening our home to two opera singers  from Lake Baikal, cooking for the touring directors from Missoula Childrens Theatre, learning how to  build sets, forging relationships with other Thrasher volunteers and supporters.  Thrasher is the catalyst for opening ones eyes and ears, and heart!

Where else can you visit a charming lake town of 1000 people and listen to award winning musicians like legendary  bluesman Eric Bibb, iconic folksinger Tom Rush & founding member of the Byrd's, Roger McGuinn? In addition, the Missoula children's theater keeps returning and involving young people from the area in their 1 week long workshops that culminate in charming performances. There isn't a bad seat in the house and tickets are reasonably priced. Best of all, the artists love the place and it shows. They keep returning for more small town hospitality from the appreciative audiences!

It's a very intimate experience:  there are no bad seats in the house, and performers mingle freely with the audience at intermission and concert's end.  The acts range from famous (Maria Muldaur, Richie Havens, Poco, George Winston) to those who ought to be better known (Guy Davis, Eric Bibb, Peter Mulvey, Rani Arbo), but they are all top quality entertainers.

After I had genetic testing that revealed I carried a rare gene that gave me an 80-90% chance of developing stomach cancer that couldn't be detected through screening, my genetic counselor referred me to NSFC and told me not to look at anything else on the internet.  Through NSFC I found the surgeon who removed my stomach as a precautionary measure, but after surgery we learned that I'd had four spots of cancer that hadn't been detected prior to surgery.  Having lost both my father (who was diagnosed as stage 1) and my grandfather very shortly after their diagnoses, I know that this cancer would have killed me if I hadn't pursued genetic testing and learned what I could do to avoid cancer and who specialized in working with this incredibly rare gene.  The people at NSFC are all incredibly supportive and helpful, and their website is a treasure trove of useful information.  Thanks to them, I'm now 15 months post surgery and have a long, healthy life to look forward to with my family!

No Stomach for Cancer, Inc supports stomach cancer research and public awareness.Stomach cancer is the second leading cause of all cancer deaths in the world, yet far too little is known in the medical field and general public. Lives are needlessly claimed because the medical community is failing the victims of stomach cancer. This organization is working to change all that. It has been a Godsend in caring, supporting, and advocating for those of us affected by stomach cancer. In four short months, I lost the love of my life to this dreadful disease.

Gastric cancer research is very badly underfunded, and this cancer does not get the recognition it needs. More often than not, this goes undiagnosed and untreated leading to poor prognosis. This has been thought as a disease that afflicts only older generations, but that is completely false. Many young, otherwise healthy, people are being devastated by this terrible disease, and any organization that shines a light on it is to be applauded. Awareness and early diagnosis are key to beating this monster, and NSFC is providing much needed visibility.

My father was having issues after having his stomach removed and I reached out to NSFC for some advice.  Somebody got back to me within 10 minutes.  She was extremely helpful and sympathetic.  My father passed away a year after his diagnosis.  I found out I was positive for the CDH1 gene 2 weeks after my dad died.  5 more family members are carriers of this gene.  NSFC was our saving grace!!!  It was so helpful to talk to others who have gone through what my family was going through.  So far, 5 members in my family have had a prophylactic total gastrectomy.  NSFC prepared us so well for surgery and helped us find the best surgeon.  They were there for us when we had questions after our surgery.  I would strongly encourage anyone going through this to reach out to NSFC.  I couldn't have done it without them!!!
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	187876	1	/users/profile/244996	Slate1	Donor	2	11/05/2013	I donated to No Stomach for Cancer, Inc and participated in the November 2, 2013 walk for my husband who passed away from stomach cancer.   I wonder where all the money goes?  What research is it donated to?  The only mention I could find was a 2012 tax report saying 20,000 went to the University of Otago, New Zealand.  At that site I could not find what was being researched for gastric cancer.   It is a good site for connecting to others going through gastric cancer, survivors and caregivers.  Plus it offers a wealth of information.  But, I would like more availability of information on where the money is going.

NSFC has been the most valuable resource for myself any my family since we discovered the CDH1 gene mutation for gastric cancer. While the organization greatly serves those with this particular gene mutation, it is equally appropriate and resourceful for anyone with any type of gastric cancer.While I find their awareness and advocacy campaigns to be excellent and very important, I am most thankful for the grant money they provide for research into combating this very deadly form of cancer. 
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	303941		/users/profile/395097	crw74,	Client Served	5	09/13/2016	No Stomach For Cancer saved my life - literally!  After I had genetic testing that revealed I carried a rare gene that gave me an 80-90% chance of developing stomach cancer that couldn't be detected through screening, my genetic counselor referred me to NSFC and told me not to look at anything else on the internet.  Through NSFC I found the surgeon who removed my stomach as a precautionary measure, but after surgery we learned that I'd had four spots of cancer that hadn't been detected prior to surgery.  Having lost both my father (who was diagnosed as stage 1) and my grandfather very shortly after their diagnoses, I know that this cancer would have killed me if I hadn't pursued genetic testing and learned what I could do to avoid cancer and who specialized in working with this incredibly rare gene.  The people at NSFC are all incredibly supportive and helpful, and their website is a treasure trove of useful information.  Thanks to them, I'm now 15 months post surgery and have a long, healthy life to look forward to with my family!
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	93438	2	/users/profile/107479	Andrew Linstead	Client Served	5	07/05/2011	A few years ago it was discovered my family was cursed with a brutal form of stomach cancer known as CDH1. Our lack of knowledge of what we were dealing with meant the loss of two family members. To many doctors and consultants this hereditary form of cancer was unheard of. The knowledge gained from No Stomach for Cancer has proved extremely valuable in maintaining the life for many family members. Stomach or no smomach, the knowledge my family gained from this organisation has saved lives for which we are all truely grateful. Without the knowledge gained many more family members would have died at some point during their life due to this cancer.  Karen Chelcun Schreiber ,the founder, is such an inspirational and strongly motivated person. Her endless efforts to acheive the organisations mission to increase awareness of this cancer is literally saving lives and providing great support to those affected. Karen establishes personal relationships with each family and its so good to see that her efforts are recieving recognition. The Linstead Family cant thank No Stomach For Cancer enough and will forever continue to support this very worthy cause.  Andrew Linstead
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	92214	1	/users/profile/105691	Gretchen	Client Served	5	06/27/2011	Two years ago, I discovered that a mutation in the CDH1 gene runs in my family and I tested positive for it. What this means is that I would face a extremely high risk of developing a stomach cancer that is so difficult to detect, it is usually not found until it's already in stage 3 or 4. It also puts me at a very high risk for a certain type of breast cancer. The best option for dealing with this risk, right now, is complete removal of the stomach, which is an overwhelming proposition. I've spent the past two years researching, debating, and just plain stewing over this decision. Without the help, advice, and connections made on NoStomachForCancer.org, I would be lost. This organization has made me realize, that although there are only somewhere around 100 families living with a CDH1 mutation, they are facing the same kinds of decisions I've had to make, and they are thriving. How many other families like mine are out there - families with a long history of cancer feeling that they are simply "doomed." Although learning of the scientific proof that I am at a high risk was difficult, I feel so much gratitude that I now know. And, although the best solution to this problem is a difficult one, I feel lucky to have one. I also hope that through organizations like No Stomach For Cancer, we'll be able to raise awareness so that future generations will have better options, possibly even a cure.

No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	92114	2	/users/profile/105562	Brett B.	Client Served	5	06/26/2011	Back in early 2010, I was diagnosed with stage 3 stomach cancer at the age of only 34. At the same time, I was told that my stomach would need to be removed, and i would likely need to undergo aggressive chemo for a period of months. From one second to the next, I went from being an extremely physically fit individual, to being defined as a cancer patient with a bleak outlook. Being told that my stomach would be entirely removed was obviously an enormous shock. I knew of partial gastrectomies, but total gastrectomies was new to me. I decided that information was the key for me. I had to understand what lay ahead of me, so I went surfing! Unfortunately, I only found negative information in blogs. Information about gastrectomies, and surviving gastrectomies was limited and / or negative. It wasnt overly helpful. Regardless, I went in to the operation in a positive frame of mind! After my operation, i discovered NSFC. I found this site very useful, and my only regret was that my early searches didnt link me to this site.  The best thing for me about NSFC is that it helped me to understand the science behind my illness, and linked me to numerous resources, which have answered most of my questions. In my case, it is clear that the cancer was genetic, and my family now understand exactly why generations of members have been dying young.  My experience, linked with the information from NSFC will ensure that I will be the last in a long line of generations to suffer the effects of an advanced stomach cancer.    My brother recently was diagnosed with stage zero cancer and had a total gastrectomy. He was back at work within 5 weeks. This is a smaller layoff than some sporting injuries, and  is all due to our family now being aware of the illness, how to search for it, and how to manage symptoms. This can be directly attributed to the support received from Karen and the crew at NSFC.   NSFC hasn't answered all of my questions. It is impossible, as the science is in its infancy. Only time will answer many of these questions, but I am confident that with each new discovery and experience, NSFC will continue to publish it, and will continue to be an important resource for the thousands of people out there like me. Thank you NSFC! Cheers from a sunny Austria!Brett

I am a nurse and began to speak to one of my supervisors about  some medical concerns I was having about my stomach. She got me in touch with Karen and she in turn directed me to the very people that could help me. Both of my grandfathers and an uncle had died from stomach cancer years ago. Through this organization,  I learned that there is a specific kind of gastric cancer which is hereditary.  I am now in the process of genetic testing. I tell everyone I can about my experience and hopefully they will pass it on to others. I wouldn't have had any knowledge of this without this organization and to Karen who helped to start it due to her own diagnosis. Blessings to her and to all those who will be in need of help. This organization is the one that will give you the direction and courage to overcome this specific cancer.
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	91785		/users/profile/105106	Simone B.	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2011	I have been diagnosed with  the CDH1 gene which increases my chances of having stomach cancer to about 80%.  My father and uncle have both passed away from Stomach cancer and my other uncle and aunt have both had their stomachs removed as a result of cancer.  Due to the poor detection of stomach cancer through endoscopy, it is advised that those with the CDH1 gene have a total gastrectomy (removal of the stomach) which eliminates all risk.  Based on our strong family history, I have elected to have the surgery.  During my research of this gene I came across the NSFC website and have found it invaluable!! It gives factual information as well as personal experiences from others who have had TG and the opportunity to take part in discussion forums.  I access this website on a weekly basis and will continue to do.  It is very comforting to find such a site when diagnosed with this quite rare but deadly gene and to hear the experiences and receive the support from other members
No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	91779	2	/users/profile/105099	Eileen S.	Client Served	5	06/22/2011	Our 22 year old son Tyler was diagnosed with stomach cancer on December 30, 2009. In January 2010 we found out that his cancer was terminal. Tyler was a four year medal winning swimmer for the University of Wisconsin Whitewater. His request for one last swim with his teamates and the special graduation ceremony that the University held for him made headline news in our area. After reading about his story Karen from No Stomach For Cancer reached out to us with information and support. Tyler lost his battle on February 11, 2010 just 6 weeks after being diagnosed. The No Stomach For Cancer organization has a wonderful tribute telling Tyler's story on their website. They worked with Tyler's high school swim team in December of 2010 to hold an event that would raise awareness of stomach cancer. They are working with us to provide information that we can use at an event in July to again raise awareness of this deadly disease.  No Stomach for Cancer is a great organization that provides information and a support network for anyone dealing with stomach cancer.

They provide so much information regarding stomach cancer as well as help to unite people from all over the world to share their stories. My husband recently lost his 7 year battle with gastric cancer and this organization provided some comfort to me by being able to read the stories of others who have battled this disease. This cancer is so over looked in the real world, in fact there were no organizations and very little information  available when my husband was first diagnosed in 2004. My hope is that No Stomach for Cancer will get the attention it deserves and in turn bring more funding to help fight this very serious cancer.

No Stomach For Cancer, Inc.	91012	2	/users/profile/103975	chappa	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2011	The summer  of 2009 My youngest son complained of general abdominal discomfort but nothing that could be diagnosis.  This went on thru the fall and early winter it just got worse with no one able to diagnosis what was wrong...Then Christmas Eve 2009 I got the worse news I think any mother ever can deal with.  Ray was finally diagnosised with gastric cancer then we had to wait till monday to learn what type and what stage it was.  That was 4 days away and it felt like a life time.  Monday we were told it was signet cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach...any signet cell cancer is the worse to try to treat but we did.  It was a long grueling time chemo was the only option because it had already advanced 9STAGE 4) and he had ascites.  (fluid build up in abdominal cavity)  He fought and lost his battle that August 10, 2010  thru this time it was suggested we have genetic testing done just to see...They drew the blood in February and said they would let us know,  My dad had also died of gastic cancer about 10 years earlier.  What a surprise in Feb. of 2011 when my daghter in law called to say she finally got Rays genetic test back and it was positive.  It took my a few weeks to process this information but then I gathered myself and went to see the genetic testing doctor at our local hospital.  So far three of my four adult childeren have recieved their tests and have been negative.  I on the other hand am the carrier and came back positive.  I have decided that I did not watch my father and son die horrible deaths from this awful disease for nothing ..I am having a gastrectomy next week to show my son Rays beautiful daughters they have nothing to fear if they do prove to be positive as adults and need gastrectomies (they are only 3 and 4 and can not be tested until they are in their late teens unless they get symptomatic)  I pray they will find better screening in the next 10 years because without it having a  gastrectomy is the logical alternative to prevent gastric cancer.  I wISH I could do something to let all doctors be more aware of this killer of our young people.  I am a nurse and my work brings across many people with gastric cancer and I wonder how many of them could be EChardin  positive.

The level of respect and care for the children of the community is second to none. I have witnessed Anne, Leanne, their employees and many of the board members go over and above to meet the needs of the children and families they serve. And serve is the word. The serve them with their programs and displays at the museum. They serve them by the way they make sure everyone can play. They serve by engaging and providing for the community at large. They serve by their attitude; that "give all" attitude that makes people come back and engage in the learning process. I wish more community based programs would mirror the concept and mission that the Children's Museum of La Crosse has developed. Bravo!

Childrens Museum of La Crosse Inc	151150		/users/profile/201694	ICfromMN	General Member of the Public	3	03/15/2013	We have been going off and on for years with our kids, so it is worth a visit.  My kids have fun every time, and its a real asset to the small city of LaCrosse.  However, every time I have gone, its been about a two hour experience.  Maybe less.  Prices for admission were recently raised to $6 a person, and with our large family, that's just too expensive if our toddler flames out after an hour.   I've been to many kid-oriented museums over the years and most are bigger and better (pricier too, but worth it since you stay there all day).  So while I'm sure it is a good way to spend a couple of hours with your kids, I feel the museum ought to be upgraded, or the price of admission lowered.
Childrens Museum of La Crosse Inc	107025	2	/users/profile/144854	ja2010	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2012	My son Loves the children's museum in La Crosse.  He can spend 2 or more hours there every week if we could find the time to go.  In fact he could probably go more than once a week.  When we first were deciding whether or not to buy a membership I wasn't sure there was enough to hold his attention time and time again, but I was wrong.  We recently went to another museum on our Passport level membership and it included 5 museums in one.  I must say it made me see our children's museum in a whole different light.  It was located in a city bigger than La Crosse and it paled in comparison.  Not that there weren't things that were impressive in some of the museums but the children's museum was nothing compared to what we have here at the museum in La Crosse.  I just wanted to say thanks to the Children's Museum in La Crosse because I now see how lucky we are to have such a great place to spend an afternoon.  Thanks for all the exhibits and the staff who are so friendly and work so hard to keep the place clean and running.  Thank you.

It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and one that probably shaped me the most as a professional. Not only was the staff's passion for what they do contagious, but the community embraces this organization with open, willing arms. I was surprised by how supportive other businesses were and the outpour of support we also received from visitors and friends of the museum. The city would not be the same without this nonprofit; it has helped shape La Crosse as a giving and nurturing place that cares about kids. And I would not be the same without it either.

We enjoyed the museum during our interview weekend and then continued to come once we moved here. The continued updating of exhibits keeps my children interested. Now, as a member of the board I see, first hand, the dedication and hard work of the staff. I would recommend this museum to anyone that wants to see their children smile.

Childrens Museum of La Crosse Inc	26817	4	/users/profile/27836	boseman67	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2010	Our family has 5 children from 1 - 13 years old.  There is something there for all ages.  The older kids like the exhibits and rock climbing wall and the younger ones think they are in Disney Land with all there is to do.  There is no better way to breakup they day than grab the kids and head to the Childrens Museum for a few hours especially in the winter months when outdoor activity is limited.  The Childrens Museum is an asset this the City of LaCrosse and surrounding area.  Bailey Wilson

Movin' Out, Inc.	136540		/users/profile/56998	seija	Board Member	5	11/09/2012	Movin' Out is the only statewide organization in Wisconsin that is committed to developing safe, affordable and accessible housing for people with disabilities and their families.  The guiding value is to develop housing that is scattered throughout the community, so that people with disabilities live, work and play where other people with or without disabilities live. This work is complex, it requires many fiscal partners as well as as partnerships with organizations that provide supports to people with disabilities. And most importantly, it requires that Movin Out always listens to the people who need housing.  Movin Out changes people's lives.  So far, over one thousand persons with disabilities who live across the state own their own homes thanks to Movin Out. And many people live in accessible, safe and affordable rental units developed by Movin Out.This commitment to bringing people home makes Movin Out a truly great non-profit organization!
Movin' Out, Inc.	55017		/users/profile/56998	seija	Board Member	5	10/21/2010	People with disabilities have extremely low incomes, they often need to make due for about $700 each month.  There are few more important things for any human being than a safe, affordable place to call home. Movin' Out Inc. is an organization that helps people with disabilities to have a real home.  Across Wisconsin, over one thousand people with disabilities own their own home because Movin' Out Inc helped them with the complex process of getting  grants and low interest loans so that they can afford their own home.  Movin' Out Inc also owns and manages rental units for people with disabilities.  The greatest strength of MOI is its deep commitment to respecting people with disabilities, listening to their voices and developing normal housing that is part of regular communities. MOI staff competence in understanding the complex world of housing financing and their ability to develop effective partnership is they key to the succesful  outcomes.

I represented family members specifically from Northern WI, but as a Director of the Wisconsin Statewide Parent-Educator Initiative, I represent the voices of all families in WI.  It was an honor to serve on this board and get to know all the board members and the services that Movin' Out could provide families and the connections they have with other agencies.   This non-profit deserves so much recognition for the great opportunities they provide for adults with disabilities to live more independently and to have access to their community resources.  As I pass the torch of my role to other parent representatives to serve on this board, I value the connections this agency has given me to help parents look at long-term living supports for their young adult.  
Movin' Out, Inc.	96945	1	/users/profile/113305	RLWB	Client Served	5	08/30/2011	When our son was diagnosed with autism seven years ago, the plan we'd had for our lives was derailed. In the years since then we have devoted every spare penny and all our time to helping him realize his full potential. With very little savings and only one moderate income we gave up on our dream of owning a home and having a back yard in which our son could play. We struggled to find room for all of his therapy equipment in the rentals we could afford. Then we were referred to Movin' Out and through the wonderful support and guidance of Rebecca and the well-organized process Movin' Out has established, we made our way through the steps of finding a home in which to raise our boy. We have lived in and loved our home for over a year and feel grateful every day for the opportunity. The folks at Movin' Out worked a small miracle in piecing together multiple funding sources for us. They helped us prepare for the responsibility we were taking on in buying a house. They offered encouragement, practical and emotional support, and celebrated with us when the keys were in our hand. It was a really amazing thing to find and work with an organization whose mission is to bring about such a profound change in the lives of people with disabilities and their families. The gifts of roots, comfort, and building a place in our community are beyond description. We would never have known these if not for Movin' Out.
Movin' Out, Inc.	59138	3	/users/profile/58519	Amy M.	Donor	5	12/27/2010	Movin' Out is a fabulous place to work as well as being a meaningful, successful, one-of-a-kind  organization in Wisconsin that works with people with disabilities to come up with housing solutions. With a dedicated housing counselor, a person with a disability (and their family in many cases) develop short and long term housing plans, some of which include receiving down payment assistance funds, rehab or housing accessibility funds, an affordable rental home or just financial planning to improve their housing situation in the future. Everybody wins: communities add new taxpayers, money is saved by the human services system, affordable housing stock increases and quality of life goes up.

Movin' Out was just getting started, then, and through the support of Marcie Brost and others, two people with disabilities who Dungarvin supported were able to buy their own homes.  Since then, I've watched the organization evolve into one of the best nonprofits in Wisconsin concerned with housing issues. They recently made an impact with legislation clarifying that property owned by nonprofit providers of low income housing should not be subject to property taxes.  I hoe they keep up the good work.

As a volunteer, I have interacted with indviduals who have overcome challenges with grace and dignity. I  do not see these individuals any different than myself.  They are capable of doing the same project but  just perform the project in a different way. Independent First provides people with the disabilities to  participate in the communityby assisting with devices that provide them the mobilty to get around the community.  The first day I volunteered, I saw the cohesiveness with the staff and volunteers.

In the summer of 2010, I reached out to IF with the idea of bringing a CIL to our area.  I did not know Lee or any of the staff at IL personally at that time.  In the true spirit of peer mentorship, resource development, etc. Lee was very instrumental in helping me refine my ideas and giving me technical assistance.  Our CIL was born October, 2010.  Since that time, I have visited IF twice, continually learn from Lee and his staff and have recently been the recipient of some "mighty fine" peer mentoring services from his staff related to fiscal management.

Independence First, Inc.	55018		/users/profile/57001	Jill K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2010	IndependenceFirst puts its money where its mouth is.  More than 1/2 of the employees and board are people with disabilities themselves.  The Independent Living Skills Coordinators are role models, peer supports and examples to the community as a whole but particularly to others with disabilities and their families. They are proof that people with disabilites CAN and DO succeed when given the opportunity.  I've seen with my own eyes peoples' lives changed by the Independent Living philosophy and the living examples set by the staff.  Independence First doesn't do FOR...they do WITH!

Independence First, Inc.	54773		/users/profile/56573	Rachel Jones	Volunteer	5	10/15/2010	I am a volunteer for Independence First.   I am there a minimum of 2 days a month.   If there are special projects that need to be done I always try to fit them in also.   It is one of my favorite places to volunteer.    They have an excellent volunteer cooridnator who makes it a pleasant place to work.I feel that the services that Independence First provides to their clients are essential to their well being and staying independent.   As far as a place to work it really is state of the art for being handicapped accessible.I hope to be able to volunteer there for many years to come.Rachel Jones (racheljones@earthlink.net)2earthlink.net

It is obvious that each and every detail in its construction -- from flooring to the bathrooms to the tables/chairs to the kitchen, etc --  was designed to make everything easier for the disabled visitors and staff.The staff with whom I've interacted have all been extremely friendly and insightful. It is really clear that they are passionate about their advocacy.My previous employer donated computer equipment to IndependenceFirst as well -- a service that many local business participate in.

Independence First, Inc.	54638		/users/profile/56284	joyful1	Volunteer	5	10/07/2010	Independence First is an organization dedicated to helping others help themselves and its robust, vibrant volunteer program expands its reach even further into Milwaukee and surrounding communities.  As a Consumer Volunteer, I have directly witnessed the organization's impact:  first, by aligning clients with my services and second, by giving additional supports as needed.  (For example, I work with a client in need of sight aides.  An Independence First representative met with the client to arrange for the tool to be provided.)  This is true customer service and compassionate business practice combined.
Independence First, Inc.	54625		/users/profile/56186	mary-sherman	Volunteer	5	10/07/2010	For close to 30 years I was a Homemaker & Mother until one day my Husband announced He wanted a Divorce. I had learned to be  Strong because of a disability I've had since my Childhood, I survived Polio,  I learned the Ignorance of people for what they didn't understand because nothing had touched their  lives in the same manner but when my Oldest son lost his hearing to Spinal Meningitis my protective side kicked in, but it wasn't until I had a severe Stroke that I became acquainted with Independence First.  They took me from I can't to I Can through their vigilance and taught me that I was far more able then I thought that I was.  I listened at first to too many saying to me, You can't do that anymore, I made a big mistake & bought into that thinking probably because it was easier & not as much of a challenge, It was easier to buy into passive thinking but I had the opportunity trainwith my Service Dog, Gambler, but I has to travel to California to make that happen.  I mustered all my Yes I can's together and decided that Here are people who believe in me ,. Maybe I can do this, and you know what I did do it & I survived. a feeling of Joy came over me, My life hadn't passed me by, I just learned that U had to maybe do things a little different but I could Do it!! What a feeling of Joy & self worth it has given me to have people at Independence First BELIEVE IN ME, FROM THE Independent Living Coordinators TO THE DIRECTOR, they BELIEVED.  Sometimes that's all you need, Someone to believe in you, to see your cap[abilities not just your challenges.  I have grown immensely because of these people & would be willing to do anything for them.Yes Life is great because I have an army of believers on my sideYes they helped me to refined who I am & show me self Empowerment.  Thank You Independence First  I'll TAKE A BUS TO YOUR FACILITY ANYTIME EVEN THOUGH IT ONCE FRIGHTENED THE BEJEEBERS OUT OF ME.  KEEP UP ALL OF THE Outstanding Work that you do  You are Stellar in my book

We give clients or consumers with a disability and low income a chance to have a free computer, mouse, keyboard and monitor.Those are the only two requirements for receiving a computer. Last year we have almost reached 300 given away. We could do more but we are almost entirely staffed by volunteers doing the program work with some support from the paid staff at Independence First.
Independence First, Inc.	54545		/users/profile/56064	bobunkel	Volunteer	5	10/06/2010	I have participated at IndependenceFirst for many years. Over those years I have seen tremendous growth in programs, staffing, individuals served and other evidence of a vibrant nonprofit. But the greatest strength of IndependenceFirst is the commitment to mission and values. That commitment transcends its program area, and provides leadership and support for people with disabilities on a statewide, national and international level.
Independence First, Inc.	54544		/users/profile/56062	jeremiah	Board Member	5	10/06/2010	Independence First as President Lee says it's top three in the nation for Center of Independent Living (CIL's) Independence First has amazing services and they want people to get highly involved.   They are an organization that always makes sure your on top of your game to helping out people with disabilities.  But also they make the staff and volunteers feel very good about themselves when there are often times award ceremonies.My story in how I got involved with independence first was word of mouth.  I was at my IEP meeting for my Junior year in high school which was a few years ago.  Where a representative from WI FACETS told me about this youth leadership submit that was offered through WI FACETS and also Independence First.I went to this submit and gave a week of my time and I really took a lot out of it.   I thought that my whole life in having high functioning autism that if I get social security I could live off of it the rest of my life. Even though in reality I found out I couldn't when everything in life in so expensive when we went through a simulation of having SSI or SSDI and expenses.Then there were some youth leaders through WI FACETS and Independence First in where I got promoted to be on both boards.   One being on the Independence First board of directors and the other being through WI FACETS Youth Information Training and Resource Center (YITRC)When I am on the board of Independence First.  They really have helped me a lot to be a lot successful today then I was yesterday.  Without them I probably wouldn't be where I am at today in helping out people with disabilities but also advocating strongly while I strive for independence as a whole.

MidWest SSTRC, Inc	259836	2	/users/profile/348363	wirosie	Volunteer	5	09/26/2015	The service and community education that Midwest offers every year is so important. They work closely with the local National Weather service to help save lives during severe weather. Midwest has a weather spotting education program every year that everybody should send at least one family member to even if they are not a radio operator. The quality of this free program is  very good. And since they offer this class in many communities, residents should not have to travel far to get to one.  I am very glad that we have this organization in our area.

This organization consists of many caring individuals working together to help their communities stay safe from severe weather, educated about the dynamics of weather and aware of severe weather's potential. MidWest SSTRC is an organization of volunteers across several counties all working together to provide ground truth to the National Weather Service when weather turns severe. They are people who work to raise the level of severe storm awareness and preparedness to their communities. If you would like to learn more about the weather and how you can become involved in helping your community stay safe, this is a great organization that can help you help others.

MidWest SSTRC, Inc	258784	2	/users/profile/347312	Terraphon	Volunteer	5	09/22/2015	When I moved from the desert, where the worst weather event is a dust storm or flash flooding, to an area where tornadoes and other severe weather are a fact of life, I knew immediately that I would need to find a skywarn group with which I could use the skills and experience I have built over several years.  It took me a while to "separate the wheat from the chaff" but I finally did and Midwest SSTRC is that group.   These guys are serious.  MWSSTRC isn't a few guys who sit around during a drizzle and count off the thunder; This is a group of individuals who are well trained, experienced and organized.  Forecasters, nowcasters, spotter teams, chase teams, radar interpreters...they have it all.  I've spent several weather events guiding spotters and chasers to the worst parts of the storm and keeping them out of harm's way so they can see what's really happening and relay ground truth to the National Weather Service, then survey damage when it's all over. Midwest SSTRC also runs a plethora of training classes and seminars where you can learn forecasting, nowcasting, how to read doppler radar, first aid, CPR, basic and advanced storm spotting, storm safety, and more and can give you guidance on how to get a number of incident command certifications from FEMA, HAM radio licenses, etc... If you want to get involved in helping people survive severe weather events, this is the group to do it with.
MidWest SSTRC, Inc	258737	2	/users/profile/347263	popbang	Volunteer	4	09/21/2015	This organization has volunteers who are dedicated and committed to the knowledge of weather & public safety. Weather 'spotters' volunteer their time to help identify and communicate critical weather events for the NWS, local, city and county emergency teams. I have directed my friends and family to the broadcast(online) to hear what's really going on. Great organization! Volunteer or donate if you have the opportunity.

MidWest SSTRC, Inc	239957	2	/users/profile/271315	dalebernstein	Board Member	5	03/26/2015	Our main focus is convective weather per se. However we have reviewed our winter level of activations and have ramped things up a bit. Our activation levels (which can be found at www.midwestsstrc.org) incorporate a Winter activation level option, of which we have been monitoring more closely starting Jan '15. Thank you Mike for bringing your concern to our attention and showing that you care as we do, in the past, present and future service of our communities.

MidWest SSTRC, Inc	236264	1	/users/profile/320078	Mike1990	General Member of the Public	1	01/04/2015	it saddens me to see a weather group who claims to be part of skywarn but does not have current infomation on there website.  but yet there asking for donations seem to be updated more then the weather alerts.     Like today Jan 4th 2015  we have for Dane Wind Chill Advisory that has been posted now for days.  And they clame Dane is all Clear for weather alerts.     And this is not the first time.    for the last 3 weeks there website has said clear.  but yet we have had Winter storm watch,  other Windchill alerts for Dane.     
MidWest SSTRC, Inc	210886	2	/users/profile/273694	Rosie O.	Volunteer	5	08/15/2014	Every area of the U.S. should have a working group like this. The information they provide saves lives. I have been to their training sessions. I am glad they reach out to the public to help inform and train people to understand severe weather. Being informed is the best first step for safety during severe weather. 
MidWest SSTRC, Inc	210792	2	/users/profile/273585	Lrr147	Client Served	4	08/14/2014	As a 911 operator, many of my co-workers do not receive any type of training as a dispatcher; and when severe weather strikes we can count on this team to be relaying the right information, to the right source, at the right time. With the great advances in internet, I know of many people who will listen in on the MidWest SSTRC feed online to keep up with the weather and get a more accurate description of where the weather is happening at that moment. This group is very dedicated and explifies it's mission whenever severe weather affects Southern Wisconsin. I think the information that this group provides also helps the "tax-payer dollar" go further; the National Weather Service will not always have the funds to investigate in detail each storm event, which is where these volunteers fill the gap. The group is always striving to become better and remain a positive image in the community. 
MidWest SSTRC, Inc	208995	3	/users/profile/271754	Michael B	Volunteer	5	08/06/2014	I have been interested in weather and involved in weather spotting for over 30 years.  This is my first of what I hope will be many years with MidwestSSTRC.   A fantastic group of people, dedicated to educating the public about weather safety.  The organization supports the National Weather Service during severe weather events by providing real time ground truth from our network of trained observers.  Truly making a difference and potentially touching the lives of every person that lives in this region.

MidWest SSTRC, Inc	208620	3	/users/profile/271353	Teri V.	Volunteer	5	08/05/2014	MWSSTRC is a group of very dedicated individuals who volunteer their time to go out in sometimes dangerous situations to provide the eyes on the ground that the National Weather Service needs in order to issue severe weather warnings. NWS radar cannot see ground conditions beyond a distance of about 10 miles, so having trained weather spotters distributed across the counties is essential to them. I am proud to be a member of this group.
MidWest SSTRC, Inc	208602	3	/users/profile/271323	mncondon	Volunteer	5	08/04/2014	MidWest is a volunteer organization. The members perform weather spotting when sevear conditions are happening.

The work they do to push young men to recognize their own potential and set their lives on a path to success is truly remarkable.Rawhide is proud to use Christian principles in their program even though there have been several attempts over the years to damage them financially for adhering to this mission.The records show that the young men who participate in Rawhide's programs are more likely to remain out of the justice system. Rawhide's successful model should be studied and repeated!

Every person we came in contact with demonstrated a strong faith and a caring desire to help our son.  Our son is now 21 and on a positive path.  Rawhide was very instrumental in this.  My parents donated a vehicle after seeing what the organization did for their grandson.  They had a positive experience with the donation.
Rawhide Inc	299228	2	/users/profile/390135	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/04/2016	Approximately ten years ago I had the opportunity to tour the Rawhide campus and was completely awestruck with the facility, staff and most importantly the young men they serve. We were able to hear and see first hand how they had changed the life of a young man whom was graduating from the program. A young man that without the help of Rawhide was destined to life on the streets or prison.  Honestly this was one of the most powerful experiences of my life.  I have supported Rawhide since both as a volunteer and financially. If presented the opportunity take the tour, chances are it will change your life as well.

Even before that time, they worked unselfishly with youth to give them purpose and meaning as well as providing spiritual needs. I have know  some of those that lead and direct the programs at Rawhide as well as those that carry on day to day functions.  I am 100% certain the  efforts made by all these people are sincere and fully supportive in meeting the mission statement adopted by Rawhide . I donate by regular bank drafts monthly and only wish that I could donate a lot more.  Living nearby I see the difference in the boys and that makes me so grateful that Rawhide exists.

A second chance to turn their lives around, to be shown their lives "count," and know the joy of a life surrendered to Jesus Christ.It's truly a wonderful atmosphere where they can learn many tools & develop skills to navigate the real world.  Rawhide is a campus made up of people and employees who truly care about what they do, all centered around a common goal which is to emulate the love of Christ to the boys!

We donated to Rawhide in a simple and quick manner. It was easy, the cars were picked up and we could use the value for our taxes. We are gratified that Rawhide will obtain value and put the money to good use. We will always use Rawhide for donations.
Rawhide Inc	222322	1	/users/profile/286026	rkrause	Donor	4	10/13/2014	Donating my vehicle to Rawhide was easy and, amazingly, convenient. I spent a few minutes on their web site researching what was involved. The site clearly outlined the process and described what I needed to do. I then made one phone call and the Rawhide representative gathered all of the information. That was it. A tow truck came to my home a few days later (a date that was convenient for me, not the towing firm) and took the car away. I chose to donate my vehicle to Rawhide because I feel strongly about the work they are doing with young men who are motivated to make positive changes in their lives.

When we arrived, a Saturday, one of the teachers offered to give us a tour of the entire Rawhide campus.  Needless to say it was great.  Rawhide does a great job and it really is a wonderful place.  If you ever get a chance, go and see the campus you will not forget Rawhide again.  Also, keep donating items they need them

Little did I know I would need this program for my son 30 year later.  In trying to get my son into this program, I even tried to start this program in the Milwaukee County, just before they finally did sign the contract for Rawhide, called OKKids Corral.  Eventually, when I did find out they did sign the contract, we changed the gender to be helped for girls.  Eventually we did, through prayers, got my son into the Rawhide program.  They where Awesome with him & cared so much for him that he then turned around and through the chances of speaking about Rawhide, was able to help others.  Was one of the Keynote speakers for the Governor's Conference on Volunteerism in 1997 & the Only one that had a Standing Ovation.  My son did have his ups & downs in LIFE after graduating from Rawhide, but he always Loved the care he received from them.  My son still had one "demon" he just couldn't kick & he took his Life just this last April, 2014.  Even then, those that knew Nick while he was there  showed me & his wife concern by coming to his funeral!!  Pag & Rog Hermsen came to pay their respects to Nick!  It was Awesome to see them!!  God Bless them & Rawhide Boys Ranch for caring so much for my son!!

The expertise of the staff and the loving surrounding they are nurtured in, helps the young men realize that good does exist out in society and that they are indeed a very special child of God and they are loved. The young men we get today are more damaged than ever, and need Rawhides help and also their families.

We had a "well-used" car that we were interested in donating to Rawhide if they were interested in coming this far for it.  We were prepared to wait a while, but even during a holiday week, they were here within 3 days !  It was a very easy process :  I called and spoke with a woman who took down all the details, explained the process to me, and said I would hear from the driver soon.  I heard from the driver scheduler that same day, and the car was taken within 3 days !  It was a very easy process....we got a receipt for taxes, and they/Rawhide were most grateful.  It really felt good to help - and it helped us too (not having the hassle of advertising, selling, etc.).  We highly recommend this to anyone.

Hunt Hill offers so many opportunities for people to enjoy. I first discovered Hunt Hill by simply looking for a place to hike. There are several beautiful trails available to the public at no cost. The property contains lakes, prairies, forests, wildlife, wild flowers and just about anything else a nature lover could hope for. Shortly after my first hike, I learned about all of the educational programming that is available. All of their programs are very affordable, many in the $5 range. The people that work at Hunt Hill are great and very accommodating. I teach at local school and they have allowed me to bring my kids out for a variety of service projects. Hunt Hill also offers a summer full of opportunities for  kids, adults and families. I would highly recommend Hunt Hill for anyone who enjoys the outdoors!

The dedicated staff guided them through a week of hands-on instruction that resulted in attitude changes that last through high school and into young adult life.  By week's end, these participants have learned to survive without technology, make friendships with diverse cultures and appreciate the world around them.  The testimonials by these participants indicates they have been deeply affected by their Hunt Hill experiences of canoing, outdoor learning classes and personal interactions.  I believe Sigurd Olson and Aldo Leopold would be proud of this program.

The three of us had a marvelous time together at this beautiful place.  We all enjoyed the language classes and experiencing Swedish food, but the highlight for my daughter and myself was definitely the bog walk.

They have been working with her for only 3 months in a vocational training program.  Our daughter has matured and grown already in this program and the responsibility our daughter has gained is excellent.  Keep up the hard work for special needs adults in the work force.  Our daughter is a true testament of how successful they can be.

Our working relationship was personable and professional.  They were with me through multiple stages. At first I needed a lot of help. then as I grew more confident needed less and less help. My job coach acted as a go between when my rusty social skills and executive functioning would have counted me out before I even got in the door. They didn't do the work for me and there were no guarantees--but they helped me get past a lot of little details that could have buried me. Easter Seals gave me the chance to show what I could do.  That's all I needed.

It is a collaboration with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The program is for high school age youth with special needs.  He worked in two intership rotations in the hospital which provided hands on transferrable job skill development. He also learned "soft" job skills like preparing a resume', interview and interpersonal skills. Prior to graduating from this program, he had been trying to get a job for almost 2 years. within 5 month of graduation from the program he received a job offer based on his experience and letters of reference from Project SEARCH! This is an example of one of the many wonderful vocational training programs that Easter Seals provides. He is proud of his accomplishments in the program, of his new job and we are proud ot him!

Around that time, we had been informed that our son would be non-verbal and would likely require long-term care.    Of course, I was devastated....and relieved when our son was accepted into and began ABA with Easter Seals.     His therapists were all caring, insightful and astute, and worked fantastically with our kiddo!   Our lead therapists and the ABA staff were flexible with our changing schedule and coordinated well with teachers at my son's school.     About one month ago, we were surprised to hear that, not only will our son be dismissed from all special education services (except speech / language), but also that he no longer met functionability criteria to receive the autism waiver.      We are so proud of the accomplishments our son has made with the help of Easter Seals!   His future looks bright and we are truly grateful!

Since November of 2011 when we started partnering with  Easter Seals our daughter has made huge gains.  We have been very happy with the line therapists as well as the lead therapists and BCBA's.  The willingness to collaborate with the team at our daughter's school has been fantastic and helped tremendoulsy with her gains.  We ony expect more great things to come.  Our only item of concern is staffing in the Kenosha County area.  It appears to be difficult for Easter Seals to maintain consistent staffing in this area. I would like to see more qualified candidates solicited from this area to cut down on the commute time that is accounted for within the therapist's time with our daughter. Fantastic program overall though.

While they are "typically developing" boys their role is to work on specific social skills through fun activities accompanied by play.  I am finding this experience is invaluable to my boys.  Not only are my boys having fun and meeting new friends, but they are serving  as a positive peer support role models.  This experience is teaching them to give back to their community, how to be more compassionate and understanding of individuals with special needs and is helping them growing their skills as positive leaders and role models.  As a parent it is not only exciting to hear from the instructors they did well, but to hear from the boys who are volunteering that they are excited for their next class and cannot wait to see their new friends!

I attended the Birch Creek Jazz II session and it completely prepared me for what it took to be a serious Jazz musician. All of the teachers there are professional musicians who make their living as performers. Many of them also teach at colleges or have performed in world renown groups such as the Count Basie Band. The camp does a great job at simulating what it is like to be a musician. In the words of the director, "If you learn that you want to be a musician while you are here then we have done you a great service. If you learn that you do not want to be a musician then we have still done you a great service". While you are here you're going to to learn a lot and you will learn what you need to do to become a great jazz musician.  You're going to make a lot of connections with both teachers and friends after coming here. I wouldn't trade the experiences I had here for anything. I highly recommend going if you want to become a jazz musician.

It completely changed my life.  My high school is lucky enough to have a percussion ensemble program, but it is nothing like the program for percussionists at the camp.  All of the instructors are world-class, well traveled, and knowledgeable on everything.  I will also never forget the friends I made.  The types of music that I was able to play come from every culture and really gave me a connection to the rest of the world. Also, steel pan is the greatest thing I've ever played, and I am so lucky that Birch Creek teaches everyone to play it.  The camp inspired me to be better than I ever was, and I am now becoming a music performance major in college.

I was terrified initially, but soon found myself at home among the faculty and especially my fellow students. The atmosphere is unlike anything else I've found. People will support you and help you, and every year we leave unwillingly, wishing for more time. I learned so much in the years that I attended camp there, about performing and about myself. Every year pushed me further than I had gone before and to the limits of my abilities; there is no better atmosphere for growth. There is a reason that students return as TA's and faculty: they are so touched by what they receive in two brief weeks that they feel almost obligated to pass it on and make things even better. It is a singularly unique experience that I will never forget.

Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	310929		/users/profile/402264	Writer	Donor	5	10/15/2016	Middleton Outreach does just that. They reach out into our community, opening their doors and hands and hearts, and make life better for so many people. They're truly dedicated to helping those who are struggling in our area. We donate regularly to their clothing drive and food pantry. Our kids look forward to helping families during the holidays. MOM makes it easy to contribute and we have every confidence that our donations end up in the hands of our deserving neighbors. They collaborate and cooperate with countless area businesses, schools, and organizations. MOM is a trusted source of support, comfort, and advocacy in our area. I'm proud to voice my support for this outstanding organization.
Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	310828		/users/profile/348152	janmiddleton	Volunteer	5	10/14/2016	I am a volunteer at Middleton Outreach Ministry, I organize an an annual art fair inside the food pantry where over 60 local artists create for a cause -hungry children and families. 40%of the clients served are children.  This matters to me!  I also volunteer at the clothing closet, where gently used clothing are distributed -  those in need can come choose whatever they need. MOM is a very well run organization - they have many volunteers who enjoy giving their time and create a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  what could be more important than food and clothing?    Both the volunteers and the clients feel valued by the staff, and each year more pounds of food and clothing are distributed to those in need.  The URL says it all www.momhelps.org
Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	259637	1	/users/profile/348152	janmiddleton	Volunteer	5	09/25/2015	I believe you can tell the health of an organization by how easily they attract volunteers, how effectively they use them, and how happy the volunteers are and the reviews of the customers for the non-profit with their services.   Middleton Outreach Ministry excels on all of these dimensions.   They are an effective organization offering food, clothing and shelter to those in need and homeless.   They have many volunteers and people enjoy working there.   Their time is well used, and volunteers feel valued.   I have worked in the clothing closet where you sort clothing that is donated and hang the good pieces out.   Clients may choose what they need.   All clients are greeted with warmth and care -  and appreciate the clothing.   The women who staff this area are retired retail managers, so they have created a wonderful "shopping experience" for those in need.I also work on the Holiday Art Fair, where the event not only supports those in need but gives a way for local artists to contribute to the community.   Middleton Outreach Ministry is an excellent example of a non-profit that has real outcomes and a vibrant volunteer community and has distributed million lbs of food last year.

When you serve as a food pantry volunteer you see first hand the needs of the community and always come from the experience grateful for the blessings you have personally.  The Snowman Shoppe is also another venue offered pantry clients which allows the individual to select gifts for his/her family members...and brings many smiles to faces of recipients.
Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	261486	1	/users/profile/350101	Jim_149	Client Served	5	10/04/2015	I have worn several hats in my history with the Middleton Outreach Ministry.  As a member of the Middleton Common Council, I was amazed at the involvement of MOM in the community.  They were of critical assistance to many constituents since I represented a district with a great deal of multi unit housing.  They could always be counted on to follow up with addressing the needs of people referred to them.  Perhaps my most important hat was as someone who needed their services when I lost my job at the State Capitol and saw my income drop drastically.  They provided renters assistance and that made a real difference in paying my rent.  I do need to give a special shout out to MOM's Laurie Horton who made an exceptional effort to help me during these trying times.  I learned first hand of the value of their amazing service.  Finally, my third hat is now as a member of an organization that works hand in hand with MOM to provide food and other assistance for those in need.  Our Middleton Action Team holds numerous food drives on MOM's behalf and we also hold a monthly food distribution at the Voss Haus, an apartment complex serving people with low incomes and disabilities. I can't say enough about the positive way that MOM is changing lives for the better in the Middleton area.  They represent the best in us all.
Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	261202	1	/users/profile/349795	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	I recently took a tour of the Food Pantry and Clothing Closet at MOM. I was really impressed with how organized everything was. It was obvious that a  lot of work and care went into both of them. The Food Pantry was organized like a grocery store with large coolers for refrigerated items and volunteers were unloading fresh produce. The Clothing Closet was organized like a retail clothing store with racks labeled by size and even a rack for seasonal Halloween items. The next time I donate food or clothing, I will be bringing it to MOM.

The program is extremely well organized, and providing something meaningful for families who need a little extra help during the holidays is part of the true spirit of the holiday season. In fact, we now give to families in the names of our family members as a "gift" to our family members, and they, too, say it has been one of the most meaningful gifts they've received. I highly recommend this program, in addition to the amazing work MOM does to help people on the west side of Madison, Middleton, and Cross Plains.

I'm amazed at what they're able to accomplish with the resources they have, and they never seem to let their volunteers go unrecognized (even at the expense of the staff getting recognition themselves for the unparalleled work they do).

Their dedication is unmatched in charity organizations and their comradeship makes for an enjoyable time for volunteers and clients.  Food and clothing is sorted efficiently and stocked quickly.  The staff in the front office are free to run the organization as it was meant to be run.  The extra services provided for clients is unmatched in the greater Madison/Middleton areas.

Middleton Outreach Ministry, Inc.	259416	1	/users/profile/347943	Shirley N.	Volunteer	5	09/24/2015	There are many worthy Nonprofit organizations doing great things.  M.O.M. is a standout to me for several reasons.  1.  The staff is innovative and works to bring dignity to the experience of those utilizing services and have made it unified by offering food, clothing and housing assistance in one place.  In addition, interesting and unique fundraisers brings community together, giving emotional support to all.2.  As a new volunteer, I am impressed with the sincere dedication of veteran volunteers, many who are devoting their retirement to the mission of M.O.M.  It gives me incentive and drive to participate.3.  My experience particularly stocking the food pantry and in the community teaching garden has shown me that M.O.M. leadership, both staff and volunteer, is interested in building programs that provide individuals with skills that will empower them to independence, while bringing quality, dignified experiences.  The food pantry operates similarly to a grocery store, replicating real life food experiences.  There are tastings and fresh produce gleaned by many former UW Madision agronomists and Ag researchers who know high nutritious produce picked often from farm to pantry within hours.  I helped glean some apples and pears that were directly placed in the pantry for pantry participants to have that very day.  It doesn't get much fresher or higher in nutrition than that!!  What a great program!!!

They moved swiftly and efficiently to provide that food to families in need.  I was impressed with their compassion and for their ability to ensure that food was given to people who needed it.   It would be hard to imagine this organization wasting money or goods, their volunteer staff are effective community service individuals.

They are honest, and adopting an equine from them is straightforward and safe.  You will also have ongoing support if and when (more likely when) you need it, not only from Karen and Scott themselves, but from the many people that frequent their rescue's online forum.  I have adopted from them, as have a few of my friends, and I can't say anything negative about MHWF.  I've also met a lot of great people through this organization.

The experience I have had with this program is exceptional!  Scott and Karen are very, very knowledgeable and work very hard to pair the right adopter with the right horse.   The horses coming into the program vary, as do the reasons. The horses range from healthy and sound, older, younger, and in some cases in need of rescue.  The program has taken on some extreme rescue cases and have done amazing work with horses in need.  I am honored to have four adoption horses from this program and if I were to consider additional horses in  the future, I would most certainly adopt from MHWF!

However, this is not your ordinary fill out the paperwork and your off kinda foundation. This is more than that. This is where you gain friendships and Karen, Scott, and Their Furbabies become part of your family. Along with all of the love and support you gain from fellow adopters. My husband and I have adopted with MHWF a couple of times and they have been their for us, every step of the way. From the initial inquiry of a hooved baby to the hooved babies last breath on earth. Karen and Scott are living the hooved babies journey right along with you. They are never afraid to lend a hand and have given everything they have to take in as many hooved babies as they can. Giving each and everyone of the babies a fighting chance. I cannot express in a few words as to how MHWF has helped my family grow and taught us the true values of love, happiness, trial and triumph, as well as the true meaning of friendship. Thank you MHWF for all you have done and continue to do. Hugs n Love  ~ The Unser's

After fencing open acreage and building a horse barn, we researched several equine rescue and adoption programs.  We were very impressed with what we learned about MWHF and visited their exceptional facility in Wisconsin before eventually applying to adopt horses through their program.  As an adopter of 3 horses from MWHF, the concern and professionalism shown by MWHF to these needy animals is undeniable.  It is very apparent in their excellent facility,  their dedicated personnel and their comprehensive program requirements that demonstrate  their commitment to the wellbeing and protection of all the animals they serve.  
Midwest Horse Welfare Foundation Inc	318000	2	/users/profile/409139	LifesHazards	Client Served	5	11/01/2016	I cannot say enough good things about this organization. MHWF is such a great group of individuals that do what is in the best interest of horse and adopter. I adopted my horse from them over 6 years ago and they fielded every annoying terrified phone call I sent their way (first time horse owner here). They lend their expertise and support with each adoption and come up with unique fundraisers to benefit their rescue. The horses they get are all test ridden or worked through whatever issues the might come in with so their future homes are set up for success. Should a home not work out, they take back their horses in a heartbeat. This organization is a great rescue. They don't pull from auction houses and feed into the slaughter pipeline. They rescue the horses that need it in their very community or if people want to donate their horse to have them find a great home. No thousands of dollars adoption fees like you see with some "rescue" organizations either. These people are in it for the horses and everything they do reflect that.

Scott and Karen do a terrific job of getting to know the horses they take in and matching them with the right adopter.  In addition, they get involved with rescuing horses in such a way that they can actually handle the situation, not taking on more than the facility can support.  The stories of horses that have been rehabilitated here are nothing short of amazing.I have had friends donate their horses and those horses found wonderful homes through this program.  Knowing that the welfare of those horses is followed for five years gives a donor great peace of mind.The care in follow up, the access they continue to provide to adopters for advice and input is wonderful as well.I have adopted and facilitated the adoption of a number of horses and in one case where the adoption didn't work out, they were right there to take the horse back in even helping to find transportation.  Its all about the horses and matches for Karen and Scott.  I can't think of a better way to use the dollars I want to spend improving  the lives of horses.

Their services include not only adoption of donated horses but also assistance with neglect and abuse cases . They have taken in horses in such poor shape that even the vet didn't think they would survive ( see Faith's story ). They have a separate peaceful pasture for old neglected horses to spend the rest of their days with kindness , good nutrition , fresh water - all the things these horses were missing over the years prior to coming to MHWF .

The condition of some of the beautiful animals they take in is just appalling, but with the love and care they get, in a relatively short period of time you would not know it is the same horse.

Not only have I adopted my mare, but I also have donated another mare, and I spend most of my free time volunteering and fundraising for them.

MHWF isn't just an organization to me, It has be come my extended family.  They do wonderful things and take great care of the equines in the program. They care deeply about the horses, adopters, donors, and volunteers and that's what makes this organization possible. 
Midwest Horse Welfare Foundation Inc	199335	3	/users/profile/260242	AriaDiva	Client Served	5	04/30/2014	I have been involved with this organization in many facets.  I am an adopter, donor, & volunteer.  I first was an adopter in 2011.  They were very open and honest about the mare that I was interested in, her strong will and quirks.  She wasn't exactly what I had told them I was looking for and they made sure I understood that before adopting her.  It has turned out wonderfully and was very grateful they were honest with me, instead of just trying to push the horse out the door.  I love the horse I adopted and because of that, have volunteered for them on a regular basis even though I live 2 hours away.  Through helping with fundraisers and volunteering on the farm, I have gotten to know the directors very well.   They are EXTREMELY knowledgable, give the horses all the care they need, and are selective and honest when approving homes for their horses.  I have since adopted a 2nd horse who had some soundness issues that they were completely forthcoming about, and because of their amazing adoption policy, donated one of my personal horses in order to guarantee his protection as well after changes to my financial situation.  When the time comes again that I will be able to afford another horse, the horse will come from MHWF.   Any time I have questions, even unrelated to my adoptions horses, they take the time to offer their guidance and experience.  They never make me feel ashamed, embarrassed, or ignorant when I ask questions.  I have worked with the organization now for 3 years and I have only ever seen them do what is in the best interest of the horses.  MHWF has given so much more to me than I will ever be able to repay.  So I will continue to support them in any way that I can to express my appreciation for everything they have done for me.  They do things they don't have to, and are happy to do it.

They also are quite picky (to the best of their ability) in matching horses with the correct people.  Some horses represent more of a challenge then others and they simply try to make a match that is best for person and horse.  MHWF always gives a very honest assessment of each horse and keeps that info up to date on a daily basis should anything change (training, personality, experience, health, etc.)  Horses are expensive to care for (vet fees, hoof care, meds, hay, grain and facilities to name just a few) I am surprised that MHWF can provide such great care to so many horses on such limited donations and fund raising. MHWF have to turn down many applications (which have to be completed in writing) as some people just don't have the training or facilities necessary for horses (of any disposition)  They simply will not adopt a horse to "horse ignorant" people which sometimes makes those people angry.  Just because this is an adoption service does not mean they will simply let a horse out of their care to such people, if only people that sold horses for profit were so honest!

Each horse in their care has it's own personal thread on their discussion forum with updates and new photos besides it's profile on the adoption page.

Eagle River Historical Society Inc	197993	1	/users/profile/219796	Historyworker	Board Member	5	04/16/2014	The Eagle River Historical Society is poised to open a new, and second, museum in this small community of 1500 people.  That alone is an accomplishment, but when the time frame from conception to completion is only a year, it becomes that much more so.  As a small organization with limited resources building occurred in phases, as funding became available.  The support of the community has been the mainstay of this effort.  Almost every contractor involved, from designer to floor installer, has donated labor and/or materials, some the entire amount of the estimate.   As each phase commenced someone came forward and offered help or funding.  Some volunteers were so committed that they were on site every working day.  The Society should be very proud to have attracted such devoted and passionate support. This is an organization that has evolved from a few store front displays to one with two museums and a variety of programs under way.  Even as this building nears completion there is discussion of moving other historic buildings to the site and considering future physical development.  It is a prime example of what commitment and perseverance can accomplish. 
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	165347	1	/users/profile/219796	Historyworker	Board Member	5	08/19/2013	After over two years of fund raising the Eagle River Historical Society took a big step and purchased a site to renovate for a new, and primary, museum.  The Society will retain a smaller museum as a specialized railroad and commercial display site.  In only eight months most of an additional $150,000 renovation budget has been funded through donations, gifts in kind, volunteer labor, grants and pledges.The enthusiasm and dedication of a relatively small organization has propelled this project through many challenges to near completion.  It is a model of what can be accomplished with will, hard work and determination.  Soon the small town of Eagle River, Wisconsin, will have a new, high quality museum to showcase its history.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	277821	1	/users/profile/367655	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/23/2016	We had the opportunity to visit both museum sites, Railroad Depot and the Historical Museum, over the summer with visiting family.  Our group had varied ages and interests.  There was something for everyone to enjoy!  It is great to see history being preserved.  Definitely a "Jewel" in the Northwoods!  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	254155	1	/users/profile/342465	eaglelighting	Donor	5	08/27/2015	Eagle Lighting Inc in Eagle River, WI, was asked for advice in lighting the new historical museum. The museum needed general lighting and display lighting for their exhibits. We were able to donate some large fluorescent lights used for the general lighting area. We supplied the display lighting for the exhibits and installed all LED bulbs.The museum is now energy efficient saving 2/3 the energy cost from last years expenditure!  We are fortunate to have this museum in our small community to preserve history and educate our school children with tours.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	253153		/users/profile/341324	nstott	Volunteer	5	08/17/2015	I am relatively new to the Eagle River area and have enjoyed becoming involved as a volunteer for the Eagle River Historical Society. I have been impressed with how well-run the Society is and what they have accomplished in recent years. The purchase, renovation, and opening of their beautiful second location over a short period of time and the fact that they carry no debt on the extensive renovations shows how well-run the organization is and how important it is to the community. Volunteers, community members, and local businesses all demonstrated their belief in the importance of the Historical Society by pitching in with the renovation. Eagle River Historical Society's mission of preserving the rich history of Eagle River is an important one. The volunteers are constantly striving to improve its internal methods of operation (such as cataloging historic items) and its external community relationships (such as its involvement with the local schools) so that residents and visitors to Eagle River can  enjoy learning about Eagle River's history. Visitors to the museums are often adults who spent time in Eagle River as children and they are fascinated to learn more about the history of the area and where they stayed and the activities they enjoyed.   I am happy I chose to donate my time to the Eagle River Historical Society and enjoy working with its hard-working, competent, and fun volunteers.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	253026		/users/profile/341175	IkeD	General Member of the Public	5	08/15/2015	These guys have definitely been an awesome part of the local community. Great people, helpful, always willing to give a hand. They're set up programs for the local schools, they're putting programs together to save people's items, they're looking to bring more and more tourism into Eagle River... Overall a great part of Eagle River. They're developing a great way to learn about the area and the heritage of Eagle River. Kudos.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	253006		/users/profile/341152	ERMember	Board Member	5	08/15/2015	The second museum of the Eagle River Historical Society has now been open for two full seasons.  In that time several goals have been achieved:  programs developed with the local school district, new, professional level, policies and procedures in place, a full collections management policy established and a plan for strategic planning and board restructuring created.  In the same time frame a second successful benefit was held at a historic estate, combining the Society's mission with fund raising.   The Society has addressed a need for highly qualified volunteers through an annual volunteer job fair, organized by the Society and including 10 other area non profits.  It's financial position is stable, allowing for a 60% reduction in the remaining debt on its new campus. I am proud of colleagues who have raised the professional operating standards of the Society to match the impressive museum they created.  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	198110	2	/users/profile/258793	Ken Stallman	Volunteer	5	04/16/2014	This review is  based upon being involved with the Eagle River Historical Society for four years.  During that time I have donated $500 plus to the organization and contributed about  200 hours of my time to working on the rehab of the new Historical Society building.    Here's why I decided to focus my efforts on this organization: *  The mission of the Society is well thought out--tell the 150 year story of the Eagle River area to the tens of thousands of tourists and summer residents who visit the Northwoods each year and to the students attending Northland Pines schools.*  All of the Directors of the Society contribute their own money to the organization or are instrumental  in raising funds.  They have made a personal commitment to the success of the organization.*  The Society's funds are carefully managed.   Budgets are used to monitor revenue and expenditures.  Financial statements are prepared monthly and distributed to all Directors for their review.    Expenditures over certain amounts require approval by the Board before a commitment to spend the money is made. Over the last twenty years I have been involved with some twenty non profits in Houston as Chairperson, President, Treasurer, or volunteer.  Non demonstrated a stronger commitment to their mission, had more grass roots support or tenacity than the Eagle Historical Society.  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	185505	1	/users/profile/242480	gotya	Donor	4	10/30/2013	Our family has been fortunate to have lived here for over 35 years, and during that time frame we have observed this group constantly expand their horizons from a small exhibit in a local shopping mall, to where they are presently involved in renovating an historic early era young adult summer camp building to house many artifacts related to the development of this community. It is great that local residents, and visitors, will be able to visualize the growth from the early logging industry, through the farming period, and its present destination for the many visitors who now come here to enjoy our great natural beauty and the "Largest Number of Interconnected Fresh Water Lakes in the World". In addition to this new facility, the Historical Society will continue to maintain its present old Railroad Station location in downtown Eagle River that will concentrate on how the railroad helped in the development of this area. We owe a great of gratitude to this group for its dedication to this project.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	182001	1	/users/profile/238756	alicekramer17	Volunteer	4	10/24/2013	I was born and raised in Eagle River and like many, have 'come back home'.  My grandfather was a blacksmith in the late 1990's and my children & grandkids call ER their second home.  Our family was recently able to be of some assistance to the Society in relocating to its current building.  The building had originally been part of Camp Tecumseh on Catfish Lake and was bought and donated to the Knights of Columbus by my father, Harry Pride and Francis Sailer.  The Historical Society appreciated its local historical connections and is now making it their permanent museum home.  My husband and I are proud to support the Society's leadership and were very impressed with the recent fundraiser at a local historical home.  We've joined the hardworking team of volunteers and welcome this opportunity to help inspire present generations and preserve the history of the area for generations to come.  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	177958	1	/users/profile/234560	Zara49	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2013	My husband and I are recently retired and new to this community.  We are so pleased to find several viable and exciting organizations with which we have become involved.   We're impressed by the enthusiasm and knowledge that the folks of the Eagle River Historical Society display.  The fun is that some of the group can claim generations of family members in Eagle River and surrounding areas.  The sharing of photos, stories, and local lore is a joy to experience.  We attended a dinner for the area library last night where the guest speakers, from the Historical Society, presented a slide show with narration of early settlers, buildings, facts, people, Native Americans, loggers, and legends.  It was well received.  It also generated more interest in the ERHS amongst those present.  We are so happy to support this fine and dedicated group of  local history buffs!

The members are devoted, talented, and consistently involved in their mission.As a native of this area, I appreciate their service and dedication to their mission.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	176566	1	/users/profile/232989	marlynber	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	I was able to help the ERHS by taking part in the bi-annual Cemetery Walk, and acting as one of the Eagle River professionals of an earlier era gave me touch of the Eagle River history I am coming to value.  Seeing the ERHS continue its mission by expanding to two sites, after having moved from the Trees for Tomorrow site, demonstrates, for me, what a dynamic group of people can do to capture the imaginations of those who value history.  I look forward to the opening of the new site on Highway 45S and the uncrating of all that must be stored presently.  I look forward, also, to seeing students pour over the exhibits and the artifacts, searching for a context that includes either their  families or people about whom they have heard while studying Wisconsin history or the history of Vilas County.  ERHS is invigorating the history of the area (witness the Sunset Point summer evening event) and awakening many to the treasures around us.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	176550	1	/users/profile/232972	GayleD	General Member of the Public	5	10/10/2013	As the Curriculum Director of the area school district, the ERHS has become a vital participant of our school.  They have offered curriculum assistance, program offerings, partnerships with our students and teachers, in class instruction and field trips to their museum.  Their dedication to teaching the youngsters from and visitors of the the area has been awesome to observe and become involved with.  Our school district appreciates their efforts and contributions to our community. 
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	172433	1	/users/profile/228334	histbuff	Board Member	5	09/30/2013	My family includes early settlers of Eagle River, so I am well aware of the rich history of the area and the importance of keeping their hard work and vision of what it could be, along with what they accomplished alive and well for others to learn from.  The present society group is a small, but determined group, who is doing an outstanding job of pressing forward to provide a venue to preserve, showcase, and teach coming generations how respect for the land and its resources brought us to where we are and can continue to do so for years to come.  I am very proud to be a part of this project.  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	168828	1	/users/profile/223800	Cityboy	Board Member	5	09/10/2013	The Eagle River Historical Society has become a vibrant, exciting organization in the last few years.  The Society is pulling together and is working hard to complete renovations to its new museum building. Through long hours of hard work by many volunteers and businesses, the building is shaping up nicely; hopefully to open Memorial Day weekend, 2014.The Society has become pro-active within the community and is always seeking news ways to contribute to the community. From being a stopping place for history buffs in its beginning, the Society has grown into a community asset; saving Eagle River's past and preserving today for the future generations.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	168517	1	/users/profile/223442	jimineagleriver	Donor	5	09/09/2013	I was born and raised in Eagle River and, over the decades, have both observed and participated in various efforts to preserve and showcase our community's rich history.  These efforts were mostly conducted informally by a small group of older community residents who (bless their hearts) worked very hard with limited resources to establish Eagle River's first historical museum and to sustain the Historical Society. Fortunately, in recent years, growing interest in Eagle River's history by a group of younger retirees along with many Eagle River natives who have moved "back home" after professional careers around the country has resulted in a boost to the ranks of Historical Society membership and a new pool of energetic and focused volunteers who view a new museum as their next professional challenge. Naturally, this dynamic has resulted in taking the Historical Society to the "next level", including regularly scheduled and disciplined Board meetings, fundraising by experienced volunteers, construction planning by those with a building background, and membership development by those who've spent careers in the field. Everybody likes to be associated with, and contribute to, a winner.  The Eagle River Historical Society has evolved into a big winner and I'm both proud of their accomplishments...and waiting for the next fundraising call with my checkbook handy.
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	166943	1	/users/profile/221795	DBVIS	Advisor	5	09/04/2013	It has been both a pleasure and a reward to have the opportunity to work with such a dedicated and knowledgeable board in the creation of their new museum space.  Their diligence in organizing, promoting volunteers and setting goals is sure to lead to success.  Continued assistance and fundraising is a must but I am confident that their new space will make everyone proud to be associated.  
Eagle River Historical Society Inc	166886	1	/users/profile/221735	ktgsmokey	Donor	4	09/04/2013	The ERHS has been transitioning from a lesser known entity into a civic/cultural institution with presence in the community and the potential to increase its awareness among visitors and tourists who come to the Eagle River area year round from surrounding major cities and states. Its recent fundraiser which showcased a historic estate demonstrated the Society's ability to match its fiscal endeavors with its core mission which many non-profits fail to achieve.  By doing so, the Society raised its awareness and appreciation within the community and its outreach to many others.  One out-of-town attendee remarked that the ERHS recent event was "The best charitable contribution we have made...ever!"  That statement is evidence that the Society's leadership has achieved the crucial objective of engaging and endearing rather than merely soliciting donations.

As a past mentor, I had an opportunity to work firsthand with students and it gave me a sense of purpose. I was recently asked to come back on career day to speak to some of the children and I was moved by their questions, intellect, and level of respect for me as I gave my presentation. I'm certain the students appreciate Ms. Marmolejo and the rest of the staff just as much as I do, if not more. NBAP is great for the community.

Kids with Down syndrome are a blessing from God!! I wouldn't want this lady as a program director or around children.  Also do you know she posts pics of the children on her Personal Pages!!! I wouldn't allow that. You might want to check if the parents gave consent to post on her personal pages because that could lead to a lawsuit.

We have since become moved to help CSR by volunteering to help transport incoming dogs, and have gotten an inside glimpse into the dedication that they have to helping dogs in need.

I've had experience doing some fostering for CSR, as well as transports and dog food pickup! I've spoken to many people who have adopted their dog from CSR and it's always been a positive experience. Jan's adoration for the cocker breed is second to none and she and her volunteers go to great lengths to care for these dogs.
Cocker Spaniel Resources Inc	296244	1	/users/profile/387014	tobysmom	Client Served	5	07/13/2016	We had just lost our lab mix and we were heartbroken.  I scanned the classifieds to fill the void and stumbled upon CSR.  They had a very cute brown and white cocker named Toby.  Yep he had and has his issues but we Love Him.  They were very fastidious about finding a home for him that would become a forever home as he had been in 8 others already!  We had been through the adoption process for our son and were amazed at having a "home visit" for a dog!  I can totally appreciate the screening process and apparently it works, they have so much success with not only the young dogs but also the seniors.  Where would these poor dogs be without them?  They use their own dollars to train those that have behavior issues and help those with medical needs.  They truly are a wonder.
Cocker Spaniel Resources Inc	296242	1	/users/profile/387012	Julia68	Volunteer	5	07/13/2016	I don't even know where to begin to express my gratitude for Cocker Spaniel Resources.  It's because of their dedication to rescue, rehab, rehome and retire cockers that we have been blessed with our two amazing furbabies.  We're beyond grateful!!!!
Cocker Spaniel Resources Inc	292140	1	/users/profile/382628	Susan463	Client Served	5	06/05/2016	Cocker Spaniel Resources will have my utmost appreciation and support for the rest of my days.  There just aren't enough words to express what this wonderful organization has brought to my life.  I hope I can do them justice with my review.  When I lost my first cocker I knew I needed to find another special soul to bring me the same joy and I wanted to adopt through a rescue organization.   I looked on Petfinder and found "Blessing" at CSR, Inc.  He certainly was a blessing for me.  They were great working with me to make this beautiful boy my own.  His foster mom. Cyndie,  even offered me a place to stay for the night in her home so that we wouldn't have the expense of a motel.  They have been there every step of the way.  Their care and concern doesn't stop with the adoption.  Jan helped me navigate the way when ear surgery became necessary in Minneapolis, six hours from our home.   She was a terrific shoulder to lean on during that time, just a phone call away . You become a part of their wonderful family of adopters, fosters and volunteers with a host of activities through the year to keep in touch with your "new family."   Their Facebook page is such an uplifting place of support, suggestions, and ideas with many new postings each day.  I have recently lost my "Blessing", n/k/a Huffy.  I am heartsick, but have already been in touch with Jan about adopting one of their golden retirement cockers.  It keeps me going knowing I can give another cocker a chance for a wonderful life they have most likely never known. The level of caring and dedication shown by this organization makes it an honor to be associated with them.  I sing their praises every chance I get.  They have become such a welcome addition to my life.
Cocker Spaniel Resources Inc	289199	1	/users/profile/148422	jan_7	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	Awesome little rescue organization working in MN, WI, IA.  Not only do they re-home  younger dogs, cockers and cocker mixes, they also have a great Golden Age Retirement program for senior cockers.  I've adopted 2 sweet seniors from CSR in the past year, ages 9 and 10.  Dogs and potential adoptive homes are both well vetted to provide for the best possible match of dog and family.  Medical and/or behavior issues of dogs are addressed when needed and prior to placement.  CSR work doesn't happen without the help of many amazing volunteers who foster, transport, assist with adoption/fundraising events, and admin tasks; and CSR always gratefully acknowledges their volunteers for their help.  Please support Cocker Spaniel Resources and consider them when looking to adopt a rescue dog.

Cocker Spaniel Resources Inc	288665	1	/users/profile/378862	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	I love cockers.  I already had 2 dogs, but when I read a post from CSR that a young cocker was about to be put down because of aggression and health issues, I volunteered to foster him.   It was true; he was aggressive, not house-broken, and he did have what turned out to be minor health problems.  Still, he was also very sweet, and I fell in love with this boy and knew I was going to keep him.  However, I needed help in getting the aggression under control.  CSR put me in touch with their professional trainer, who took my boy for a couple of weeks and worked with him extensively.  When I got him back, he knew commands, and she gave me instructions on how to work with him.  Since then, we've seen no aggression, and when he gets spun up, we know how to bring him back down.  He's also getting better on the housebreaking front.  He's definitely a keeper and I'm so glad we found him!   CSR and Sarah Garfunkel (our trainer) are the best!

I have to say that this group is exceptional in providing support for all who have adopted from Cocker Spaniel Resources, Inc. They help if we need someone to watch our dogs in an emergency.  The staff and volunteers are a compassionate group of people dedicated to the care and well being of these animals.

They offer emergency and extended foster services to people who want to keep their dogs while the owners are in a transitional stage of their lives i.e. an extended hospital stay, moving to a new home or an apartment, leaving the country for an extended period of time.Jan

We watched their growth in alleviating poverty in Nicaragua through theirmicrofinance program  to small businesses and low-income farmers.  We are very happythat the lending has spread to so many other impoverished countries in Central America.We feel it is a program that works, brings hope and provides resources to the working poor.

Working Capital for Community Needs, Inc.	265138	1	/users/profile/353888	Writer	Donor	5	10/19/2015	While microfinance might be trendy and groups come and go, WCCN has been helping women, farmers and entrepreneurs for 30 years in some of the toughest and poorest areas of Central and South America.   WCCN gets measurable results by working with  established in-country partners who can navigate tough local economies and even tricky local politics.  What separates WCCN from other groups is a commitment to showing off their work by taking real investors into the field to hear directly from real borrowers.  The first person stories and connections made on those trips solidify and expand the investor network back in the states and help WCCN to reach more borrowers in more places.   I have proudly donated to WCCN through a  workplace giving campaign for  5 years. 
Working Capital for Community Needs, Inc.	264672		/users/profile/353395	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2015	WCCN is a great place for those who want to get started in impacting investing to help to make a better world and, in particular, to improve the life of the poor in Central America.  Central America is one of the poorest regions in the western hemisphere so the impact of your dollars is great.  WCCN has a long history through which it has refined its practices to make loans to its "partners" (usually microfinance institutions) who then lend to very poor borrowers.  While that does not eliminate risk, it provides a lot of comfort.  My wife and I have invested through WCCN since 2009.

Since that time, I have been a microfinance lender and donor through WCCN.  I have been consistently impressed by this group's dedication and passion to sustainable, help-others-to-help- themselves solutions.   WCCN does great work supporting organic fair trade coffee cooperatives, building sustainable housing and agriculture, and otherwise helping the working poor of Central and South America build better lives in a manner that is good for the planet and dignified for the people being helped.  The people who work and volunteer for this group live modestly in order to focus their efforts on helping these groups.  They are truly helping to make the world a better place.  I'm proud to support this organization every year.
Working Capital for Community Needs, Inc.	258273		/users/profile/346758	Asano F.	Donor	5	09/18/2015	WCCN is  doing a great job of allowing the people of Central and Latin America to make a dignified and decent living in their home countries.   On a study tour sponsored by WCCN I  met a number of  individuals and cooperatives that receive the loans from WCCN  in Nicaragua. My favorite group receiving a loan was La FEM (Fundacion Entre Mujers). This  group of women use their loan money to buy land in the women's names and grow organic coffee. We got to see how they make organic compost with worms.  Not only do these women farm but they educate themselves in women's health care and fight abuse of women in their country.I have been donating money to this organization for years and recently I became an investor. Now not only am I helping to provide a way for the peoples of Central and Latin America to make a living but I also make a small interest when they pay back their loans.

Since then, I have continued my involvement as a committee member, board member, and donor. I strongly believe in the power of microfinance to empower the world's working poor. However, even more impressive to me is the way that WCCN has remained a steady presence and trusted partner in the world of microfinance for more than 20 years. While microfinance has come and gone as an investment darling, WCCN has been there for our partners helping them benefit from good times and weather bad. They provide a lot of technical assistance as well as financing, allowing organizations to continue to grow and maximize their potential. 
Working Capital for Community Needs, Inc.	252613	1	/users/profile/340705	NickV	Board Member	5	08/11/2015	I started my career in finance as a intern at WCCN.  I got to witness firsthand the remarkable impact the Organization has on the working poor in Central America.  I traveled with WCCN to record the stories of the borrowers in Nicaragua.  I heard testimonial from borrower after borrower about how loans provided by WCCN dramatically improved the quality of their lives by allowing them to start small businesses or improve their housing.   I highly recommend investing with WCCN and traveling to Central America on one of their study tours.  I promise the experience will change your life for the better.

The loans are repaid and people are empowered to build and assist their families and communities. I am proud to have invested in WCCN and to see the important work being done by a great group of extraordinary people, at both the giving and receiving ends of WCCN's work. Sally Stix

Rather than solely providing charity, the organization empowers people to take ownership of their own future and shape the direction of their business. Further, WCCN prioritizes underserved populations, particularly women and indigenous business owners. Their work results in very effective poverty eradication.

The assistance offered is based on specific financial and social metrics that ensure both a real impact in the lives of the individuals and communities served as well a secure and meaningful return to its investors.  I am so impressed by the successes that WCCN has achieved over the past 30 years that I have dedicated my time to the Board of Directors since 2013.   I have both lived and volunteered in Latin America (serving the 'working poor' through Peace Corps service) and I can solidly endorse WCCNs efforts and mission to be truly meaningful, relevant and successful.

It's a unique people to people  organization which began as a  sister state relationship between Wisconsin and Nicaragua.  It's small lending relationship with CEPAD, the Nicaraguan (protestant) Council of Churches has grown into a much larger CDFI (community development financial institution)  with 26 partner lending NGOs in 6 Central and South American countries.  WCCN has safely lent over $98 million for microfinance and high social impact ventures, our current portfolio totaling over $12 million, $10 million of which is borrowed money from impact investors.  It remains a solidarity organization with the people of Nicaragua and 5 other countries.

The WCCN team puts in an incredible amount of time and energy into studying the organizations they make loans to, and only give money to ones with great social metrics and values. I am proud to be a part of WCCN. It is easy for any one to be involved in this organization as they take retail investments.

As an intern in the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to personally promote WCCN's mission across numerous social media platforms. Being able to share stories of economically prosperous entrepreneurs and farmers from some of the poorest communities in Latin America was the most rewarding experience I have had while working. WCCN gives hard-working people the financial resources and technical assistance they need to achieve a better life not only for themselves, but also for their families. I urge you to support WCCN and further promote its mission with the hope of improving just one more life through microfinance. 
Working Capital for Community Needs, Inc.	205162		/users/profile/267265	Tom_63	Board Member	5	07/04/2014	I am incredibly impressed with the mission of WCCN and honored to be recently added to the organization's Board of Directors.  WCCN has been empowering people in Latin America to help themselves for 30 years, but that's just the beginning.  There is a new energy in the organization that is leading to bigger and better things in the future.  Microfinance loan support will continue to be a major part of the mission, but there will be increasing opportunities to help people in Latin America through other means, especially women.  WCCN is a great organization with strong leadership.  I strongly endorse this organization and encourage you to consider supporting it.

After selecting a child to sponsor at the House of Jesus' Children orphanage in which Health Ministries for Haiti is affliated, I felt an overwhelming need to meet this child.  I traveled to Haiti in January, 2010 with HMH and cannot describe what meeting this little girl meant to me.   We were in Haiti when the earthquake struck and I saw first hand the positive impact the medical team of Health Ministries for Haiti had on the injured victims of the earthquake.  Health Ministries for Haiti is dedicated to the gracious and resilient people of Haiti.  I have an unending passion for the children that live in the House of Jesus' Children orphanage and work as coordinator of the sponsorship program that HMH started.     
Health Ministries for Haiti Inc	131692		/users/profile/177267	Jenny Lujan	Donor	5	10/31/2012	I support the work of HMH because it addresses the root causes of poor health outcomes.  They work closely with the orphanage to participate in the children's educational and health care needs.  They also provide training for community health workers to learn preventive health education for sustainable and ongoing support.  While they travel to Haiti to assess needs, engage in clinic-based activities and develop plans with their Haitian partners, much of their efforts involve fund raising to provide financial assistance for basic needs: food, shelter, healthcare supplies.    I feel this model of service delivery can help to empower community members to identify how to best meet their own health care needs.

She is now a nurse and is able to further use and share her skills in ways that benefit so many. She has developed many close friends and deep bonds both here and in Haiti that will last a lifetime.

Jen has been very supportive, both finding potential funders for me and following up on the work I've done.

We continue to grow and implement new strategies to not only help the Haitian people but also to make sure that HMH will be around for the next generation.

HMH has been working in Haiti since 2006 and has impacted the lives of many individuals over the course of this time.  Not only does our organization work directly with community health workers to treat the people of Haiti, but we learn from them and adjust our work to what the current needs may be for the communities; be it food distribution, water purification, or medication refills. I have learned so much about the people of Haiti, their resilience, and their modest appreciation for all that we do for them.    The organization is well formulated to operate efficiently within the settings provided to us.   The exposure I have had with HMH and Haiti has even lead me to find a young boy there, whom I fell in love with and am currently adopting!

Volunteer	5	08/23/2012	Health Ministries for Haiti (HMH) is a nonprofit organization committed to making a difference by working closely with Haitians to attain the highest possible levels of physical and spiritual health.  HMH was my first medical mission experience.  This experience has had a profound impact on me and has taken over the way I think about and view things.  Among the many things I experience, I actively participated in delivering health care to Haitians, developed knowledge and respect for the Haitian culture, language, and health practices, and developed an awareness of the social, economic and political factors in health and disease in Haiti.  HMH is highly organized all the way from pre-trip planning to after the trip.  I was continuously informed of plans and felt part of the team who was making a difference.  I hope to make many more medical missions in the near future with this wonderful organization.

My health care skills were put to the test when we would daily go to different areas in Port Au Prince and create makeshift clinics for all Haitians and their families to attend. The Haitians would be lined up for hours, waiting for free treatment for their multiple medical conditions. HMH could not create such greatness if it were not for the generous and wonderful donors. I have been forever changed by my experience and plan to participate in and support the organization for many years. 
Health Ministries for Haiti Inc	121078		/users/profile/164750	OliviaPitchford	Volunteer	4	08/20/2012	Health Ministries for Haiti (HMH) is a wonderful organization devoted to providing Haitians much needed healthcare support. It takes hard work and dedication to offer voluntary services anywhere, much less outside the country. HMH is highly organized and takes a systematic approach to funding and operating their nonprofit organization in order to carry out the tasks at hand, including traveling to Haiti each year to monitor their efforts and to provide hands-on cares. I traveled with HMH last January to Port-au-Prince and the experience has truly changed my life. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of Haiti nor the beautiful people I encountered there. HMH has caused me to catch "a bug" of volunteering as an RN and to hopefully travel again outside the U.S. to provide healthcare services again in my lifetime. 
Health Ministries for Haiti Inc	121051		/users/profile/164712	Karen88	Donor	5	08/20/2012	I very much appreciate the work Health Ministries for Haiti, Inc. is doing in Haiti. I haven't had the opportunity to volunteer with HMH, but the stories they share of the work they're doing and the lives they're impacting makes me feel like part of the team. I appreciate the fact that HMH is a small non-profit and that my donations are being applied directly to the work they do in Haiti. This work is so important to giving the people of Haiti needed access to healthcare while also supporting a sustainable healthcare infrastructure.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	190106	1	/users/profile/37788	plantwhisperer	Professional with expertise in this field	4	12/07/2013	Having been involved with WO since 2002, I would recommend this group to anyone interested in wildlife, outdoors, plants and environment. Our local chapter invites speakers to share their vast knowledge in the fields of history, geology, plants, insects, amphibians and more as well as their personal and/or professional lives in the field of restoration, botany, propagation and our natural world. WO is an organization that invites all to attend meetings and become more involved in gardening, learning vast amounts of information on preservation and restoration of our environmental resources. WO is a strong and growing group of interested public, professionals and organizations that promote native plants for a healthier earth with a solid foundation of knowledgeable and committed people voluntarily running the entire group. Good group, good mission, great people!
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	37025	2	/users/profile/37788	plantwhisperer	Volunteer	5	04/26/2010	I started this chapter in 2003 as the Maumee Valley Chapter (now Oak Openings Chapter). I have much experience and knowledge about native ecosystems and native flora. I provide chapter members with free plants/seeds and invite everyone I know to attend meetings.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	144232	1	/users/profile/190746	Roger Miller	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I've been a Wild Ones member since 2004 and a board member of my local chapter in Minnesota since 2006. I've attended national events and meetings of the national board, as well as frequent local events and meetings. I am singularly impressed with the dedication of our national and local (volunteer) leaders, and with the staff at our national office. Here in Minnesota, Wild Ones has become the primary organizational advocate for landscaping with native plants. Monthly chapter presentations and field trips, and an annual day-long "Design With Nature Conference" have attracted widespread public interest and national speakers. Our efforts here in Minnesota are built on the support and encouragement of the national organization. I'm especially impressed with the quality of our national board of directors and their work in developing the organization and pursuing our mission. I'm pleased to be a regular donor as well as a member.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	101346	1	/users/profile/129363	bluets5	Donor	5	11/30/2011	I have been a naturalist/outdoor educator for over 26 years and have a interest in teaching people about the environmental, economic and aesthetic benefits of nautral landscaping. Discovering Wild Ones was one of the best partnerships I could have ever asked for! I started a chapter at my nature center and have represented them in many public forums. I like that Wild Ones is really an environmental advocacy group but shares the message of earth care through home and community landscaping practices. Wild Ones understands, honors and advocates for our native flora. They offer sound information and advice. The national office staff as well as volunteers involved with chapters are a wealth of knowledge and always willing to offer help. As Audubon is to birds, Wild Ones is to natural landscaping!

Inside it is a blue, six-page leaflet titled, Members Support Wild Ones Mission with Generous Gifts & Contributions."  On page 5, I am listed as a Wild Ones Lifetime member.  Remove my name.  As of 20 August 2011, I ceased to be a member of your odious organization and you have no right to state or indicate in any manner that I am. (Motion attached. Note the final sentence: "That Michelle Vanstrom be removed from the Board of Directors under Article IV, Section 10 and under Article IV, Section 2, only members may serve as a Director." Wild Ones is to issue a printed retraction and digital retraction (via the January/February 2012 issue of The Journal and the E-newsletter), sending both to the entire Wild Ones database.

Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	99994		/users/profile/121434	More Natives Plz	Volunteer	5	10/30/2011	Wild Ones is one of the very best of the ecological/green organizations, with a clear mission, good people (volunteers and staff alike), and a compelling message. I've belonged for about 10 years, and recently became an officer in our (newly-renovated) chapter, which has put me in touch with many of the national officers and staff.  Wow to each of them.  I look forward to working with this group for many, many years to come.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	99127	1	/users/profile/118568	greenest	Volunteer	1	10/08/2011	WildOnes is one of the worst organizations I have volunteered for, unfortunately.  The National office has de-chartered a local chapter out of fear of a lawsuit.  This local chapter, formerly the Niagara Falls River Chapter, was a growing and vibrant chapter and had contracted with a consulting company to create a written and simulated video presentation of what the Niagara River gorge might look like if restored to ecological diversity and a nature park -- seemingly a perfect project for WildOnes.  Granted, any tech-savvy teenager might have been able to create a simulated video like this, but we wanted a professional environmental consulting firm to put its stamp of quality on the WildOnes name.  However, the consulting company failed miserably, dragging its feet and not doing its work or following its own timeline.  The National office became upset with the local chapter because:  1) in direct response to our not paying the consulting company for work they were bound by contract to complete, but did not (their uncompleted work falls into two categories: a) work not completed at all, and, b) work unsatisfactorily performed), and 2) to our refusal to voluntarily turn over the remaining grant funds provided us by the a regional greenway  commission  to National.  Instead of National helping to pressure the consulting company to complete the work which they wrote in their own company contract, they de-chartered us and accused us of holding onto monies that were not ours.  Our bank accounts were then frozen by National and the design project was taken over by National. We note the following:1) We do not regard the funds in question to "belong" to either our Chapter nor to National. They were to be held in trust for those of this region to accomplish goals set forth in proposal and contract for which our local Chapter was made an intermediate steward.2) National Wild Ones, fearful of the "controversy" and consequences of the contractor not being paid, will quickly transfer the funds to the consultants regardless of the product produced.3) National is unqualified to determine whether or not the contract goals, in substance and spirit, have been met by the consulting company.4) National has indicated their lack of qualifications in this regard by attempting to pass off these responsibilities to two others (e.g., a greenway Commission and city government).  To our knowledge, both have declined to take on that responsibility.5) The consulting company has on-going contracts with the state and the city which compete with the goals of the ecological restoration of the river gorge and they did not disclose this until recently.  These appear to be conflicts of interest which National is acquiescing to. We are deeply disappointed in National's failure to support our Chapter re this matter, and its moving instead toward discrediting us with such language as "for actions unbecoming" and "insubordination" more fitting to a military tribunal than eliminating differences between those united in a common cause.  It is now over a year since the consulting company's own timeline said the project would be finished.  Since that time the state parks office has shared several of its own proposals for the river gorge rim.  The local WildOnes project was originally contracted to be completed before the ones from state parks, so that it could have aided in the environmentally-responsible vision that state parks should but doesn't have.  So, even though later this month (October 2011), the consulting company is finally going to share its so-called "completed" project, it is too late for state parks and the public to seriously consider it.  We -- as individuals, not as members of WildOnes anymore -- look forward to seeing the results of the project, but overall it is too little too late and the way WildOnes National has dealt with local volunteers has been a huge disappointment.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	98674		/users/profile/117222	stevewroselle	Board Member	5	09/30/2011	Wild Ones is uniquely positioned to lead the next phase of the environmental movement.  In the past we have focused on preserving grand spaces (Muir), understanding the connectednes (Leopold) and removing pollution.  Now we need to focus on the efficiency of these existing and limited lands in their ability to support ecosystems.  By focusing on adding native plants we are giving wildlife plantroots support in rebooting the food chain. In my own case I have been able to bring back a small ecosystem on less than an eighth of an acre in a subdivision of 500 cookie cutter homes.  Dragonflies, damselflies, toads and grasshoppers now make their home here  My isolated yard is also an island of biodiversity in the midst of a sea of mowed grass, hosting several bird species and dozens of migrating monarch butterflies every year.  Possums. owls, hawks and raccoons have visited as well. Where land has been degraded with invasive monoculture plant species we as an organization are removing these and replacing them with varied native species which nourish the land continuously by alternating their flowering stages.  We also educate many people about the greater ability of natives to sequester both carbon and water.  Selecting site appropriate native species allows us to mitigate flooding with rain gardens or to select drought tolerant species which reduce the draw of water in parched areas.  Whether arid or moist, our advocacy of native plants therefore knows no bounds. And of course, we are preserving the biodiversity of the seedbank through the sharing of our seeds.  In addition, our plant sales put these plants more widely into our communities. All these efforts of ours work to improve the efficiency of the land by connecting yards to neighboring natural areas and providing nourishing islands for visiting animals.  People are unaware that they too have a choice between providing for nature or not providing for nature on their own property.  We are the organization that can guide them with our educational and local and personal support.  There is no other organization that can accomplish this much.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	98648		/users/profile/117187	prairiesmoke	Volunteer	5	09/29/2011	I became passionate about landscaping with native plants almost 20 years ago.  At that time I lived in Illinois.  I looked around for an organization that believed, as I do, that saving and growing native plants was essential to health ecosystems.  It was then that I heard about Wild Ones.  I was not able to join Wild Ones in Illinois but found a chapter nearby in Kentucky.  I am membership chair of that chapter because I want to reach out to others who are seeking the type of education. call ot action and information that Wild Ones provides.  A recent series of articles explained how critical native plants were to the entire system - including the very soil that they grow in.  There is no other organization like Wild Ones and I am proud to be a member.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	98622		/users/profile/117153	m.rice	Board Member	5	09/29/2011	WILD ONES NATURAL LANDSCAPERS, LTD Wild Ones Natural Landscapers, Ltd. Is a 30+ year old national non-profit organization with the simple mission of providing advocacy and education on the important role native plants play in our environment.   For those who cherish the birds, butterflies, bees, other pollinators and the environment in general, native plants are a cornerstone in the natural world.  Plants, be they flowers, grasses, trees, shrubs, etc. that are non-native to our individual geographic communities cannot dependably provide and sustain the food and shelter needed by the natural world.  Want non-toxic air and water?  Then native plants are again the answer as they dont require broad and/or ongoing applications of herbicides, pesticides and other toxic chemicals. Wild Ones Natural Landscapers provides the hands-on, grass roots information for bringing native plants to your part of the country, whether it be your garden, yard, and/or other public and private sites in your community.  Many of our chapters throughout the US have established and maintained native plant demonstration gardens as examples of what can be done with native plantscaping.   Our work to bring youth into the native plant environmental movement is addressed through the Wild Ones Seeds For Education Grant program.  Through both national and local efforts, we organize and support community efforts to establish natural areas of learning.  This program reaches out to youth by annually awarding funds for educational projects using plants native to their individual communities. My personal experience:  on 911 (Sept. 11, 2011) we installed a native garden between our busy urban street and backyard fence.  It provided peace and sanity on a tragic day for this country.  Several years later we decided to go entirely native in our backyard with prairie, savanna and shade plants.  It grew lovelier each year as the plantings became more established.  Four years later we decided to downsize to a condominium so the house went on the market.  In spite of a very volatile real estate market our house sold within months to a couple who instantly fell in love with the backyard (we bought your backyard, not your house!).  Its now 4 years later and their favorite place to be is the backyard.  (Of course we miss it but have been invited to visit often!)  Your support of Wild Ones Natural Landscaping will help us move forward in our mission of achieving a cleaner, better, healthier and even more beautiful environmental world---and hopefully help other people achieve a wonderful and exciting native yard. M.

Additionally, I was privledged to meet and get to know Lorrie Otto, a great environmentslist and spiritual leader of Wild Ones for many years.  The concept of reaching out from our individual gardens to change the way our nation creates and manages to a more sustainable manner is vital to our success.

I joined to add to my knowledge of native plants, and to be a part of an organization whose core values reflect my own.  I am now on the Board of Directors, a partner at large from Tennessee.   Wild Ones has such a fount of knowledge about native plants all across the Unites States.  I have been so impressed by the articles in their monthly newsletter, that pertain to gardening with native plants.  I especially am inspired by the personal stories of gardeners who have transformed their yards to all native plants or have added native plants to their landscape.    I learn something new from each newsletter, about what other people and places are doing to change the ideas about what constitutes a yard, to encompass native plants and natural landscaping.   I have been personally motivated to add plants to feed wildlife,and to embrace plants that feed the insects that feed so many birds and other critters.

I started by attending a few local chapter meetings and learned about native plants. I planted a few natives and before I knew it, I was finding more and more places to put native plants in my yard. Then I got involved on the chapter board, eventually becoming chapter president. Then I became a national director. I am now in my second term as national president.Wild Ones has helped me learn a lot about why it is so important to return native plants back to the land.

This was and still is the go-to national organization to find out about native plants and the benefits of their use in landscaping.  The information they share via their website www.wildones.org and the information they are willing to share upon request 877-394-9453 is outstanding.  Thru  their Seeds for Education grant program, their bi-monthly Wild Ones Journal, their chapters and their website, they are able to simply, but emphatically explain the need to use native plants in landscaping, the need to save our pollinators, the need to help heal our earth through this simple, but enjoyable part of most everyone's everyday life.   It has been a great relationship for me since the day I found out about this grassroots organization.

The small hired staff are very committed. The widespread growth on chapters attests to the meaningful role it is playing in the ecological field.
Wild Ones -- Natural Landscapers Ltd	36995	1	/users/profile/37759	gardening-girl	Client Served	5	04/26/2010	I joined the Wild Ones organization about six years ago when I sought their help in establishing a Native Plant Garden on our College Campus.  The group was instrumental in the process: completing a site survey, recommending plants and selling the concept to administration.  Wild Ones also helped to identify plants to install near a creek edge that runs through campus. We started hosting their meetings at the campus and getting students interested.  We have had many fabulous speakers that addressed issues of invasive species, the beauty of native plants, environmental benefits of using native species, seed collection and propagation.  I have been so drawn to the mission of Wild Ones that I took on the leadership role last year as President of the Flint River Chapter and have recently been asked to serve on the membership committee. The work that Wild Ones is doing is invaluable to the future health of our planet.  A recent book that addresses this concept well is Douglas Tallamy's

I have learned a lot about the benefits of using native plants and the biodiversified world of which they are part since then.  Through my personal networking with Wild Ones members, the Wild Ones webpage and the Wild Ones Journal, I continue to be amazed by the ecological impact of our personal actions to the natural world.

We feel like we are putting our money where our mouth is!! And National helps us do it! This IS THE organization for Lung Cancer- hitting all the points that will make the most difference!
Free to Breathe	7395	11	/users/profile/9251	Lrkarp	Volunteer	5	07/27/2009	The National Lung Cancer Partnership is a group of leading doctors, researchers, patient advocates, and lung cancer survivors who are working together to improve treatments for lung cancer patients. They are dedicated to raising public awareness of the disease and generating funding for lung cancer research.
Free to Breathe	93323	1	/users/profile/107237	Brian Brubaker	Volunteer	5	07/02/2011	This is my 5th year of advocating for the National Lung Cancer Partnership.  I randomly participated in their Free to Breathe walk in Philadelphia back in 2007 because I wanted to start giving back to the community.  Then the hammer was dropped the next day when i found out that my cousin back home was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. I thought this was very ironic, and that somehow I was sent to this organization.  I took it as a sign, and decided to work with the Partnership.  5 years later, I am chairing the 2nd Annual Free to Breathe in the Delmarva area of Delaware/Maryland/Virgina. I have also been lucky enough to have attended my 2nd Lung Cancer Advocacy Summit presented by the Partnership.  For those not familiar, it's the one time of the year where advocates, patients, and survivors get together to learn more about the progress being made in the fight against lung cancer.  It's also an opportunity to see new faces of those who want to get involved, as well as meet people who have been touched by this terrible disease.  I can honestly say that it is a privilege and honor to attend, and to be amongst those who are so passionate in this cause. I have been most impressed by the National Lung Cancer Partnership in the fact that everyone there TRULY cares about this fight.  They want to create CHANGE.  And after interacting with them for so long, you can tell that there isn't the bureaucracy in this organization that plagues so many others....which means more money goes towards lung cancer research.  This organization is ONE CLASS ACT, and I wouldn't be involved with any one else!!!!!
Free to Breathe	88458		/users/profile/99587	Jen Meier	Donor	5	05/07/2011	As an advocate and donor, I am impressed with the Partnership's quality and quantity of resources.  As an advocate, they ensure you have the knowledge base and activation tools to to become an effective advocate.  Their organization is led by Dr. Joan Schiller, a leading oncologist.  Not only is she impressive and well-respected within her field, but she's also willing to ask the tough questions of her colleagues in an effort to push for the best research understanding of lung cancer.  I am very proud to be a part of this organization, and I have no doubt this organization will create a successful movement to garner much-needed funding for lung cancer research.
Free to Breathe	88447		/users/profile/99561	Joan Tashbar	Volunteer	5	05/06/2011	The National Lung Cancer Partnership is made up of researchers, advocates, physicians.  It is a partnership in the fight to help find answers through funding research and making communities aware.  This organization is totally devoted to lung cancer so all funds raised are directed toward this fight.  As an advocate I go in to the community to present programs on lung cancer, it's risks, symptoms, treatments available, etc. I am able to provide materials for participants through the NLCP.  Each year this organization awards grants to young investigators to fuel their research in to finding answers.  They provide an avenue for advocates, caregivers, etc. to connect and support each other.  
Free to Breathe	88345		/users/profile/99335	Leslie Richter	Client Served	5	05/03/2011	In the short time I have known of this organization, I have been impressed with it's commitment to raising the awareness of lung cancer as well as raising funds for research. They have developed a terrific management team and are fiscally conscious. They, as much as their supporters, want to see funds raised being spent to fund lung cancer research. 
Free to Breathe	88330		/users/profile/99306	Brandy Langley Bennett	Volunteer	5	05/03/2011	I recently attended the 4th annual Lung Cancer Advocacy Summit with this organization.  I was amazed that so many people from such different walks of lives have personally been effected by lung cancer and are ready to make a difference in the outlook of this disease.  The statistics are frightening, but the hope through research and advocacy is what makes this organization so wonderful to work with.  My step-dad is fighting this disease now.  And I am ready to work with this foundation that puts the patient first.  
Free to Breathe	88296		/users/profile/99249	Tammy Allred, RN, OCN	Volunteer	5	05/02/2011	I have been a member of the Partnership for over 4 years. I have been to at least 2 Summits and helped to develop the first one in NC. I am an advocate and activist and also a nurse navigator at UNC in Thoracic Oncology. Through working with the Partnership, I have gained knowledge of how to be an advocate. On a personal leve, the Partnership has inspired me to do more. I am now involved in speaking to large or small groups about lung cancer and educating them in the most up to date manner. Trying to get rid of the stigma and educate providers in the most accurate information. 
Free to Breathe	88287		/users/profile/99239	Lily Wai	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2011	I was recently selected by this organization to attend their 4th Lung Cancer Advocate Summit as a lung cancer survivor and has lived with this disease for almost 7 year.  The Summit was attended by a group of leading doctors, researchers, patient advocates, and lung cancer survivors.  This group is dedicated to raising public awareness of the disease and generating funding for lung cancer research.  Attending the Summit for the first time really opened my eyes and energized me to want to get more involved in raising public awareness in the need for more research funding for finding the best treatment for this deadly disease which claimed lives each year more than the breast, prostate, and colon cancer combined.  Yet, the funding for lung cancer research ranked at the bottom of the other more visible cancers.  I found this organization has the best potential to achieve the goals they set out to accomplish--Research grants for dedicated scientists for lung cancer research, advocate for public awareness, and provide support for lung cancer survivors with needed resources, and the basic knowledge to seek the best treatment available for lung cancer.
Free to Breathe	88266		/users/profile/99199	Stephanie Haney	Volunteer	5	05/02/2011	I am a 42 year old woman living with Stage IV lung cancer.  I turned to the National Lung Partnership because I was angry and looking for a place to help change the face of this neglected disease.  The Partnership funds research directly, provides patient support materials, and trains advocates to expand the army of fighters trying to get the word out.  They are staffed with great talent and professionalism.
Free to Breathe	82996		/users/profile/91804	Julie Miller	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	I lost my mom to Stage IV Lung Cancer in July 2005 after a fourteen month battle.  She died just one month before I had my daughter, her first grandchild.  I searched everywhere for an organization to become a part of that solely focused on lung cancer research and raising public awareness of the disease.  The National Lung Cancer Partnership is the only lung cancer advocacy organization founded by physicians and researchers that are working with survivors and advocates to fight this terrible disease.  They also have the Free to Breathe event series that I have become a part of locally.  I co-organize the Athens, GA FTB 5K.  100% of the net proceeds from each event go to supporting and funding NLCP's research, education and awareness programs.  I have met wonderful staff, physicians, survivors, and advocates since joining NLCP.  I can't think of a better organization to dedicate my advocacy work with and to watch grow in their efforts.  I have also done research grant reviews the last two years as a patient advocate and have learned so much from the wonderful work that is being done by researchers across the country to fight this disease.
Free to Breathe	82965		/users/profile/9350	Christine	General Member of the Public	4	03/23/2011	The National Lung Cancer Partnership has been very helpful to me in my own grass roots advocacy work. Always willing to answer questions or supply materials. Just a great organization
Free to Breathe	7891	11	/users/profile/9725	Rita Bubb	Volunteer	5	07/30/2009	I learned that I had lung cancer December 22, 2000.  Then I had my tumor removed January 9, 2001.  That was a painful surgery and a difficult recovery for me as I was left with nerve pain.  Worse than the pain was the isolation that I felt.  I'm not sure when I first learned of National Lung Cancer Partnership, but I know that when I learned that physicians had organised and started this organization, I felt more hope than I had in a long time.  I found a place where there was interest in finding better outcomes for survivors of lung cancer.  Until then, I had actually heard physicians cite lung cancer studies from 1968, as pertinent.  And, I had heard physicians state that if people would stop smoking there would be no more lung cancer and then brush off the topic.I am able to keep current on lung cancer topics, and I am able to see what is being done to remove the stigma attached to lung cancer by belonging to NLCP.
Free to Breathe	7455	12	/users/profile/9309	Janice	Volunteer	5	07/27/2009	When I my mom was diagnosed with Lung Cancer, I didn't know where to turn. She died 6 1/2 weeks later, and I felt helpless! I turned to other organizations, but didn't find that fit that allowed me to heal AND to help. That was 13 years ago, and thanks to NLCP, I was able to find a "home" to learn, grown, educate, advocate, and help others. They embraced me and allowed me to engage in the cause to eradicate this disease.
Free to Breathe	7421	11	/users/profile/9278	Nancy Gatschet	Board Member	5	07/27/2009	When I finished my treatment for lung cancer with no evidence of disease, I asked my doctor which lung cancer organization I should work with.  She answered without hesitation, National Lung Cancer Partnership.  I have been an advocate working with the Partnership for over 2 years now.  I admire them for staying focused on their mission of decreasing deaths from lung cancer and helping patients live longer and better through research, awareness and advocacy.  In a short 3.5 years, they have created a branded fundraising event in Free to Breathe, which started as a single event in 2006 and will have 23 events this year.  They created the first lung cancer advocacy summit in 2008, and held a second one this spring, training interested people in the tools of advocacy and the details of the disease.  And they fund early career research grants in the hopes of developing strong professionals for the future.  They provide an excellent patient education booklet called "Living with a Diagnosis of Lung Cancer" (note "Living" - hopeful!) and a DVD designed to help patients considering participation in clinical trials.  And they do it all with an incredibly low administrative %.
Free to Breathe	7420	11	/users/profile/9277	HOPE THE 2ND	Volunteer	5	07/27/2009	This organization has been excellent resource for me as a survivor of Lung Cancer.  I attented their Summit in April in Dallas.  In all my years as  Stock Broker for various firms I have never been to a meeting so well organized and helpful.  I will be bringing their "Free to Breathe Race" to Jacksonville to help raise awareness (which is desperately needed in Lung Cancer) and funds. They have what I can a "Race in a can".  The framework is all done for you. The staff could not be more helpful in all venues. This is a grassroots organization that should receive all the water and fertilizing one can obtain for them.  I believe they have helped my healing process by allowing me to work with them. Kudos to the National Lung Cancer Partnership!
Free to Breathe	7388	8	/users/profile/9173	charmaine	Volunteer	5	07/27/2009	This outstanding organization was founded by lung cancer physicians/researchers to raise disease awareness in society and to raise much needed funds for lung cancer research.  The organization has partnered with other lung cancer foundations in an effort to maximize each groups effectiveness.    The Partnership sponsored a Lung Cancer Summit in 2008 to train grassroots advocates to raise disease awareness and the need for additional research dollars, as well as to generate fundraising activities in their communities.  My involvement with the Partnership began with my attendance as a survivor advocate in training at the 2008 Summit.  I returned for the 2009 Summit as a group leader.  The program in both years was outstanding and included researchers' presentations, media consultant and public relations presentations, speakers from other cancer foundations, and speakers from the National Cancer Institute.  The 2009 Summit also included presentations from 2008 participants' awareness and fundraising activities.  Advocates left the Summit armed with ideas and a notebook filled with the power point slide presentations, facts and statistics, materials on legislative advocacy and engaging the media as well as an action plan designed by, and for, each advocate participant.  Advocate/participants included early and advanced stage disease survivors, family members, friends and health professionals.  The Partnership also formed a google group to provide a venue to facilitate participants' continued communication, provide new research information, news about legislative initiatives, media and awareness raising opportunities as well as to provide  encouragement to fledgling advocates. In two years the Partnership has trained about 100 advocates.  Each advocate has taken what they learned at the Summit and put it into practice through awareness raising activities and fundraising events in towns and cities across America.  In addition, and as a direct result of the Summit, two new National Lung Cancer Partnership State Chapters were formed.  Way to go NLCP and thank you for what you do for all of us!
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	313340		/users/profile/404712	peggyjp	Volunteer	5	10/22/2016	I joined CASA as a volunteer this summer. The training I had was thorough and that, along with my many years of teaching, prepared me for my experiences with my two CASA children.  The rewards that I have received in getting to know the children and their guardians are indescribable. The joy I see in their eyes when I arrive at the home and the genuine caring I witness in the guardians of  the children make my day every single time I am there.  The CASA staff is available to answer questions, inform me of new developments, and assist me in any way they can. Working with this organization is one of the best experiences I have had. 
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	312330		/users/profile/403684	Mary473	Board Member	5	10/20/2016	I joined this organization 7 years ago and have found it to be a great organization assisting the abused and neglected children in our community.

CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	310206		/users/profile/401558	MJnunormal	Board Member	5	10/12/2016	I joined CASA of Brown County after retiring in 2009.  I have volunteered as an advocate for children from age 1 week old thru age 18.  I believe I have shared with all these CASA children that they can trust again and they were special.  Many times I had to wonder if I was enriching their lives or they were enriching my life.  (A combination of both, I believe).  Giving your time and/or talents to a nonprofit is what I truly believe enriches all lives.  Staff, Board Members and Advocates, "thank you" for believing in the mission of CASA of Brown County.
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	309867		/users/profile/401221	mec819	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	I have been a CASA volunteer for 2 years.  It has been a wonderful experience and has afforded me a chance to give back to my community, children and families in need of love and support.  The support CASA receives from Brown County Human Services and the Brown County Court system is amazing as well.  The collaboration and partnership between the systems is a true testament to the importance of children in our community.
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	309710	1	/users/profile/401061	Kathy274	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	I have been a CASA volunteer for over eight years. CASA joins together volunteers with a heart for children, with children who need some love and someone to advocate for them. Then the child and the CASA volunteer are joined together with judges, teachers, parents, foster parents, siblings, social workers extended family & friends of the child, case workers, attorneys, supportive CASA staff, education & speakers, opportunities for children to grow & learn, and a whole lot more. I have learned how to be a better advocate through the training & staff of CASA but mostly I have learned to be a better advocate from the children & teens. The young people hold wisdom far beyond their years!

CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	309704		/users/profile/401053	Dawn155	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	As a volunteer for CASA of Brown County I have discovered an organization that gives back to our community by helping children who have no one else to help them.  The staff of CASA of Brown County also show appreciation to their volunteers and the support they get back from the community. There is nothing more important than helping a child have a voice in their life!
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	309697		/users/profile/401047	Ashley177	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	They are so amazing and help so many people. I have seen from both sides the good they do and the love they have for the community. 
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	308701		/users/profile/400074	suebischel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2016	I prosecuted child abuse and neglect cases in Green Bay for 9 years and served as a Judge for 20, presiding over many juvenile court cases.  Far too many children are struggling,and there are numerous community programs offering help. But the children we see in juvenile court represent 10% of the reported cases of child abuse and neglect--only the most serious are the subject of juvenile court petitions.  They typically have inadequate family and community resources.  That is what makes CASA unique.  After encountering these children for 29 years, I concluded what was most lacking is a single person they could  ALWAYS trust and count on to make them a priority, protect them and help them get through whatever trauma has occurred and lies ahead.  That is what a CASA volunteer does. And the volunteers come from all walks of life.  While the CASA training is exceptional, the volunteers are not trained social workers or mental health professionals.  Their only motivation is to be that one consistent, supportive, loving, nurturing person to make the difference that lasts a lifetime.  I personally witnessed the value of  CASA hundreds of times.
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	308633		/users/profile/400002	ljrose53	Board Member	5	10/07/2016	I am continuously amazed by the efforts of the CASA-BC staff and yes dedicated advocates. These people change lives of children one at a time. Thanks to them for all they do. 
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	308324		/users/profile/399713	jabaumgart	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I am a CASA volunteer. Working with children that are in foster care can be challenging both emotionally and mentally simply because of the trauma and the ongoing unknown that they live with every day. The advocate supervisors at CASA of Brown County are very supportive when legal and safety issues arise, but most of all they are there for their advocates when the emotions become hard to handle. They are professional when they must be and caring and supportive when we need it. This is a great organization!
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	308307		/users/profile/399696	Writer	Board Member	5	10/06/2016	CASA of Brown County is a fantastic organization helping the most vulnerable children in the community. The staff and volunteers are passionate about their roles and work tirelessly to better the lives of abused and neglected children. I cannot say enough positive things about CASA of Brown County and the work that they do. 
CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Brown County	308294		/users/profile/399681	csalmonseven	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	This organization is top-notch!  The staff, the Board, and the volunteers work together to help children in need of protective services.  The children I have visited love to have a consistent friend that is there to advocate on their behalf.  We have fun together while trying to understand how they are feeling and what they are experiencing.  I wish there were more CASA organizations like Brown County across the state!

The expertise and knowledge of the staff and volunteer group of this organization help find a long term solution for at-risk youth in the area. Their coordination with the County and local judicial system really provide a support system for these kids.  A great organization and one that is absolutely worthy of the support it receives from the surrounding community.

They make a big difference in the lives of the most at-risk youths in our community.  We constantly hear great feedback from the CASA kids as well as the Brown County judges that the CASA advocates are having a very positive influence in the lives of the children served.  I'm honored to be a part of such a great organization.

Volunteer and break the cycle, be the one to make the difference in that child's life. 
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	233713	1	/users/profile/297634	Winded	General Member of the Public	1	11/15/2014	I called to talk about my situation and Tiffany answered after about 8 rings. She was not helpful. She voulntarily told me she has worked there for a month which makes me understand why she does not understand domestic violence. She definately should not be in charge of intake calls. Give the girl some training. People should be able to get away from a variety of abusive situations. She put me on hold and told me we only house people who are being abused, no questions about my storyand when I asked who she spoke with she would not provide me a name and hung up on me. I expected better from a place who has so much public funding. I suggest people to donate somewhere else.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	167978		/users/profile/222867	Community Member2	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	I understand that it can be difficult when the current shelter has to run a wait list. That is why DAIS is working so hard right now to build a much bigger shelter. They do amazing work despite the limitations they face. 
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	164174	1	/users/profile/218133	jessie26	General Member of the Public	1	08/03/2013	where do you tell a victim to go when they need shelter and you simply say sorry we have a waitlist. What do you think they are going to do? They are going to stay with the abuser because it's the only place they have...........
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	95795	2	/users/profile/111410	Libbey05	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2011	I am a survivor  domestic violence.   I am a former employee of DAIS.  I am currently a supportive community member.  I have worked as an advocate and trainer in the area of intimate partner violence since 1992.   DAIS services are critical and necessary. The people touched by the work are forever changed. Until the violence stops, I hope DAIS is there to support those in need.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	40189	13	/users/profile/41111	hickoryridge	Volunteer	5	05/23/2010	I am privileged to be a volunteer member of the DAIS committee for the annual fund raising Celebrate Independence luncheon.  Economic times have created difficult situations for many, including victims of domestic violence.  In the past year, DAIS has received 352 calls seeking information about shelter (144% increase), 293 new crisis response clients (49% increase) and 964 nights that people have been waitlisted for shelter from their abuser (1621% increase).  In the past year, Dane County has experienced an increasing number of deaths resulting from domestic violence.  This dismal picture is exacerbated by the fact that while demand has dramatically increased, retaining funding for important DAIS services has become much more challenging.  DAIS is the only domestic violence agency supporting Dane County.  Dane County has a projected 2009 population of 491,357.   DAIS serves this population with a budget of just over $1 million and through a 25-bed safe-house residence.  What they accomplish with minimal resources for the population base they serve is commendable  direct service to victims, community outreach and training for law enforcement, human services staff and other related professionals.  In spite of their sterling reputation and the need for their services growing at astonishing rates, they unfortunately continue to have to direct a significant amount of staff resources to just maintaining their budget, let alone grow it to better need the pressing needs.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	39861	11	/users/profile/40815	1daisy	Volunteer	5	05/21/2010	I am very honored to provide this small service(cleaning)to DAIS.  Although I know that the staff has to meet challenging circumstances on a daily basis, they still manage to maintain a professional and positive attitude.  This past year was particularly traumatic with several high-profile cases of domestic violence in Dane County including the murder of two mothers and their daughters. Although the staff was deeply affected, they continued to provide the support, information and comfort so needed by victims of domestic abuse.    Yesterday there was an article in the local paper (Wisconsin State Journal)about the huge increase in the number of people seeking DAIS services. I know that even with its limited resources, DAIS will continue to try to meet that need with knowledge and compassion.

That is why I volunteer.  I want all the women who experiance violence to know that we, as a community, care for her and are there for her...we want her to reach her full potential-however she may describe it.  DAIS provides the love, safety, and reality of "next step" planning for people to get into a safe, secure life pattern.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	39306	15	/users/profile/40261	lindalambert	Volunteer	5	05/18/2010	Domestic Abuse Intervention Services (DAIS) helps provide a safe place for many women while they find their independence.  It is a great organization, with dedicated staff and volunteers who make the vision of the organization a reality.  I have witnessed personally, through this dedication, the power of women helping women achieve their dreams.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	39250	12	/users/profile/40201	rja1	Board Member	5	05/17/2010	This is an organization that does terrific work day in and day out, but is stressed from too much demand for its services.It is a place of safety, comfort, and new beginnings.  I am proud to be on its board even though it means learning things about your community and humanity that you find personally challenging.Volunteering for and supporting DAIS is very rewarding, because they are making a difference and changing lives of victims and future generations.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	38899	14	/users/profile/39816	mary22	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	Domestic Abuse Intervention Services is an organization that strives to empower women by providing services and support they might not otherwise receive when facing the challenges that come with domestic violence.  I started volunteering last October, and I have seen the broad reach of the organization's positive influence. Whether through advocacy, the shelter, the Crisis Line, the Crisis Response program, support groups, legal assistance, the Kid's program, and its extensive volunteer training program, DAIS is truly working to make positive changes in the lives of its clients, its staff, and the community writ large.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	38897	1	/users/profile/39818	littlesteps6	Client Served	5	05/14/2010	The events that finally prompted me to seek help through Domestic Abuse Intervention Services were traumatizing and left me feeling ashamed, embarrassed, guilty, and numb; detached from any and all emotion. By the time I called asking for information, I was prepared to die. I think I even anticipated it. Not only was I living in fear every day of what might happen to me, but I had completely given up on myself. I was in so much pain, and I knew it was only a matter of time before I couldnt do it anymore. I lost all hope, and I hated myself. When I called for help, I had no idea what services could be offered or if there even was anything that anyone could do to keep me safe. The person who I talked to that night was so nice and patient with me. She must have been able to tell that I was scared, but she gave me all the information I needed and got me to where I needed to be: the shelter. I almost didnt end up going, but something in her voice seemed comforting and safe and I went. That decision changed my life. Throughout my stay there, I had constant support from both the other women living there and all of the staff members. It was the first time in a long time that I didnt feel alone and worthless and pathetic. I saw the other women as strong, smart, funny, amazing, and inspiring. By talking with the staff and my caseworker, I gradually started having important and life-changing realizations. They helped me actually believe that none of what happened was my fault. Almost everyone it does happen to thinks they should have done something different or been different in some way and they blame themselves because of that. But  no matter what was different, it still could have happened. It was never in our control to begin with and that's not our fault. We aren't to blame. I am not to blame. Being able to accept that finally allowed me to start healing. And with that, I was able to forgive the person who hurt me, which is for my sake only. Im not angry anymore. Really, I feel sad for him because hell never know love or compassion with all the hate he must have in his heart. But by forgiving him, its as though I am no longer connected to him, and he has no control over me anymore. He will never be able to hurt me again. I finally feel free. Ive also finally forgiven myself for everything. I understand now that my negative ways of coping and the harm I've caused myself werent because I hated myself. I was surviving, and whether they were bad or good, my instincts kept me alive, and thats the most important thing. My experience at the DAIS shelter saved my life. Im not only surviving now, but Im finally starting to live. I feel incredibly lucky to have ended up where I did, because the journey has been beautiful. Ill never be able to convey how appreciative I am and how much the people there mean to me. They will forever be my role models and my heroes.

Prior to becoming a part of the DAIS team, I was completely uneducated about all of the barriers and problems that victims face when trying to overcome their fears and leave their abuser and I hope that I am able to pass on what I have learned to my family and friends.  DAIS does a lot with what little money and shelter space it has.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	38765	13	/users/profile/39661	khdance86	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	DAIS is an organization about empowerment and respect.  It offers services and resources that empower women to make their own choices about their lives and their safety.  This is what I love about DAIS; they respect women and their capabilities.  They provide an (unfortunately) necessary resource for families in the community that they cannot find elsewhere.  They provide safety, support, and advocacy and they do it with the utmost respect and dignity.
Domestic Abuse Intervention Services	38744	10	/users/profile/39644	hkope	Board Member	5	05/12/2010	I am just beginning to get acquainted with this organization and am totally impressed. I am serving on the board of trustees where our primary purpose is to increase DAIS awareness and donations, furthering our reach. The need is definitely greater than the funds, but everyone is working so positively to enact change one step at a time. The staff & volunteers work with very limited resources to make unbelievably positive & measurable differences for people in the Madison community. I am honored & excited to be a part of helping people change their lives for the better.

Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	58725		/users/profile/62092	RuthHarper,	Board Member	5	12/12/2010	Lost Creek Camp Confidence is a one of a kind place where "unwanted" horses are cared for, trained and given a job that that love whether it is teaching children and adults how to ride, being camp horses or taking riders on the trails. The founder, Lynette Weldon, is that rare person who connects and understands horses as well as people. Her uncanny ability to read a horse is matched only by her wisdom in knowing exactly what her riding students need to move forward.

Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	199553		/users/profile/260501	horselover54003	Client Served	5	05/02/2014	I have learned everything about horses from Lynette and the instructors at Lost Creek Ranch. Not only have I learned to ride but I have learned to take care of horses, feed and I help out with chores too. This year I am on the show team and I am proud to be riding and showing a rescue horse!  Camp is the best week of my year and my favorite part is watching horse movies on the projector in the bunkhouse when we go to bed. I also like that I have learned western and english riding and that everyone is really nice no matter what kind of riding you want to do.

The founder is an amazing horse person who not only takes in unwanted horses but also gives at risk kids from the community a place to be part of something big. The kids and horses love each other and the ranch is a one of a kind place. The riding lessons are so much fun and it doesn't matter how much or how little you have ridden- they always seem to choose the perfect horse for you to ride and learn on. I could spend all day brushing and loving on those horses. Thank you Lost Creek Ranch for all that you do for our local community and horses in need.
Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	199551		/users/profile/260498	S.snyder	Client Served	5	05/02/2014	All I have heard about is Lost Creek Ranch since sending my daughter to Camp Confidence! She still talks about "her horse" and the other horses. One of the most important aspects of this camp versus others we have attended was the amount of riding and horse time the girls get- they have lessons two times a day and in between learn to groom and get to help out with the rescue horses. I loved that the girls were put on chore teams and helped feed and care for the horses every day. Again this is unique to this camp and it instills a work ethic in the girls- my daughter was proud to be part of the team and felt like her chores were really important. And her riding improved so much in just one week of camp! She cantered in the camp show and her smile was huge. She is already planning her return and making sure her new camp friend will be in the same week. She also loved her camp counselors who were collage girls and now my daughter wants to go to collage and study horses just like them!

This should not be a place that is allowed to serve kids. Surely there is a review board that would close this place down. The kids slept in a shack for a week, with no electricity. No running water or indoor bathroom at all. They showered once at a local pool 15 minutes away. They served instant Mac and chees for dinner more than once.  This was a horrible experience and one I feel guilty for sending my kids to.

Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	188692	1	/users/profile/62091	Ruth H.	Client Served	5	11/16/2013	Simply the best horse camp experience hands down! Campers are assigned their own horse for a week and learn everything from haltering, grooming, saddling, safe handling on the ground to the basics of riding. Campers ride twice a day, help feed and care for the horses, work in "chore teams" learning everything it takes to care for horses.  Councelors are experienced horse professionals- many of them students majoring in pre vet and equine studies at the University of WI River Falls which is inspiring to the young campers. Another favorite is having the farrier (horse hoof care specialist) doing a shoeing demo for the girls- they learn so much!  Riding lessons 2x/day (indoor and outdoor arenas), an awesome selection of horses for all levels and abilities, hot afternoons spent at the local pool, evenings around the campfire and watching horse movies projected lifesize on the arena walls are just a few camp favorites!  Lynette Weldon has been running Camp Confidnce for over 12 years and loves working one on one with the campers building their confidence and fostering a lifelong love of horses. Her staff are professionally trained, comitted to the best care of the campers and horses and above all enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge and passion for all things horse.
Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	164801	2	/users/profile/219054	mladkins1	Client Served	1	08/13/2013	Never had I been more disappointed in a camp than I was in this one.  The camp was run-down and filthy, the water main broke toward the end of the 5-day camp and there was no running water for 1 1/2 days.  The one "biffie" was filled to the brim and was DISGUSTING - most likely a complete health hazard - not to mention the fact of no running water.  The area set-aside for the kids to ride the horses was so dusty, my husband couldn't even take pictures at the end for fear of ruining his camera!  Haven't they hard of spraying at least SOME water down on the dusty ground to minimize the dust when horses stomp on it?? Even though "Camp Confidence" touts itself as the kind of camp that builds confidence and self-esteem, it did nothing of the kind for my daughter.  If my daughter approached Lynnette with the fact that she wasn't sure how to do something - Lynnette (and the other snotty girls) made fun of her, told her she should know how to do that, and didn't help her or teach her at all.  So much for a teaching camp! Even though the counselors touted that they watch movies in the bunkhouse every night (keep in mind the "bunkhouse" is a thrown-up "shed" that barely houses 6 bunk beds - no running fans - no open windows) - they watched "Saddle Club" one night out of the 4 nights.  The main house on the property might as well be a crack house, for the sight of it.  Completely run-down and not taken care of at all. The campers sat on their iPhones during all the sessions - and Lynnette didn't do anything to stop them.  The campers were encouraged (or at least, not discouraged by Lynette and the other counselor) to mock, tease, and act entirely like snotty, bratty children toward the other "not as financially able" campers.  "You don't ride every day???" "You don't have your own horse???" Blah, blah, blah.  They even mocked my child for actually wanting to spend time with her horse!!!  What child wouldn't want to spend time with a horse - they are at A HORSE CAMP!!!! Give me a break.  I have no problem with the attitude of Lynnette and her counselors (and yearly campers) toward new-comers - BUT, to tout this camp as "Camp Confidence?" Give me a break! Lynnette's own daughter has Down's Syndrome and was lost for hours playing "hide and seek."  Not only was Lynnette not worried and not looking for her daughter, she came across (to my daughter) as completely unconcerned and uncaring.  Luckily, she was eventually found! The campers didn't do one single trail ride the entire week - which was very disappointing to my daughter - especially since it is touted, as well, in the literature. This was certainly NOT a $750 5-day camp week.  The facilities are severely lacking, the teaching and training is demeaning to say the least. The only good thing are the horses. The half shire/half quarter horse my daughter had was beautiful and outstanding.  And well cared for. I only wish Lynnette actually cared for her campers as much as she does for her horses. Don't waste the money on this camp.  There HAS to be better ones out there.   
Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	126203		/users/profile/171276	wp45328	Client Served	5	10/16/2012	I surprised my wife with a trail ride excursion at Lost Creek Ranch last summer and little did I know it would renew her love for horses and begin a relationship with Lost Creek Ranch that I know will continue for a long time.    My wife began weekly lessons with Lynette the owner of the ranch.   Lynette not only has tremendous knowledge and experience with horses, but has a gift of teaching both children and adults.   Lost Creek Ranch rescues horses and trains them for jobs at the ranch.   The horses in turn help children and adults build confidence, gain experience riding, showing, and caring for horses along with giving guests at the ranch a unique riding experience.   Lost Creek Ranch also provides a great opportunity for interns to work with guests and the horses.    Last weekend my wife and I invited our two nieces to the ranch for the Fall Horsemanship.   Jillian (12) and Emma (10) had a wonderful time grooming the horses and learning to ride.    With Jillians parents going through a divorce and her cousin Emma still mourning the loss of her father less than two years ago, this experience really provided a day of fun and escape from the stress of lifes unexpected turns.   Horses have a unique way of helping people deal with the pain in our lives and Lost Creek Ranch truly is a place that recognizes this.    - Bill and Julie, Roberts, WI  
Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	125628		/users/profile/170857	Cari C.	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I found Lost Creek Ranch about two and a half years ago when my boys were at camp.  I wanted a break from my two sons with special needs and a very active high schooler.  I was welcomed, accepted, challenged and learned alot.  I stayed on and actually now get a caregiver for the boys so I can have rejuvenating time for me.  I have learned from Lynette (owner) how to understand horses and how to ride better.  I have gained friendships with many of the woman there.  The at risk youth program, intern program and youth camps are an important part of why the ranch exists.  Lynette is a strong believer in giving these special horses a new job and allowing youth to grow through asset based experiences and the companionship of a horse. This place has changed my life.  I am eager to have our indoor arena completed  this fall so that we can ride on site in the winter as well as the summer.  This will allow continuity in our programs and keep the horses engaged and in shape in the winter as well.

I came to the ranch, hoping to ride a few horses, clean a few stalls, and so small chores. I never imagined these small volunteer task would spark a new life for me!

Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	123767	2	/users/profile/168497	Exercisechic927	Client Served	1	09/28/2012	Had the worst trail ride experience at this ranch. The people did not even introduce themselves or talk to us while on the extremely short ride which was mostly on the road where there was traffic by cars. The only thing they cared about is making sure everyone was tipped which was not going to happen after I almost fell off their horse.  The inexperienced staff put a too big of saddle on the horse I rode causing me to fall off. I would not trust anyone to take their kids here riding! Very unsafe and my worst experience ever on a horse! Staff are very unfriendly! 
Lost Creek Ranch Camp Confidence	88197		/users/profile/99089	a student of lynettes	Volunteer	5	04/30/2011	I found out about Lost Creek Ranch through their website. Lynette has taught me everything I know about horses. From how to put a saddle on to jumping!       During one of my lessons I fell off. I was scard to ride again, but Lynette helped me little bt little and eventually I gained the confidence to ride again. After that event, I feel like it helped me build a better relationship with horses.        The best part of Lost Creek Ranch is their Camp Confidence. They have a smaller size camp which helps students learn more things and you learn faster. At the camp you don't just learn how to ride, but also while your there you get to learn how to care for a horse of your own. I know it takes a lot of work, and their camps teach other kids that too.        I never get board of doing the same thing! Every lesson Lynette has me do something new. That makes horseback riding a lot more interesting. Everyone can learn at their own pace. They don't push you to learn. That helped me when I fell off. Although you do have to be confident and willing to learn that is the only way you can ride.           Lost Creek Ranch made me horse crazy!It is a piece from heaven!

I was in shock and that night I called ABCD. Years ago, it was the Y me hotline. I asked for someone to speak with and match me up with a survivor. they did the EXACT match I was looking for. Understanding, caring, empathetic, and this woman got me through. if it wasn"t for this woman at the other end of the phone counseling me, guiding me, listening to me I would not be in the space I am today! She was My life saver! I have no family that was ready and available to "listen" Friends shyed away from me and still do. I have had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. Still healing and now facing chemo therapy for a year. I know have another survivor I am speaking with. I am also BCRA1 positive. I live alone and its been painstaking going through this .

ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	169841		/users/profile/225093	Nancy Williams	Volunteer	5	09/15/2013	Five years ago when I was unexpectedly diagnosed with breast cancer, with no family history, I thought that my life was over, both physically and mentally. I cried for days on end until a good friend told me about ABCD. Scared to make the call to them, and not knowing another sole who had the misfortune of having this diagnosis, I felt isolated and all alone. I got up the courage to call ABCD and their receptiveness and caring was a God sent!!!! They, immediately assigned me a mentor who lived nearby, and I had the pleasure of meeting a caring person that had experienced the exact same diagnosis and went through the same fears and apprehensions that I was experiencing gave me hope and enlightenment.If it wasn't for ABCD's mentors and ongoing programs, I cannot even imagine what would have become of my mental and physical health prognosis.I am a 5 year survivor, with the help of a great surgeon, oncologist and the members of ABCD. I wanted to give back what I had graciously received from them, so I took the time to take their mentoring course, and I am now awaiting another anxious and confused patient who, was given the same diagnosis of the BIG "C", breast cancer. I hope and pray that I can be as proactive as a mentor, as the person that guided me through my dark days.GOD BLESS "ABCD'', AND ALL THE FABULOUS PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH THIS LIFE SAVING ORGANIZATION...

The breast cancer survivors at the other end of the toll-free phone call at ABCD, After Breast Cancer Diagnosis, are there to help, from the moment of diagnosis throughout the cancer treatment journey, then beyond into survivorhood, so no one faces breast cancer alone.     The emotionaI impact hits like a truck.  Me?  Shock, disbelief, scared  will I die, will this be my last Christmas?  Fear of the unknown.  What will the treatments be like?  How sick will they make me?   Guilt  what did I do to cause this?   Fear - Will I make it?  Does anybody make it?   Practical questions - How do I tell my husband?  My kids?  Do I even want to tell my family yet? Will I still be able to do my job?  I have to find an oncologist and surgeon right away  how? Ill likely need months of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation?  How will I pay for it?  These are some of the feelings, and practical questions, the ABCD mentors help callers with every day.     I felt so scared and alone.  Mostly overwhelmed.  By all the new terms and the many, many treatment decisions I needed to make, and make quickly.  Decisions Id have to live with for the rest of my life  do I remove a breast?  One or two?  Which is worse, more surgery or more radiation?  If I do take off a breast, should I get reconstruction?  If yes, what kind  what is each REALLY like?  Which looks better, feels better, is the shortest surgery, fastest recovery, has least long-term side effects?    What will I feel like if I dont get reconstruction?  Will my husband still love me when Im no longer whole?  Will I ever feel normal again?  The trained breast cancer survivors at ABCD help patients every day with answers to questions like this  from the large resource database at their fingertips, their personal wisdom from having been in those shoes, the experiences of over 350 other mentors from across the country from all walks of breast cancer type/treatment/age/etc, and, mostly, a listening ear.       I wished I had heard of ABCD when I was diagnosed 4 years ago to help me through that emotionally hard time and to help me come up with questions to ask my doctors so Id have all the info I needed to make the right decisions.  I learned about them months later, near the end of my treatment when I joined a support group and heard other women talking about how calling and talking to someone who had been in their shoes was the only way they got through their many crisis points.   There were multiple times throughout the journey when I wished I had had someone to talk to  like the night before my first chemo  step by step, can someone walk me through what its going to be like.  Whats it feel like when your hair falls out?  When will it grow back?  What am I going to feel like?  Will I be able to (get out of bed? go out with friends?  go on our planned vacation? )     ABCD, After Breast Cancer Diagnosis, is there, and has been for 15 years, a toll-free phone call away.  They have a top reputation by many doctors, many of whom routinely ask each of their newly diagnosed patients if theyd like an ABCD mentor.  ABCD provides immediate, customized one-on-one peer support to anyone affected by breast cancer.       After hearing how much the ABCD mentor support helped my friends, I subsequently became both an ABCD helpline and diagnosis-specific match mentor.   Now, every day, I experience the power of one-to-one.  With nearly every phone call, Im blessed to walk side by side someone with breast cancer, and be rewarded with the satisfaction of knowing Im making an immediate difference in peoples lives.   Phone calls that start in tears and fright, end with sighs of relief, effusive thank yous, and often even laughter.       ABCD, After Breast Cancer Diagnosis, daily providing trained and professionally supported peer support that is just as important to a successful breast cancer journey as top medical care.   ABCD  empowering women with breast cancer through the power of one-to-one.  ABCD my favorite great non-profit.
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	169517	2	/users/profile/224679	Lisa Klein	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	ABCD picked up some of the pieces left when Y-ME closed it's doors last year. Since then, the organization has, with emphasis on fiscal viability, extended their regional reach nationwide. The goal is to match callers with mentors who have had the same or similar diagnosis who will support them through their journey. In addition, ABCD offers personalized resources for each caller who requests information thanks to a support staff of researchers who find answers and resources expressly for the individual. The helpline and mentor program are staffed with many survivors, including a large contingent of ex--Y-ME volunteers, ready to lend an ear to each caller. There is nothing like knowing you have made a difference for a caller (survivor, family member, friend), and many times those who call in say they are so happy to have spoken with someone who understands. The combination of these personalized services are unique to the breast cancer support community.
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	169449		/users/profile/224535	shotzie30	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	After being diagnosed with breast cancer over seven years ago, my friend suggested I contact ABCD for some support. I'm glad I did. They matched me with a mentor and sent me some literature. The staff were so caring and eased the feelings I was going through. After my five year of being a survivor I wanted to give back. So I contacted ABCD and went through the mentor training. Attended several workshops, Date With A Plate a couple of times and various other events and the DETAIL that goes into each training session, workshops, events, etc... is unbelievable! Every time I visit ABCDs office I get this fuzzy warm feeling with the staff. This organization truly cares for the participants as well as the volunteers. There hasn't been a time I didn't hear how grateful they are to work with such wonderful volunteers and couldn't do this mission without us. How cool is that?!
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	169166	2	/users/profile/224201	Arline K.	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I was a staff member and volunteer with Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization for 32 years when Y-ME declared bankruptcy July 2012.  Out of this devasting event, ABCD reached out to our peer counselors and embraced us as family.  They expanded all of their services, retrained, educated, absorbed the expense of obtaining much of Y-ME valuable resources and ran with it.  ABCD has a Helpline and Mentor Matching program that is outstanding. They have a caring and dedicated staff. They have spent countless hours and dollars to make ABCD a national organization that can help patients, survivors, caregivers, spouses, loved ones, friends etc. who are all touched by breast cancer.  They are currently in the process of expanding their hours to be more immediately available to callers.  This is an organization that has changed the face of breast cancer and the journey.  
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	168998	1	/users/profile/223989	Harriet T	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	As a mentor and Helpline volunteer for ABCD, I hear the gratitude and relief in the voices of the women to whom I speak.  They are so appreciative and relieved to speak to someone who "gets it" , someone who has been in their place and knows what it feels like to be diagnosed with breast cancer. All of the volunteers are trained, caring people who want to be there for someone else who is now going through a difficult , and often lonely, experience.  Women call filled with anxiety of the unknown, and after speaking to a volunteer, can take a deep breath for the first time since diagnosis.   Besides being a comforting presence, the volunteers on the helpline can also offer information, resources, or a match with a mentor who is paired as closely as possible to the caller from a large database of women or men who have had almost every possible diagnosis or treatment.  The callers can then speak to someone who has had the same tests, treatments, surgeries,  or is even the same religion or  marital status if that is important. In an impersonal world, where people are diagnosed with cancer and sent home with their heads spinning, new vocabulary words, difficult choices, ABCD steps in to explain, comfort, listen, and , most importantly, to show that being diagnosed with breast cancer does not mean she or he will die.
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	168994		/users/profile/223970	Micki Huston	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	After my own breast cancer diagnosis, I felt alone. I had good, caring doctors, loving friends and family, but no one had been in my shoes. At times, I felt alone and isolated. I cried myself to sleep, had tearful moments at work, found it hard to concentrate.  A few years after my treatment, I learned about and became a peer counselor for a national breast cancer hotline. I felt good that I could use my experience to help others better understand and cope with the disease. Sadly, that organization closed its doors in 2012. I led a group of volunteers from that organization in a search for a new home for our collective services. We researched many fine organizations around the country that do wonderful work. We chose to volunteer our services with ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis because we shared the singular focus and passion of easing the confusion and pain for breast cancer patients, survivors, their family members and friends with, as ABCD puts it, "the power of one to one".  ABCD welcomed us and as it turns out, they were expanding their Helpline services, so we were in the right place at the right time.  ABCD Match and Helpline Mentors receive training from a caring staff as well as professionals:  physicians, attorneys and psychologists who generously give their time to assure that each and every caller to the Helpline and every person who requests a match has a quality experience. Volunteers are attentively supported during their training, Helpline service, match relationships and continuing education opportunities that also provide a chance for mentors to socialize. I am proud to support patients and survivors who want help with finding reliable sources of information, suggestions for coping strategies and just someone to listen, with ABCD style, depth and quality. All ABCD services are FREE. Recently, I answered a Helpline call and I heard a shaky, soft voice say, "Hello." I asked how I could help her, and she didn't know where to begin. I asked her if she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and she said, "Yes." I asked her to tell me about her experience, and she tearfully described the set of events that brought her to our call. As I listened, she began to ask if this and that were normal. I reassured, empathized and offered coping suggestions. Together, we organized her thoughts, outlined her next steps and then we requested a mentor so that she could have regular contact with someone who has been where she is now, someone just like her. By the end of our conversation, her voice sounded stronger, she had direction and she learned from someone who had been there that she could DO THIS!  ABCD matches breast cancer patients, caregivers, spouses, or other loved ones with very carefully selected mentors. The match process takes into account many variables such as age at diagnosis, exact diagnosis and treatment, number of children, faith and many more. ABCD's group of  mentors is culturally diverse, with some who speak Spanish, French and other languages, as well as mentors of several ethnicities. The organization also strives to meet the breast cancer support needs of the underserved.   For me, to be able to support breast cancer patients who suddenly find themselves in the gripping fear of the unknown at the time of a breast cancer diagnosis is a passion; one I find especially rewarding along the continuum of ABCD services from Helpline call to Mentor Match through survivorship. ABCD's motto is "the power of one-to-one". There is nothing quite like it. 
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	121151		/users/profile/164849	June R.	Volunteer	5	08/21/2012	ABCD was there for me when I was diagnosed with breast cancer almost 10 years ago.  I found it great to be able to send my assigned mentor an email in the middle of the night - that seemed to be the time when all my questions popped up and I couldn't sleep!  After knowing what to anticipate from my mentor, it was easier moving forward.  I truly valued my mentoring experience and following my treatment, I, too, went through the mentor training experience.  I wanted to be able to give back and help others going through the breast cancer diagnosis.  "One day at a time, one step at a time" is my mantra.  It can be such an overwhelming moment when you hear those words "you have breast cancer" but ABCD definitely helped me see my way through.
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	119432	1	/users/profile/162385	Judy37	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/27/2012	ABCD became an integral part of my life when I found myself in the wrong place at the right time. I was at a crossroads in my life, uncertain as to what direction my life should take. Unforeseen circumstances took me to ABCD, introduced me to its founder, Melodie Wilson and found me interviewing for a job that has given me a true sense of purpose.  Six years later I am still with ABCD and still feeling that sense of fulfillment as I help to  make the breast cancer journey for those diagnosed less lonely.  ABCD's model of free, personalized, one-to-one mentoring is unique in that it matches participants with mentors (all of whom have taken the breast cancer journey, are at least one year out from treatment and have been certified through ABCD's training program) who are similar both diagnostically and personally.  This  year over 4,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the State of Wisconsin alone.  ABCD's mission is to expand its reach and offer its services to a far larger number of those affected by breast cancer as well as their families and friends.  I am proud to be a part of an organization that truly does make a difference.  In the words of ABCD's founder, "there is much work yet to be done."
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	119392		/users/profile/162330	Virginia1960	Client Served	5	07/27/2012	I first volunteered for ABCD: After Breast Cancer as it was just being organized.  I knew first hand that a free, unbiased, reliable, accessible and truly personal resource for support for those affected by breast cancer - patients, family and friends - was essential.  I had just learned a dear friend had breast cancer and had no idea how to be helpful or calm my own stress.  Since that time thousands have been served, living in cities, rural areas and everywhere in between.  ABCD's approach is changing the breast cancer experience.  Now, I work at ABCD and am proud to be part of an amazingly effective and sensitive organization with hundreds of trained and professionally supported volunteers, committed staff and insightful Board.  Sadly, because of the prevelance of breast cancer, I've used ABCD's services over and over.  But until there is no more breast cancer, thank heavens ABCD is there.
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	119370		/users/profile/161999	nicnak517	Volunteer	5	07/26/2012	I have been involved with ABCD as a volunteer for nearly nine years, and am so proud to be involved with an organization that understands a breast cancer diagnosis is about more than just the medicine. The concept of one-to-one support is so unique! Participants are matched to a mentor who has had similar experiences and can really understand the fear, pain, uncertainty, etc. that is part of a breast cancer diagnosis. And ABCD not only provides support to those who have been diagnosed, but also offers mentoring to the family and friends of the participants to help them through the journey. ABCD is an amazing organization!
ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis	119305	1	/users/profile/162211	Tracy A.	Volunteer	5	07/25/2012	I am a 14-year Breast Cancer survivor and was introduced to ABCD in the early years! My Breast Health Coordinator suggested that because I was relatively young at the time of diagnosis, I might want to consider helping other younger women with my story of hope. When she suggested that she would be giving me Melodie Wilson's phone number, I recall feeling rather star-struck, having watched her over her career as a TV-Broadcast Journalist. I humbly took the number and after a few days of practicing what I would say, I called. My life was forever changed by that one phone call. I became an ABCD Mentor and later a Board Member, and now a happy volun-cheerleader!! ABCD is a small organization with all the might of a giant non-profit. It keeps true to its primary purpose - to help those affected by Breast Cancer. They are an organization of smart, innovative, passionate, dedicated, and funny people and our healthcare community and our community at large would not be the same without them. Let me wrap things up with this - my surgeon, my oncologist, and all my healthcare practitioners set out to do ONE thing...save my life, for the rest of my life! They did it with care, they did it with compassion, and they stayed laser-focused on that goal. It wasn't until I started reading some books and talking to other women (before ABCD was born) and learned for example that beyond my head-hair, my eyebrows and eyelashes would likely fall out, and they did. I wouldn't have thought to buy and use a bra that hooked in the front, because it was going to be a while before I could stretch to reach my bra that hooked in the back. These aren't the kinds of a thing that the medical community is built to delve into...and thats o.k., but gosh golly I'm so grateful for those kinds of nuggets. Now ABCD isn't all about eyebrows and bras, no! A Mentor is able to provide emotional support and share what is to be expected in that regard as well. That is quite invaluable, because your healthcare practitioners are saving your life and your family is filling in the gaps and making your life work while you're doing what you need to do, coping as they can, and even your BFF can't relate to what you're experiencing (unless she/he is a survivor too), so there is something so useful and comforting in talking to practically a complete stranger (at first) about what's going on and being able to ask those questions you can't ask anyone else! Great organization...wouldn't be me without them!

The diversity of the students and staff truly make SJA a great learning environment. I entered SJA shy, scared and inhibited and left as a strong, confident young woman ready for the world. While I was a student, my favorite part was reachiong out to the community through our wonderful annual spaghetti dinner, culture performances and many more. Now as an alum, I look forward to attending those events are re-living old memories.

St. Joan Antida High School	9133	4	/users/profile/10924	JThomas	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2009	At SJA I was exposed to Diversity at its best and learned that the world is much more than what's in my own backyard. Not many schools encourage girls or low-income students to take 4 years of math, science, and advanced courses like SJA did.  I am now an accountant and have served my community for 9 years as a public servant in politics & education.  I credit the high expectations of my teachers at SJA for pushing me toward success.
St. Joan Antida High School	9131	3	/users/profile/10923	Sr. Kathy Lundwall 1968	Former staff	5	08/14/2009	I wanted to attend a high school with a small student body and St. Joan Antida H. S. was the school I chose.  I never regretted my choice.  I got an excellent education.  Sisters and other staff members were totally dedicated.  I felt "at home" at SJA and in fact, it was my home-away-from-home.  The clubs and activities helped me to hone skills and make lasting friends.  The importance of prayer and values also had a great impact on my life.  Ultimately I chose to join the Sisters of Charity of St. Joan Antida and after I completed my college degree I taught in the theology department for over 20 years.  I also worked with the guidance department specializing in college counseling.  I love the school.  As Sisters of Charity we are dedicated to serving young women who have many hurdles to jump over -- many more than existed when I was a high school student.  We continue to strive for excellence in our programs and do all that is humanly possible to touch the heart and life of each young woman who comes to St. Joan Antida.  We continue to be a small high school where students benefit from more individual attention.  Teachers and staff go the extra mile to help each young woman grow into an adult who is competent, confident and prepared to face the challenges that life offers.

What we agree upon is each of us was encourged to develope and use our talents, to have happy, fulfilling lives.  The staff has changed over the years but they still work to show each student what her best talents are, and how to develope them, even if the student isn't always aware of the talents.
St. Joan Antida High School	9129	3	/users/profile/10921	Number 1 G	Donor	5	08/14/2009	Back in the 60's there were not many alternatives for high school programs that could accomplish the feats of academics, social activities, faith-based involvement, and overall maturity.  However, St. Joan Antida accomplished all of that and more.  As a graduate back in 1967 I hold tightly to all of the memories of my four years at SJA.  When I left Milwaukee I knew that my own children would not know the honor of a St. Joan Antida education.  Always remember that academics is only one piece of the puzzle.  How to function in the world with maturity, decency, and a good sense of humor makes all the difference in personal success.  Thank God for SJA.

A non-coed education is a real choice that should be considered.  I graduated at a time when women were not generally recognized as leaders or given many opportunities.  My SJA education didn't automatically teach limitations... in fact, just the opposite.   I highly recommend SJA and know that any young woman who is lucky enough to attend this school will also look back, as I do, knowing it was the right choice!

I participate in a dialogue circle about race and ethnicity as part of my job (with colleagues) and every time I have those conversations it amazes me that so much of the way I view the world was shaped by ...the experience I had at St. Joan's. When I talk about the experience (after people look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them I went to an all girl's school), they start to become amazed at what I learned about the world, culture, religion and spirituality, and race and ethnicity while attending a Catholic school. So, I just wanted to say thank you :) I wouldn't be doing what I am doing, and standing up for the things I stand up for, and educating the students I have an opportunity to interact with, if I wouldn't have had the experience I did."

However through WBDN, I have gained so much knowledge of what some of the various bleeding disorders are that some of my friends and their families suffer and how they deal with them on a day to day basis.    I've also seen how they do not let their health issues limit their activities and that is because of what the WBDN has taught them in dealing with day to day life.   This organization is one of the most educating organizations that I have ever come across and they make their knowledge available to anyone who asks, but more importantly, are their for those in the community who need support and help.     Great organization and one that I am willing to support even though my family is not affected directly with these diseases.    Thank you WBDN for sharing your educational information with non-bleeders.    We all need to learn and be aware of what others are going through.     Elaine Krohn
Wisconsin Bleeding Disorders Network, Inc.	208426		/users/profile/271111	Blackwhite	Donor	5	08/02/2014	I have been involved with Wisonsin Bleeding Disorders Network since it's beginning.  Many times over, I have seen the good it does in the bleeding disorders community.  The valuable information and support they provide is outstanding!  I have attended many of WBDN's educational events, and am always impressed by the information  that is shared.  I have been involved in the bleeding disorders community for 24 years, and thought I knew just about all there was to know.  I always leave an event feeling greatfull  that there are people like Darcy in the world.  I have been involved with 3 nonprofits in the bleeding disorders community, and Wisconsin Bleeding Disorders Network is by for the best.
Wisconsin Bleeding Disorders Network, Inc.	208425		/users/profile/271110	Suzalala	Board Member	5	08/02/2014	Being the grandmother of grandsons with hemophilia, I must say that the support and services that WBDN makes available to this community is most note worthy.  24 hrs on call for anyone who needs help or assistance with referrals or information, or some times just needs an ear to listen, is sure to get it from WBDN.   Great Community support and activities, both informational and fun, at least once a month, but usually more than that.  This is a very hands on non-profit...always looking for more ways to serve the community.  Members do not have to pay .....   A BIG SHOUT OUT to WBDN!!!!!!

This non-profit provides valuable information about how to live with a bleeding disorder. WBDN is well organized and managed.

Wisconsin Bleeding Disorders Network, Inc.	123463		/users/profile/168125	Patricia38	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2012	It is incredibly difficult to express in a short paragraph, my feelings and thoughts pertaining to the WBDN.  I found the network though Facebook, and follow their page on a daily basis.  As I do have close friends who do suffer from a bleeding disorder, I must stay in tune with what the network is accomplishing.  As I continue to see the time, effort, and great passion that is put into the WBDN by its executive director, Ms. Darcy Zwier, I fully understand how fortunate the network and its community are to have such an intelligent, passionate, and dedicated woman as their leader.  Ms. Zwier, and the WBDN, deserve the attention and nomination for giving back to the community.  I remain grateful to be a connected with their community.
Wisconsin Bleeding Disorders Network, Inc.	123395		/users/profile/168044	Jessi3	Board Member	5	09/26/2012	I knew I wanted to get involved with WBDN when it was still an idea being brought to life!  I was absolutely honored to be asked to serve on the board.  The old guard organization was not serving its community as I feel it should have.  I wanted to be a member of an organization that listens to, values, respects and is responsive to the needs of it's community.  WBDN does all this and more.   When families come to us in need, we give as generously as we can.  We strive to create new and exciting ways to connect members of our community.  We use feedback on programming to influence future programs.  I am happy to be a part of an organization that doesn't ostracize non-affected parents when their affected children reach the age of majority.

They are a small, very well run organization operating on a limited budget that strives to reach out to those in need. They are an excellent model of efficiency, compassion, and commitment that larger organizations in the community should emulate.

I am a foster parent that helps young kittens not old enough to be adopted. This is a very rewarding experience. The staff at BAHS are very supportive and offering suggestion with fostering.  BAHS also reminds us volunteers how important we are with get-togethers to thank us for our dedication. The staff should be rewarded too because of doing this everyday and being a major part of their lives. 
Bay Area Humane Society	315204	2	/users/profile/406533	Molly50	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I've been working with BAHS for over 10 years. I can't believe what an amazing place it has become during this time! I am a huge advocate of BAHS. Every time I hear someone talk about wanting to add a new furry friend to their family, I always push them to go there. The staff is amazing, the cost is very minimal, and you're helping give a home to an animal that may otherwise never know what a home is. If someone would've told me 10 years ago that BAHS would be what it is now, I would never have believed them. I love being a part of this amazing organization and I love that I can help by fostering these sweet animals. They never asked to come into this world without a home or family, but with the amazing help of BAHS, they get to know love.

From kittens and cats, puppies and dogs, guinea pigs, hamsters, birds, rats, and even an occasional chicken or two, BAHS has a program to fit every need.   I am particularly impressed with the hospice program and the fund raising done for animals needing extensive surgeries.

We were blown away by the amount of helpful, knowledgeable and dedicated people we met at BAHS!  Being that we only had 3 hamsters at home and had never had a dog we were in such unfamiliar territory but felt at ease while working with BAHS.  We are now the proud owners of Rose (formerly Freda) and we couldn't be happier!!  She has literally changed our lives and brought so much love into our home!  Not to mention we are now active volunteers for BAHS because of how impressed we were with their dedicated team!

Dakota came to us 13 years ago when my husband and I were looking to expand our family. Dakota was in Dog Kennel 1 and we knew from the moment she peed on my skirt she was the pittie for us!  About 4 years ago we were blessed with Callie, a basenji mix pup who stole the hearts of our children when our Shepherd was diagnosed with cancer. Next came Pancho, nearly 3 years ago. He had come to the shelter with a leg injury and a bad attitude.  While some shelters would have put him down BAHS monitored and eventually amputated his leg making him the happiest little chihuahua around. He completed our family...that is until the kids couldn't live without Waldo and Willman, 2 cute little guineas!  BAHS became part of our family and we feel like we've become part of theirs. #adoptdontshop

I love helping with the summer camps and walking dogs every week. I'm not allowed to get a pet so volunteering so closely with the animals is very special to me. I do get upset when animals get adopted because I make special bonds with some of them. I feel very independent when I volunteer and I love that I am not treated like a little kid while I'm there like I usually am. I love going to BAHS!!!

I am constantly impressed (but not surprised) with the genuine love and care all of the staff members and other volunteers have for the animals in our care. Working in animal rescue, there are many tough situations that we find ourselves in, but every staff member's first priority is the well-being of the animal. I have adopted four animals through BAHS and will continue to do so in the future. I am proud to say at I am a part of such a great organization.

First, we went there and they explained the layout and what to do if we are interested in a kitten or cat. Our first cat, Watson, we just knew he was the one. Because we had never done this, they took us step by step of what to do. Filling out the forms to giving us a care package to begin our life with our kitten. We moved to a house and felt Watson needed a friend. We went back to Bay Area Humane Society. Again, we were lucky, Sherlock picked us for owners. Sadly, when Watson passed away, Sherlock was devastated. We adopted another kitten. Again, with the help of the Bay Area Humane Society, Greyson picked us out. While donating some items, Grafton caught our eye. So we adopted him. Finally, because Grafton was young, we chose to get a playmate for him. Bradbury was added to the family. During all the adoption the people were helpful, funny and helped us through the process. We are very lucky to have them.

This pristine land is a wonderful preserved history for the community.   As soon as you start descending down the hills to the 100 year old house you feel a great sense of peace come over you.  And when you start to see the beautiful view of the river I feel so at ease and tranquil.  Martells does some very important events. They invite local schools for feild trips to learn about nature and Native Americans and the St.Croix River, Hold different seminars and work shops, or Host a  very "Green" wedding. When ever I visit the Minnesota /Wisconsin area, I always make sure Martell's Landing is one of my stops.
Martell's Landing Education Center	37753	7	/users/profile/38449	melissa16	Volunteer	5	04/30/2010	Students from Somerset Elementary School, Middle School, and High School came out to Martell's landing to be educated on topics like local French-Canadian history, biology, Native American studies, art, etc. The students were able to explore nature, create art inspired by nature, and learn to appriciate their local environment and community. It's important for students from surrounding communities to have the opportunity to take field trips to learn and spark their interest in the local culture and their environment, Martell's Landing Education Center serves this purpose. It is the perfect place for a school field trip or community outing for people of all ages. Martell's offeres a variety of options for students at a low cost to schools which is what they all need right now. Schools don't have to cut back on these important experience for students when there is a place like Martell's Landing Education Center

This center has built a close community even with visitors who live in foreign countries.  The location of the center is renowned for its beauty and this organization has done much to maintain that beauty and I am sure could do much more if funds were increased.  This organization stands above the rest for its breadth of educational focus and its work ethic.
Martell's Landing Education Center	37490	7	/users/profile/38211	mkate	Client Served	5	04/29/2010	I have had the 'priviledge' of attending an array of classes, retreat's and special events at Martell's Landing over the past 5 years and am so looking forward to more!  The land there is special, holding the ancient memory & history of the native people who found sustenance and nourishment there ~ the plants, tree's and enormous groups of migrating waterfowl and animals alike arriving each spring.  These all are taken care of by such special & gifted individual's, sharing with youth and adults alike - this oasis of nature is still preserved because of all those Native men, woman & children who came before us, living on this land, did the same ~ they took care of this special place where land meets water and sky.  Martell's Landing is rich not only from it's past history, along with the the Martell family farming and nourishing the land, yet as important it is rich because of all those who are now coming to teach on the land and those coming to learn. Children learning about nature, traditional ways of living,  Native story-telling and teachings, herbalism, water conservation and so much more.  I've received so many countless gifts from attending these courses and having the opportunity to receive so much generosity from the volunteer's at Martell's Landing and so important too ~ the spirit of the land, animals, plants & water.  The one thing I noticed which is so needed here is additional financial aid to help support the ongoing of Martell's Landing, both in the physical upkeep ~ as in the most special hand-hewn cabin, the large barn which hosts a variety of events & classes and for the ongoing of supporting field trips and classes for the surrounding schools.  My life has been enriched by the classes that have been offered there in herbalism, Native American programs - storytelling & outdoor skills workshops, cooking classes to name a few along with the priviledge of teaching classes to grade school kids about forestry & plants. The overnight accomodations can be both rustic camping along with sweet cabins available and the food which has been prepared for these classes & workshops has always been so nourishing & delicious.  I am looking forward to returning.

To have the privilege of seeing young people grow in confidence as they participate in our classes is just awesome. Then when the children showcase what they have learned at our annual spring recital it is wonderful to witness the growth, as individuals as well as the program itself. I am thankful to God for giving the vision of ATC to Linda. I am thankful for all of our wonderful instructors that have come alongside to help bring the vision to fruition.

From the beginning it has been both a blessing and challenge to get the children engaged and the parents committed to getting their kids to  class. The transformation that happens while we all learned to trust each-other and grow in this new skill is often times amazing. Some of the children who at first were unsure, hesitant and sometimes un-cooperative had developed more confidence in themselves which led to them being more respectful of me and encouraging of their dance classmates. As the weeks went by, many times I got the sense that most of us were looking forward coming to class and experienced the joy of sharing this short time together away from the outside distractions.

They really love the ballet teachers and the staff of above the clouds. It is a safe environment for them to learn what thy love to do. It has also boosted their level of confidence.  I would recommend above the clouds to everyone, Because not only is it free it is fun and also a learning  experience.

The passion and care put forth to save dogs is the number one goal and it's very evedent when working with adopt me! There are very few rescues that are volunteer based and still manage to save and rescue the amount of dogs that they are capable of saving! 
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	321116		/users/profile/414329	Writer	Client Served	5	01/12/2017	I found out about this organization back in august of 2016 when my wife and I decided to get a dog. The people at Adopt Me work so very hard every single day to make sure these dogs are loved and taken care of. All they really care about is making sure that every dog finds their forever home. This group of people are all volunteers. Therefor, they get nothing out of it but knowing that they are helping out a great cause. My wife and I have been able to build relationships with these people and you realize right away that these are genuine people with genuine intentions. Please use Adopt Me whenever looking for a new dog!
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	321100		/users/profile/414297	Anna O.	Volunteer	4	01/11/2017	I first learned of Adopt Me Animal Rescue in March of 2016 when I decided that I wanted to get a dog for my 12 year old son with special needs.  A trusted friend recommended them and is a volunteer for the group.  I  started by fostering my first dog in April  as an only dog.  Laya was a senior girl and did not like being in a home with other dogs.  By the time that I received Laya, Adopt Me had spent thousands to get her healthy and ready to be transported from North Carolina to Wisconsin.  Laya stayed with our family until she crossed the rainbow bridge a few months later with her last foster and I by her side.  She was never adopted so the rescue was out every penny spent on her.  I have fostered up to 4 dogs at a time for Adopt Me since that time, putting in hundreds of hours volunteering to help the organization in countless ways.  I consider the other volunteers as being a part of my family, a little dysfunctional at times, but we stick together.  Like most non profits, we always need money, as an all volunteer group, we always need more help.  The people I know in this group bust their butts for these dogs giving up time away from work and family day after day.  I am sorry for those that have had a bad experience with Adopt Me and I have talked to a few of you myself.  I can tell you that I walked in to this experience thinking I knew so much about dogs, I was so very wrong.  I have learned and am continuing to learn so much about dogs.  I am dedicated to learning and growing with this group for the sake of the dogs and the dedication of the people  involved.  If you adopt or foster one of my dogs, you will get the unvarnished truth about that dog.  If a foster or adopter gets the truth and still wants the dog, it will likely not come back to me which is what is best for the dogs.  Please allow us several days to get back to you if you have a question, we have jobs.  Please allow your new foster/adopted dog two-three weeks to settle in to their new home.  Imagine how overwhelming you would feel going to a different country not knowing the language?  That is probably how the dog feels being moved.  Be willing to learn about your new dog and how to make them comfortable.  Be willing to go to training with your new dog.  It will build trust and a much better relationship for both of you.  Most importantly, before you take a new dog in to your home, be absolutely sure that is what you really want to do and are committed to making it a success.  I am personally committed to doing my part to see that every dog is being fostered or adopted by the right family.  Thank you for taking the time to read my post and even if you don't adopt from Adopt me, please adopt not buy.  
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	321091		/users/profile/414282	Jennifer618	Volunteer	5	01/11/2017	I really like working with this rescue. There's a bunch of similar groups in the area, and I even volunteered with them for a while...but I keep coming back to adoptme. It feels like a family - we are all here for the dogs and that's what matters. I've fostered 6 dogs so far with this rescue. Each dog has had their challenges which has made me stressed, to be honest. But as soon as they go home, I miss them and start looking for another dog.If you're not having such a good experience, tell someone! I dare you to find another group of people as passionate and as willing to sacrifice for these dogs. 
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	321086		/users/profile/414272	Writer	Volunteer	4	01/11/2017	I've fostered several puppies and dogs through adopt me and generally I've had a good experience. It is completely volunteer run so sometimes you have to wait a bit for answers as everyone has jobs. Sometimes fosters can sugarcoat dogs a little too much too, or the foster may not know how to spot a sick dog so you end up fostering a dog with a little more baggae than you expected. Adoptme has been stellar at getting any sick fosters I've had into the vet and taking any foster that didn't deal in my house well. Money is tight for the organization so sometimes they would like you to try home remedies for non serious issues first.  I think communication between fosters could stand some improvement since the sugar coating can cause people to take on a dog they otherwise wouldn't have. That's not really the fault of the organization in general but specific fosters with selective memory. My questions always get answers even though i need to ask a couple times sometimes (people ask a lot of questions so things get lost in the shuffle) and all the issues i have had get resolved.
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	321080		/users/profile/414262	Writer	Volunteer	4	01/11/2017	I have adopted from Adopt Me a year ago and started volunteering for them recently. Could things be better run, sure.  But remember that ALL of the people running the organization are volunteers. Volunteers that also have their own full-time jobs, families, and other responsibilities. It takes longer than 24 hrs to process your application because we call your references and speak to your vet.  Then we have a volunteer schedule a home visit with you so that we can help determine the right dog for you. There are plenty of places you can adopt from and I can tell you they are all about like this. If you think you can help make changes, please volunteer and offer your help. Also, remember your patience, and continue to send follow up emails if you feel your contacts are not being returned. I've seen how hard the volunteers work and how much they care for all of the dogs. And now I am using my skills to help the organization run a bit better than before. 
Adopt Me Animal Rescue	320080	1	/users/profile/412186	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/13/2016	Dogvolunteer101 / Crystal Teutschmann: Your review is so sad. How could this group of volunteers force you to take in such a ferocious dog, put you directly in harms way, and abandon you? You mean to tell me that you chose the life that you wanted save? Only then did that dog make the trip across the country to stay in your home? Your dog arrived to a heated garage and was able to go home with you on that same day? You decided to abandon that dog less than twelve hours after he arrived. Your reasoning wasn't related to aggression, family issues, or anything at all. It was because he licked your resident dogs face? Twelve hours after you picked up a puppy which you chose to travel across the country to stay with you, you decided to dump him for being too affectionate. You didn't care at all that every other foster, such as myself just got new fosters on the same day. You felt abandoned because it took 8 more hours after your initial request for another volunteer to take over your commitment to this animal? Because it licked another dog? You threatened to take it to a shelter because no other foster (just like you) could step up on the same day that they all took in new dogs too?-Fellow volunteer, just like you

When the foster did not get along with my resident dog no one from the organization would reply. After i threatened to take the dog to the humane society i got a response and then from another volunteer a rude attitdue when i brought her the dog. I would not recomment volunteering here. Not to mention the main home the dogs are taken too is not clean and highly poplulated with dogs In a basement and garage.

Interview was intelligent and well thought out.Felt comfortable, and she's already checked my references.Arranged to meet the dog at her fosters, on Saturday morning ( 2 days later)LOVED the dog, payed the fee via the donate button,and brought the dog homeShe is sweet as candy, and goofy / crazy and a little confused by her new home, as all dogs will be.I think it's unfortunate that typically only those who aren't happy for some reason seem to be the only ones who write reviews. If an org rescues 175 dogs a year and has four 'complaints', I'd consider that excellent.   Rescue is taxing process on everyone. Organizations such as this face stress, hardship, joy, love, fear, on a daily basis. It's exhausting. I am very grateful for the hard work all rescues put forth, and Adopt Me Forever is a great organization !

I was told I would be reimbursed up to $400 for treatment expenses I incurred. I have spent over $540 so far and still have the 3rd phase of treatment to do. My phone calls, e-mails and text messages along with a letter & copies of invoices have all been ignored by the individual(s) listed as the contact on their webpage http://www.adoptmeforever.org/contact/  and other board members.

Introduced him to my parent's dog, he attacked him and then bit me three times, still have scars 6 months later. Dog was totally great, just not with other dogs. I emailed the woman who wrote the recommendation and she said that, actually, she did have to keep this dog crated a lot because he would go after her dogs. I reached out to the main contact person to return the dog, they seemed quite indifferent that I was bit and that it the whole thing was my fault somehow. Not that I'm 100% free of blame, I did introduce the two dogs, but I should have been warned the dog had issues.

Als Worldwide	323797		/users/profile/418301	SueTouzel	Client Served	5	02/26/2017	I starting experiencing symptoms  such as foot drop and difficulty in walking in August 2013 . After numerous visits to various neurologists I was diagnosed with ALS  February 2014.  The diagnosis came as a shock to our whole family and it was even more devastating when we realised there was very little information or help available for us in South Africa. We were determined not to just accept . After extensive research we were very lucky to find and make contact with Stephen at ALS Worldwide. We were overwhelmed with their empathy and support and their positive approach to helping us fight this disease and maintain hope. Stephen is always available to provide advice and support during many skype sessions and has not only recommended but also sourced many medications for me that have provided symptomatic relief and enabled me to have a far better quality of life.  We are very grateful for the love, caring and knowledgeable support that we have received from Stephen, Barbara and Sarah which continues to give us hope. Susan Touzel, Durban, South Africa

Als Worldwide	240270		/users/profile/326370	NanAm	Client Served	5	03/31/2015	My mother was diagnosed with ALS two years ago. Since then, and as she has deteriorated, we've struggled through the prescribed stages of grief. We've held out for miracles and desperately but unsuccessfully tried any number of therapies. We've given up hope on more days than I can remember. But we've been dragged back, every single time, by the incredible humanity and tireless optimism of Stephen and Barbara Byer, who continue to remind us that we have chosen to fight this disease and its grim prognosis, and that despite the seemingly insurmountable odds, we will never have to fight it alone. The extremely patient support which they have extended us beggars belief. The fact that they have been able to commit themselves personally and with equal dedication to each family that has reached out to them is nothing short of a miracle. Ceaseless as they have been in their quest for every bit of knowledge that might be applied to bring my mother some relief, and so very dignified in the way they have helped us deal with our emotions, they are the very rock upon which we are tethered against the tumult of ALS.  As long as they continue to hold a candle to this darkness, I have no doubt that we will one day defeat this horrific disease which has cost us, and them, so very much.

Todd was diagnosed with ALS on August 9, 2013, and we have been fighting as a family since 2008 when the symptoms first began.  How this has impacted our lives has knocked us to our knees. At the beginning we were so overwhelmed, we didnt know what to do or what to think. Then we put our positive thoughts, our hope, and our belief that one day, and one day very soon, there would be a cure and a miracle placed not only on our family but upon the thousands of families that fight ALS every single day.  My daughter Caitlyn is 9, and I wanted her to say to say a few words on how ALS has impacted not only her, but her two brothers:	Well my dad used to tell us stories and talk to us, but ALS has taken away his voice, which will come back I know. And no matter what ALS does to my dad, he will still be the same funny guy we know. We just have to stay strong and believe that miracles and a cure will come. ALS Worldwide was the organization that reached out to us at the beginning when we were in a whirlwind. We had no idea what to do, what ALS was. The only thing we were hearing from neurologists was, Im so sorry, this is a terminal illness and there is no cure. Steve Byer reached out to us, and got on weekly Skype calls to answer all of our questions, and gave us so much hope and information on so many things that we could do to try and keep Todd as strong as we can. Weve followed his advice, and we will continue to do that.
Als Worldwide	239513		/users/profile/325353	STouzel	Client Served	5	03/20/2015	I live in Durban, South Africa with my husband Charles and our four children. I was diagnosed with ALS/MND in February 2014, after undergoing numerous tests that eventually lead to this diagnosis. Understandably it was a great shock for the entire family and has impacted our daily lives quite considerably.  I am fortunate enough that my symptoms have started in my legs, and at the moment Im feeling weakness in my back which is affecting my day-to-day mobility and the ability for me to do normal day-to-day tasks. I am very lucky that I have an extremely supportive family who have gone through this journey with me and supported me with love and caring.  We have found it extremely difficult in South Africa to find medical help as not much is known about the condition in South Africa. Very luckily for us, just going through the internet, we managed to find ALS Worldwide, who have been incredible in their support, their empathy, their caring, and their information in terms of possible medications that could help us. More than anything, we feel extremely grateful for the fact that they have given us hope.  At this stage we are feeling very positive with the route we are taking in terms of treatments. So far we are doing pretty well. We do appeal to you to support ALS Worldwide as there is no other organization who offers this kind of support to families in our situation who are desperately looking for some kind of light at the end of the tunnel, and to stay as positive as possible and that is the incredible support we have got from Stephen, Barbara, and Sarah. They have been unbelievable and unstinting in their support. We Skype with them once a month and have found them unbelievable in their help and their caring for us.
Als Worldwide	239511		/users/profile/325352	WalkerFamily	Client Served	5	03/20/2015	Hi, my name is Ryan Walker.  I live in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa with my wife and 2 daughters. I have been living with Motor Neuron Disease for two and a half years. ALS affects my family and me on a daily basis, from the moment we wake up until the moment we fall sleep. I lived a very active lifestyle. Ive always tried to be healthy and fit and its getting progressively harder and harder to do that. At the moment my speaking, eating and breathing are fine, but my limbs are continually a challenge and is something that I find relentless and getting progressively worse. ALS affects me in a thousand ways every day. Im struggling to write, cutting up food is a challenge. Picking up my children, holding them, walking down the stairs. These are all a massive challenge and are getting harder each day. Getting dressed in the morning takes me half an hour instead of five minutes. Getting around my lands on the farm is a massive struggle. Tripping over the smallest step is something that is beginning to happen more and more often. Negotiating with my kids and chasing them when theyre trying to run away. Its not all bad, but its not all good. ALS Worldwide have been an incredible support structure for us. We were introduced to them through a mutual friend who is on the same journey. Theyve provided hope, theyve provided guidance, and theyve been a pillar of strength that we have time and again been able to rely on. Steve, Sarah, and Barbara Byer have been incredible. Theyve given us guidance on medication that they believe can assist ALS. Theyve given us guidance with stem cell therapies and the promise that they hold. We often call on them for guidance and they are always there for us, even on Sundays through Skype sessions. Weve become very reliant on them.
Als Worldwide	239125		/users/profile/324750	akpap	Client Served	5	03/11/2015	My name is Tony Papoulias. I am a 62 year-old pensioner of Greek origin. Our Calvary started as early as the beginning of 2000 when my wife Annie observed with a feeling of awe the first bulbar symptoms settling on a day-to-day basis. Being a fast progressor, she was soon diagnosed with ALS at the age of 42 in Birmingham, UK. Our two daughters, Anastasia and Demi, aged 18 and 16, had to face the inexorable reality of their mothers imminent death. As a result, both of them great up and matured really fast. It seems that it was Gods divine plan of my getting in touch with the Byer family in the summer of 2003. Needless to say, this very fact marked the beginning of a true friendship. And according to a well-known motto, A friend in need is a friend indeed. Never will I forget how much we profited from the precious pieces of advice offered or the unique way we were respected and treated. That is the reason why I do consider myself to be an extremely lucky man to have made their acquaintance. 
Als Worldwide	239124		/users/profile/324749	wkjo	Client Served	5	03/11/2015	Hi, my name is Keith Johnson from Pineville, Louisiana, and I was diagnosed with ALS a little over two years ago in November of 2012. When I first got this news I was devastated. The doctor told me I had two to five years to live, during which time I would become completely paralyzed, not being able to speak, eat, or eventually to even breath. I was immediately concerned for my family, wondering what kind of burden I would become to them Im now more optimistic than Ive ever been about the future. Part of the reason for my optimism is my association with ALS Worldwide. Early on in my battle with ALS, I was searching the internet for treatment options and I ran across their website which had information that I was curious about. I sent an email to Stephen Byer, not really thinking I would ever get a response. Not only did I get a response, but he set up a Skype video call with me and talked to me about my health, when I was diagnosed, what I was doing treatment wise, and just provided someone to talk to that completely understood what I was going through.

Along with that news, our neurologist (at the time) was less than encouraging with statements like If you want to travel anywhere, youd better do it now.  We spent the next few months in a tailspin as we quickly learned that resources for people in our situation were, at best, very limited. Finally, after countless hours of scouring the barren desert of ALS information, Toni found the oasisSteve & Barbara Byer / ALSWW. It was a joyous day on March 29, 2012 when Toni encouraged me to participate in that first Skype call with Mr. Byer.  Since that time there have been numerous calls and emails where weve received information, advice and encouragement.  Although my ALS has progressed, we are confident that the advice and involvement in various drug trials have given us many more quality days than we would have otherwise had.  With that being said, the greatest gift weve received from Steve & Barbara is HOPE. Many, many thanks to ALSWW for being our trusted advisor on this journey.
Als Worldwide	238864	1	/users/profile/324344	FriendofALSWW	Client Served	5	03/05/2015	In the couple of years only I have known Steve and Barbara Byer, I have seen them tirelessly circumvent the globe again and again to carry the flame of hope of ALS Worldwide to so many patients and their families in the far corners of the globe. In ALS, as in most neurodegenerative conditions, care-takers physicians, neurologists from around the world are often at a loss to alleviate the patients struggles with the illness or symptoms. In fact, with limited pharmaceutical resources to draw from, they often fail to establish the appropriate medical protocol which has become synonymous with the successful treatments of cancer or cardiac diseases today. With so much of the published medical research in neurology based on anecdotal evidence, often conflicting, the asymmetry of information between patients and physicians or indeed between physicians themselves has never been greater.ALS Worldwide was able to bridge this information gap for my family - and helped us after many unsuccessful attempts to curb one of the most debilitating symptoms of our patient (pseudobulbar palsy), by pointing us to a targeted drug at the time still under FSA review in America. This drug treated the symptoms fully, much to the wonder of the patients physicians and neurologists...  Yet, accompanying ALS patients and their families through the mazes of diagnosis and treatment protocols is only half of ALS Worldwides wide ranging mission. Each of their patient visits across America or abroad affords an excuse to inspect and survey the leading neurology research centres and hospitals from such places, identifying along the way some of the most interesting/upcoming research. I believe ALS Worldwide, along with other Non-Profit Organisations advocating for a faster delivery of treatments to patients, plays an important catalytic role for tomorrows cures to be developed today.For these reasons, as well as Steve and Barbara Byers tireless and selfless personal commitment to fight a disease they couldnt defeat in their own family, I chose to support ALS Worldwide.

I really felt the sincerety like even more than any of my relatives. They were the only one who really understood our situation. Our feelings about not being able to do anyhing about our most loved one,my mum, was killing us day by day but they gave such great help and support that we could continue our life.they made us obtain symptom relieveing meds that were really helpful.  You feel that you are not alone and there is hope and there is something to do.This is very important because if you lose your hope , you lse everthing as this is the worst diagnosis that the human being can take I think. I also met them in stanbul,they were really helpful and kind. We spent several hours together but I haven't seen any sign of that they got bored of our several questions that we hadn't got reply from anyone until then .They were so friendly and sincere. We really had great time together. They also spoke with my mum on Skype and fortunately directed us to the doctor Merit Cudkowich from MGH. They helped us with the all contacts and procedures step by step.By means of them,we got the courage to see doctor abroad. And I think this is the most true decision we have taken so far. We had some problem at the biiling department at MGH. We were really got shocked and stressed. They were the first people I called without hesitation and again only people who really relieved us. I don't know what I could do without their assistance.By their support ,we could turn back to our country in safe.Thanks to God ,we met them in this really desperate situation . We are very lucky and we will be debtful and grateful to them throughout our life.And they have never charged anything from us for their service so far.                                                                                                 Yasemin Akarsu

Their selfless dedication to investigate every avenue of potential treatment and assistance while striving to protect a desperate and highly vulnerable group is to be commended. Their ability to successfully petition for an open label trial of Dexpramipexole has allowed me to slow the progress of this terrible disease and afforded me a commodity upon which no price can be placed  time with my family. At ages 4 and 9 my children have the myriad experiences of growing up still ahead of them and there is nothing I wish more than to stand by my wife and watch our children grow, to laugh and play with them, to pick them up when they fall down, and to give them the unconditional love that only a parent can know. These are things I had been told I would never know. The efforts of ALSWW have given me more than just invaluable time with my family, they have also given me a glimmer of hope. The medications they provide help me to maintain a functional existence while my family and I wait for the breakthrough that will bring an end to this cruel and relentless disease. I have no doubt that an answer is near at hand, but without the efforts of organizations such as ALSWW this answer is at risk of remaining just beyond our reach. I am deeply grateful for not only the medical support I have been given but also for the understanding and compassion shown by Steve and Barbara. They have been a rare source of warmth in what is often a cold world of life with ALS. I would ask any who can to support them in their endeavour to overcome this terrible disease and play a part in bringing hope and joy to thousands who have been given only despair. Our sincerest thanks The Edwards familySydney, Australia

We looked at a variety of "cures", we traveled within the USA and were about  to travel to India when we heard about ALS Worldwide,  Stephen and Barbaras mission,  their son Ben , and their willingness to share the knowledge they were compiling. They never claimed to be an expert but rather would travel to meet and speak to the scientists in the field as well as expose the frauds.  We would never be able to find this information on our own. Over these past four years,  ALS WW has countered our despair with hope and our  questions with options,   all the while building a friendship of humor and mutual fondness for each other.  We can't thank ALSWW enough and don't know where we would be without ALSWW.   Kathy Keenan Bennington, VT  
Als Worldwide	168568		/users/profile/223498	Charles Goslee	Client Served	5	09/09/2013	Dear Friends of ALS WORLD WIDE: I would like to provide  you with a testimonial to both the incredible Organization of ALS Worldwide, and most importantly the dear souls , the Byers, who have dedicated their entire lives of "Devotion" to the cause of Helping all ALS afflicted patients and their families with so much love and caring and help. Let me explain : First, some context please:  My Wife of 47 years,  Elaine , 65 years old at teh time, and in great health, had slurring issues develop and worsen in 6 months.  Some misdiagnosis occurred , our  panic when it was tested with the abhorrent EMG test and found to be ALS, followed by our personal denials  and the familiar Lyme disease diversion routines,  then massive searches for the  #1 ALS clinics, Doctors who were at the top of all ongoing clinical trials, and not to dismiss the terrible sadness and dejection on our part when we  researched the progression rate and the absolute guarantee of death (100% )  of varying degree's ,but terminal certainty and short longevity.  We commenced into the short 2 year journey with God, Dr Merit of Mass General Clinic, and our new Dear Loved Friends, Barbara and Stephen Byer, of ALS WORLDWIDE. During our research , we found that there was a myriad of sites professing to help with what 'cures, clinical trials, mouse and genetic research, patient variability, and on and on. Baffling beyond imagination.  At the ALS Clinic at Mass Gen, we were told we would not be eligible for any current Clinical trials..they were all closed already. That the  promising Biogen medication in the phased trial had promise, but all dosages were taken. DEAD END FOR US.  We were suggested to look up ALS Worldwide who had some very limited access to the Biogen drugs approved by the Feds for special needs.  We then contacted Barbara and Stephen Byers at ALS Worldwide for help. The Extent of help by this INCREDIBLE couple and organization cannot be understated. They provided the most important of all medicines possible in this world...namely LOVE, CARING, SUPPORT, MEETING US PERSONALLY, THEIR WORLD WIDE DEDICATED TRAVELS TIRELESSLY FOR EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS MEDICALLY, AND RESEARCH OF EVERY KNOWN TRIAL FOR ALS, STATUS OF THOSE EFFORTS AND SO MUCH MORE.  They shared with us the loss of their son to ALS, and gave us a copy of a personal movie of his life that he made and the insurmountable courage and achievement he achieved...it was breathlessly exhilarating. One could hardly feel down when you meet with these Owners and their absolute saint like devotion to every single human being who has this evil disease.  They felt everyone's pain personally.  Having said that, they managed to find us a prescription to the experimental medicine from within their organization allotment . We were blessed, it gave us some hope for survival, albeit small because of the nature of the disease...but hope it was.  Further, their research into all world wide medical trails and developments is one of a kind.  In essence,  one site, all information one needed to comprehend what is and not possible and what is the medical hope of the near future for patients.  What more could one ask.  My wife died from complications of ALS. I know she loved the Byers deeply, and Dr Merit too of MGH who works with Steve and Barbara as well.  I would ask every single person who has any means to support this organization , your generosity is so very needed to help them continue their pursuits and provide the leading patient support and critical information base in the world.  ALS is EVIL beyond any single Neurological disease.  Brings a healthy person to the depths of human dignity loss. It must be helped, cured and supported. I truly beg of all you who read this note to give with your heart and dig deeply for all those souls who suffer this tragic prognosis.  I and my wife in Heaven thank you for any support you might provide. CHUCK AND ELAINE GOSLEEEASTHAM, MA 02642NAPLES , FL 34114

The owners are lazy and don't know half of what goes on there! They don't even clean the pooh out of the cages of the wolves! The camel lives in a cold barn all winter in a tiny horse stall!! They have a cougar that lives under the stairs of a building with no light or heat! There employe chuck is on heavy medication and shouldn't be around animals or people for that matter! And like I said the owner knows nothing about what is going on and are lazy!! Even there house should be condemned!! They should of been shut down years ago!!
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	122810		/users/profile/38465	vieauvic	Volunteer	5	09/21/2012	Valley of the Kings goes above and beyond basic needs to care for their animals.  I had the honor of helping take Assam, a tiger, to a veterinarian clinic for his second and third surgery.  Assam was first operated on in September of 2011 for a cancerous tumor on his cheek.  At first it was thought to be an abscessed tooth.  The first operation in September bought this awesome tiger some time.  His second operation in December of 2011 bought him some more time.  He just had his third operation to remove the returning tumor and we hope to have bought him even more time.  Other places don't necessarily give the quality of life care that VOTK has made part of their mission and promise to the animals they take in.   VOTK gives each animal the best care they can with the people and resources they have.  The residents at VOTK are loved and cared for above and beyond just a place to live.  They have arrived at a very special place.  I believe the volunteers and owners feel blessed to be able to participate in this activity and honored to know these amazing animals.  If good karma was bright--VOTK would glow like the northern lights.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37766	1	/users/profile/38465	vieauvic	Volunteer	5	05/01/2010	I became a member in August 2009 and a volunteer in October.  I cannot express how healing it is to work with these amazing and loving animals.  With over 50 big cats and various farm animals living close together, you really appreciate the love, care, and dedication this place generates every day.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	122798		/users/profile/167261	cadrian	Volunteer	5	09/21/2012	I am a certified veterinary technician in the state of Illinois. One of our class volunteer trips was to visit VOTK and that's where i first got involved. As a CVT, it is my job to assist in the health and well-being of the animal kingdom. I firmly believe because of the unconditional love and non judgemental character our animal companions offer us, it is my duty to provide the up most health service i can in repayment for how our friends can benefit our lives. Once i became a regular volunteer at VOTK, i learned that any animal, pocket sized or 900 pounds, is capable of providing people with health benefits we all are familiar with. Being a volunteer here has changed my world in ways indescribable and is of course a once in a lifetime opportunity!!
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	122709		/users/profile/167133	AndyCarlson	Volunteer	5	09/20/2012	My name is Andy Carlson and I have been a volunteer at Valley of the Kings for 16 1/2 years.  VOTK is in my opinion, a model for how a big cat sanctuary should be managed and operated.  Jill and Jim are completely devoted to the animals in their care and they have truly worked some miracles for their animals.  Most of the big cats have come from abandoned, abused or neglected backgrounds.  Jill and Jim, along with the help of their dedicated volunteers have helped heal the animals not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically.  To see these animals being reborn through love, kindness and respect is simply amazing.  The other magical thing is, the animals share this message with new arrivals.  Last year a new tiger arrived as it was just turning dark.  As the back of the special transport trailer was opened we could see the tiger in his rolling crate and he was not real happy.  He didnt know where he was and he had been on the road for a number of hours.  As he started to growl, suddenly in the darkness behind us we heard the lions and tigers who live at VOTK let out a thunderous chorus roar, as if to say its okay, you are safe here, welcome home, we are glad you are here to join us.  Within seconds of the new arrival hearing that message you could see him almost as though he was taking a deep breath, exhaling and starting to relax.  This is only one story that illustrates how dedicated and committed VOTK is to the animals in her care. Thank you,Andy Carlson   . 
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37407	6	/users/profile/38122	catsr4ever	Volunteer	5	04/29/2010	I first stepped onto Valley of the Kings' property in April 2003. They had me with the first roar! I knew I had found what my heart had been searching for all my life. The energy from the big cats envelopes you and sustains you all day.  I have never worked so hard and enjoyed it so much in my life.  The animals are so grateful for our being there.  You can see the love in their eyes. After a day of hard work it is often even harder to get in the car and drive off.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37395	6	/users/profile/38111	darylynn1	Volunteer	5	04/29/2010	I have never been to a sanctuary quite like this one. The people who volunteer are incredible, the people who run it are unlike anyone I have ever met (in a very good way), and the animals are mesmerizing!
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37294	6	/users/profile/38026	laurie5	Volunteer	5	04/28/2010	I have been volunteering at Valley of the Kings  (VOTK) for just over a year. In addition to the big cats, VOTK has a variety of other animals that were in need of refuge. Whatever circumstances brought these animals to VOTK's doorstep, the result was the same, they were finally home. Regardless of the chore a volunteer does, not only do the animals benefit but so does the volunteer. Its a win-win situation for all involved. The animals now have a forever home and volunteers get the privilege of seeing them flourish and grow. It is this type of environment that makes VOTK truly define the word sanctuary.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37278	6	/users/profile/38008	susan25	Volunteer	5	04/28/2010	I live 25 miles away from VOTK and I am amazed about how many locals have no idea that VOTK exists. It is not only a wonderful place for all the animals to find their forever home, it is also a blessing to me to be able to share my life with the animals, the owners and the volunteers. As soon as I pull up to the gate the positive energy fills me and prepares me for the day of hard but very rewarding work. I love each and every animal there and take great joy in spending one on one time when I can.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	37082	4	/users/profile/37844	sharon10	Volunteer	5	04/27/2010	Valley of the Kings provides food, shelter, veterinary care, love and forever homes for abused, neglected and abandonded animals, primarily large cats.  It has been a joy to watch animals being transformed from a thin, scared state into healthy, happy critters.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	36822	4	/users/profile/37600	hpgal	Donor	5	04/24/2010	Valley of the Kings does an absolutely amazing job caring for animals with extremely limited resources. Many of these animals come to them from abusive situations, requiring extensive care, which is provided with a huge dose of love. I never cease to be amazed by what a small group of committed, volunteers accomplish at this wonderful sanctuary.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	36762	4	/users/profile/37545	bethkronwall	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	Valley of the Kings Sanctuary and Retreat is an amazing place. The animals who come to live there get the best care financially possible and all of the love we have. The people that I work with are dedicated to the animals and inspire me to come back week after week. The animals themselves are incredibly sociable and grateful, I can tell. VOTK does so much good work and has saved so many animals, but we have the capability to do more if only we had more money.
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	36175	4	/users/profile/36962	angel1	Volunteer	5	04/19/2010	I have been a volunteer at The Valley of the Kings, (VOTK) for over 5 years. I started out cleaning up the compound after the horses and sheep were out all week long. What a lot of work that was. Then I got to fill the big cat's water buckets. That was very rewarding. The lions and tigers always love fresh water....and when you fill the tigers bath tubs....what joy. Most tigers love to soak in their tubs for hours on hot summer days, and can not wait for you to fill the tubs with fresh cold water.I have done many jobs there since my first year. I have been on many many tours of VOTK and every one is very educational and interesting, still. There is so much to learn about these animals, from the bunny rabbits to the lions. VOTK is about big cats, and their hardships before they arrive at the farm. But the owners do not keep the sanctuary just for the big cats. There are many other different kinds of animals there, that needed a forever home.One of my most memorable tid bits of a tour was that there are now more tigers in captivity than there are out in the wild. And most of the captive tigers are not treated as they should be. That is why sanctuaries are around, to take the animals that need love and excellent care.Valley of the Kings can use every penny possible for feeding and caring for the animals and upgrades on the enclosures and buildings.Thank you so much for this opportunity!
Valley Of The Kings Sanctuary And Retreat	34960	7	/users/profile/35813	catpurrson	Volunteer	5	04/07/2010	I have been a volunteer at VOTK for over 10 years and it is a place of love and devotion to those animals that live there. Most of the rescues are the big cats, but they take any animal in need from horses to sheep to lions to wolves and more. It is a farm-not fancy- and any money received goes into the care of the animals. They are all fed on a daily basis and all have a shelter area and toys. (Watching the big cats playing with large balls just like a house cat is so fun).The pens are large enough to  run in; much unlike the places many have come from. It is painful to see these animals come when they are thin and fearful of humans and even open spaces. But after a bit they gain weight and aren't so scared, and you know that you have helped give them a much better life. When they actually recognize you and come to the fence to greet you; well, there is no better feeling in the world.
Eagles Nest Center Inc	132691	2	/users/profile/178342	misssplittstoesser	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	I find the people involved in this organization to be some of the most genuine and heartfelt people I know. Their emphasis is not only on a person's problem or specific area of need, but on a whole person,  mentally/physically/emotionally/ spiritually.  Their approach is to accept all people exactly as they are upon their first meeting; acknowledging that all have something to offer. Through deep respect of the individual, tapping into what is already good, and through sincere concern for the both the person and the community, inner and thus outer growth becomes a focus. Under such forthright conditions, it is impossible for positive growth not to occur! I truly count my affiliation with this organization a blessing. 
Eagles Nest Center Inc	127786		/users/profile/172887	pcopper	Donor	4	10/22/2012	I have been a part of Eagle's Nest as a donar and Board Member.  I find this organization to be strongly connected to their mission statement and passionate in their work.  I am very proud to say that I will stay connected to them in the years to come and look forward to more of our nation community to join in and support them.  They are there to represent youth and their families in every way they can.  Monetary support for them  would make a world of difference in our community and help this organizaton move forward.
Eagles Nest Center Inc	126349		/users/profile/62700	Chris	Donor	5	10/17/2012	Eagle's Nest Center is an important part of our community. There is little in the way of government sponsored programs for at risk youth in the area, as well as  for the State of Wisconsin as a whole. With spending cuts for social programs an issue as the State and National governments try to balance their respective budgets, programs like the one Eagle's Nest Center provides are paramount in maintaining the mental and emotional well being of our communities. My hat's off to the founders of Eagle's Nest Center for standing by their vision during such hard economic times. These are the times we need such dedication the most!
Eagles Nest Center Inc	58690		/users/profile/62700	Chris	Volunteer	5	12/11/2010	I've helped Bob and Judy with different youth functions as well as taking troubled youth climbing as an excercise in team building and growth in self confidence.  There are certain tools that everyone should have to help themselves progress in life. Often times people have not recieved these tools through poor upbringing or because somebody had taken them away through some experience along the way.   It takes alot of work to break bad habits, to change a deeply engrained self image, and to instill confidence in someone who's felt worthless for a long time. It takes time, patience, understanding, and alot of faith.  This is why alot of counseling doesn't work. You sit in a sterile room for one hour a week while someone talks at you about what's wrong with you based on some text book they read somewhere. Bob and Judy will sit at their own kitchen table and talk with you, listen to you, and work with you for as long as it takes. This is when you connect with people. This is when people realize what they have to say or have experienced is important....this is when they begin to feel important. When you start to feel like you matter then you can start the healing.  Bob and Judy know this better than anyone I've meet. Before becoming a volunteer, they helped me change the direction of my life. I went from selling drugs and living life as a party to getting my graduate degree, and have begun taking on personal goals like climbing some of the tallest mountains in the world.  The bottom line is that Bob and Judy have given their lives to helping other people change theirs.

Eagles Nest Center Inc	102241		/users/profile/132740	ckohel	Volunteer	5	12/13/2011	The holidays are a hard time for some families in terms of financial problems and that can lead to alcohol and substance abuse. Family problems don't take a break for the holidays and Eagles Nest Center doesn't either. They know the importance of being available for people during these hard times. The services Eagles Nest Center provides for families are the type that can save an otherwise broken Holiday season. I have to commend them and their commitment to such work when most other people take this time off.

They are known and respected in the International Native American Religious community. The wellspring of spiritual blessings that flows so freely from both of them is a testimony in itself to their spiritual authority.

I was hospitalized for 9 days and was falling apart in all areas of my life.Eagles nest opened their home for residential living for a while so I could start praying on how I could start putting one foot in front of the other.Bob & Judy helped save my life.

He new I needed healing from the wounds of my youth. I participated in some of the traditional teachings and was able to turn my life around for the better. I wish I was nearer to the facility to be able to support more.  When I can,  I give a bit of time or a bit of money. I trust over these last 12 years that the organization formed out of a giveaway of service, time and healing. We need these teachings for the ones that tend to fall through the cracks in the system. These teachers have the determination and fortitude worthy of investment. Those youth that give the ENCI a chance will find there are other ways to make it through hard times. They will learn strength, courage, humility and gratitude. Give! Give! Give! to the Eagle Nest Center Inc.

Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	47725	1	/users/profile/48459	rob9	Client Served	5	07/03/2010	In November 2006, I was diagnosed with form of childhood bone cancer at age 19.  I was immediately recommended to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and was able to speak to a specialist instead with in 12 hours of having my first x-ray. Three days later Rob started 10 months of chemotherapy treatment that required him to spend over 100 days in the hospital. I had his treatments at Childrens Hospital of Wisconsin and had a vigorous schedule that required him to remain inpatient for weeks at a time. Along with chemotherapy, I had 3 major reconstructive surgeries to remove the tumor in his right wrist. One of the procedures required the removal of his left fibula, muscle tissue, and some skin from his leg to replace the bone and tissue that had been removed from his right forearm. Since then I had a surgery in May to repair a complication with one of the tendons. The surgery was a success and I has been doing well ever since. I will be in his 3rd year of remission this June!  As a survivor, I don't think that I could have made it through the treatment if it wasn't for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.

Our two sons were flown by Theda Star to CHW for their injuries.  Our youngest son (then 11) had broken his back and had severe trauma to his abdomen and was paralyzed from the mid-chest down.  Children's Hospital staff quickly took hold of the situation with excellent care and concern.  As parents we always felt well informed.  Our son spent 6 weeks recovering and learning how to sit up again.  His surgeons, nurses and therapists were all incredible.

Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44306	7	/users/profile/45280	judy55	Client Served	5	06/17/2010	In 2007 our 11 year old daughter suddenly went into heart failure.  When this happened we were told to say our good-byes as there was a very good chance she would not make it.  Due to the expertise of the staff of Children's, Erica is still here with us today.  Within 48 hours of Erica going into heart failure, she was diagnosed with a rare disease called Takayasu Arteritis and dilated cardio-myopathy.  Erica spent the next 30 days at Children's.  During that time the staff became like family to us.  We saw them cheering with our highs and tearing with our lows. As you can imagine our daughter was very sick and very scared.  Dr. Nancy would sit next to Erica and talk with her, comfort her and engage her in conversation that would take her mind off what was happening.  Every staff member that entered her room showed nothing but compassion and concern.  Not only did they tend to Erica's needs, they also took care of our families needs.  Always explaining what was happening, making sure we understood and making us feel like Erica was one of their own family members.  Erica is still being seen by many specialists at Children's and it amazes when we see staff that have cared for her, they know her by name and ALWAYS take a minute or two to ask how she is doing and chat with her.  From the parking attendants, to volunteers, to public relations people, to cafe workers, to the nurses, doctors and specializes, Children's Hospital is a blessing to our community.

The staff made sure we knew what was going on at all times, and answered our questions.  If a nurse didn't know an answer to one of our questions, she would make sure to find out for us.

Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44257	7	/users/profile/45169	tammy10	Client Served	5	06/17/2010	We love Children's Hospital of WI.  Our experience was with their NICU staff.  My first child, Zachary, was born at 29 weeks.  He weighed 2lbs 2oz and was 14 inches long at birth.  He was hospitalized for 66 days and during the course of that stay he not only battled all of the prematurity issues, but also had a battle with Staph and Rotovirus.  I cannot begin to explain the stress level when your first child is born prematurely.  It is a constant struggle everyday dealing with all of the ups and downs of a preemie.  The staff at Children's Hospital of WI Fox Valley was phenomal!  Not only did they care for Zachary, but they cared for our entire family.  The day of his discharge was so exciting and terrifying, but also a day of sadness, since it felt like we were leaving family behind, because each and every person that is involved with the NICU feels like family.Little did we know that we would experience the NICU twice.  Our second child, Madelyn, was born at 32 weeks gestation and weighed 3lbs 4oz and was 15 inches long.  She was hospitalized for 32 days.  The second visit to the NICU seemed a lot less traumatic.  It is still stressful leaving your baby behind, but this time I was very knowledgeable about the staff and all of the procedures so I think that helped us a lot.I cannot say enough good things about the NICU team from Children's.  They are all wonderful people and have enriched our lives so much by taking such good care of our children when they were at their most fragile states.

We have had unexpected visits and they were right here to help us through the tough times. Its been a year since we first came to CHW and I wouldnt have changed my experience one bit. I would recommend this hospital for any oncology visit. CHW ROCKS!!

Since then she has had open heart surg., had 4 implanted pacemakers and had a stroke just days prior to her 21st birthday.  All her hospital experiences were at Childrens Hosp.  As a parent when your child tells you to sleep at home because she is safe and comfortable enough to sleep at the hospital without me, that means the world to someone who has slept in the room or gone without sleep until your child wakes up!Thank you Childrens Hospital for all you do.We will be coming back for a heart transplant, we wouldn't have it done anywhere else.
Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44222	7	/users/profile/45143	jms88	Client Served	5	06/17/2010	FOLLOWING THE EMERGENCY C-SECTION DELIVERY OF MY DAUGHTER, ALICIA, SHE WAS IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, SO THE DOCTOR AND NURSES STARTED RESURSCITATION EFFORTS, BUT HER CONDITION WAS NOT IMPROVING. THERE WERE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS MADE TO INTUBATE HER AND DURING THIS TIME HER LUNG HAD COLLAPSED.  ALICIA WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE NICU OF CHILDRENS HOSPITAL OF WISCONSIN-FOX VALLEY WHERE SHE WAS TREATED FOR RIGHT TENSION PHEUMOTHORAX (A HOLE IN THE LUNG) AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. ALICIA WAS PUT ON A RESPIRATOR AND HAD A CHEST TUBE INSERTED TO HELP HER BREATH, SHE WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION BUT STABLE.  A FEW DAYS LATER ALICIA DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA WHICH THE NURSES EXPLAINED WAS VERY COMMON  WITH THIS TYPE OF CONDITION. THE DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE ALSO MONITORING ALICIA FOR A HEART MURMUR TOO.  SHE WAS UNABLE TO NURSE OR DRINK SO SHE HAD TO BE TUBE FEED FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS. WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT A WEEK OLD SHE STARTED TO DRINK SMALL AMOUNTS BUT WAS STILL STRUGGLING WITH HER BREATHING.  SHE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO BREATH AND ALSO NURSE, BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN HER BODY WEIGHT WITH THE TUBE FEEDINGS AND FLUIDS SHE WAS RECEIVING.  ONCE THE PNEUNOMIA CLEARED SHE STARTED EATING ON HER OWN VERY QUICKLY.  ALICIA RECEIVED HER LIFE SAVING TREATMENT AND CARE FOR THE TEN DAYS AT THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL WHERE ALL THE DOCTORS AND NURSES TREATED YOU LIKE YOU WERE FAMILY AND ALWAYS EXPLAINED ALL THE PROCEDURES AND TREATMENTS IN TERMS THAT MY FAMILY AND I COULD UNDERSTAND. IF WE HAD ANY QUESTIONS THEY ALWAYS HAD OR WOULD GET AN ANSWER.ALICIA IS NOW ONE YEARS OLD AND IS A VERY HEALTHY ENERGETIC GIRL.  YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED THAT SHE HAD SUCH A DIFFICULT START INTO LIFE.I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THE LOVING SUPPORT AND CARE THAT ALICIA AND I RECEIVED AT THE NICU OF CHILDRENS HOSPITAL OF WISCONSIN-FOX VALLEY THAT WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN.  I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND BLESS THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL FOR ALL THE DEDICATION AND WORK FOR ALL THE SPECIAL CARE THAT THEY GIVE TO ALL THE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AT THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL'S.
Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44219	9	/users/profile/45141	kellkohl	Client Served	5	06/17/2010	My son, Eltayrius, was in the Children's Hospital in Milwaukee for 64 days after he was born. He was in the NICU. Eltayrius was born two and a half months early at three pounds. He had many problems when he was born. The staff in the NICU helped me so much. When I needed a hug they gave me a hug. If I needed information about what was going on, they were there to explain it to me.There is one thing that sticks in my head. I was going to see my baby for the first time. I went into the POD and saw my baby and just fell over in tears. The nurse came to me and said everything is going to work out and you have to be strong for him. She helped me up and gave me the biggest hug. I could feel how much she cared about him and his family.The doctors were also wonderful. It was great to see a group of five or six doctors consulting about my baby. I knew he was getting the best care possible. I can not express how much the staff at Children's helped me through that time. Living an hour away and being winter time, I could not always make it to the hospital to see my precious baby boy. I would call and the nurses would always inform me about everything that happened during the day and night. The nurses always stayed positive through everything. There are so many positive things that I can say about this hospital. The staff felt like family when I walked out the hospital with my baby. The negatives of having a premature baby where turned into a positive by the great care he recieved and the love our family got from all the staff members.
Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44144	6	/users/profile/45059	dustin2	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2010	Our son Parker has spent a good portion of his life at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We knew that he was sick before he was born.  The technical diagnosis is "bilateral kidney dispaysia".  For all of us who are not doctors, this means that neither of his kidneys worked.  He spent the first 128 days of his life in the NICU, and has been re-admitted 16 times since that first discahrge.  He has been through 12 surgeries, some minor, and some very major.  The last of which was his kidney transplant.  It has been 16 weeks since my wife donated one of her kidneys to Parker, and thye are both doing great.  The doctors and nurses took very good care of both Parker and Lindsay throughout the transplant evaluation, the surgery itself and follow up care.  I know first hand how brilliant doctors at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin are.  The quality of care that has been provided by the nurses is unbelievable.  They take care of not only the patient, but also the family of the patient.  The entire staff, from the volunteers to the facility service workers all truly care about the patient.  This is an amazing facility that people from all over the United States travale to, and we are fortunate enough to have it right in our back yard.
Childrens Hospital Of Wisconsin Inc	44128	8	/users/profile/45041	daisyray	Client Served	5	06/16/2010	My son arrived at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin by helicopter. He had contracted Meningococcemia, a deadly bacterial infection in his blood. He was given excellent medical care. He spent 161 days as a patient at CHW. Not only were his medical needs taken care of, but also his emotional needs. The staff at Children's took care of our entire family making sure we had everything we needed to cope with our situation. We were always kept informed about every aspect of our child's care. Our son was being seen by many different departments (orthopedic, plastics, rehab, nephrology...) and we had regularly scheduled care conferences which were meetings where all of the departments were represented and all care could be coordinated. Despite suffering amputations to all four extremities, our son is living a normal life and doing almost everything a teenage boy should be able to do. We have made many friends at Children's. Even though the hospital is two hours from where we live, we continue to use their services because we know our son will receive the best care possible.

I cannot say enough about how pleased I have been with the staff, the facilities, and the experiences they have received.  Every staff member has been caring, friendly, and a positive influence in the lives of my children.  The facilities are gorgeous!  They kids have room to play both inside and outside, a swimming pool to enjoy, and all areas are maintained beautifully.  The experiences included music therapy, swimming, and the intergenerational activities have made my children more caring and accepting of differences.

The St. Ann's intergenerational care model affords the opportunity for children, individuals with disabilities, elder adults and those needing respite care to interact and engage on a daily basis. The care provided by staff is personal with many special touches integrated to ensure that client needs are met. Having had a parent that had Alzheimer's for over 20 years, I wish that I had known about such a special place as St. Ann's that could have met the needs of our parents in such a golden but critical time in their lives.

We are blessed to have Sister Edna and St. Ann's Center here in Milwaukee founded over 25 years ago. The need is there, so much that we have just embarked on a new location plan for the North side of Milwaukee. As the Sisters of St Francis of Assisi say, "go to help the most needy". That is our core values and mission here at St. Ann Center. A fabulous place indeed helping so many people every day.

Every day I associate not only with my coworkers, but also the adults and children who come to the center for day services. Many of the adults are challenged with disabilities, and their attitudes  and behavior despite these disabilities, are truly an inspiration and model for me. As our founder, Sr. Edna Lonergan, discovered early on, the children are a joy, energetic contribution to the daily life of the center, and are therapy in their own, special way, just be being who they are. I am grateful to enjoy so wonderful a workplace and to be a witness so much goodness and vitality daily.

Not only do they have a commitment to working with neighbors to build communities that are good for people and good for the environment, they care deeply about the relationships they are building to make this happen. In every interaction I have had with the organization, I have found warm, caring individuals who are highly intelligent and determined to make a difference in the lives of others.

(www.schoolfoodfocus.org) CRC understood the organizational needs of the backbone organization and supported the collaborative, collective impact structure by physically housing staff, assisting with infrastructure needs and providing professional support upon request.  It really was a demonstration of the organization's ability to live, breathe and carry out their mission in a very synegistic way - CRC's impact is visionary and truly greater than the sum of it's parts!
Center for Resilient Cities	225349	1	/users/profile/289127	CarmenS	Donor	5	10/23/2014	I have been so impressed by the commitment to the community expressed through this organization. Time and time again, the mission of holding the community as the driving vision and owners of the work is expressed whether by a name change or a moment's pause to make sure all contributions (monetary or not) are given their recognition. It's no wonder they are seeing change in the resilience of the neighborhoods in which they work. When you nurture the whole being and work on increasing their health and general well-being, you are empowering people with resilience.
Center for Resilient Cities	111142	1	/users/profile/151281	Karen66	Donor	5	04/30/2012	What a wonderful organization! From the concept of only going where invited and engaging the community in all aspects of the planning process, it is easy to see why the Center for Resilient Cities has such a successful track record. When a community invests its time, energy and resources in creating its vision, how can the outcome be anything but successful? Wrapping those concepts in a resilient platform concentrated on doing the earth good while at the same time revitalizing a community and everyone wins. I read some of the other reviews and I whole-heartedly agree with Nancy who said that the Center for Resilient Cities simply "gets it." 
Center for Resilient Cities	110646	1	/users/profile/150619	Nancy Ketchman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/24/2012	Our agency has collaborated with Center for Resilient Cities many times over the years on a number of projects and successful grant proposals dealing with inner city greening efforts and food system work.  One of the Centers programs  Alices Garden  has been a key participant and vendor in our farmers market, selling sustainably grown produce sown, nurtured, and harvested by by local neighborhood residents at the Garden.  Several participants from Alices Garden are also participating at our Port Washington farm to help transition from a smaller, backyard garden to a larger, income-producing plot.  As a background, our agencies are located in an area underserved by quality grocery stores and overpopulated with fast food restaurants and corner convenience stores.  The chronic shortage of fresh fruits and vegetables, when combined with poverty and a lack of transportation, create food insecurity, or the inability to obtain and consume affordable food.  While our agency is working to solve some of the food security issues in the area, we also realize that healthier food is meaningless without safe places for families to walk and play, nutritious school lunch programs, and access to educational and economic opportunities.   This is where the Center for Resilient Cities comes in. The Center brought together many competing nonprofits, social service agencies, government agencies, and churches and started a shared conversation about how to create a vibrant, robust, and healthy community. The strength of the Center for Resilient Cities lies in their ability to listen to residents and to put together projects that promote resident-identified wants and needs.  They excel at synchronizing the efforts of distinct and sometimes competing entities to work towards a common goal.

Center for Resilient Cities	110404	1	/users/profile/150300	Matt Schreiner	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2012	The Center for Resilient Cities is currently constructing the Resilience Research Center.  This has been one of the most exciting projects I have had the privilege to be involved with.  In regard to stormwater runoff, the Center for Resilient Cities has set the bar extremely high.  This project has been designed to detain and infiltrate 100% of the storm water runoff volume generated on the 3.9 AC site and a 2.0 AC offsite area draining to the site. This level of treatment far exceeds regulatory requirements and is the most ambitious stormwater goal I have ever seen for a redevelopment project of this size.  This goal was accomplished through the use of green roofs, bio-retention basins, porous pavement, infiltration basins and a 60,000 gallon underground storage tank system for irrigation.  Harvesting rain water for irrigation will help to reduce demand on the City's water and storm sewer systems and will help to replenish the City's aquifer.  The Center for Resilient Cities commitment to sustainability is impressive!

Started by one communty member of inexhaustible energy who had/has a vision for the use of a very long and very wide area in the central city of Madison, Wisconsin.   What bettter use than a community park with amenities and  attractions for all ages and abilities.  The planning has taken years and still isn't a reality but focus of the park is now a project of the city of Madison.  The board and staff have moved to a new emphasis and name. We are now called the Center for Resilient Cities. Our current project is the development and building of a new school in conjunction with the Madison Metropolitan School District.  The of the curriculum is education and production of sustainable agriculture.  This has included the design and development of a new public school with active involvement of the surrounding community in defining the design of the school as well as the development of the curriculum.
Center for Resilient Cities	109059	2	/users/profile/148397	Chris Quandt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/05/2012	The Center for Resilient Cities is constructing The Resilience Research Center in Madison Wisconsin. This project has focus's on urban agriculture, neighborhood revitalization and education. The site of the project is an urban island where no grocery stores are present and all the children are bussed to school many miles away due to no elementary school in this area. This project will provide a charter school on a 4 acre parcel that is completely vegetaded with edible plants, trees and shrubs. Fruit and nut trees, vegetable gardens and berry plants will abound and will be irrigated using captured rainwater. The fruits and vegetables will be harvested, cleaned and cooked in the commercial kitchen in the school. Beside the building housing a charter school there will also be space for offices for Growing Power, an international urban agriculture non profit headquartered in Milwaukee Wisconsin and lead by Will Allen - one of Time Magazines top 100 people in the world for 2011. Also, a neighborhood center will be located in the building along with offices for Center for Resilient Cities. This building will be a LEED Platinum building. Energy consumption will be less than half of what a conventional building of this size uses. All rainwater will be captured from the entire site and utilized for irrigation. Aquaponics will be done in greenhouses and possibly hoop houses. PV solar energy is utilized. Waterless urinals are used. Tinted glazing is used to minimize solar gain which minimizes air conditioning load. This project is a phenomenal green project that deserves accolades from around the world.

Center for Resilient Cities	108974	2	/users/profile/148301	Nancy40	Board Member	5	04/04/2012	The Center for Resilient Cities simply "gets it".  The staff and fellow board members "get" that successful urban neighborhoods and sustainable cities require attention to the whole person and the total environment--natural and built.  Our projects use intensive community engagement, organizing people around those things that we can help with--water, energy, food, healthy living--and the things that neighborhood people care about.  I am always excited to hear our staff briefings about our projects; GreaterJohnsons Park in Milwaukee and the Resilience Research Center in Madison being our current projects underway.  Troy Gardens, a project completed some years ago, has won awards and has been featured in publications as an example of best practices.

The building will have a geothermal water cooled variable refrigerant flow system with heat recovery.  They also have community gardens, and will be growing perch and tilapia in their outdoor greenhouses.  This building will serve as a great example and a beacon of hope in the distressed community it serves.  It will also have a unique middle school that allows the students a real hands on approach to learning.  This is an exciting project.
Center for Resilient Cities	108953	2	/users/profile/148265	KateStalker	Donor	5	04/04/2012	Seven years ago near my house, sat a 2 block hodgepodge of vacant post-industrial parcels, only a mile from the Capitol.  I watched as the Center for Resilient Cities (then called the Urban Open Space Foundation) slowly aquired each.  After years of input, the new Central Park was sold to the City last year for $1.  Their next project, the Resilience Research Center, was conceived to fill a need in an underserved & isolated neighborhood on Madison's south side.  A 60,000 s.f. facility now under construction, will house offices and a farm for Growing Power Madison, a new project-based middle school where children will grow and cook their own food, the Resilience Neighborhood Center with a commercial incubator and neighborhood kitchen, teen center, and programming for all ages with a focus on healthy living through daily exercise and good food!  The facility is slated to become the highest rated LEED PLATINUM building in the world and boasts 278 geo-thermal wells, 60,000 gallon underground water storage tanks for irrigation, intensive urban agriculture, vermiculture, aquaponics, PV, greenhouses & hoophouses, orchards & cranberry bogs, porous pavement and so much more.  And that's only one project in Madison - the Center for Resilient Cities has other projects in Madison and several projects in Milwaukee as well.
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	230420		/users/profile/294055	sboule	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	A few months ago I was invited to attend one of the "Beyond the Classroom" performances at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts.  This unique daytime school series not only entertains our children but teaches important life lessons as well.  I wish everyone could have seen the joy on those kids faces!  The topics are varied: history, literature, music and drama, and their interpretations are discussed after each performance to further enrich the experience.  There were so many hands being raised the actors could hardly contain all the excitement in the room.  If everyone could experience an event like this they would know how vital the Wilson Center is to the Wisconsin arts landscape.  Our children deserve education in the arts and unfortunately not all have the means to do so.  It's programs such as these that will help ensure a better future for each one of them who is lucky enough to be touched by the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts.

The staff and volunteers at the SLWC made sure each student felt welcomed and valued.  The performance was also exceptionally remarkable, with one woman playing about 10 different characters.  Top notch! The offerings are varied, unique and plentiful.  There is something for everyone, at anyage and during any season.  My friends and I have enjoyed the variety of events, but especially the personable, enthusiastic and professional personnel.

Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	224453		/users/profile/288214	dpotratz	Board Member	5	10/20/2014	The greater Milwaukee arts community is especially fortunate to have The Wilson Center, one of the truly integrative arts venues in Southeastern Wisconsin. The Center offers so much! Not only can one and one's family enjoy an innovative array of performing and visual arts, the Center is growing in its importance in arts education for the area, instilling a cultural experience at an early age that benefits our children throughout their lives. What separates the Center from other institutions like it is its continual growth, offering new experiences to our communities with each passing year. The quality of life it brings is vital to the health and growth of not only Waukesha County, but surrounding counties as well, and adds to the attractiveness of Wisconsin as a place to not only work, but to play and raise a family. There is something for everyone at The Wilson Center. It is a very special place. I have been honored to serve as a Board Member for this year which is my way of saying "Thank you" for all the years my family has enjoyed performances and the people on staff and who frequent its events.
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	223792		/users/profile/287544	susancerletty	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	The Wilson Center's breadth of programming offers performance and exhibition offerings that expand my understanding and appreciation of creativity. The size of the stage provides a venue capable of fabulous dance performances. And the artist receptions provide the opportunity to see the art through the eyes of the artist. Ever enriching! 
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	222845		/users/profile/286589	Connie57	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	What a treasure in my own backyard! The Sharon Lynne Wilson Center has a great offering of concerts to please any listener, and they make it easy to pick and choose to tailor a season ticket selection to meet your own desires. My husband and I purchased a series for the very first time, and really enjoyed the first event.
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	222742		/users/profile/286485	mike999	Board Member	5	10/14/2014	The Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts provides our area with a fantastic mix of visual and performing arts offerings.  Through its educational programs, SLWCA also gives students from varied backgrounds opportunities to experience the arts that they would likely not otherwise have.  Get involved with SLWCA and find out for yourself!
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	222719		/users/profile/286457	tellmewhy	Volunteer	5	10/14/2014	While the live performance offerings are varied and outstanding, what makes the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts special are the youth arts education programs. They serve children year round from the entire SE Wisconsin area, including MPS, with programs ranging from live educational performances to hands on art classes. A wonderful learning environment.
Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts	222616		/users/profile/286351	Paul143	Board Member	5	10/14/2014	The Sharon Lynn Wilson Center for the Arts could very easily be the best kept secret in southeastern Wisconsin.  From a performance venue with world renowned entertainers to arts education, the Wilson Center has been able to fill avoid for the last 12 plus years.  If you haven't experienced it...perhaps you should.  Soon.

Einstein Project, Inc.	51369	2	/users/profile/52003	gronnert49	Donor	5	08/31/2010	We began our relationship with the Einstein Project four years ago when they approached us to fund their Wheels in Motion project.  We did that over a period of three years and were impressed with the professionalism of their operation, staff and board of directors.  They provide excellent hands-on curriculum in the schools; programs that might not otherwise be available.We are a major sponsor of their annual Butterflies and Friends Auction which draws a large number of area supporters and is a very successful event that the community always looks forward to.  Part of that success is the fact that they make the auction pieces available to the community for viewing.  It is great exposure for them and the artists and gives the opportunity for citizens in the community to view the fine pieces of art.
Einstein Project, Inc.	51269	1	/users/profile/51878	sandy15	Volunteer	5	08/30/2010	The Einsten Project, Inc puts on a yearly Science Expo for kids, the goal of the Expo is to give local businesses an opportunity to give back to the community by creating hands-on, fun activities about thier businesses for kids.  Last year in our company's booth, we made solar-bead bracelets and had an electrical safety demonstration.  In other booths kids were making Silly Puddy, Rockets, Paper and learning how to make simple machines.  There were also a variety of animals, reptiles and birds for the kids to get a closer look at and to learn about.  Overall, the Science Expo is a great family event!  It provides an educational & fun experience for everyone!The Einstein Project, Inc is an excellent organization who has demonstrated thier desire to give back to Green Bay and make it a great place to live.
Einstein Project, Inc.	51263	1	/users/profile/51873	mommylu	Client Served	5	08/30/2010	They were so very excited to see results and understand the reasons behind everyday things, like where butterflies come from, the moon, magnets, weight, floating.  With Einstein Project kits in the classroom, teachers have the resources to be "hands on" in science, rather than lecturing.  It is tailored to the way kids think and learn.
Einstein Project, Inc.	51201	1	/users/profile/51764	maribeth	Board Member	5	08/27/2010	Making science fun and exciting, plus easy to understand, is so important in keeping students involved and learning. And as the students learn more, they develop into young adults with the critical thinking skills necessary to allow our economy and technical/scientific programs to grow. The Einstein Project does a wonderful job of sparking that desire to learn with their hands-on science kits, teacher training, and more. When I first heard about Einstein's work, I was quite enthusiastic about what they were doing. Many years later, and with time spent helping by serving as a volunteer on the board, I am still impressed with what Einstein does and the positive effect it as on students.
Einstein Project, Inc.	50869	1	/users/profile/51375	sean-sanders	Board Member	5	08/21/2010	I have been lucky enough to be associated with The Einstein Project as a board member for the past 3 years. My employer, Festival Foods, has supported The Einstein Projects Mission of partnering with schools and communities to provide leadership and support for science education in Wisconsin. As a student many years ago I struggled mightily with science. I found science to be quite boring while trying to learn from a text book. I assumed science just wasnt for me. But the more I got involved I realized that the Project uses the philosophy of hands on learning to get young minds involved and engaged in the classroom. The Einstein Project realizes that as the environment becomes more endangered and as the technology becomes more complex, there is an increasing need for young people to become more knowledgeable in science, technology and mathematics. I only wish I had the chance to experience The Einstein Project as a kid and that helps fuel my fire to be involved with this great organization.
Einstein Project, Inc.	50338	1	/users/profile/50924	jeter2	Board Member	5	08/13/2010	When I joined the Einstein Project as a Board Member 4 years ago, I was already familiar with the work they do through my daughter-in-law, an elementary school teacher. She had been using the science kits in her classroom and loved them! She was very enthusiastic about the training and support she received as well as the positive results she saw in the classroom from her students. Once I was able to see "behind the scenes", I was amazed at what they accomplished with such a limited but dedicated staff. Despite the financial challenges and time restraints, the Einstein Project constantly strives to improve hands-on science for both the educators and the students. This is evident through training for educators, website information and reference links, updating and adding of kits. All of this is possible only through strong community support which the staff and Board have carefully nurtured throughout the years. As I have worked with volunteers at our fundraising events, it has been wonderful to see the commitment of so many people to help keep this program fiscally sound. They recognize the importance of the hands-on science education that the Einstein Project brings to so many students.
Einstein Project, Inc.	50289	1	/users/profile/50862	carmen3	Board Member	5	08/12/2010	It has been my privilege to be associated with The Einstein Project for more than 10 years.  As a former classroom teacher, I benefitted from utilzing a research and inquiry-based, hands-on Einstein Project unit to teach physical science concepts to my students in the sixth grade.  My students had fun learning and doing science because of The Einstein Project! I went on to become a trainer of one of the units and witnessed first-hand, the difference The Einstein Project has made in providing high quality materials and training to hundreds of teachers in our area.  As a member of the Einstein Project's Board of Directors for the past ten years, I have also had the opportunity to see a strong community and school partnership in service to our community. This organization is not only a leader in science education in our region, it is also an exceptional model for an organization which has effectively established partnerships and shown true engagement in our community!
Einstein Project, Inc.	50275	1	/users/profile/50845	marykornelyaolcom	Board Member	5	08/12/2010	I met the Einstein Project in the early 1990's when our school district was searching for a new science program.  This was a perfect match for me as a classroom teacher.  I did not have a good science background. The Einstein Project provided this with teacher training.  The units are hands-on and teacher friendly.  My students and I love the units!  As time went on I became a teacher trainer for 3 of the units.  Three times each year the Project provides training for classroom teacher who are new to the units.  I am also a member of the Einstein Board of Directors and the chairperson of the Education Committee.  The Einstein Project provides me, the classroom teacher, with the additional science backgroud that as an elementary teacher I did not have.  It also provides me with additional teaching strategies, curriculum extensions, technology, and much more.  This is the best way to teach elementary science.  The students comprehend science concepts of much higher levels by doing hands-on, not just reading from a textbook.
Einstein Project, Inc.	49143	1	/users/profile/50431	dness	Donor	4	08/04/2010	Festival Foods partners with The Einstein Project each year for the Grocers on the Green Golf Outing.  The event raises funds through event sponsorship, which in turn are donated to The Einstein Project.  Through all phases of the planning and event execution the Einstein associates and volunteers were great to work alongside.  The event was a huge success agian this year and there is no one more deserving of this donation than The Einstein Project.
Einstein Project, Inc.	49134	1	/users/profile/50418	narlt	Donor	5	08/04/2010	Eight years ago I was asked to meet with The Einstein Project to evaluate whether my company should or could partner with their organization. Going into the meeting, I was not optimistic about the possibilities. After that meeting and a few more, I was really able to see where the organization had come from, what it was currently doing and the vision they had. I was so impressed that we took on the Title Sponsor role of their largest fundraiser.It has been seven years of sponsorship and both the organization and our relationship have continued to grow. The impact that this organization has had on the youth that go through its program is phenomenal. Research has shown that the interest and knowledge of students in science has gone up dramatically, but equally as impressive scores in other areas of school improved significantly as well.The Einstein Project is a truly unique organization that is doing tremendous things in our communities!
Einstein Project, Inc.	37881	1	/users/profile/38603	bill-newhouse	Board Member	5	05/03/2010	15 years ago I was approached to join the Einstein Board of Directors.  I work for an Engineering and Sciences Consulting Company and felt it was a good way for me to bring the business aspects of the engineering career to this Educational organization. IT is so rewarding for me to see the interest in the grade school and middle school kids using these science learning kits that I am still an active participant on Einstein's Board of Dir.  I would have loved to learn science by using these interactive kits instead of reading text books and taking the occasional field tour.  Hands on learning has proven to be the best learning technique and I am proud to say that in a small way I am contirbuting to this learning style for several thousand students in Wisconsin.
Einstein Project, Inc.	3746	1	/users/profile/5522	Karmen Lemke	Board Member	5	04/21/2009	The Einstein Project is a nonprofit organization partnering with schools and communities to provide leadership and support for science education in Wisconsin. The Project offers 41 inquiry-based science units, developed by the Smithsonian Institution and National Academy of Sciences, to schools giving children the opportunity to learn by doing. The units allow schools to provide an exemplary hands-on science curriculum for students. The eight to twelve week units contain enough materials for an entire class and are leased to schools for a modest fee.My daughter loved the 2nd grade unit 'The Life Cycle of Butterflies'.  It opened her eyes and curiosity to nature and the world around her.  I would highly recommend Einstein sciene for schools.
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	322794		/users/profile/416826	overfiend2222	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2017	We met the Werner's because we also lost a child to meningitis.  We have supported the Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation for a number of years - their work and dedication in helping spread awareness about this disease and raising money for the cause is simply amazing.
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	91469		/users/profile/104656	DeafGary	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	I met Bob and Dee at the Second Annual PALs meeting, where I was a meningitis survivor and Dee told me their daughter had died from the disease.The three of us began corresponding and they, like I, find it hard to believe that people can see the devastation, caused by meningitis and still think the vaccine is unimportant. I am in the middle of writing a book about a cop, who is shot and paralyzed in the line of duty.  Things, I've learned from both the Meningitis Angels, as well as Bob and Dee, have allowed me to introduce a teenaged  character, who lost her hand and hobby (softball) to Meningitis and then allow the cop to encourage her to find another hobby....She learns she can write with her, formerly, non-dominant hand, as well as she could with the hand, she lost.  She even learns to draw!! With the memory of someone else, whom I met at the same meeting, where I met the Werners, I would like to allow that to show other meningitis survivors that meningitis doesn't have to be the end of living.  I do, however, wish it didn't take so many lives!      
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	91354		/users/profile/104469	Lauren J.	General Member of the Public	5	06/19/2011	When I was in high school the Werner family came to tell their story about Becky and it truly moved me, they shared their tragedy to prevent it from happening to us, a very difficult but courageous mission. As a board member of the University of Wisconsin HOSA, I invited them to come share their story with the Madison community as my club HOSA strives to share pertinent health care issues of today. Everyone who came were moved and so appreciative of the Werner's telling their story and many followed up stating they got vaccinated because of the Werner's story and mission or passed the information on to loved ones! Many thanks go to the Werner family for their amazing efforts to prevent this tragedy from occurring in another family!

My son contracted it 3 years ago.  
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	91085		/users/profile/104079	aclemieux	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2011	As a high school teacher, I see first hand how naive young people are to this disease.  Most have no idea how meningitis is spread.  Through the education that Werner's have provided to me, I am able to help spread their message.  I thank them for that and for all their hard work to help educate people.
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	91027		/users/profile/103993	marylynn	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	The Werners have worked extremely hard to educate teens and their families about Meningitis.  Through the Becky Werner Foundation, they do presentations at schools all over the state of Wisconsin, host events to raise awareness of Meningitis, including being a part of an international group that has established World Meningitis Day.  They also have golf outings, bike rides, and the walk at Concordia University.  As a volunteer,  I know first hand how well organized the events are.  The walk at Concordia is especially nice with beautiful scenery, touching tributes to victims of Meningitis, with educational materials available, and great snacks after the walk - it really is a great day.  I have heard the Werners tell Becky's story many times and I can see how difficult it is for them.  But they persevere, with the ultimate goal of getting the vaccine on the list of childhood vaccines so no family has to experience the pain they live with every day.   
The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	90950		/users/profile/103895	kjohnson	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2011	The Werner's do a great job of creating Meningitis awareness.

The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation	90907		/users/profile/45041	daisyray	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2011	The Becky Werner Meningitis Foundation, led by Bob and Dee Dee Werner is an amazing organization. The message they bring to young people is touching and inspiring. I have had the privilege of attending their presentation several times and it touches me each time. I am amazed that Bob and Dee Dee could take the devastating experience of losing their daughter and turn it into this amazing program focused on getting young people vaccinated so other families don't have the same experience.

Linda and Gene Farley Center for Peace Justice and Sustainability I	303421	2	/users/profile/394586	Marilyn65	Board Member	5	09/12/2016	The Farley Center is a broad ranging organization that aims to do good in the world, one community at a time.  Just look at its full name!  The amazing thing is that, five years after nonprofit incorporation, it is truly doing just that!  The Center continues to sponsor farmers, many of them recent immigrants to the United States, lending them rich land to grow crops while they learn the kind of marketing that needs to be done to sustain a local organic farm.  Next, the Center has been fostering bonds between peace and justice organizations by providing them social connections with one another in its homelike meeting facility.  Add to this the use of part of its rural Wisconsin land for a natural cemetery,  and you can see that it really is working to complete its mission for the sustainable "cycle of life."    And all with honest fiscal responsibility for the grants and donations that support its growth. I am now a proud Farley Center Board member!  
Linda and Gene Farley Center for Peace Justice and Sustainability I	303384	2	/users/profile/394547	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/12/2016	The Farley Center is a great companion to the Natural Path Sanctuary. We have compatible goals and mutual admiration. We are all only temporarily not soil, so it is a great thing that people can work hard for peace, justice, and sustainability while they're on this earth and then bring nutrients and life to the organisms that remain when they're in this earth.

It has helped train organic farmers most of whom are immigrants or people of color . The training includes farming methods, marketing strategies, and outreach to help farmers find lend to rent lease or own in the Dane County area. The center also operates one the only two green cemeteries in the state called the Natural Path Sanctuary. We are burying people there who want to help conserve the land by becoming the earth that feeds the forested hillside  that slope up from the organic farming fields. The center also provides a meeting space for Peace and Social Justice groups to meet and plan activities. We are  partnering wth groups to promote peace, cross cultural , arts and welcoming activities for immigrants.  We are located on land just West of Madison, WI that belonged to Gene and Linda Farley , two public Heath doctors who dedicated their lives  to peace and Social Justice activities and especially to pushing for a single payer health system. It is an organization worthy of support.

Linda and Gene Farley Center for Peace Justice and Sustainability I	295742	3	/users/profile/386522	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2016	For the past four years, I have sent university student volunteers to the Farley Center.  I cannot say enough not positive things about this experience.  Not only have they engaged the students in meaningful work relative to fulfilling their mission, but they also largely invest in our students' learning and growth to cultivate their civic and community identities.  They make the students feel like a part of the organization, and help them understand why the work is important.  For this reason, many students choose to return to the Farley Center semester after semester. Every staff member I have encountered is enthusiastic and passionate about the organization, and introducing others to the work as well! The Farley Center also has established  effective and important programming, yet, they are nimble, out of the box thinkers who continually consider new opportunities and ideas to fulfill their mission. They continually seek ways to support their partners and deepen partnerships.  I am so grateful for them, the work they do in our community, and the support they provide for our students.

Catholic Charities	186159		/users/profile/243140	BAEH	Board Member	4	10/30/2013	I am humbled to be part of the board of Catholic Charities.  The dedication and professionalism of the staff is impressive, but the courage and determination of the clients we serve is even more inspiring.  The number of people Catholic Charities serves goes up each year, and yet the needs in these 10 counties grows even more quickly.  Whether you favor large or small government, government can't do it all, and Catholic Charities works very hard to fill gaps that others don't.
Catholic Charities	184450		/users/profile/241388	DL-Proud	Board Member	4	10/29/2013	I am very proud to be a member of the Board of Directors at Catholic Charities because I can see first-hand the wonderful work the staff does with so many needy people.  I am thoroughly impressed with the dedication and the passion of the staff, whether they are helping the poor, immigrants, children, working mothers , elderly or people who need counseling services.  Most of the staff members have worked at Catholic Charities for many years, and they have great expertise and excellent resumes; they would have no trouble attaining much higher paying positions elsewhere, but because they love what they do and who they help they stay and make Catholic Charities a tremendous asset to our community. DL
Catholic Charities	184312		/users/profile/241250	Adoptive Mom	Client Served	5	10/29/2013	When my husband and I decided to build our family through adoption, we interviweed between 7-10 agencies and by far, Catholic Charities stood out as the agency with which we wanted to work.  Their wraparound approach to workiing with all in the adoption triangle (birth parents, child, and adoptive parents) produces positive results for all, but especially the child.  Our adoption counselor always kept us informed about, and through, the process so we always felt as though we knew what to expect.  Also, thier fees were reasonable compared to most other agencies.  As a direct result of their openess and dedication to their clients, we now two beautiful children, two new extended families (we are stil in contact with all the birth parents), and a terrrific resource for our family as we go through any adoptive family growing pains. I would highly reccomend them 1000%! 
Catholic Charities	184242		/users/profile/241179	CR fighter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	 As a disability rights lawyer, I have seen charities that work, and I have sued charities that don't work. Catholic Charities is one that does a great job. Just like the Catholic Church, it is misunderstood and ridiculed, often by those that have a hidden agenda. However, Catholic Charities serves the poor and needy with meaningful and supportive services. And the web site in Milwaukee provides the tools by which this excellent organization reaches out into the community to seek volunteer support and offer "spot on" services to those in need. When someone is critical of an organization like this (especially when they are clothed in the anonymity of the web), it says to me that they have an agenda that either results from an anti-Catholic bias or ignorance. Keep up the great work Catholic Charities!!

As someone with a creative background the use of art projects as a vehicle to gain the interns interest and keep them motivated was what attracted me to volunteer.
ArtWorks for Milwaukee	160104	2	/users/profile/161866	Sara D.	Board Member	5	06/09/2013	I have had another very positive year at ArtWorks for Milwaukee! One of the highlights of the year was that I was able to volunteer as a career coach during one of our internship programs. During that experience I met with two interns to work through career exploration, resume writing, and interviewing workshops. What a great opportunity for high school students to really start thinking about the future/what they would like to be doing after high school. It was rewarding experience to talk through these topics with the two interns and very fun to see them get excited & gain confidence about their future careers!
ArtWorks for Milwaukee	119049	2	/users/profile/161866	Sara D.	Board Member	5	07/22/2012	ArtWorks for Milwaukee is filled with dedicated volunteers on the board and committees. In my experience over the past year I have been so impressed with the energy from all these volunteers that it motivates me to continue to dedicate as much as I can give.  Meetings are filled with great ideas, brainstorming, and detailed planning to make sure that everything our organization does is to 100%. The most rewarding part about this volunteer experience is seeing the interns that have come through the program gaining a lot of confidence in themselves through the 8 week art internship. Helping young high school students gain confidence and be proud to present their work is such an important experience that we need to continue to offer to more and more Milwaukee teens.

Over the last 4 years I've volunteered and it never ceases to amaze me, the positive change you see within the teens from when they first start their internship to the day they're proudly unveiling their masterpieces. The evident positive change in self confidence, attitude and overall communication of life and career goals within the local teens that are hired at ArtWorks is what makes me an ArtWorks advocate. Thank you to all the volunteers, staff and community partners for supporting such a great organization!

I find all of the young people engaging and yearning to learn.  ArtWorks gives them the ability to experience success and give them a sense of pride in the work that they do.  This helps set these young people up for success in other areas in their lives.

The world of work has changed so drastically, and it has become even more critically important that individuals entering the workplace have basic skills.

We are so proud of each and everyone of our interns, especially as we see them give back to ArtWorks and to our community.

It would have been so nice if she and her husband would have been able to go to the retreat where they could be alone with no phone or doorbell or any interruptions and discussed the options.  would it be a double mastectomy, take medicine for 5 years than what etc.  They could have prayed, cried, shouted and what ever in the beginning of this discussion making  which would have made it easier for them later.
Hopes Journey Retreat Inc	93199		/users/profile/106998	kathyd	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	I volunteer my time and donate to Hopes Journey because both my daughter and I are breast cancer survivors.  Additionally I had an advanced form of uterine cancer.  Following our treatment both my daughter and I wish we had been able to have had access to the beauty and serentity that Hopes Journey Retreat Center has to offer. Because the founders lost their loved one's to cancer they chose to honor them by building special center.  As a volunteer I am so impressed by the dedication, hard work, the financial commitment and spirit of the principals and other staff members. I hope you'll visit the website to see the work that's been done, read about their mission and future plans to serve cancer survivors and their families.

Hopes Journey Retreat Inc	93135		/users/profile/106924	Lori S.	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	I am a volunteer, board member and currently serving as President of Hopes Journey.  I lost my brother-in-law to cancer in 2005 and my husband to cancer in 2006.  As a result, I started Hopes Journey Retreat because I felt that there is a great need for this kind of facility...a calm, tranquil and serene place, apart from the every day chaos and stress...for families to be together.  A place where they can be nurtured and be given hope.  When guests stay at our facility, it is our hope that the fear, anxiety, and pain cancer patients are forced to bear will be replaced with a renewed spririt, inspired to perservere on life's journey.  Whether visitors choose to relax or be active, Hopes Journey offers a variety of opportunities to celebrate strength and courage.  Some of the activites available include canoeing, horseback riding, hiking, skiing, yoga, pilates, arts and crafts, massage treatments, reflection, prayer, meditation and resiliency training.  Hopes Journey welcomes not only those living with cancer, but those with other chronic health care problems as well.

Being personally involved with a cancer patient, having a place to go to get away from the day to day concerns giving a respite from fears is so important.  Hope's Journey is providing this for people.  It is a unique opportunity for caring people to care for others.

When I was doing Cemo I was like many others and very sick.  I remember laying on my davenport and seeing my grandson looking at me with big eyes looking so scared and  not sure of what he was going to see   If  our family could have gone to Hopes Journey spending time together we could have talked about our hopes and fears and rested.  It would have assured everyone even tho  I was so sick, for the time being, everyone was comfortable being to gether during this difficult time.   We all could have learned about the foods and exercises that would help me get stronger fighting cancer. I have seen many people at fundraisers at Hopes Journey and out in other public areas and everyone has given me many names of people who need this facility to help them learn to cope  with life after they have heard  their Doctor say YOU HAVE CANCER. I have many people  who have volunteered to help us when we are able to get Hopes Journey Cancer Retreat going full time. It is just plain and simple, we need money to help us move forword to help people with cancer fight the battle.  Thank you

The staff are truly caring and nurturing individuals with the sole intention of making your stay as comfortable and wonderful as it can possibly be.  Nature trails for walking or just sitting and meditating on the peaceful beauty of nature is healing to the soul and body.  Optional amenities and classes are an added plus to the experience.  Enjoy!

At the table there was another family that had three generations that attended (daughter, mother and grandmother).  It was a great event.  As an Asian with delectable taste for all types of food, this was a great compilation of cultural and urban flare in not only Filipino food but the unique concoction of cocktails.  I loved the one with a slight bite at the end.  It was a great family event; I would do it again and so would my niece.  But next time, we would invite more family members.

Wisconsin Microfinance	287446		/users/profile/377543	JxKx	Board Member	5	04/27/2016	Wisconsin Microfinance pursues poverty alleviation through the noblest goals, namely, empowering individuals through self-employment.  By providing modest loans for startup and growth capital, microfinance provides an opportunity for people to build their own path.  With Wisconsin Microfinance, the communities devastated by disasters but out of sight from larger organizations build a base of self-sufficient businesses.  With an all-volunteer administrative staff, Wisconsin Microfinance is able to directly improve lives through even the smallest donations.  I cannot imagine a more effective way for a nonprofit to be impactful.

Wisconsin Microfinance	275552		/users/profile/365179	Writer	Board Member	5	01/04/2016	This nonprofit has so many unique and amazing attributes. Even though they distribute small loans to impoverished people, it is set up as a fundraising entity, so that the money can continue to circulate throughout the Haitian community, instead of coming back into the U.S. In addition, other than the board of directors, it is completely run by students and young people in the community, providing an amazing opportunity for them to grow. Finally, last year they threw an AMAZING Haitian gala fundraiser. The food and company were both stellar. 
Wisconsin Microfinance	275394		/users/profile/365012	Kate100	Volunteer	5	01/02/2016	Wisconsin Microfinance (WMF) has an excellent system setup for providing microfinancing loans that requires little overhead, without sacrificing oversight, and has proved to be effective in helping climate disaster-stricken communities recover with dignity.After Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013,  I was working with two other Returned Peace Corps Volunteers to identify ways to help  communities recover. We learned about WMF, researched their business model, and after meeting with the Board President and Executive Director, decided to work together rather than try to create our own non-profit structure or do fund-raising that would donate to a large humanitarian aid organization. This has been a good decision.The oversight of the Board President (also the UW-Madison Business School Professor who helped form the program with students after the 2010 Haiti earthquake) is a key component. His insistence on good record-keeping from the Haitian and Philippine recipients means that we know that our funds for microfinance loans will not be diverted. Meanwhile, the solid work of the Executive Director (a UW-Madison student) has meant that details of funds management, website development, and outreach are being handled. Their cooperation (focused on Haiti fundraising and overall program resiliency) with our subgroup (focused on Philippines fundraising)  has helped families in the more remote areas of these countries receive funds to rebuild their small businesses.

OARS is truly dedicated to helping out these animals that have no hope.  All of the money donated goes to the care of these animals.  I have donated several times myself and I volunteer.  I truly believe this organization does superb work in our community.   We are working on public education to reduce overpopulation as well.  A new program called SNiP was started to help address these issues. I personally am very passionate for this nonprofit as I am an animal lover through and through and I love to see the happy endings when in the beginning these animals had little to no chance of making it.

I adopted my first kitten from OARS in March of 2010.  They told me that cats do better in pairs.  They were right.  I adopted my second kitten from OARS in June of 2010.  They were so helpful and concerned about the animals they were caring for.  You could tell the care they had for their animals came from the heart.  They really wanted the person/animal match to be a good one.  My dog and two cats have become best freinds.  I am thinking about getting a third kitty.  If I do, it will be from OARS.  They do wonderful things everyday.

They are always willing to offer advice and guidance on caring for you new addition. One of the most impressive things about this organization is the care and concern they have for the animals they work with.  It is clear they are passionate about this cause.  Each animal is important to them and they work hard to find suitable homes for them.  They take the time to get to know these pets and understand the best enviornment for them.  As a continued supporter, I am always happy to see the outreach that they do.

Our kittens, now one-year-olds, had been found stray without their mama at a very young age, fostered in a home and hand fed.  They are so cuddly and well-socialized and had had all the medical care they required.  I follow OARS on Facebook due to my fond feelings for them and will eventually volunteer when more space opens in my life.  I have referred several friends to them and will continue to do so.

We both love working with them because all the volunteers are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, & helpful. When 1 of our cats had a behavioral issue, we went back to OARS for advice & they were tremendously helpful & supportive. They gave us advice on how we should react & also recommended several different products to help in our situation...& completely resolved the issue. Needless to say, we have made several donations & will continue to donate to this wonderful organization.

They were never presumptive and were completely thankful the entire time [during the donation process].  I have never had any sort of regret in doing so.  They have done so much good for so many animals, and in turn, so many people as well.

Soar of Racine Inc	53242	1	/users/profile/54323	learning6thgrade	Donor	5	09/24/2010	I have worked with Laura Sumner-Coon at another non-profit - San Juan Diego Middle School.  I saw all the expertise she has to be Executive Director of a non-profit.  When SOARbegan, I knew nothing about it. I was not aware of the possibilities for children who wanted to go to private schools that did not have the means to go.  When San Juan Diego Middle closed because of the economy and grants were how the school fuctioned, Laura stepped up took everything in her power to be sure SOAR was up and running so the San Juan Diego children who did not have money for a private school could go to a private school.  The scholarships for the children to go to the private schools is from constant letter writing, grant writing, contacting individuals, businesses.  Laura knows how the system works.  I was fortunate to be helping with closing the books of San Juan - when children would come in with their parents to her office saying they wanted to go to a private school.  This is a wonderful non-profit.  Also besides the scholarships given to children, Laura has a mentoring program with each child that has a scholarship to have a mentor whether in high school or middle school or grade school.  I was fortunate last year to have an eighth grader at John Paul Academy II - besides me helping her every Tuesday afternoon, she taught me a lot too!  The Christmas program was very enjoyable and I helped with it because my mentee was in it as a sheep.  She had to make her own custume and did a great job.  The bonding of mentor/mentee is amazing and very meaningfull.  SOAR has a breakfast I think it is four times a year - to ask people to be Table Captains and invite people to hear the story of SOAR and give.  Laura makes sure there are students there and they tell their story.  I am moved by Laura's compassion to help the children that want to learn in a private school.  The Board of Directors are wonderful and also willing to help Laura.This year I am mentoring a sixth grader I just started last night.  We worked with Science and again I'm learning all over again.  I'm also a donor to help these children go to and learn at a private school.SOAR is a Compassionate/Worthwhile non-profit.

Soar of Racine Inc	51666	2	/users/profile/52387	angie-bartzen	Board Member	5	09/03/2010	SOAR of Racine (Scholarships, Opportunities and Access in Racine) began several years ago to provide scholarships for lower-income students to attend any of the network of our faith-based schools in Racine. The need is overwhelming - 10 students have scholarships, 90 are on the waiting list and others have had to be turned away because we are no longer accepting applications for now until more funds become available. Laura, our Executive Director, does far more than raise money for scholarships; she supports our scholarship students and families to make sure they succeed. And they have - all 10 got through their first year in the school of choice with good academic records. Laura monitors their progress, has formed a group of volunteer mentors who meet with their students at least once a week for tutoring and she has begun a partnership with a local university to have their graduate pyschology students provide counselling services to any student from our school network who could benefit from it. Providing students with scholarships and support, emotional and academic and even transportation at times is more than a full-time job and Laura happily meets it. Kudos to her and our students and families and let's hope that we can support many more over the years.

My children are currently waiting to get in and the SOAR director has kept us abreast of the funding issues and our position in line. To help do our part, we sold raffle tickets and helped at the carnival that was held in hopes to raise enough money for SOAR to offer more scholarships. If SOAR can get the funding and get students placed it will truly benefit those in need and give lower income families a chance for their children to rise above poverty in the future.

Not only do SOAR students attend good schools with tuition support, but they are appointed mentors and tutors that become their 'education families' that almost guarantees that they live a wholesome life in and away from school.  The SOAR model is unique.  SOAR children simply blossom and the progeam strengthens the spirit of the whole cummunity.  Nothing is more important than the future of our youth.  I enjoy working and volunteering for SOAR activities and watching the students grow in so many ways and loving their lives.  They are the future beacons of our community.

Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	144791		/users/profile/191336	warrengfco	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I have been a huge drum and bugle corps fan since the 1960's.    In the 1970's, my taught ( I was a band director) with someone who knew the corps director of the Blue Stars and we took our high school band to many Blue Star performances.  We had several band members march with the Blue Stars after graduation.  They had great experiences.  Fast forward to 2007.  My son auditioned for the Blue Stars and marched 2007 and 2009.  I was hooked.  I have volunteered every year since.  The Blue Stars provide an exceptional life changing experience for extraordinary students.  The students are well cared for on tour and received top notch instruction from professional educators.  We strive to give our members the best possible drum corp possible.   Drum corps is a very challenging activity on many levels-musically, physically, emotionally.  It is very possibly the hardest thing the students have ever done in their lives.  Yes, they will learn a lot about drumming, brass playing and spinning flags but, they will take with them so much more in terms of values for life.  They will learn responsibility and accountability-no one can march and perform their role in the show.  Time management-be on time for all rehearsal blocks, don't be late for the bus.  People skills- on tour with 150 peers- learn to get along. Most importantly they will learn they are much more capable than they ever.thought possible.  I have volunteered for 6 yrs and will continue to do so for as long as possible.   We have a dedicated Board of Directors, an excellent management team, quality educators and supportive volunteers.  I have met wonderful people as part of this activity and am proud to a Blue Star volunteer.
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	144734		/users/profile/191277	Heather82	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I have been attending drum corps shows since I was 6 months old. But my dad was the one who first started volunteering with the Blue Stars when he retirement. He asked if I would like to come with him and help sell souvenirs with him...and the rest as they say is history. The Blue Stars welcome everyone and you are part of their family. With a rich history dating back to 1964 you meet so many people from the beginning days of the corps to the rookie kids and parents from all over the country. They are a class act who care about everyone.  I am honored that I can be a part of the Blue Stars family.
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	144143		/users/profile/190652	Sue_46	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I became familiar with the Blue Stars because of my daughter.  I had always taken the stance that she could do drum corps AFTER high school.  Through various incidents, we began the search for a corps during her junior year in high school.  Her goal was to march with a World Class corps and be on the field at Lucas Oil Stadium on Finals night in August.  She was also looking for a corps that was challenging musically and visually, but where she felt at home.  Our road led us to the Blue Stars.  Being curious as to who my child would be traveling with for the summer and loving to spend time with my kids, I decided to volunteer.  Multiple opportunities were presented for volunteer opportunities, so I opted to assist with the cooking.  We are blessed to have found a home with the Blue Stars, and the experience my daughter is getting is priceless.  From a music education standpoint, even had she not been contracted, the camps were well worth every penny we spent.  She has gained self confidence, grown in musical skills, grown in marching technique and found that she can strive for AND achieve far more than she ever anticipated.  As a volunteer, I have found a group of hard-working adults who care for each and every corps member as if they were their own child.  Staff and volunteers alike are invested in supporting, encouraging and teaching these young people as they embark on one of the most difficult, exciting and rewarding adventures of their lives.  
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	142296		/users/profile/188750	Dawn39	Volunteer	5	11/24/2012	Until 2004 I didn't even  know Drum Corps existed. My older daughter joined a local one in Massachusetts and soon convinced her younger sister follow her. They were 13 and 11 years old at the time. I had no idea what a life changing opportunity it would be for not just them but for my family. At first the performance opportunity and skill building was what we saw. Later the life skills- like time management, organization, setting goals, prioritizing, leadership just to name a few. We had volunteered with other organizations, but were amazed at what was involved with this activity. In 2010 my daughter wanted to make the transition to world class. I figured she would once again pick one of the local corps or at least one in New England. She had other ideas. Clearly from 2004 to 2010 she had been evaluating the world class corps looking for one that had the values and ethics that she wanted from the experience. She along with 3 of her friends headed off to The Blue Stars from LaCrosse, Wisconsin. I have to admit at first I was disappointed knowing that when they left there would be very few opportunities to see them perform or for my husband and I to volunteer. But she was so confident of her choice I knew it would work out. Soon after arriving she called to tell us that we should come out and volunteer, that they were very welcoming. She was right on so many levels. I have never been involved with an organization that lived up to their core values on so many levels. The management of the organization had clearly put time and energy to make sure that the corps provided a world class opportunity to the members as well as continue to provide the life skills. I took a week of vacation to volunteer that summer. Within a few hours I knew that this was an organization that was worth my time and money. I went back 2 more times to help out that summer, as well as the next 2 years. My husband has volunteered the past 3 summers as well. Most people think you do it so that you can see you child, ironically you see very little of them because you are as busy as they are. Each time I have helped out I am still amazed that the volunteers are so diverse. There are people that marched Blue Stars or another corps, others that have a family member marching currently or in the past, others are people that know what the activity provides. However the two categories that speak volumes are the people that stop by to help out for a few hours but end up staying on for days or weeks because they see the value that this organization provides to the members as well as the community. These members spend 3 1/2 months each summer working harder than most people do in a year. But they do it and come back again to do it again until they age out. This summer I watched new alumni come back to help out because they want to give back to the organization. With all the opportunities available to people this age that fact that they would spend a day, a week or longer volunteering is proof that they recognize what this wonderful organization provided them that they want to make sure that it is there for future generations. Their motto translates to "The End Crowns the Work" and this organization truly lives by that creed. I will continue to support them with my time and money long after my daughters age out. 
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	138616		/users/profile/184689	tvolk	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I first saw the La Crosse Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps perform in 1975 in Ohio, where I grew up. I was very impressed with the performance on the field, as well as the classy demeanor off the field.  Fast forward 21 years to when I took a job as a Professor of Biology at the University of Wisconsin- La Crosse.  I watched the Blue Stars because I enjoyed them, but I was too busy focusing on my new teaching and research duties.   I did not have time to do much else those first several years, so I did not have time to meet people in the corps. By the time I was ready to volunteer, I developed heart problems, and I was unable to do much.  In 2006 I had a heart transplant, which saved my life.   During the recovery period I had to stay at the hospital out of town, and I started following the Blue Stars on their online forum, which was quite active on show days.  The corps had recently moved up to World Class division and was on the move.  The Blue Stars forum became my connection to the outside world.  A year later I was still hanging out on the Blue Stars forum when one of the parents asked me to march in the Blue Stars alumni corps for the annual Oktoberfest Parade in La Crosse.   It was great fun, and even though I wasnt an alumnus, people made me feel like I belonged.   I started volunteering that year at the Blue Stars Oktoberfest Brat stand, and then started volunteering extensively the next summer and three summers after that.   Last year I spent more than 30 days volunteering with the corps.   The members of the corps are wonderful.  They are polite to and grateful for the volunteers. It is fun to watch individual members go from shy, often scared auditionees to rather mature, focused adults (of course their musicianship increases greatly also!).  The lifelong friendships and bonds that they build with one another as they work toward a common goal are fantastic. The Blue Stars help to build the members into more interesting, confident, mature people.   It is very rewarding to follow their career paths after they leave the corps.  The Blue Stars experience is great for members, staff, and volunteers alike.  It has been fantastic for me as a volunteer to watch the Blue Stars organization grow and become even more stable and successful. The Blue Stars have made me part of their family.
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	138475		/users/profile/184539	Eaglegdc	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	 Through its world class instructional programs, the Blue Stars offer excellent opportunities for young men and women to realize new potentials they didn't realize the had. The training and application stages of the programs are second to none.  The corps instills high morals and values to all its members and often are life changing experiences.
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	138420		/users/profile/184485	Donahjh	Board Member	5	11/13/2012	The Blue Stars motto is "Finis Coronat Opus"... roughly translated as "The End Crowns the Work".  In my 7 years of association with this organization I have seen some many young adults achieve and grow well beyond their own expectations.  The values and work ethic provided by the Blue Stars is second to none in the Drum Corps activity.    My own story involves my son.  Not only did he advance as a musician, but most importantly he grew into a responsible, compassionate adult and leader.  His story is far from unique.  The Blue Stars strong values, sense of family, inclusion and fair play porvides positive  life changing expereinces for its 150 members every year.   I willingly give my time, business skills and money to this organization.  Investing in these young adults has the highest return on investment possible.  
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	138300		/users/profile/184357	Souvieguy	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I have been a volunteer with the Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps for the last two years.   I have found my volunteering with them to be an extremely rewarding experience.  I am so positive about this organization that over the last two years I have vested 5000+ hours, traveling 25,000 miles, slept on countless classroom floors, helped out where ever I could, to see the organization succeed.    Why do I do this --  the staff, administration, and all the volunteers associated with the Blue Stars organization are all dedicated to developing (personally and professionally)  the young leaders of today, and the business leaders and educators of tomorrow.   While on the surface the visible results of the organization are a superior musical marching performances by 150 young adults,  the real accomplishment is the transformation  of 150 individual musicians/performers into a responsible, dedicated, group of leaders living and working together as a well honed team.                      Drum and  Bugle Corps was an activity I was a member of as a young adult some 45 years ago.  Over the 45 years the activity has improved its processes for developing the leaders of tomorrow.               For those who don't know what a world class drum corps  is, think of it as professional caliber marching band, i.e. the NFL of marching bands.  The big difference is that none of the performers are paid; and in fact, have to pay to participate.  
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	137401		/users/profile/183380	Snare	Board Member	5	11/12/2012	I'm 60 years of age, & a recently retired VP of the second largest retailer in North America. Frankly, I owe my early retirement & the blessings bestowed on my family to the Blue Stars Drum & Bugle Corps, from La Crosse, Wisconsin. It was during my mid-teens that I auditioned for and became a marching member of this tremendous performing arts drum corps. The ensuing 5 years molded my character & values quite rapidly, as drum corps is a highly competitive activity. Among many key learnings, I gained an understanding and true meaning of dedication, hard work, discipline, pursuit of excellence, and working together as a team. I learned how to win with humility, and I learned how to lose with dignity. Most important, I learned how to pick myself back up along with my fellow members after a defeat and try again and again until we achieved success. These valuable lessons carried over and were ultimately applied to every aspect of my professional career which again, made me & my company successful. My involvement with the Blue Stars also enabled me to successfully raise five children, embedding in them the same values & belief system, building moral character & respect for others. So today, following a 36-year career, I'm a Board member of this same organization and volunteer for a number of activities - no job is too small - in hopes of contributing in some small way and making an impact on the lives of our 150 young adult marching members.
Blue Stars Performing Arts For Youth Inc	87344		/users/profile/98002	TimK	Board Member	5	04/26/2011	I first became aware of the Blue Stars when I was marching with another drum and bugle corps.  I was always impressed by the organization.  After I was too old to march and transitioned to a fan and volunteer, I was continued to be impressed with how the Blue Stars were managed, the corps values, the administration and staff, and its members.   When my daughter decided she wanted to participate, I did not hesitate to encourage her to become involved with the Blue Stars.  It was a fantastic experience for her.  Being closer to the organization as a parent and volunteer, I saw first hand that my prior impressions of the corps were not only correct - they were surpassed. When I was asked to join the Board, I again did not hesitate, as I was proud to be a part of an organization that is as dedicated to its members, as its members are to the organization.   The Blue Stars provide their members with an opportunity to learn many very valuable life skills.  Its not just part of their mission statement  they really do this.

There were many guidelines and tips given on ways to improve credit. The handouts were helpful in that I've had reference them to refresh my memory. For example, during my car search I referenced the handouts to be enlightened on car history, car insurance and things of that nature. Even though my search for a car seemed never ending, tiring, and frustrating I was able to find the perfect car for me. Being in this program allowed me to purcase my first vehicle.

This program enabled me to get back and forth to school and work. I have since earned a degree at an accredited university and haved been at my current organization for almost three years now. I have also learned the importance of budgeting and learning how to manage my finances through the credit education that is offered through the program.

When I got to where I wanted to be, which was with a Physicians Office in Clinton, Iowa, I was satisfied with my acheivements and knew that I was on the right path. Unfortunately, my positive experience turned into a hardship. My vehicle was lost due to engine failure. Being a single mother, with lots of unsecured debt, I had no where to turn for someone to lend me an efficient amount to purchase a vehicle. Until I heard of the ways to work program, I was going to be back where I had started. I wash sure to lose my job if I didn't have the transportation. Fortunately, with the help of my Ways to Work counselor, Pat, we were able to discuss a budget, set up a payment plan and expect to increase my credit score significantly within the two years of paying off the loan. I am beyond greatful for the help and the opportunity to become a responsible consumer, a committed employee and a good mother to my children. And it all comes back to having the a Way to Work.

Prior to applying for this program, my family had went through many obstacles.  It was very difficult in getting a ride to and from work even if we paid the individual.  It was hard getting to many appointments in a timely manner, and in some cases we had to catch multiple buses.  Not to mention getting up extra early to get the grand baby off to daycare, and getting to work on time.   I had completely lost faith in everyone and anything within my community.  Usually you have to jump through hoops in order to reap the rewards.  This was not the case when I decided to apply for the services of this program.  This program restored faith within my family that there are still valid programs in the community that is willing to help people like us in need.  This program allowed for my family to get to all appointments on time in addition to getting to work everyday.  The Staff members of this program are awesome individuals.  They make you feel like a human being and go above and beyond to assist in helping the individual with meeting the requirements of the program.  They did not discourage me in form, shape or fashion.  They did not look down on me because of past mistakes in my finances.  This really meant a lot to me, because I did not need anyone to prejudge me.  Instead, I needed help for me and my family.  I have recommended this program to so many of my single friends that have gone through similar situations like my family.  This is a very good program within our community, and it should be recognized as the most effective program in the non for profit arena!  Ways to Work has shown my family that there are people that do care about the community, and they want to see people do well on all levels!  I thank GOD for this program, and its amazing Staff members!

We empower women by helping working mothers with poor credit obtain auto loans for the purchase or repair of a vehicle. These women would be unable to obtain a loan from other sources, or if they would qualify for a loan, their credit would force them to pay a much higher interest rate. I've heard many great stories about how getting reliable transportation has helped our clients by allowing them to get more involved in their children's lives, permitting them to further their education and giving them the opportunity to obtain better employment.

Then once your credit is up to par,and all paperwork is complete, you will receive a $4,000 loan from Ways to Work that allows you to purchase a reliable car under 100,000 miles.  Ways to work makes sure the car that you are to purchase comes from a trustful dealer, and they even supply a short list of dealers that are accustomed to the Ways to Work program.  I am a most grateful recipient of a Ways to Work loan, and my 2001 Chevy Malibu has taken me many places that I couldn't have gone without Ways to Work. :~)
Endometriosis Association, Inc.	246640	6	/users/profile/334032	PrayBoldly	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/29/2015	This is a terribly mis-managed organization.  It troubles me that most of the reviews are by board members, not people being served.  It almost appears to be a requirement for the board!  I have worked with the President and she thinks much too highly of herself (and her time).  She is insulting (I have seen her YELL at people wearing fragrances) and does not have a solid grasp on reality.   I have also seen her yell at staff, board members and even volunteers.  She may have written a helpful book or two, but she is no longer contributing to the field due to her irrational nature.  I would never recommend donating, volunteering or God forbid working for this organization.

Their lives are in turmoil and yet, they are not believed. Please parents and medical professionals, recognize that your daughters/patients are not making up their chronic pain. Listen to them. Thank you EA for making research-based materials available to teens around the world!

So many are very creative and work so hard to raise money for and awareness of the association. It's as incredible as it is heartbreaking to hear about their struggles with this disease. It is even more heartbreaking to think that women around the world still suffer with endometriosis even as the association heads into it's 35th year of working for a cure.  They were THE first to make this effort, and they will succeed because they will not give up! 
Endometriosis Association, Inc.	235067	2	/users/profile/312146	ShannonHawkins	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/07/2014	The Endometriosis Association is an organization with the mission to education and support women with endometriosis. While this is critical, they have a huge push in endometriosis research. This translational research push is very encompassing - clinical, therapeutic trials, basic science research, educational research, and psycho-social research. Mary Lou is a great leader who knows the leaders in the field of endometriosis. The Endometriosis Association has been around for 35 years and is a credible resource for women!  As a policy, the Endometriosis Association does not give recommendations for physicians. They do recommend that women with endometriosis join the Endometriosis Association to participate in support and outreach activities with other women with endometriosis.  To be clear, this organization is a support group that should work hand in hand with your doctor. If you are a woman with endometriosis, call them up and join so you can get involved!

I asked to speak to the President and was told flat out that she doesn't talk to people.  How can the head of an organization not talk to the public?  Not even by a scheduled request?  When I ask what they actually do, they said support, research and education.  I was looking for support and they did nothing. I asked if they could suggest a doctor.  They will only give you a doctors list if you pay $40 for a membership and then $5 more for a list.  Really??  I got a free brochure, that was really dated.

Endometriosis Association, Inc.	158230	1	/users/profile/209918	capes1	Advisor	5	05/18/2013	I first came across the Endometriosis Association when I was diagnosed (belatedly, as so often happens) with endometriosis. I became a member and received the newsletter and publications, and right away I was impressed by the combination of heart and science in the EAthe commitment to building a support community for women with this mysterious disease while serving as a catalyst for groundbreaking scientific research. I was even more impressed when the EA uncovered the link between endometriosis and environmental pollutants like dioxin, which helped the medical community to understand the misnamed career womans disease in a much broader way. The more I learned about the EAs workthe collaborations between laypersons and doctors, the building of a global support community, the careful data gathering, and the independent fundraising for cutting-edge research--the more respect I had. In fact, I found the EAs approach so remarkable that I wrote a sociological article about it and documented the organizations history so that it could serve as a model for others. While doing this, I read many, many personal testimonies about the EAs life-changing work. Im now an advisor to the EA, and I strongly recommend the EA to anyone who wants the best information and support relating to endometriosis. The EAs work has always been mostly membership-funded, and while it stretches every dollar to the maximum limit, it would certainly benefit from more funding. My personal experience and my research both tell me that becoming a member and making any donation will have a huge multiplier effect. 
Endometriosis Association, Inc.	146435	1	/users/profile/193263	nath	Volunteer	5	12/11/2012	I learned about the Endometriosis Association after I was diagnosed with this disease.  This organization helped me so much and I learned accurate information in helping me deal with this disease.  Just having someone understand what I was going through was very encouraging to me.  After reading the Endometriosis Sourcebook, learning information, changing my diet, and talking with other women, I felt better educated to deal with the medical problems I face associated with endometriosis.  My husband and I have supported the Endometriosis Association for years and I encourage you to do as well.  I recently became a board member and I am looking forward to educating and encouraging other women with endometriosis that need help as they deal with their diagnosis.

I had so many questions, but no one seemed to have the answers.  I remember sitting in the waiting room of the doctors office and I picked up this yellow brochure for the Endometriosis Association.  Later that day, I contacted them.  It was life changing for me.  Not only did I have a wealth of information and knowledge at my finger tips, but there were people who truly understood what I was going through by having this disease.  As a member of the EA, you have access to the best information out there!  The books, newsletters, healthcare provider list, programs and the ground breaking research are what truly make the difference.  I have personally been involved for the past 5 years by serving on the board and I have seen first hand just how much goes on each and every day.

Endometriosis Association, Inc.	98320	2	/users/profile/115189	CureEndoNow	Board Member	5	09/27/2011	As a disease, endometriosis is plagued by misinformation, taboo, and delayed diagnosis.  There is no cure, the symtoms are often misunderstood, and many treatments have serious side effects.  There are huge needs for patient advocacy and support to correct the multitudes of bad information out there, and the Endo Association fills that gap and more.I first connected with the Endometriosis Association when I was diagnosed with the disease as a teenager and was spending most of my days in pain.  I benefited from the Association's books and, as a member, I have learned a lot from their incredibly informative newsletters which also connected me to an international community of women with endo.  The books are the BEST information out there on endo.  After volunteering for EA, I recently joined the board and can say that, from the inside, the organization is even more impressive.  EA is funding groundbreaking research, and has had its own groundbreaking discoveries, such as the first-time-ever research-proven link between dioxin and endo.  Mary Lou Ballweg, the Executive Director, works tirelessly on behalf of women and girls with endo and in her time since founding the organization has producted amazing shifts in the way the disease is understood and treated.  However, much more needs to be done!  Get involved by joining as a member, reading a book by the Association, or being a donor: www.endometriosisassn.org.   
Oshkosh Area Humane Society Inc	143633	3	/users/profile/190099	ZoraZora	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	More below, but: I see that there's a Donor Advisory because OAHS did not list fundraising expenses. While I am not privy to the organization's financials, I do see how they fundraise and advertise in our community, and everything I see (and have been involved with) is done with donated time and materials, via volunteers, social media, and supporting organizations (for example, the local paper runs stories on the Pet of the Week; they've done a few videos courtesy of people who donated equipment and time that get a lot of play on Facebook; PetCo has adoption events; etc.). Especially since they made a commitment to being a lifesaving shelter, but also since they rescued a few high-profile animals (Google "Bernice the Cat" and you'll see what I mean), they've gotten a lot of free publicity. They rock. I know how much they try to make sure all of the animals in their care don't just get a chance to live, but to have a good quality of life. Everyone who works there, from shelter director to janitor, is interested in the animals' well-being - as I've seen when I've been there picking up and bringing in foster animals, sometimes unannounced and at odd hours. For example, I was fostering a cat for them who was very ill (and we had no idea what was wrong) and who was clearly fighting for life. Most places would have put the cat down, but not OAHS. While we discussed that as an option in case the cat was really suffering, we decided that we should take our cues from the animal, and as long as the cat seemed to want to fight for life, we were going to support it. We did, and the cat is now lively and happy in a forever home. (Yay!) They do their absolute best to provide each animal with a positive environment at the shelter or in foster care - the shelter has really nice community rooms and single condos for the cats, playtime and volunteer walkers for the dogs, and every office has animals in it, too, because if there's space, there's no reason there shouldn't be a pet in it. It is a shelter that you actually feel good being in, even when you can't take all the animals home with you.  They are constantly trying to find forever homes for their animals, and they are thrilled when it succeeds. I give them money, time, and donations of goods, and am always encouraging friends and family to support them as well. They get a lot of community support, for good reason - but they can always use more, because these animals (and their shelter) always need more help.

The group at the shelter continually show inventive ways to educate the community, foster fostering, increase adoption, and raise funds. You know when you donate to this worthy cause - that the dollars are going to fund the best possible outcomes for homeless animals. I'd be hardpressed to get a pet anywhere else BUT the OAHS
Oshkosh Area Humane Society Inc	3281	1	/users/profile/4813	Oshrocks	Client Served	5	04/07/2009	The Oshkosh Area Humane Society is an extremely well run non-profit organization.  They strive for local education, facility and service exposure, enjoyable special events,successful drives in times of exceptional need.   All this and more, is done, secondarily - because at the heart of the organization is the goal to ensure that all animals, not just in the shelter but also throughout the community receive the basic needs, loving care, and respect that all animals deserve - and often times do not get. OAHS does an outstanding job caring for animals, matching up potential foster or adoptive homes, following up with those pairings.  Adopting a pet from OAHS is not a one/two time contact - it becomes a relationship where both parties have the best interest of the animal in mind - forever. The staff is top notch:  knowledge, caring, realistic, and honest.  Without this - the OAHS would not exist as the great organization that it is today!

Oshkosh Area Humane Society Inc	41862	3	/users/profile/42648	rescuegrl	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	This is one of the finest animal organizations I've been to.  It's clear just from walking in the front door that they put the animals first. I don't know who wrote that first comment but it's clear they are misinformed or have a personal vendetta against someone.  The shelter's LifeSaving Mission means that they will no longer euthanize any animal simply because they do not have room.  Obviously they have always saved lives but before, when the shelter was full they had to make the difficult decision on whether or not to euthanize an animal to make room for another animal.  It's great that they have made this pledge and they've really dedicated resources to try to expand their foster program to find temporary homes for every adoptable animal, until they go to their new forever home.  And as far as the claim about the administration being overpaid, that is just laughable - you can look up executive director's salaries online and I can tell you that it's ridiculous how LITTLE people make.  You have to admire those who have a passion for their cause that they are willing to work 60-80 hours a week for hardly anything.  All in all, OAHS is a stellar organization - one that others should use an example.

I started in 2005 as a volunteer walking dogs and other odd jobs. While volunteering in January of 06 I started training a puppy named Smokey.  After working with him for several months and fostering him I decided to adopt him.  In 2008, I was given the opprotunity to join the Board of Directors.  All my experiences at the OAHS have been very positive. The new building is state of the art and they have an absolutly outstanding staff to go along with it.  They all are very caring, dedicated and everything is done for the animals best interest.  Some days I don't know how they do it but they always handle every situation, difficult or not in the most professional, caring manner.

I have done almost everything there is to do there, walk dogs, give them baths, laundry, dishes, clean kennels in a pinch, helped out at the desk.  I keep volunteering because I feel very wanted and useful there.  I am always thanked when I leave no matter how much or little I've done that day.  The staff is very caring and very good at what they do.  I know that everything is done with the animals best interest.  I will continue to volunteer as long as I can, because the shelter is like my family.  If I would have never volunteered there I would also have never had the joy and love of my three dogs and two cats.
Oshkosh Area Humane Society Inc	3100	16	/users/profile/4790	mskruby	Volunteer	5	03/21/2009	I have been a volunteer for the Oshkosh Area for over 6/7 years. I started volunteering there when it was in a small building with limited outdoor space. It was still one of the best operations with which I have been associated. It was clean and as organized as could be. My first and best observation was that the people were so very caring about the animals and ALWAYS kind and helpful to volunteers and patrons alike. There was a warm feeling that all of the employees liked each other and helped each other when the need arose.Now that the OAHS has moved to a bigger and more comfortable facility in many ways, the above values continue. The place is so clean and well-kept. The employees continue to be helpful and caring. The animals are genuinely cared for. Further, the employees are educated in the latest information about caring for animals and help community members with their animals regardless of where the animal originated!!!I love this place.Martha A.

Oshkosh Area Humane Society Inc	3099	12	/users/profile/4787	crazyaboutdogs	Volunteer	5	03/21/2009	I have been a volunteer at OAHS for 3 1/2 yrs. It is like home to me. I wear many hats while volunteering and love being there and helping the staff. I see things most volunteers don't see, I see the staff interacting with the public, with the animals, with volunteers.  They have always made me feel welcome and know they can ask me to help wherever I am needed. I have helped other volunteers and staff rehabilitate terrified dogs from puppymills and celebrated when they were adopted to a forever home. I have also seen the tears and have cried with the staff and other volunteers over the loss of an animal do to abuse from irresponsible owners. I have seen dedicated dogs that are 11 or 12 yrs old dropped off because owners didn't want to deal with them anymore. Many have been adopted and it lifts our hearts.  I volunteer at OAHS because of our dog Penny. She died 4 yrs ago and I wanted to help other dogs that did not have the wonderful life she had. There is no better place to volunteer and I have volunteered several other places.
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	161763		/users/profile/214558	louise99	General Member of the Public	4	06/29/2013	I continue to support this organization because I feel the founder has been honest with her reporting responsibilities. I give to a number of highly rated non profits. They, too, support this organizations efforts. They would not if they suspected misuse of funds. When donating, I am careful to watch the organizations supporting and following each other. Based on that and other factors, I have norganizationso doubt this organization is being run honestly and ethically.
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	161738	5	/users/profile/214526	patriotel	Donor	2	06/28/2013	I was seeing some red flags on the Facebook posts about expenses and that made me think that not all the expense were being used towards transports or for other rescues and some of that money was being used for personal use. I came to Guidestar to see if there were any reviews written about the organization and when I saw reviews where others had questioned the use of funds I wanted to find out myself.  When I questioned Pennies-4-Paws on Facebook about her disclosing her 990 and expenses to me she deleted my comment and I never got an answer. I got an email though from Paypal that indicated my last donation from them was refunded. I never asked for a refund. I simply asked for a disclosure. To me that was an answer that she had something to hide. I usually check charities on here before I donate but I didn't this time.  I will now only donate directly to animal rescues, not a middle man and to charities that make their 990 and expenses available. 
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	112516	8	/users/profile/153149	jess7891	Donor	1	05/21/2012	I, too, have some serious concerns about this charity and the way it spends and handles money.  Thousands of dollars have been spent on improving the founder's home, barn, and personal vehicles. None of this money is accounted for on the charity's "awards" page. The awards page consists of a list of all the charities P4P has helped, along with the amount given to the charity. There are no listings for the significant amounts of money for the founder's pet projects - which are improvements to her pole barn, home, repairs on her personal vehicles, and fuel/travel costs for the transports that she so loves doing. Unlike other transporters, she expects her way to be paid every time, even down to hotel and food.  Which brings my other question - are there no animals in her local area that need rescue or help? It seems she is always going on these transports down south, while ignoring the animals in shelters that are nearby.  My guess is it's not as much fun to rescue those animals - because there's no road trip involved!! To me, this is a collossal waste of money - money that could be stretched and used to benefit FAR more animals than she is helping. but that's not the Pennies way. She buys the best of everything, and in bulk.  There's no making do or being creative with resources, like every other rescue on the planet is forced to do. Don't like your current crates? Go out and buy different ones. And buy TONS of them.  But them every week if it makes you happy. That's what seems to be happening at P4P. I would love to see an inventory of all the stuff that has been bought for P4P, which is not even a full-time rescue. I would also love to see the utilization rate of all these crates and kennels. I assure you, it would be very low. I believe the founder has some sort of shopping addiction, and the constant buying of new animal stuff somehow feeds her illness. The constant buying of goods to auction off, which are often sold at a loss, seems to be another indication of this. There are some very concerning things happening at P4P, and I ask others to beware. If you really want to help animals, give your money somewhere else, where it won't be wasted and frittered away. There are hard-working rescues out there that can squeeze amazing things out of a dollar. Please find one of them and support them instead of P4P
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	112492	7	/users/profile/153104	lab-lover	Donor	2	05/20/2012	I have read all previous reviews and it's quite important that before anyone makes an informed decision that they also know the truth.  First of all in regards to Cissy stating there is no substantiated evidence...this is an assumption of course and there is infact substantial public  proof of any of the concerns brought forward.  It's probably also important that the reviewers be forthright in their role in regards to this organization who gave it high scores because they too need to be  transparent in their relationship with Pennies-4-Paws.   Regarding the the review by Adam D. he is most certainly a huge donor however he is also a paid advertiser on the Pennies-4-Paws vehicle which is also mentioned as such on the public website of this organization along with a photograph of the vehicle showing his logo as sponsorship.  It is perfectly fine that he take this opportunity to advertise her very reputable business  however I think anyone who is looking for accurate information also know all of the information if they are relying on unbiased reviews.  Cookie1 who listed herself as a donor is the founder of a rescue and this rescue  has been the benefactor numerous times through fundraising from this organizaton both in large fundraising efforts as well as fulfilled Christmas wish equipment and smaller fundraising efforts.   I have no doubt Cookie1  has personally donated numerous times  to other causes via Pennies-4-Paws however she failed to also be transparent in her review by listing herself as also a "Client Served" or by mentioning this in her review.  This is not questioning the reputableness of her rescue as she has done amazing things for animals and should be commended for her sacrafice it just needs to be kept real when recommending as an individual donor versus someone who actually has been helped.  I was very active on this facebook wall and in fact don't argue the point that at one time the founder and the organization did some awesome things to help a lot of individual animals in need as well as many small rescues.  I stepped away when I noticed that less and less the fundraising became about the rescues and other animals in need and more and more the focus was on the founder herself and raising money for her own requests which have been mentioned many times by others and I won't repeat.  The "Scores" of cats that were supposedly TNR'D however I must dispute.  Three attempts were done on TNR in the pole barn and by the founders own admission on a post on her page she could not continue to do so.  She now fosters on occassion in that building that was set up for year around TNR operations.   To define transparency in fundraising is the ability for all donors to see TO THE PENNY how much money is being raised at all times.  I would suggest a chip-in form of fundraising so the total is visible.  Transparency is listing the thousands of dollars that have now been raised for the founder on her "awards" wall however none of these are listed.  Transerancy is NOT somebody throwing out a number from time to time.  In regards to the comment of jealousy.  I am or was just a donor who wants to help as many rescues and animals to find a loving home as I can and I am not jealous of the founder because I have nothing to gain from her organization I just decided that there were too many things that made me uncomfortable and I didn't want to finance the founders latest dream but rather help rescues and help animals in need wherever they are located.  I don't feel I should warn anyone to not donate,  I just feel it's really important that if people are to depend on these reviews to make good judgement on where to spend their hard earned dollars to make the MOST impact on helpling animals that they instead go directly to the rescues they trust and donate directly to them and I also feel they need to have the transperancy of those of us who review and entrust to help them make the best choice.  Pennies-4-Paws does help animals but so many, many more could be helped and so many more rescues could stay in the business of saving animals if the founder would return the focus back to those who know what they are doing and how to best utilize funding rather than focus on her own personal needs.   Animal  rescue is a very important and needed service and every penny should be utilized to benefit the most animals as possible...that can't happen unless the fundraising focuses on the rescues more than the founder. 
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	110791	2	/users/profile/150803	cissy3647	Donor	4	04/26/2012	I have found Pennies-4-Paws to be an honest organization that does  a very good job making a positive impact on the animal/rescue community with limited resources and manpower.  It has been my experience that the President and founder, Sally Geiger, has been as upfront with her decisions and monies rec'd as she possibly can.  She has been falsely attacked by a few people visiting her Facebook site and she withstood those attacks by continuing to perform her duties and help animals in need.  She has a strong following of supporters who continue to help her fundraise for various causes.  She is upfront with when and where monies are spent.  Any remarks otherwise are unsubstantiated.  It is has been my experience that when unsubstantiated remarks are made, it is a result of jealousy.  Sally has in the past and continues to have a positive impact on the animal rescue community.  I am proud to add Pennies-4-Paws among my supported organizations.
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	110261	2	/users/profile/150115	AdamD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/19/2012	I have to disagree with some of the other reviews. Pennies-4-Paws has brought a lot of grief on themselves by being so open and transparent. Many animal charities have donations go into a general fund and the donors often have no idea what happens with the money after that. With P4P, every fundraising effort is spelled out ahead of time and each possible donor can determine the worthiness of the task for themselves. Sally Geiger has accomplished a lot in a short period of time and usually for other rescues. When you consider the amount of her own time, effort and money that she has given to others vs. the possible increase in the value of a barn on her property renovated to shelter cats, it seems kind of ridiculous. They have helped many other rescues get needed funds that they wouldn't have had otherwise and I know this from people at those places. I feel very confident supporting Pennies-4-Paws.
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	109757	2	/users/profile/36050	cookie1	Donor	5	04/12/2012	This is an excellent charity who works very hard to help animal non profit organizations all over the US.  At the end of each fundraiser, the amount raised is posted on the website and the funds are transferred usually by the next day to the designated charity.  IRS compliance and verification of funds received and funds transferred are documentable at the end of each year as with any non profit organization.  In addition, each non profit who receives the funding raised for them by P4P has the option of requesting a report of donors.   As a  donor for the barn project for TNR on the owner's property, I was kept apprised of all aspects of the project progress and happily felt that if even a few animals were trapped, neutered and returned (TNR) that it would be funds well spent in rural WI where few options are available- but that has not been the case- scores of cats have been TNR'd, social cats adopted and many, many dogs have been helped when the TNR calendar is not full.  As a donor to this specific project- I know it has been money well spent.   Sadly, in the light of social media and instant communication, it only takes a few people to wreck havoc on an organization that in my view has done amazing work in the short year they have been in existance. Few organizations can say they have raised six figures- not for themselves- but for other groups within a short year.
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	106670	8	/users/profile/144208	LizB	Donor	1	02/18/2012	I was met with open hostility when I questioned about upgrades to structures on the founder/President of the groups personal property. Since the upgrades were made, little use has been made for the purpose funds were solicited.  Any attempts to mention cost conscious measures are ignored. There is distinct favoritism and frivolous use of solicited funds.  
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	106597	9	/users/profile/144086	ReneeSch	Donor	1	02/16/2012	I donated to one of the events but walked away after researching the owner. Their home is up for sale and remained on the market while upgrades were openly happening on their site. Favoritism to certain groups, condescending comments and remarks posted on the site and all out misuse of funds as seen by the public.  Many questionable acts. 
Pennies-4-Paws Inc	106560	7	/users/profile/144019	Steffey123	Donor	1	02/16/2012	This charity started out with the right intentions.  However, it has grown to pay for improvements on the directors home and to pay for gas for this individual and so many questionable expenses. Paypals are set up but never shown the actual amount being collected.  Huge concern with this organization.
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	238514	2	/users/profile/323807	ddianneepooh	Client Served	5	02/24/2015	It's been 1 yr since my father moved into Sharon Richardson & 9 months since he died.  He didn't want to go at first. He wanted to stay home, but after a few days, he realized this is where he needed to be for safety.  He lived in SRCH for 4 months before his passing.  We were allowed to celebrate 1 more birthday and my parents 50th wedding anniversary with actual parties and displays by family.  While dad's health declined we mourned and the nurses & staffed mourned with us.  There was always a gentle ear to listen, a warm hug to hold, and someone special to shed tears with.   Everyone was so wonderful, dad never wanted for anything, and neither did his family.  Thank you all so much for everything you did for our entire family.
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	234139	3	/users/profile/298249	donbielski	Client Served	5	11/20/2014	My mother was only there two days before passing, but in that short period,this place proved the reviews that say "amazing."  When my mother wasstruggling at 6 AM on a Monday, they could not get ahold of my 90 year oldfather and called me 100 miles away.  My father is hard of hearing and I hadtold them he would be tough to get ahold of him before 10.  That said, the nurseJason who was attending to her was willing to drive into Sheboygan, retrievehim and bring him to the hospice.   Unfortunately, she actually passed during my call with Jason, dad finally answered the phone and came in, but the commitmentdemonstrated by their staff to ease this experience was incredible, amazing,etc.    
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	231419	1	/users/profile/295012	Amy2014	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2014	I joined the SSRCH team in 2011. It has never felt like a job. It is a true privilege to serve people within our community. The focus of Sharon S. Richardson Community Hospice (SSRCH) has always been quality care. The quality in care has been proven year after year by our outstanding family and bereavement survey reports completed by those who have experienced care. SSRCH is the only hospice in the county that offers inpatient care within a Hospice Inpatient Center designed specifically to serve patients and families at the most precious moments of life. I will someday give myself my final gift as I receive the best hospice care possible from the most incredible people at Sharon S. Richardson Community Hospice!
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	230626	3	/users/profile/294255	Jerry38	Client Served	5	10/30/2014	Our family learned much and came together with friends during my wife's time at the Sharon Richardson Hospice Center.  We were amazed, and talked repeatedly, about the friendliness and professionalism of the staff.  My wife actually selected SRHC as her hospice of choice, as it was equidistant from our two daughters' homes in the Chicago area and our home in Central Wisconsin.   Everyday there was a gift for us all. The beautiful facility and the outstanding and caring staff made a permanent difference in all of our lives and the memories we carry forward.
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	230404	6	/users/profile/294039	Bernadette2	Client Served	5	10/30/2014	My daughter was at Sharon Richardson Hospice Center for three months before her journey came to an end. They welcomed her in the fount door and when her journey was over she left through that same front door with dignity and respect. The staff became our family, friends and educators. They taught me how to care for my daughter so when I felt I needed to be with her 24 7, I packed a bag and moved into the center and became her caregiver with the perfect balance of privacy and assistance from the staff.Thanks to Sharon Richardson I can look back on my daughters final days and feel Perfection, Honor and Joy.B Peterson
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	213653	2	/users/profile/276850	SMeyer	Board Member	5	09/05/2014	The folks that provide care at the Sharon S Richardson Hospice (SSR) are what truly set it apart.  These are the people you'd want at your bedside if you found yourself in those circumstances.  I have strong feelings about this because I lost my first wife to cancer at age 40 and I wished SSR would've existed at that point for both my sake (as a caregiver) and my wife's.  I became involved with SSR so that I could help the next person.  I've had many people I know take advantage of SSR's services and I always hear back from them about how important SSR was to them and their loved one during that difficult time.  I've even had total strangers come up to me and thank me for the wonderful care at SSR when they found out I was involved through someone else.  It is truly heartwarming to know that at some of the most difficult times in your life, SSR is there to serve you with understanding and compassion whether it's in your home, nursing home, hospital, assisted living or at the SSR center.
Sharon S Richardson Community Hospice Inc	213630	2	/users/profile/276828	Mootown	Volunteer	4	09/05/2014	SSR is a wonderful caring place with loved ones receiving remarkable care and comfort during their final days.  I have interacted with many of the employees as a committee member, volunteer and one of the founding members.  Their compassion and commitment is nothing short of remarkable.

Thier kindness, compassion, professionalism and efficiency has made our lives a little easier during this terrible time. Our RN Kathy and CNA Becky have treated Mom like family. I can ask for nothing more than that while trying to help Mom in the process of dying.  The staff even did the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in her honor. I pray all those in hospice care have the chance to be treated as well as my family has been. Liz Engel
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	169961		/users/profile/225243	janet_hern	Board Member	5	09/16/2013	I must say that not only as a Board Member, but as a professional who has asked for and received  assistance for my homeless disabled veterans, MHVI is a great resource to have available for our veterans. MHVI has helped my clients with bus tickets, household items, emergency food, and more! As a case manager, I know how hard it is to find certain resources, and I feel that MHVI has worked hard to fill the gaps in this community for veterans. I know I can count on them to either have items on hand from donations or reach out to others to assist a veteran in need. MHVI has a dedicated staff of volunteers who go out of their way to make sure that deliveries and donations run smoothly. I'm grateful that MHVI is here for the veterans who were there for us. Thank you MHVI!   
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	169183	2	/users/profile/224223	Wwilliams	Client Served	5	09/11/2013	I called and they helped me. Just like they said they would.  The gave me a home.  I have a kitchen of stuff so I can eat.  I have a bed.  They were real nice.
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	168992	1	/users/profile/223967	dej21747	General Member of the Public	1	09/11/2013	Non-Profits should be just that, Non-profits not platforms to show boat with fancy talk about so called help.Grass roots organizations like I started here should help the intended recipients of the donations and grants collected from good people and not pad the pockets of the directors, staff and other entourage. We have to get back to compassion and real help for the many in need and not use non-profits as a job opportunity for non caring individuals. 
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154967	4	/users/profile/205828	markschwingle	Volunteer	5	04/16/2013	I have been working with MHVI for the past three weeks. I find the job very enjoyable and gradifying. The people who donate are very nice and  truly enjoy giving to this cause. I really like the reactions from the Veteran that is receiving our help. These people just need a little help to move their lives forward. Many of these veterans have families and small children who are sleeping on the floor. We are doing our best to make sure this does not happen. I can see the problems with warehouse space and organization,but we are working hard at rectifying these bumps in the road. MHVI is a great cause and will continue to help homeless veterans as much as possible.   
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154905	4	/users/profile/205769	Daughter	Donor	5	04/15/2013	I am grateful to the men and women who have made numerous trips to the condo to pick up items we could donate. They were polite, on time, efficient and grateful.  So many of our vets have done so much for us. They suffer things we can't begin to understand. Their families are affected by this. To be on the streets on top of everything else is heartbreaking. To be given a home - a shelter of your own with electricity and running water and heat is a wonderful gift. The LEAST we can do as civilians is give the vets a hand with household items. Live simply so that others may live.
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154792	4	/users/profile/205659	upnorth	Donor	5	04/15/2013	I believe in what they are trying to do, help and show respect to our vets who have given us so much.  If I didn't live 6 hrs away I would definitely volunteer. So I send donations when I can. 
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154789	3	/users/profile/205654	TeriS	Donor	5	04/15/2013	I have donated to MHVI.  They made it easy as they came to my home, were on time and carried it out to their van.  The driver was really nice.  I happen to hear back that my couch went to a vet the very next day.  It feels good to have the things I do not need used by other who need it.  
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154248	4	/users/profile/205075	John West	Volunteer	5	04/11/2013	I have been involved with the MHVI over the last 14 months first picking up donations from people we know and delivering them to the warehouse. It became obvious that there was no organization to the warehouse at all with bags, boxes and furniture everywhere. My wife and I asked for a set of keys and basically became warehouse managers. We organized the clothing, house wares, bedding and furniture for easy access. We put together kits of bedding by size, towel kits and kitchen kits to make it easy for the drivers to take to vets.  The first of February we took over the phone that receives all the incoming calls from veterans that have been placed in apartments as well as anyone wanting to donate items to the MHVI. Since that time up until now 4-11-2013 we have furnished most of the furniture and housewares for 46 veterans that have been placed in apartments and have coordinated some 138-donation pickups. During this time we had to vacate the donated warehouse we had, move to 4 storage units in 2 separate locations in the city and were still able to provide the above services. This could not have been accomplished without the help and dedication of our 3 driver/movers that are themselves veterans giving back to veterans in need. During the course of our short tenure with MHVI we have talked to and met some very wonderful veterans and donors many of whom have become repeat donors simply because of what MHVI does.  All we can say is being associated with the people of the MHVI and its mission has definitely been life changing for us.   
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154161	4	/users/profile/204987	Roeboat	Donor	5	04/10/2013	What an amazing program MHVI is! I sent an email asking about donating and John asked if we could talk by phone. He was so personable and friendly, I was thrilled to be able to help out. I keep an eye on the Facebook page so I can help quickly when there's a need I can help fill.  When you donate to MHVI, you feel a real, immediate impact. They don't ask for anything beyond what they need. Instead of sending things into a great unknown abyss, I know my community is immediately supported by my donations. I'm hoping to arrange a neighborhood donation this spring!  
Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative	154091	4	/users/profile/204920	Mark Foreman	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	In the past five years, I've watched the MHVI start with only a dream to end homelessness for veterans in the city of Milwaukee,  and now they've helped hundreds of homeless and low-income veterans find shelter, food, clothing, furniture, and VA benefits. They are an impressive organization that deserves a lot of credit for helping to end homelessness for veterans in the city of Milwaukee.

Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	320413	2	/users/profile/412887	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/22/2016	I am a former Kid from way back in 1971 and 1972. My experience was during the 3rd and 4th years of the Kids.This was a fairly new idea of a group of talented young people coming together to do something musically positive for the State of Wisconsin. I think we all felt a huge responsibility to represent a positive image of youth in Wisconsin at that time. I realized many things about myself during these years, and what abilities I could continue to develop beyond my Kids From Wisconsin experience. Thank You!
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	320378	2	/users/profile/412820	Denise165	Volunteer	5	12/21/2016	KFW has been a wonderful experience for us!  My son was a KID for two years (47-48). The training provided to these kids as performers, encouraging them to be their best, well....its immeasurable!  The KFW entire staff instills values, respect, responsibility and support on a daily basis to our kids, whether it is at camp, on tour, or at the Tommy. As a parent of a KID, I always felt at ease when my son traveled with this group. They have always taken very good care of our kids 24/7.  He often spoke about the great experiences he had during his travels with the troupe and you could tell it must have been a fun time by the smile on his face.As a parent of a performer, the KIDS experience was always a proud moment  and an honor for me to say that I am a parent of a Kid From Wisconsin!The friendships made have been with the most amazing people you could imagine and will last a life time. Once a KID parent, always a KID parent!
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	320295	1	/users/profile/412645	RockerMom	Donor	4	12/19/2016	As the parent of a college music performance major, and a #48 KID, there are many positive things to say about the Kids From Wisconsin experience. 1) I appreciated what I saw as the organization's core values: - respect; personal & group accountability; responsibility; integrity; honesty; and team support.2) In a safe environment, it encourages performers to push themselves in a productive manner, resulting in more self-confidence.3) Again in a safe environment, it gives serious performers the opportunity to hear constructive, honest feedback enabling them to hone in on areas of needed improvement.4) As a parent, it's offered the chance to bond with parents of other serious performers, which is a wonderful benefit.
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	320244	3	/users/profile/412545	MomOv4	Volunteer	5	12/17/2016	The KIDS From Wisconsin is by far one of the most positive influences in our son's life.  He has performed for the past three years as a principal trumpet player.  He has made forever friends and has been able to perform over 180 shows including three years of State Fair performances.  He has played at the Governor's Inauguration, performed at multiple morning shows, video taped a TV commercial and taped a piece for the  Channel 12 holiday show!!  All of those opportunities have given him a chance to learn the love of a performer's life.  That being said, the most important thing about KIDS is the integrity, professionalism, and sense of family that embraces our entire family.  The leadership is amazing and have helped to keep the tradition of KIDS alive.  Thumbs up to the KIDS From Wisconsin:-)
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	320206	1	/users/profile/412463	LaurenJaye	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/16/2016	While I was never a KID with Kids from Wisconsin, I always feel like I am one and part of the family! Everyone is so warm and welcoming; constantly smiling.  It is a true gift to watch these amazing performers do what they love day after day. The troupe members are admirable and inspirational for their drive and passion within the performing arts. There is not another non-profit quite like Kids from Wisconsin!
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	318762	2	/users/profile/410010	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/11/2016	The KIDS From WI has been, without a doubt,one of the BEST experiences of my two daughters lives and our family's as well! Not only has it been an incredibly positive "on stage" experience but it has been an amazing life experience! We have all made life long friends and have experienced soooo much joy along the way!!! A BIG thank you goes to the incredible staff! Without them this one of a kind organization would not exist!!!
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	318673	1	/users/profile/409924	krebswebs	Volunteer	5	11/10/2016	I have been privileged to be the parent of two Kids from Wisconsin, as both of my daughters have performed as principal and alternate singer/dancers (principals 2013 & 2016). The KIDS from Wisconsin organization promotes and reinforces the value of the arts to not only those who are lucky enough to be a KID, but to the communities and patrons who host or attend a performance. The value of the KIDS organization is enormous, as it builds on something greater than any one individual or location. The history of the organization, the feeling of family the troupe and alumni experience, the celebration of musical artists and genres, and the enthusiasm patrons show about the KIDS performances- this is what KIDS from Wisconsin is about. 
Kids From Wisconsin Ltd.	318649	2	/users/profile/409885	jbenishek	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2016	The KIDS FROM WISCONSIN is a group of extremely talented young Wisconsin adults.  KIDS consist of a eleven piece band and twenty-two singers/dancers.  A wide diversity of music is played for all ages during their two hour show.  If KIDS does not move you from the opening curtain, then you need to check yourself for a pulse. ;-)  Check out their web site at www.kidsfromwisconsin.org

Box of Balloons	241479	1	/users/profile/326736	sarah_wells	Board Member	5	04/21/2015	I became involved with Box of Balloons as a way to introduce my young daughter to charitable giving.  Box of Balloons is helping us, just as much as we are helping them.  Blessed to be part of something doing such good in our communities. 
Box of Balloons	240973	1	/users/profile/327383	RebV	Board Member	5	04/11/2015	One of my favorite things about Box of Balloons, is enabling the parents of these sweet kiddos. All of the Box of Balloons action/volunteering takes place behind the scene.  We provide  the ability for parents/caregivers to celebrate their children with a birthday.  That's special. 
Box of Balloons	240866	1	/users/profile/327225	Kendrat	Volunteer	5	04/09/2015	I fell in love with what this organization was doing the second I read about it.  I knew immediately I wanted to get involved.  I came from a careers working with many of these children, and I knew I wanted to find some way to make life a bit more normal for them even if it was one day a year...
Box of Balloons	240852	1	/users/profile/326730	nicolemoll	Board Member	5	04/08/2015	I love Box of Balloons! Growing up my mom always threw my sisters and I the best themed birthday parties, now I love to do the same for my kiddos. It makes me so sad to think there are lots of children who don't get a happy celebration and so many parents who can't throw their child a party. I love that Box of Balloons helps parents in need give their child a celebration to remember, a day filled with happiness and hope. 
Box of Balloons	240700		/users/profile/326963	Msetz	Board Member	5	04/07/2015	Box of Balloons is an amazing organization that works to ensure that each child is celebrated on his/her special day!  By way of party decorations, cupcakes, and a birthday gift, we are providing not only smiles on the faces of less fortunate families in our community, we are giving hope for better days ahead and an opportunity for them to take a break from the hardships in their lives.  Each item donated positively impacts that child's life.  Please consider joining our efforts so that every child can be celebrated.
Box of Balloons	240552		/users/profile/326746	aprilB	Board Member	5	04/05/2015	Saying yes to a volunteering opportunity for Box of Balloons is an absolutely incredible way to love others in a super-simple way !! I've been blessed by choosing  to share a little of my time and or money to bring a smile to a little ones face! This organization has opened my eyes to the needy in my community and has shown me that there are easy ways to help bring a little sunshine to those who need it most; children! It's amazing what can happen when a few people decide to open their hearts and spread the love via a Box of Balloons:)
Box of Balloons	240549		/users/profile/326744	nicolekking	Board Member	5	04/05/2015	Box of Balloons is a great organization helping children celebrate their birthday! I'm so honored to be a part of this organization and raise my daughter teaching her the value of giving back. If I can help bring a smile to even just one child, it warms my heart :) there are so many ways to volunteer and donate! Check it out, you won't regret it!
Box of Balloons	240542		/users/profile/326732	Amy_217	Board Member	5	04/05/2015	Help a child celebrate one of the reasons being a child is so much fun!!! Spread the fun, spread the love! 
Box of Balloons	240236		/users/profile/326323	khansen	Board Member	5	03/30/2015	I fell in love with this charity the second I heard our director explain this 'idea' she had for our community.  I have been on the board, getting this organization rolling since day one and it has been one of the most positive experiences of my life.  While some people may say that a birthday celebration is trivial, I say they are wrong.  We are walking into the lives of children who don't have much to hope for at that moment in time, or who have never been celebrated before.  We are giving them a day full of meaning, joy, and hope and reaffirming that they are worth it.  All while empowering their parents/caregivers by giving them everything they would need to give their child an amazing birthday party.   Not only that, we are getting communities involved.  We would never be able to do what we do without our community members/volunteers.  It has been simply amazing to see the kind and giving hearts and soles that are right in our very own backyards.  
Box of Balloons	240229		/users/profile/326313	Jenna22	Volunteer	5	03/30/2015	I got involved with Box of Balloons from the beginning & have loved every moment! Being able to help parents & families give their children a birthday is so special. Every child deserves a day to honor them! So glad I'm a part of this organization! 
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	282960		/users/profile/373135	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/20/2016	The Order of Christ Sophia has the earmarks of a group that exerts undue influence to recruit members.  They target young college age girls and make no hesitation to admit ...especially Mother Clare...that "family" is not of importance?  Why?  Because no parent, family or friend would condone the practices and twisted teachings of this group.  The ratings below are also a scam and created by members to legitimize this group.  They even do damage control by writing a post on their sites on "what is a cult".  Hmmm?  Have you been called a cult?  why might that be.  Of course, their explanation differs quite a bit from that of experts in the field like Margaret Singe and Dr. Robert Lifton.  Look up their red flags and the breadcrumbs will lead to Father Peter, Mother Clare , The Spirit of Light Center, the Ruach Center and all of the little splinter groups they have created to  rapture the minds and wallets of their followers.  Humanitarian?  Christian?  I don't think so.
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	170233		/users/profile/225576	A former donor	Donor	1	09/18/2013	In 2011, the Order of Christ Sophia asked for donations earmarked to build a rooftop garden. THOUSANDS of dollars were given towards this. After it was built, the leadership got caught by the city for doing so without a permit. It took additional money to tear down the rooftop structure and legally buy permits. The Order of Christ Sophia never re-built the rooftop structure and instead said they would sell building materials to recoup costs. They kept all monies, NEVER returning funds to donors who had earmarked donations specifically for that structure to be built. It was blatantly dishonest and fraudulent.
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	100859		/users/profile/125338	Debbie01	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2011	In May, 2010, I inappropriately posted a review/comment concerning the OCS on this site. I am sincerely sorry for this posting and for saying what I did. If I could go back in time and undo what I wrote, I would. My daughter is safe and happy, and my words offended her deeply. For this, I am truly sorry. I was wrong to say what I did and regret doing so with all my heart.

They definitely go out of their way to make sure that your retreat experience is the best it can be.

The staff definitely contributed to this by generating an attitude of positivity, generosity & attentiveness. I got the feeling that they really believed in the power of peace to change the world and demonstrated this in their actions. I also really appreciate their support of nonprofits who are working to make the world a better place! The surroundings are beautiful and awe-inspiring. Food is delicious & healthy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	42144	13	/users/profile/42882	revrachel23	Client Served	5	05/31/2010	I have had a number of experiences at the Sophia Peace Center (SPC) namely, last year, as a volunteer at the Colorado Peace Ride, a bicycle tour which rode through Dolores and was hosted at the SPC. The hosts there are generous, considerate and detail oriented. The SPC cares about each individual having a peaceful experience that is fulfilling, both individually and globally ~ it is rightly named as a Peace Center ~ as every one there upholds the integrity and consciousness one .
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	42095	12	/users/profile/42840	nasa	Client Served	5	05/30/2010	This retreat center is so beautiful and each time I go there (a couple times a year for retreats with my church), I am amazed at how clean the air is and how big the sky is, and how friendly and welcoming the staff is (also FANTASTIC food, with dietary restrictions always accommodated). I recommend this place highly!
The Order Of The Christ Sophia Inc	41434	16	/users/profile/42260	mark17	Client Served	5	05/28/2010	Not only is the location, surroundings and views amazing, so are the staff and accommodations.  The landscape around the property is serene and peaceful.  All of the food was delicious.  I appreciated the efforts and technology in place that made the facility more sustainable (water saving showers, toilets, and signage).  The retreat center is infused with peace and love that will feed and fill you.

Urban Ecology Center Inc	151348	1	/users/profile/38961	dennisglaw	Volunteer	5	03/20/2013	I've been a volunteer with the Urban Ecology Center for the last 15 years, during which it has grown from  occupying a double-wide trailer in Riverside Park to now serving over 50 schools with ecology/science educational programs from centers in three different areas of Milwaukee, with over 70 full and part-time employees, and a wide array of programming for children, families and adults.  Meanwhile, important but previously neglected or abandoned open spaces are being restored, planted, and turned into active community resources.  Crime is down, schools are more successful, and neighborhoods are stronger and more alive.  What's not to like?
Urban Ecology Center Inc	38116	6	/users/profile/38961	dennisglaw	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	I've watched, and been a part of the Center's growth -- from a Friends of the Park group, to providing environmental education field trips to classes from neighborhood schools, to offering a broad science/environmental education curriculum out of a double-wide trailer, to becoming a full-fledged nature center/urban environmental education center/community center in a wonderfully green, comfortable, and inviting 20,000 sq ft building, and to serving schools and neighborhoods in another area of Milwaukee from a branch Center in another large park.  The Center's collaborations and partnerships with other organizations -- community groups, environmental organizations, educational institutions, artists and performers, gardeners and urban farmers, etc -- are among its great strengths.  I've been a volunteer and board member of many nonprofit organizations, and UEC has been unique in being virtually free from ego struggles, turf battles, personal agendas, and the like.  Even when hard work, or complex and difficult tasks need to be accomplished, volunteering at UEC has always been fun and satisfying.  And, best of all, interesting, caring and friendly people are always part of the equation there!
Urban Ecology Center Inc	145458		/users/profile/191942	MAriens	Client Served	5	12/01/2012	The Urban Ecology has transformed a neighborhood and a natural area in the heart of the city and made it a safe and accessible place.  I feel safe hiking and biking alone in an area I would never have considered venturing alone 20 years ago.  I love to visit the UEC with my children to play, sled, snowshoe, hike, visit the animal room or just hang out.  I also enjoy going there alone to concentrate on projects away from home and to fly my kite from the lookout tower.  It is a good place to recharge!  The UEC staff are warm and caring folks and can really engage children and adults alike in the wonders of nature and in the ways of living lightly on the planet.
Urban Ecology Center Inc	110241		/users/profile/150108	vanschyn	Volunteer	5	04/19/2012	I have been involved with the UEC for almost a year now, and I think the work they are doing to revitalize the communities surrounding their 2 (soon to be 3) locations is outstanding. And I feel like I would be hard pressed to find a more passionate and welcoming staff. I like that they offer so many ways to be involved in the work they do, education, citizen science, land stewardship, urban sustainability, community building, etc. There is a place for everyone at the UEC!
Urban Ecology Center Inc	69745		/users/profile/76229	banana	Donor	5	02/16/2011	The Urban Ecology Center is located in a Milwaukee Park, Riverside Park.This park was not being kept up and was not used by many people.The UEC changed that. The park is now a vibrant place.Many children who have never had the opportunity to investigate theoutdoors are thrilled to come to UEC. These kids learn about trees,plants,birds,insects,wildlife and how tocare for all these. They love it!  The Urban Ecology Center is a goodthing for the neighborhhood too. I know, because I grew up here, and this was MY park.
Urban Ecology Center Inc	68169		/users/profile/74489	johnbecker	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	     The Urban Ecology Center (UEC) is a most efficient educator of Milwaukee's youth.  Educating youth on the environment may be the the UEC's stated major mission.   However, I believe that the UEC is even more valuable in helping youth of all socio-economic backgrounds develop reasoning skills,  develop values necessary for maintaining society,  and gain the ability to work with others.  The UEC facilitates value exchange between generations.    In an age of working parents and shrinking school budgets, I believe that the UEC is the place to invest in our future. 
Urban Ecology Center Inc	39625	6	/users/profile/40573	nealray	General Member of the Public	5	05/20/2010	They are an amazing group of energized people who have excellent knowledge and are really helping to revitalize once loved parks that have fallen by the wayside.

Urban Ecology Center Inc	38128	6	/users/profile/38990	eddee	Donor	5	05/06/2010	Twenty years ago I lived near Riverside Park and I was among the few who ventured into it. The park was poorly maintained and considered dangerous. I have watched the Urban Ecology Center grow and the Park become inviting and popular. I have worked with UEC staff when writing my book about the need for natural areas in cities to help connect people with nature and develop an environmental ethic. They do a remarkable job and I consider the UEC one of the best things happening in Milwaukee, a model for environmental education that should be emulated in every city.
Urban Ecology Center Inc	38114	6	/users/profile/38965	tim10	Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	The UEC brings together so many different elements for me it is difficult to describe its impact on the Greater Milwaukee community.  Truly a neighborhood based organization that has primary mission of bringing inner city kids to nature, the UEC is a model for cities everywhere that want citizens to get out and appreciate the out of doors.  Sustainability and enjoyment of the world around us in an urban setting has blossomed into a huge, multi-faceted set of programs serving all parts of the community from bird watching to snowshoe
Urban Ecology Center Inc	36410	8	/users/profile/37200	maryhintz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2010	The Urban Ecology Center is a fantastic Organization that has a huge impact on the Milwaukee environment and community.  The Center's focus on environmental education for students is sure to have a tremendous affect on Milwaukee's environmental future.  Urban students who would otherwise never get a chance to learn about the beauty of nature receive an invaluable experience and it is evident that they will never forget their visit to the Center.  The Riverside Park location is truly a gem that everyone in the community must see!
Geneva National Foundation Inc	262149	1	/users/profile/350822	Writer	Former staff	5	10/07/2015	Geneva National Foundation has been so generous to Studio 84. Several of our students attended the Life Empowerment Open that benefits individuals with special needs. Our students from Studio 84 created paintings while the golfers walked around and took off in their golf carts. The students had a chance to watch all of the carts take off, see their first sausage race, enjoy a nice lunch with great company, tour the building and also ride in the golf carts. This was really a life changing experience for our students and this is something they will talk about for a life time. Thank you so much for having us and I know our students are already asking to come back. Also, thank you for supporting Studio 84.

As a small non profit that serves people with disabilities in the area of the arts it is a struggle as the arts and disabilities are often very underfunded areas in society and we have them both in one organization. The Foundation has been very generous and a joy to work with. Several of our students attended the Life Empowerment Open and did some painting, had a chance to meet some of the golfers and ride in the golf carts. They were so proud to show off their art skills.

Having attended the event multiple times, I can honestly say there is truly something special happening with this organization. I have seen and met first-hand the individuals that benefit from the outpouring of monetary support kick started by the GN Foundation. It is  both touching and inspiring to see the smiling faces of everyone who attends the event.

Northwoods Wildlife Center	292020		/users/profile/382505	mattyj2011	Former staff	5	06/03/2016	I had the amazing opportunity to be a summer intern at Northwoods Wildlife Center a few years back. This was before they had an advanced rehab license but that didn't stop us from being able to help hundreds of animals be re-released back into the wild healthy and recovered. The rehab is only a small portion of the work they do. The education and information they provide to the public is superb. The educators there have multiple programs on all sorts of animals, as well as animals for the public to get up close and personal with. It is an amazing place and everybody there does an extremely good job of educating, being friendly, and helping an animal in need. I highly encourage anyone in the area to visit, it will be an eye opening experience and it changes all the time. I know I visit whenever I'm near! 
Northwoods Wildlife Center	291965		/users/profile/382451	Writer	Former staff	5	06/03/2016	Northwoods Wildlife Center is truly unique. It not only helps wildlife through rehabilitation but education as well. I appreciate how they aren't just another petting zoo. You go there and you learn things and then go out in the world and use what you've learn to better the lives of animals. The staff there are hard working, dedicated individuals who love what they do and it shows. They also accept several interns a year helping students gain hands-on experience in this field which in turn creates more wildlife advocates. If you want to learn about the wildlife in your area and how to help them, this is the place to come.
Northwoods Wildlife Center	291962		/users/profile/271189	Kelcie S.	Volunteer	5	06/03/2016	I first learned about NWC when I was a sophomore in college. I had been looking for positions which may help me gain experience in the field and boy did I get it! My first time in Wisconsin was because of this center and I fell in love with both state and center almost immediately. The staff are a wonderful group of people whom always brightened my day, some I still talk to years later, and their work is as phenomenal as they are. If you ever wish to volunteer or become an internship for the center, please do! You'll obtain more than just experience in the field; you'll build networking, learn life lessons, understand the importance of documentation and note taking, expand your knowledge on wildlife ecology and conservation, meet a diverse group of public with plenty of interesting stories to tell, expand your knowledge on medical techniques and implementation, husbandry, public speaking, and oh so much more.This center is one of the finest non-profit I have interned for and certainly a place I still enjoy visiting whenever I get the chance. 
Northwoods Wildlife Center	291961		/users/profile/382448	Rachel175	Former staff	5	06/03/2016	An AMAZING facility that works extremely hard to help educate anout and rehabilitate wildlife in northern Wisconsin.

Northwoods Wildlife Center	291959		/users/profile/382446	Amanda225	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/03/2016	Northwoods wildlife center is a an incredibly inspiring place to learn about wildlife of the Northwoods. The staff works incredibly hard to heal and foster animals like raccoons, porcupines, Hawks, owls, and many more that would otherwise have a slim chance at survival.  The educators provide excellent detailed programs that include live embassator animals.  We pour our hearts into our work, and we love to share it with you! 
Northwoods Wildlife Center	291934		/users/profile/382415	Writer	Board Member	5	06/03/2016	Today, the Northwoods WIldlife Center just released a loon, found emaciated on the side of the road. Through donations from friends of the Center, minnows and excellent care by rehabbers and interns,  allowed us to release her today. The NWC exists as a non-profit only by donations, endowments, wills, and grants. They serve all of northern Wisconsin, and the rest of the state. They currently have 3 fawns, 14 raccoons, two porcupines, a wood chuck, numerous squirrels and chipmunks, a raven, a baby barred owl, and birds of all types.  They expect many more fawns, duck babies,etc, throughout the summer. NWC has three missions, rehabilitation, education, and research. They reach over 3000 people/students annually through tours of our resident animals, and outreach to schools, and other organizations. Just received estate grant to build eagle flight rehabilitation pen, and need donations for new owl rehab pen.

Northwoods Wildlife Center is a  great place for our kids to learn about wild animals that they are not familiar with.  The staff is always friendly and answers our questions with patience and knowledge.  They are doing a great job at helping injured animals return to their native habitat.  We were so impressed that we started sponsoring one of their resident birds. 
Northwoods Wildlife Center	213160		/users/profile/276314	Lynn80	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2014	I first had contact with the Northwoods Wildlife Center when I brought them 2 baby Cardinals.  The staff was really caring and explained to me the procedure for raising and releasing these birds.  They truly care about the animals they help.  Being 3 hours away, I called a few times for an update on the birds and they were more than happy to tell me how they were doing and what stage they were at.  The facility is wonderful for birds, first being cared for inside and then being released to the outside area to fly away when they are able.  They care for small mammals just as well.  There are e fawns, raccoons and anything else that is brought in that is orphaned or injured and all are treated with the same love and commitment.  They do it all.  They also have the ability to transfer to other facilities if necessary.  They do a great job with their public education program by giving tours and going out and speaking to groups.   This is a great place.  Lynn Hoeppner, Shell Lake, WI

Our vision has been for Lifeline to help Italian Greyhounds in need, and we've achieved that and so much more. Lifeline has educated thousands about Italian Greyhounds. We've conducted Canine Good Citizen testing, and spent hours teaching owners & their dogs the skills necessary to pass the test. Lifeline's 'specialty' is matching the right dog to the right owner, whether someone is looking for a low-key housemate, a snuggle-buddy, a running partner, or a dog for performance competition. I'm proud of Lifeline's achievements, our volunteers, our donors, and our adopters!

They did an exceptional and thorough screening process to ensure that it would be a good fit. It has been wonderful having Pharoah in my life and I think they made the perfect choice. Shortly after that I began volunteering with the group. I've been able to educate other people about this breed, and help find Iggies in need a good home.

I immediately received acknowledgement of my application and a very thorough interview, home visit, reference check, occurred before I was allowed to adopt.   I had an outstanding experience all around with the adoption process, and continue to receive advice and education from Lifeline Italian Greyhound Rescue.                                   One thing that stands out to me, is how informative their website was.  The website isn't geared toward attracting Italian Greyhound owners.   It's dedicated to helping educate about the breed.  It provided the top reasons Italian Greyhounds AREN'T  the right dog for everyone.    I took full advantage of the information provided and was able to make a responsible decision about adopting a forever member of the family.

Prairie Biotic Research Inc	198366		/users/profile/259078	CCMB	Donor	5	04/19/2014	.I recently retired after a quarter century in administration in an engineering research center at a large research university.  In the last 10 years or so, my primary work was in assisting faculty to prepare and submit research grant proposals to federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), as well as to state governments.  As far as I could tell, agencies such as these have no place, and no funding, for small research projects outside of the university mainstream.  (Our unit was applying for grants of $100 thousand to $20 million.)  When I first learned about Prairie Biotic a couple of years ago, I saw that the organization was filling a specialized and essential niche -- providing small grants to researchers studying any aspect of our vanishing prairies, special places and their flora and fauna which were so integral to our history and which contribute to, and reflect, the state of health of our planet. Just this past week, I received the funding report for the last cycle of grants made.  I was very impressed with the variety of topics funded and the demographics of the researchers, from individuals unaffiliated with large institutions, to young faculty, post-doctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduates, a high school student, and a high-school teacher and his students!   As I understand it, all the time for organizing and administering the proposal solicitations and reviews as well as ongoing grant administration is given on a volunteer basis and expenses are kept to the bare minimum.  It proves that a small group of dedicated people can made a big impact.
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	89039		/users/profile/100838	Asclepias	Client Served	5	05/23/2011	PBR is a great organization that helps fund researchers from a variety of backgrounds. PBR is a non-profit run by volunteers, so the money that is raised to fund research goes to do just that. The grants cover non-academic as well as academic researchers, which I think is unique. The grant proposal form is extremely reasonable for what you can get in return and so I encourage others to apply. My interactions with the organization have been very pleasant and I hope it can continue funding interesting research well into the future. 
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	81767	1	/users/profile/89650	Andrew Williams	Board Member	5	03/10/2011	As founder and President of Prairie Biotic Research, I can reveal some aspects of this all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) public charity that others cannot.   PBR was established in 2000 with the mission of fostering basic field biological research by individuals studying any species in prairies and savannas anywhere in the USA.  No other nonprofit does what PBR does; PBR is unique.  We offer grants up to $1000 in a competitive, annual Small Grants Program, have already been through nine grant cycles, and this whole program runs like a well-oiled machine, beginning each October and wrapping up the following March.  We've funded 100 such grants, amounting to $94,849, to researchers in 24 states.  More than half of these grants have supported graduate students.  Before another month passes, we will fund roughly another 17 proposals. All 14 PBR board members and scientific advisors themselves engage in just the sort of basic field biological research we seek to fund through our Small Grants Program, though we ourselves are ineligible for this funding.  Grant proposals are evaluated and ranked by our scientific advisors, while the board members, though ultimately responsible for funding decisions, actually have little input in the process, instead spending their time running this charity.  PBR provides a rare avenue of funding for individuals, especially those with expert knowledge but who are outside the organizational framework of academia, government, and nonprofit agencies.  PBR supports natural history (observational science) as well as experimental science.  Funding for natural history is essentially unavailable in our culture today. What maked this enterprise so urgent and important is that our prairies and savannas are disappearing under the tsunami of development pressure, and as the habitats vanish so too do their many beautiful and interesting species.  We are gathering information that may slow this terrible erosion of our natural heritage, while fostering the development of these researchers, thereby sustaining our cultural heritage.  And for some of us, our ability to study the natural world around us is what makes life itself so precious!  It all gets more interesting the more one knows, and the beauty we encounter in wild places is a balm to our souls. Our overhead is very low as we are an all-volunteer enterprise.  Foundation grants generally go ENTIRELY TO PROGRAM, which very few nonprofits can claim.  Operating expenses are covered almost entirely through gifts from individuals.  PBR seeks and receives no funding from any government agency.   PBR has never been in debt, and our net worth continues to slowly grow as we build our research endowment, which supports our Small Grants Program. The 14 of us who volunteer to make this charity run smoothly and effectively take great satisfaction in fostering the curiosity of those whose research we help to make possible.  Never yet have we had enough money to fund all those proposals in a given year that we would like to fund.  This year we had 108 proposals submitted and will fund roughly 17 of them.  Ours is a labor of love and of service, not just to the people we fund but also to these habitats and their many species we appreciate.
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	79647	1	/users/profile/86984	Thor Hanson	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	I received a grant from this organization to conduct research on native bees in prairie remnants.  The process was the most efficient and transparent grant process that I've ever been involved with and I hold Prairie Biotic in the highest regard.  They fill an important niche, funding both students and established researchers for experimental and descriptive natural history research.  These grants are important and are delivered in a straightforward manner by an all volunteer organization with virtually no overhead.  This is a terrific group -- highly recommended.
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	79177	1	/users/profile/86487	paulfrater	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2011	This is a great organization that dedicates itself to funding research to learn more about a truly globally imperiled ecosystem known as prairie. I live in Iowa and over 99% of the millions of acres of prairie that once existed here are now gone. This is not only a once prolific ecosystem, but a national historical monument that is quickly fading. It is absolutely essential that we continue to study this biome in order to better understand, preserve, and appreciate it. Prairie Biotic Research Inc. provides requisite funding for the study of prairies in order that we can do exactly that. If only we had more organizations like this one we might be able to actually preserve all of what's left of this national treasure.
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	74711	1	/users/profile/81628	rstanton00	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	Prairie Biotic Research is willing to take risks to fund research by individuals who are often just beginning or are outside dominant research institutions.These research funds, which often are directed towards natural history studies, are critical to maintain species populations in the prairie environment, which is increasingly threatened by contemporary agricultural and developmental paradigms.  That Prairie Biotic Society is concerned with conservation of the environment and long-term sustainability is therefore obvious from their diverse portfolio of vested research grants.As a recipient of research funds from Prairie Biotic Research, I can say that my investigations would not be possible without support from the organization.  No other agency has funded my research, which concerns life history of an unstudied prairie insect, as it is not immediately applicable to human uses or needs.Throughout my application process, I have always found the staff at Prairie Biotic Research to be helpful, timely, and insightful.  Applying was thought-provoking and hassle-free, and administration has been very fair.Funding for my project was very quick, and I was able to begin research on time, without waiting (essential for field season biology).  Annual reports written to the nonprofit are not onerous and give me a chance to describe my work.I would highly recommend Prairie Biotic Research to any scientist wanting to contribute to knowledge and conservation of the prairie ecosystem.
Prairie Biotic Research Inc	74674	1	/users/profile/81588	Weezy	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	Prairie Biotic Research Inc. (PBR) is a rare non-profit organization funding original research in grassland and savanna ecosystems.  There is no other program that I know of that serves research needs specifically for these ecosystem types.  PBR's funding is so critical because grasslands are one of the world's most threatened ecosystems.  Many species of grassland-dependent wildlife have seen declines over the last 50-60 years because of habitat loss due to conversion of native prairie to cropland, urban and ex-urban development, and livestock management practices that primarily serve the livestock producer.  Further, very few organizations offer these types of resources, which are not constrained to on-the-ground conservation projects or academia alone.      PBR has provided support for my grassland research on two occasions, and without their support my investigations would have suffered.  I felt PBR had a genuine interest in the success of my projects.  They promptly notified me of my award, and followed up at the end of my projects to find out about outcomes.  My overall impression of this organization is that it values quality scientific inquiry, and its first priority is facilitating the conservation of prairie ecosystems.

I have volunteered for other organizations but OccuPaws is the first that over 90% of every dollar donated goes to program expenses.  The fact that hundreds of people come together to volunteer to help with every aspect of this program is very inspiring.  Also there are other organizations which also provide guide dogs to the visually impaired for free, but those require the applicant to leave their home and go to a guide dog school for a month or more.  Many cannot do that, and OccuPaws provides an alternative by "moving" the GDMI to the applicants location for several weeks, and trains them in their home enviornment.  They are also one of the few groups to provide Visual Assistant Dogs for Children as young as 6 years old.

OccuPaws Guide Dog Association	140044	2	/users/profile/186200	Sharon Y.	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I moved to Madison, WI five months ago, and one of the first things I did was meet the Schultzes, who founded and run OccuPaws. Since I used to be a pro dog trainer, I soon began volunteering to teach classes, participating in training at Oshkosh prison, and helping write the curriculum for puppy raisers. My experience with OccuPaws has been 100% positive. Everybody I've met that volunteers with OccuPaws is very dog-savvy and enthusiastic, and they are all interested in and knowledgeable about dog behavior and positive-reinforcement training. OccuPaws is a very financially sound organization with accessible treasury reports. The organization only has one paid employee: an experienced harness trainer that does all the advanced training for the guide dogs.  So any donations go directly into the program rather than paying for a bunch of directors' salaries. OccuPaws puts on very unique and well-attended fund-raisers, and are always getting creative to find funds to continue the program. In addition, I have spent time at the Schultze home, where puppies stay when they first come into the organization, and where the Schultzes themselves care for 1-3 program dogs at any given time. The Schultze's home and large grassy fenced yard are both extremely clean and tidy. Besides the yard, they have two spacious indoor/outdoor kennels that the dogs use occasionally. (All OccuPaws dogs are normally full-time indoor dogs--the kennels are used for occasional convenience on nice days). I just wanted to add something about their home, because I'm always reading about "hoarders masquerading as pet charities," so wanted to assure that everything with OccuPaws is on the up-and-up!

Once they find them, they will contact you to let them know they are in.  The Closet is always organized and easy to look through.  One of the nicest things is you are limited to how much you take.

St Croix Valley Restorative Justice Program, Inc.	111585		/users/profile/151941	Amy_19	Client Served	5	05/08/2012	SCVRJP's talking circle training has been a core component to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls' Destination Program.  Our Domestic Destination Program occurs over spring break.  The program includes education on a social issue, direct service, and reflection.  We use talking circles as the main medium to facilitate reflection.  What we have found is that by using talking circles our participants gain a greater understanding of one another as well as the social issue they are examining throughout the week of service.  Talking Circles give everyone a voice and by sharing stories people gain a new perspective/compassion for each other.  The Destination Program is so thankful that SCVRJP trains and enlightens us each year!  Through the talking circle process  lives are transformed.

I think the Victim Impact Panels help a great deal and I always feel something new when I come out of them. I enjoyed being an intern and learned many things over my time being there. I don't have a personal story that is like any of the ones I have heard of my time being here but I share my story as a community member to help make changes for the good. I help organize a face to face meeting with an offender and the offended and I feel that this can better serve them instead of a harsh punishment. I feel that this is because they have to actually speak to the one they hurt instead of just serving their time and never showing that person that they are sorry for what they did.  I enjoy helping out at SCVRJP and I would love to help out again in the future.

It was an eye opening experience listening to family's impacted by behavior like mine as well as hearing testimony from previous offenders. Changed my viewpoint about how severe my decisions were and that Johnny Law was not just out to get me. We all make decisions and not always the right ones, but drinking and driving is one of the most easily preventable and inexcusable acts one can decide to do. In part due to the presentation afforded to me from my own decisions and the people who took the time to share their stories, I no longer am the same man and recommend all to participate in or see for themselves what I am talking about!

I was referred to SCVRJP.  They offered me an avenue by telling my story to others. I speak at Victim Impact Panels to people convicted of DUI's and Drivers Ed classes and at area High School Mock crashes.  We try to help teens choose to make better driving and life choices.  SCVRJP also initiates talks between a victim of a crime and the offender by bringing them together to repair the harm. There are many opportunities to get involved in community events or classes being offered such as Grief Circles and Death Notification Training for first responders as a couple of examples.  SCVRJP is an EXCELLENT program with endless possibilities to make a deep and long lasting impact on the community! I am proud to be a part of this organization

My dad, although in fairly good health, is in the early stages of vascular dementia; he lives alone and his social life has dwindled. The visitor who serves as his primary companion is wonderfulcheerful, tranquil, attentive, efficient, discreet. Among the things my dad most appreciates about her visits: "She always avoids empty chatter. Her conversation is interesting.""She seems well-informed about the communitythat helps keep me in touch with what's going on.""I like the way she is unobtrusive about helping keep the house clean and suggesting things for us to do." Above all, she is a great listener. My dad loves above all things to read aloud from works of literature, and she is always up for another chapter. She has been a great blessing in our lives. I should add that everyone else I've ever dealt with at Independent Living (various division heads, substitute companions) has been equally helpful and responsive. It's a reliably excellent organization that has much improved the quality of my dad'sand hence of my ownlife.

I am the proud grandmother of a 23 year old young lady that has Tourettes, Aspergers, and Epilepsy. For most of Ashley's life we have been afraid to leave her by herself for fear of her going into a seizure and no one there to help her. Then we heard of ADASDF. After contacting them and providing the necessary paper work we were introduced to Jonah. I feel it was love at first sight for both of them. Ashley's life has changed. She is now able to travel by air along with Jonah. Her confidence and attitude are completely changed for the better. None of this would have been possible without the help of ADASDF.  Their donation of Jonah has made Ashley's life so much happier. Thank you again ADASDF.

Through my own fundraiser efforts, have raised about $50k over the past years for the ADASDF and help pick some of the Veterans who also received service dogs from the ADASDF.

ADASDF (Active Dogs Academy Service Dog Foundation)	278820	5	/users/profile/368814	MizEllie	Client Served	5	02/02/2016	I can't say enough good things about ADASDF.  I'm a nurse practitioner disabled since 2008 with a painful and very debilitating neuro-endocrine-immune disease for which there is no FDA approved treatment and no cure. One of the primary symptoms is debilitating fatigue. I also have another chronic disease that results in poor balance, I also limp due to an injury. Walking under my own power with a cane limited me severely. I needed wheelchairs in airports and at doctor visits. It was impossible to even go inside a store when I was having a bad day and on good ones I had to use a motorized cart. My ADASDF service dog pulls me when walking so I now use less energy while still being able to exercise; she also is there as a stabilizer when I am unbalanced or dizzy. With MaeMae I can leave the house more often.  When the time comes I have to use a wheelchair full-time, she will ready and willing to pull that, too. Although I had put obedience titles on other dogs and trained many others, when I applied to ADASDF I knew I'd no longer had the energy to train even basic obedience, much less do the immense socialization and environmental exposure a potential service dog needs. Because I depleted my retirement savings prior to receiving Medicare, I fully expected to fund raise for a new service dog. You can imagine my surprise when told the dog and equipment would be donated! When I needed different equipment, that also was donated, as was time to answer questions--and with a prompt response.I tell my story to everyone I can because the generosity of the ADASDF is such a standout in terms of dedication to the dogs and handlers.

WWW NEXT CC INC	296039		/users/profile/386806	martech99	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/13/2016	To better explain our experience in the "partnership" with NEXT.CC you need some background about our organization.To start, my name is Marcelo Caplan, associate professor in the Department of Science and Mathematics - Columbia College Chicago and Director of the program Scientists for Tomorrow (SfT). SfT provides access and opportunities to undeserved and underrepresented communities to learn and promote themselves in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) serving more than 40 communities (children and parents) in the Chicago Area. We provide on-site STEM hands-on curriculum where the participants build STEM oriented projects. (www.scientistsfortomorrow.org)In our quest to provide also a "high quality and free" online complementary set of activities for our children and parents we started a deep search until we discovered NEXT.CCWe explore their journeys that includes many topics, developed in a level that progressively attract children to explore a topic they like, and then, have opportunity to delve more into their selected topic and with it develop a passion. This passion was enabled by the possibilities that NEXT.CC offered.Then, the next step was obvious: to contact NEXT.CC leader, Linda Keane, and establish a partnership. The goal of the partnership is to provide to our children a combination of real world hands-on experience with e-learning to allow them to grow and explore in their own pace. Working with Linda we develop and adapt some journeys and now we are developing two new journeys: The Smart Grid and the Renewable Energies journeys. Working with Linda, and the team of NEXT.CC is a pleasure and an inspiration. They are really dedicated to promote ACCESS to all. To close, I will like to say that for us in Scientists for Tomorrow, it is a pleasure and an honor to have  NEXT.CC as a partner in our quest to facilitate STEM for ALL!!!!

I was so impressed. I've worked in the field of collaborative public art and space design for many years and I found her approach to be so organized and refreshing. The National Visual Arts Standards adopted in 2015 include this prompt for designing objectives for K-12 curriculum: "People create and interact with objects, places, and design that define, shape, enhance, and empower their lives."

WWW NEXT CC INC	295559		/users/profile/386348	Kevan N.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2016	I was initially introduced to Next.CC at the 2016 NAEA CONFERENCE in Chicago while attending a workshop dealing with STEAM by Design. My interest in STEAM is as a result of my belief in the importance of cross curricular teachinng as well as the importance of the inclusion of the arts in a truly comprehensive model for effective learning. My high school is looking to become the 1st STEAM high school in Minnesota and that added impetus for my attending this particular session which turned out to be the highlight of my experience at the Conference. I was totally amazed and intrigued by the massive amount of well thought out resources and lesson plans that NEXT.CC provided and have subsequently shared those resources with the STEAM Steering Committee that I am a part of at my school. I also reached out to Linda Keane after the Conference and have asked her to be a resource for us as we begin to take the necessary steps to integrate the STEAM centered approach to the transformation of my high school which she has volunteered to do. Finally, I have to say that since I was first introduced to the STEAM concept several years ago at my state level art education conference (AEM), by our then keynote speaker Georgette Yakman from Virginia Tech, I have never found as complete and thoroughly developed resource as NExT.CC is for the creation  of a sustainable and meaningful STEAM based curriculum model.

Disability Rights Wisconsin	232313		/users/profile/295850	Cathy85	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	My first awareness of DRW came well over 20 yrs ago. I met a DRW staff member who came to Kenosha, WI to talk to people like myself who were consumers of Mental Health Services about personal empowerment and rights.  She has been a leader in the field for the rights of people who have a Mental Health Disorder.  Her name is Attny Diane Greenley who I have found to be has a mentor, inspirational and a comrade in the area of rights for all people with a disability and specifically with a Mental Illness.  This was a starting point for myself to a incorporate advocacy skills not only for myself but also for others.  After this connection a couple years later I had met the Milwaukee Office Director of DRW who was leading a Coalition Conference in WI Dells on Advocacy. His name is Tom Hlavachek. I was asked by the local NAMI organization to attend this meeting.  I was forever changed and encouraged by all who attended the conference and the great coalition building skills that DRW staff Tom Hlavacheck instilled into me. This was in the earlier days of our Mental Health Consumer movement in WI was gaining momentum.  Then my local NAMI representative asked me to join onto the Mental Health Advisory Committee to the DRW Board.  This is the point were I got to meet many other people from around the state and also many dedicated staff at DRW.  Here is were I learned about the incredible work DRW was doing along with fighting for the rights for so many Wisconsinites with other disabilities.  Their passion and dedication with which the DRW staff worked was verocious and at times against so many odds. Some of the stories of advocating that the staff would tell would bring tears to my eyes. DRW and that staff were quite often the only hope that a person with a disability would have to help the individual or person with their basic human dignity and rights. I served on that committee for a couple years and then was asked to join DRWs Board.  I was new to the experience of being a voluntary board member and wasn't sure if I knew how.  However, I felt so moved by DRWs mission and the ability overall that DRW was able to advocate and fight for the rights of WI citizens with disabilities I felt honored and excited to assist in DRWs mission.  I have been on the board  for 6 yrs before my terms ran out. After a year I was asked to consider rejoining which I did an am finishing up four more years with one two year term left to serve.  I mention this because I have seen DRW workforce grow, a change in Executive Directors, the commitment and steadfastness of all the staff and the ongoing RESPECT for which DRW is seen as a positive force in our state. I have witnessed first hand the positive and life changing effects that DRW has pursued and brought for all WI citizens with disabilities. Those stories are so many that I can not do them justice here to tell them.  The ongoing education on self advocacy, system changes, education of the public and legislators is monumental. I myself have learned so much more and have been  embraced for my personal strengths and experience by fellow board members, staff and others in the community. I feel that I DO MATTER and so do my fellow peers with disabilities. This all that I am trying to express here is what DRW is about and how important it is to believe in oneself, ones personal rights,  the rights of others, and the importance of ADVOCACY in people's life. This is the nuts and bolts that pulses throughout the agency. I am so proud of the staff, the agency and the respect we have for others.  I am only one person that has been so impacted, now multiply that by hundreds and hundreds more.   Our agency is also recognized on a national level too. Within our national organizational membership we are looked at as a great organization to refer upon. Just think.  This all started from a chance meeting with A staff member over 20 yrs ago.

Disability Rights Wisconsin	226795		/users/profile/290526	Frank43	Board Member	5	10/25/2014	It has been my privilege to serve on the Board of Disability Rights Wisconsin for the past six years.  During that time I have come to know many of the staff.  Without exception they are knowledgeable professionals with the expertise and experience necessary to protect the rights of all people with disabilities and to successfully advocate for change on their behalf.  But what makes this a premiere organization is their unwavering dedication, passion, tenacity, and personal commitment to make a difference.

Disability Rights Wisconsin	226283		/users/profile/290019	hp96cole	Client Served	5	10/24/2014	DRW and the personnel that are employed are a great help to the disabled and more.  I had a very good friend who's title 19 medicaid insurance was always being dropped and it was one particular paerson at the DRW every year that would get her insurance re-instated as she needed.  Without the help of the DRW I do not know what we would have done.  Because Dr.'s would not see her and pharmacies would tell her she had to pay full price for her scripts etc. Thank you Honee Pawlowski

Orc Industries Inc	105241		/users/profile/141351	Deborah Jacobi	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/01/2012	I learned about the Winona ORC through their collaboration with other area agencies seeking a local solution to dental access barriers faced by people with disabilities. Like the Stone Soup fable, this caring group each contributed ideas and resources with the needs of others as their guide. As a result, the WORC now hosts Apple Tree's mobile dental offices so that their clients and others can receive dental care in a convenient, supportive environment. The staff are wonderful to work with and clearly care about each individual.
Orc Industries Inc	105094		/users/profile/141079	deskbuddy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2012	Many of us looks for a purpose, or a reason to wake up and go to work in the morning.

Valley Cats Inc	249491		/users/profile/337311	ellesmith	Client Served	5	07/23/2015	We reached out to Valley Cats as we had a few little friends we wanted to view. The staff was incredible and were so accommodating with our time to be sure we could meet up at the foster house. We have adopted at a variety of shelters and humane societies before and this was by far the most impressive operation. The care they show each cat is as if it's their own and it truly blew me away. We knew that we were getting a healthy and well cared for cat! Not only did we get all her papers but also some food and toys she likes to play with as to make the transition that much easier for both U.S. and our little Bella. I would HiGHLY recommend them to anyone.

It was a fantastic experience.  The lead person that I worked with was very professional, organized, and a pleasure to meet.  The actual day-long training session, in which I was a part, was also well planned and skillfully carried out.  The best part:  The participants at the session were incredibly friendly, enthusiastic, and very dedicated to their work in assisting adults develop their literacy skills.  Overall, a very positive experience!!
Milwaukee Achiever Literacy Services Inc	139736		/users/profile/185864	garydalton	Board Member	5	11/15/2012	I first became involved with Milwaukee Achiever more than 10 years ago as a volunteer tutor. I worked with many wonderful learners who shared their life experiences with me as they mastered their English skills. Milwaukee Achiever is one of those wonderful organizations that visibly improves the life of others and that compelled me to continue doing more. Since that beginning, I have volunteered computer services and have been a board member for a few years. A big reason for my ongoing support of Milwaukee Achiever is the impact it has on people's lives. Learners come to the organization with a desire to improve their lives. Milwaukee Achiever connects those learners with trained volunteer tutors and uses its proven methods to dramatically improve their literacy skills. I am a bit of a numbers person and the success numbers from Milwaukee Achiever compare favorably with other organizations. There is an impact beyond just the numbers though. The quality of life in my community is improved when every person is able to contribute in a meaningful way. The skills learned at Milwaukee Achiever help many persons make a more meaningful contribution to the community.
Milwaukee Achiever Literacy Services Inc	137885		/users/profile/183904	JessicaM	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	As a career counselor at a college, I have the privilege of helping my schools students find employment every day. Even for students who have a college degree or are working towards one, it can be difficult to find employment in the current job market. The challenge for individuals who dont have a high school diploma or who are not proficient in essential skills (math, reading, English language, etc.) is even greater. Milwaukee Achiever Literacy Services makes it possible for low-income residents in our city to further their education and develop skills they need to secure employment. I first became acquainted with Milwaukee Achiever a year ago, when the organization participated in the volunteer fair at the college at which I work. I was so impressed by the breadth of their programming and services that I began volunteering there, myself.  Since then, Ive worked with two adult learners: a young woman, who had a high school diploma, yet could not pass the math proficiency exam to get into a CNA training program at a local technical school; and a mother of two, who was hitting a glass ceiling at work without a high school diploma and some college-level training. The tutoring theyve received at Milwaukee Achiever is making it possible for them to pursue career opportunities they might not otherwise be able to and to envision more for themselves and their families.  As a volunteer tutor, Ive received support and training form the Milwaukee Achiever staff in the form of an initial orientation and tutor observation, learner progress reporting, and semi-annual tutor training events. You dont have to be a K-12 teacher to volunteer here; the staff provide you with educational materials and a study plan customized to the adult learner to which youre assigned.  At a time when so many people are unemployed/underemployed and companies report a skills gap in our local workforce, an organization like Milwaukee Achiever is essential to help our citys residents prepare for jobs of the 21st century. The staff cant do it alone, though. This organization relies on the help of volunteer tutors, and Id encourage anyone with a passion for learning and 2 hours a week to contact a site coordinator (www.milwaukeeachiever.org/index.php/contacts).

Amazing Grace Equine Sanctuary Inc	200267	5	/users/profile/261429	Claudia19	Volunteer	5	05/14/2014	Erin Kelley-Groth and John Groth own and operate AGES. This is the note I wrote to Erin after my daughter's and my first day volunteering there: Hi Erin, I'm writing to express how thankful Molly and I are that we were able to come work and spend time with your horses on Saturday. It is not within our current means or situation to have horses of our own, and we are so grateful for the opportunity to come serve and participate in loving and caring for the beauties at AGES. We appreciate the time you spent with us all on the orientation and helping us get started. Molly and I had an especially wonderful time with your newcomer, Nick. Laurie accompanied us out into his and Rudy's paddock. Of course, Rudy wanted nothing to do with us! But Nick came over and accepted our treats, so we started brushing and loving on him. After we worked on his back and sides for a while, I stepped over and started on his neck. He really liked that. He kept moving his head over my head from one of my shoulders to the other, and eventually just rested his chin on the top of my head and leaned! (It only sunk me down a couple more inches.) He was so sweet, calm, and relaxed. I'm really looking forward to seeing him again, but I hope and pray he goes to his forever-home soon--he and all of your adoptables. I admire the work you've done and continue to do for those beautiful horses. Thank you for letting us come and be a small part of it. We are eager to come back again!

I don't have so much time because I work full time and I have a hubby and twins who are 4.5 years old. I'm so glad to have found AGES. I am learning so much and at the same time I'm able to give back. Thanks for what you do. You rock!

They have worked heart and sole to care for horses and yes  a donkey.  They come in hurt, starved, beaten, and blind. None are refused. A call for donations calls in hopes to get the funds for help of surgery, or hay or what is needed. Amazing is really what they are.  Compassion for living breathing animals are their love. I truly am grateful to have found them.  May they continue to do their amazing work.

We had heard about Amazing Grace Equine Sanctuary (A.G.E.S.) and were excited to see that they had a couple of promising horses. Erin was so helpful, honest, and caring. She asked all the right questions and was able to match us up with a horse that fit our needs. The horses are very well cared for by Erin and her volunteers. Their goal is finding the right home for a horse. Awesome experience. I highly recommend A.G.E.S.

PaP is a well-respected organization that has built a positive reputation for itself in the community of Santiago Atitlan. After seeing the different programs in action, I also decided to sponsor a child which was also a rewarding experience to know I am supporting one girl's opportunity for education. I would highly recommend donating or paying a visit to the office if you want to see how the programs are helping the community there.

Pueblo A Pueblo	87699	1	/users/profile/98443	Linda	Board Member	5	04/27/2011	 I became involved with PaP after I stumbled across the website while researching an upcoming vacation in Guatemala. The more I learned about the organization, the more I knew I wanted to help them make a difference. I've seen with my own eyes the important work that Pueblo a Pueblo is doing, and I strongly believe in its community-based, secular approach to helping indigenous Guatemalans to improve their own lives.  Pueblo a Pueblo focuses on education, health, and nutrition - three critical areas in helping today's children to break free of the poverty that has gripped their families and community for generations - and over the past several years I've witnessed the impact of their programs:  I've seen the children hungrily line up for PaP's school lunches; I've watched kids learning how to grow healthy food in their school gardens; and I've seen children sitting in rapt attention during story time at the library. I've also heard about one of my favorite programs - Mother-Child Health - where moms receive pre- and post-natal care, their babies receive checkups and vaccinations, and parents attend monthly sessions on parenting and family planning.  I guess what has meant the most to me, however, is meeting my sponsored child and his mom when I visited in 2010. I was nervous about the language differences but I found that smiles know know language boundaries. But while the smiles warmed my heart, what really showed me the effect of PaP's work were the grateful tears in his mother's eyes as she asked the translator to tell me how much the ability for her son to go to school meant to her. It still grips my heart just writing about it. I am now a board member and know the organization from the inside out, and it has only increased my respect and admiration for the organization and its owrk. I can honestly say that Pueblo a Pueblo is making a difference in the lives of the children and the communities where they work. I am proud to have a small part in making that difference.
Pueblo A Pueblo	85439	1	/users/profile/95327	NDerr	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	II love Pueblo a Pueblo (PaP).  I learned about PaP from a friend and began sponsoring a young Maya girl, who recently successfully completed 6th grade.  I am now sponsoring her young brother.  PaP also has a mother-infant program that is doing wonderful things to improve infant and child health.  I have been a volunteer for a little more than three years now, and am very impressed with the leadership and the new directions they are taking the organization.  New projects to set up organic gardens to support local school lunch programs and establishing school libraries are programs I can fully support.  PaP is doing an excellent job, especially given current economic uncertainties.  I had the opportunity to volunteer with PaP in Guatemala  something I wholeheartedly recommend.  In early 2008, I was able to spend 6 weeks in Santiago on Lake Atitlan in the central highlands. I simply fell in love with the country and the indigenous people I met there.  It is a paradise, but the people have so many needs.  Malnutrition is the biggest problem, followed by poor maternal health and high rates of infant mortality.  The literacy rate is very low among the indigenous Maya. PaP is making a difference in Santiago Atitlan, and I will continue to support their program in any way I can.

United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Dane County, Inc.	215410	1	/users/profile/278818	123dane	Board Member	5	09/17/2014	UCP of Greater Dane County truly makes a difference in Dane County - positively affecting its clients and the community due to the hard work, dediction and selfless sacrifices made by its employees and volunteers  
United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Dane County, Inc.	161085		/users/profile/213580	ZumoDeElefante	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	In the 5 years that I have been involved with UCP of Greater Dane County, both as a volunteer and supporter, I have consistently been moved by the commitment, professionalism and integrity that surrounds this organization. From the quality of services provided, to the clarity of purpose that infuses the agency, it is obvious that  the time and resources I invest with UCP are being used to affect real change in the communities that are served. The sense of engagement I get from that confidence is why I will continue to offer UCP my help and support in the future.
United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Dane County, Inc.	161079		/users/profile/213572	BeetleBug	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	I have been involved with UCP for several years now.  I often gather up friends and help out with one of their summertime events. The staff are great motivators, constantly reminding us of why we're there and what our help means for the organization.  I never doubt that we're making a real difference working with UCP.
Ozaukee Family Services	41840	10	/users/profile/42633	sbeknelk	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	Ozaukee Family Services provides valuable support, guidance and education for families and individuals in need.  Especially in economic hard times, where the bread winner in a family may have lost a job, OFS helps the children understand and cope with what can be a big adjustment in their lives.  OFS will counsel parents to deal with the stress, tension or depression that can come from losing a job. Additionally, OFS will help with supplying vital items for infants if the parents cannot financially.  These efforts help tremendously to lessen financial worries. Ozaukee Family Services is able to recruit and maintain a top notch staff who have the capability and skills to help families and individuals in need.
Ozaukee Family Services	41170	13	/users/profile/42049	carol18	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	This organization empowers families, often single-parent families, to become strong through parenting education,support groups for children who've lost a parent through death or divorce, affordable counseling, services for elderly clients. They were leaders in teaching about the baby brain and how crucial interaction is the child's development. They were also among the first to offer Internet safety programs in schools and for parents. The staff is educated, compassionate and upbeat.
Ozaukee Family Services	38795	6	/users/profile/39697	jimj	Board Member	5	05/13/2010	As a law enforcement officer in Ozaukee County I have seen the direct result of the compassion shown by the Ozaukee Family Services staff to everyone that it serves. The Rainbows program provide much needed support, Parents as Teachers provides the foundation for a successful family through the group sessions and the home visits, the beyond divorce program provides a awakening for participants, and the internet safety programs taught in our schools help the children learn ways of staying safe on the internet. It is an honor to serve on the Ozaukee Family Services board and I am truly inspired by what Ozaukee Family Services does for the families of our county.
Ozaukee Family Services	38591	5	/users/profile/39472	tom7	Board Member	5	05/11/2010	Twenty five years ago, when I was a newly hired school administrator, I was looking for all the resources I could find to help my students and their families. Ozaukee Family Services soon became one of my favorites. They helped our Counselors by providing presentations in our schools. They helped our Technology staff by providing Internet Safety classes. They helped our students and families going through divorce with counseling sessions out of school. Realizing that most learning takes place BEFORE children are old enough to attend school, they provide in home parenting classes (Parents As Teachers), which helped our district by improving the behavior and academic readiness of our incoming Kindergartners. BUT it wasn't until I volunteered to be on the Board after I retired that I understood just how many of the parents in the district donated financially to support all of those wonderful programs. Wow! Great programs trying to fill real needs of the community supported by the generosity of the members of the community. It doesn't get much better than that.
Ozaukee Family Services	38518	6	/users/profile/39399	jennifer32	Board Member	5	05/10/2010	It's unfortunate that every county in our country doesn't have an Ozaukee Family Services. This little organization, with its dedicated part-time staff, army of volunteers, and modest annual budget, has made the difference for our community in more ways than it will ever be given credit for, and ensures that even in troubled times that Ozaukee County continues to be ranked nationally as one of the best communities to raise a family. For stable families who just want some extra advice to get them through the child-rearing years, Ozaukee Family Services is equivalent to "Parent's School" - like actually having that instruction manual we all wish kids had been born with. For families facing more troubled times, OFS is a steady, confidential, and often free-of-charge lifeline. No one is ever turned away because of an inability to pay for OFS's services. OFS's amazingly generous donors ensure that this organization's services are always available for anyone who needs their help. From children to seniors, from prevention to intervention, and because of the generous gifts of the organization's donors, OFS is there. I can't imagine living somewhere without such an organization and I hope I never do.
Ozaukee Family Services	38515	5	/users/profile/39395	carol17	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	After the death of my father I struggled with a way to use this difficult time to help others. I became a volunteer for Ozaukee Family Services and a facilitator for the nationally renowned Rainbows program, a support and counseling group for children who have experienced death or divorce in their family. The ages of the children in the program range from 4-teens. The format is helpful and enriching to the children, parents and facilitators - the children know they are not alone; have an outlet for their feelings and frustrations; and they learn new coping skills. As a facilitator I saw first-hand the good that I was doing. Through this program I saw how efficiently and effectively Ozaukee Family Services uses its financial and human resources to serve the community.

Helping Paws Pet Rescue Inc	292638		/users/profile/383180	RescueRhyna	Client Served	1	06/10/2016	Helping Paws Pet Rescue stepped in and helped me pull my 8 month old Pitbull (Rhyna) out of the local shelter after she was attacked by a stray dog while tied up in my yard. She accidently bit me while I was trying to pull the other dog off of her. I had to go to ER because the bite was really seriouS. I only had her one month and had scheduled a visit to the vet the next week to get vaccinated so when she bit me I had to quarantine her because she did not yet have her rabies shot. After the quarentine period she was scheduled to be euthanized. While I am super grateful they stepped in I'm really upset with them. We had talked about possibly letting me adopt her back when I found a place outside of the city of Wausau. I have left countless messages and emails and they  WILL NOT CONTACT ME BACK. It's has since been a year and I just want to know how she is doing....I miss her so much and im super pissed no one will talk to me or give me an update. SO FRUSTRATING!!
Helping Paws Pet Rescue Inc	112264	1	/users/profile/152732	Heather31	Client Served	5	05/17/2012	I was staff for Doctor Gerber when she started the Helping Paws Pet Rescue years ago.  We saw a huge need in this area for additional resources to combat the unwanted animals of this area, great or small.  I was and still am very proud of Helping Paws, and worked hard to help it succeed.  Now I am the very proud owner of an amazing little cat that would otherwise not have had the chance at life without Helping Paws and I'm also the owner of a retired race horse that was helped by Helping Paws.  Two amazing animals that touched my soul, one amazing organization that I guarantee will touch your heart.  They are simply the best. 
Helping Paws Pet Rescue Inc	111161	1	/users/profile/151302	Gretchen Gerber	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	For those who are not yet familiar with Helping PAWS, here is a short version of its' mission statement. Helping PAWS Pet Rescue, Inc. was founded for the sole purpose of helping to stop the suffering of companion animals caused by homelessness, overpopulation, and mistreatment.  The goal of the organization is that no adoptable companion animal ever be euthanized for lack of medical care and a good home.  This goal is not limited to dogs and cats, but extends equally to horses, rabbits, birds and other domestic species.   Homeless and unwanted animals are offered not just a humane alternative, but are provided in each case the best possible process that would result in each individual pet finding its forever-home.  This organization's mission is unique in that it includes not only young, healthy homeless pets, but also owner surrenders and individuals with medical needs that would cause them to be rejected by or euthanized by other organizations.       As a veterinarian who has, for 26 years, refused to perform "euthanasias of convenience", this mission is near and dear to my heart.  I will happily continue to provide services and to volunteer for this organization for years to come!
Helping Paws Pet Rescue Inc	111134		/users/profile/151273	Mahlon B.	Board Member	5	04/30/2012	Although I live 4 hours away, I am an active member of the Board for the Helping PAWS Pet Rescue.  Every animal, big or small, is important to us, and we are grateful for the support of our community, friends and family.  And, we are in debt to the many veterinarians who selflessly contribute time and supplies to our cause.  Thank you!
Helping Paws Pet Rescue Inc	27502	3	/users/profile/28588	dannyd	Client Served	5	02/09/2010	What an AWESOME rescue! They do sooo much for each animal! The cat I adopted from them was already feline leukemia tested, vaccinated against rabies and distemper, treated for worms, and neutered! On top of all that the staff was extremely knowledgable in helping me pick out a nutritious food for him and he came home with a hand knitted blanket and a toy one of their fantastic volunteers makes for the shelter cats.
Literacy Network	244769		/users/profile/331779	Michelle303	Volunteer	5	06/07/2015	Literacy network stands out, to me, for two reasons:1. It provides such an essential service. It truly is impossible to get ahead in a county when you don't speak their language. You feel alienated. I've been there. It's not good. We are providing these people with TRULY life-changing information.2. Every one at the literacy network is totally committed. You can just sense and see how their hearts are in the work, and how much everyone cares. I volunteer at a lot of different organizations, and there is almost always at least one person who appears to be there not of their own volition, to be holding back and stubborn, but not here.
Literacy Network	244223		/users/profile/331117	Elaina G.	Volunteer	5	06/01/2015	Professional, reliable, overall a great organization. 
Literacy Network	243198		/users/profile/329857	litnetvol	Volunteer	5	05/18/2015	 I have been a volunteer with the Literacy Network  since 2002.  I enjoy being part of an organization that continues to grow every year.  While keeping up  with modern technology,  the staff also makes a big effort to take a personal interest in every student and teacher, especially when advice is asked for.  They approach any situation with empathy.  They always have time to listen and give constructive insights.  I am amazed by the growing number of ways they are reaching out into the community.  The newsletters capture genuine purpose  and enthusiasm.  I have learned a lot as a tutor.  i really enjoy being a part of the Literacy Network.
Literacy Network	242949		/users/profile/329557	RR3726	Volunteer	5	05/13/2015	Literacy Network is the gold standard for a small non-profit taking on an enormous challenge effectively. The staff supports hundreds of volunteer tutors who work with learners from around the world. As an ESL tutor and tutor for citizenship, I can always count on staff to train me, help me find the right resources, and encourage me and my learners.  For this reason, I have seen learners change their lives in significant ways, qualifying for better jobs, learning how to work with healthcare providers and schools, and gaining confidence as they communicate more effectively in English. The work of volunteers supplements the classes and special community projects that staff plan and implement. In addition to improving literacy in our county, Literacy Network very often brings tutors and learners into long-term supportive relationships. I believe that these relationships improve all of our lives, acting as a counter-weight to forces that otherwise keep our lives separate.  
Literacy Network	242882	1	/users/profile/329454	Brett10	Volunteer	5	05/12/2015	basically, they help people who don't speak/read/write english (or don't speak/read/write it as well as they would like) learn how to.  this is good for everyone in the community, not just the learner.  anyway, their resources are great, they provide lots of resources to learners who want to take advantage of them.  seems like a well managed and run organization. respects the feedback of its volunteers.
Literacy Network	242867	2	/users/profile/329434	SueN54	Volunteer	5	05/12/2015	This is such a great organization. I have worked with some amazing students who are so grateful for the opportunity to learn/improve their English. To see their progress and know you had a part in it is truly gratifying. What also makes this organization stand out is its desire to tailor the learning experience to the student's specific goals, rather than having a cookie-cutter approach. 
Youth Voice Initiative Inc	148824	1	/users/profile/198220	mtrg2010	General Member of the Public	1	02/01/2013	There is a lot of people here that can attest that Lika Saliscente and Mike Cee are dubious individuals for their participation on many MySpace blogs that were violent, libelous, threatening and menacing. These two individuals also have targeted people who have openly disagreed with the practices of YVI to the point of attempting to discredit rival child abuse organizations. Petra Luna has gone on record as punishing via humiliating blogs and other media, people even accused of crimes they may or may not have committed. It is more a vigilante organization bent on destroying people, rather than a true advocacy group. To date, they are not responsible for a single piece of worthwhile legislation on the local, state, or national level. These people should be ignored, or even reported, because the income they incur is not properly audited, as they will not release itemization of where exactly YVI money goes.
Youth Voice Initiative Inc	110316	1	/users/profile/150190	Sharon D	General Member of the Public	5	04/19/2012	YVI should be applauded for their unstoppable efforts in many areas that deal with advocacy on many levels. Lika attended the "take back the night" march, a while back. It was therapeutic for myself (a victim in my childhood) and for many others. She was very warm and receiving to my story. It's refreshing to see a common person push like this to get things done to help people.

Woodland Pattern Book Center	159167		/users/profile/211285	Gina Litherland	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2013	Woodland Pattern has the best selection of literature, including poetry, fiction, and chapbooks in the Midwest.  It is also a unique performance space that brings musicians, writers, and artists from all over the world to this special place.   I have attended many music performances, readings, and other events there, and am always in awe   that such a place exists in Milwaukee and has thrived for so many years.
Woodland Pattern Book Center	159074		/users/profile/211186	Ann214	Client Served	5	05/30/2013	Woodland Pattern is a rich resource for its neighborhood and surrounding community. I am especially impressed with the support for the poetry community and small book publishers. Walk in the front door and you will be lost in one of the richest literary collections in the Midwest. In my view the programming in the art gallery, classes, and readings create connections you would never think of. I am inspired every time I visit.  Standing in front of the old fashioned wooden drawers filled with chap books captures a different kind of interaction with the humanities. My wish for Woodland Pattern is a "significant-this-year-benefactor" that will help this literary treasure continue to make a difference for so many.

He is now a happy, friendly, 14 year old and I have to say, we would be struggling without the resources at ASSEW. The staff is some of the NICEST people you could ever meet. All of them have lots of experience in the autism world. For ANY parents just getting that diagnosis for their child OR adults on the spectrum, run (don't walk!) to the ASSEW office. They can help!

Stillwaters Cancer Support Services	215565		/users/profile/278999	JSRN	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2014	As an radiation oncology nurse, I am very impressed with the services our patients have received from our Stillwaters counselor, Angela. She is very responsive to our patients' needs and the patients speak very highly of her. Facing a cancer diagnosis can be daunting. Sillwaters is doing an excellent job of helping our patients through a difficult time. 
Stillwaters Cancer Support Services	205449	1	/users/profile/267617	IvyWhalen	General Member of the Public	5	07/08/2014	My mom has had cancer three times so unfortunately I am all too familiar with all that brings; from testing and treatments to the patient's emotional health to the overall well being of the family caring for the patient.  I know many friends who have sought help from Stillwaters as patients and as family caregivers.  They have benefited greatly which is why I always feel comfortable recommending Stillwaters as the place to go when a cancer diagnosis is made.  What makes Stillwaters so unique is that they provide free INDIVIDUAL counseling where other non-profits only provide support groups.  Due to this, families and patients receive very personal support from a counselor.  For someone like me who does not feel comfortable sharing in a group setting, it makes it easier to reach out and ask for one-on-one help.  In addition Stillwaters has so many resources especially with their affiliations with major hospital systems in the area.       
Stillwaters Cancer Support Services	205399	2	/users/profile/267555	Kjones12	Board Member	5	07/08/2014	I was a client before being a board member. In 2007 I had what looked like a wart removed from my left elbow that had been there for a couple years. It turned out to be melanoma! Luckily it hadn't spread but the depth required pet scans every  6 months for years. I had a ton of anxiety about it and was constantly worried about recurrence. I missed a couple months of work not being able to focus etc...My dr told me about Stillwaters so I gave it a try. They gave me tools to cope with my anxiety. I tried meditation, attended a mind body spirit class and met a great group of cancer survivors that are now considered friends and we still meet 7 yrs later! Im so grateful for Stillwaters. I was asked to join the board a few years back, currently on my second term and it's been a great experience.

A dear friend sister-in-law shared to me Stillwaters services from. As my process continued with this illness I began to interview children psychologists in the area.  Hundreds of $ later I was informed my insurance does not cover art therapy because they do not find it to be a legit form of therapy.  I contacted Stillwater and was directed to two art therapist that have dealt with children for years. My children's therapist was on staff at children's hospital for at least 13 years. My children love him! One of my children does not like to speak of what's happening but asks to go see Larry. Insecure and how to navigate through the situation with children and I feel beyond fortunate to have been directed to the services of Stillwater to help both my children and I Received counseling to Stillwater at Froedert. There are two counselors and staff over there and again we are both incredible people.

Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired Inc	192193	1	/users/profile/250920	Johanne	Advisor	5	01/07/2014	Choosing a role from the selection was difficult.  I chose advisor because, as director of the Weis Earth Science Museum, I was fortunate to work with the Council to implement a museum exhibit that was accessible to visitors with visual impairment.  When I approached the Council with the exhibit idea, I was impressed with how quickly they embraced it.  And not just with words, but with actions.  Council grant writer Judy Nolde worked tirelessly to find funds to help make the exhibit a reality.  Although I had wanted to do an exhibit like this for some time, I had no idea how little  museums typically offer for the visually impaired visitor.  The Council was aware of this, however, and really got behind the project.  I met Council board members at the exhibit opening and was struck by how engaged they were and interested in extending this kind of opportunity to others with visual challenges.  It is obvious that they strive to uphold their mission to promote the dignity and independence of the visually impaired.  I also see their backing of this exhibit as fulfilling their goal to educate the public, which will have the opportunity to experience the crystals, fossils and rocks in the exhibit in the same manner as the blind visitor to gain a new perspective.
Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired Inc	166424		/users/profile/221070	sakowskijacqui	Donor	5	08/28/2013	I am truly grateful that I do not need service from the WI Council for The Blind and Visually impaired,  but having donated my professional skills for an event in the last few months, I am profoundly grateful for the impact they are having on my community, and the clients they serve. Several months ago, I emceed the 60th anniversary gala for the council, after being approached by a partially sighted board member, who heard me speak at a professional meeting. I was one of only 4 sighted presenters at the podium.  As one blind or partially-sighted speaker after another made their way from seat to mic and back again, I realized that I was witnessing the outcome of 60 years of continuous support, encouragement, confidence-boosting and esteem building.  Through educational programs, supply of equipment and grants; hand-holding and awareness building, the council has empowered the blind and partially-sighted community in WI to realize their goals, leverage their abilities and challenge themselves to ask for more from the world. Perhaps even more important; they have given their clients, and their families, the confidence to contribute more to the world too. It is too easy for those of us with all our basic facilities and an abundance of compassion, to serve those who are not so blessed in a way that denies the recipients of our service the chance to show what they can do. It is clear to me, as I've connected more with people I met that evening, that The Council prioritizes enabling their clients to help themselves as much as possible, building their self-reliance, their independence and their sense of self-worth. I would give them more stars if more were available.   
Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired Inc	165089		/users/profile/219455	annikakonrad	Client Served	5	08/15/2013	This organization has improved my life in so many ways--they are like the gift that keeps on giving. My first experience with the organization was through the support group for people who have RP. I had never interacted with people who are blind or visually impaired before, and just the opportunity to talk casually with others have improved my life so much. The individuals who lead the group have the best character and make us laugh even when we are talking about serious subjects.  This organization also provided me with the opportunity to start a storytelling group for people who are blind or visually impaired. As soon as I expressed interest, they were nothing but helpful, excited, and encouraging. They helped me make contacts throughout Wisconsin to recruit participants, and they have gone out of their way to help me in any way they can. I couldn't ask for more!  Finally, this organization provided me with a scholarship for students who are blind or visually impaired. This is such a great way to help students who might have more expenses or challenges than other students, and I was very appreciative of the help.  For anyone who is looking for a way to connect with other who are blind or visually impaired, I would highly recommend getting involved with this organization. They do a wonderful job of creating a sense of community for individuals and their families. I always feel at home in this organization. 
Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired Inc	164952	1	/users/profile/219257	Monica35	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	The Wisconsin Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired lives up to their mission of promoting the dignity and independence of people in Wisconsin who are blind and visually impaired by providing services, advocating legislation, and educating the general public.  The organization doesn't just do for this population but works with those who know firsthand what genuine assistance should be.  Their staff is sincere and their board members are dedicated making it a joy to volunteer for them.  I feel like I am really making a difference when I help out with one of their events, driving one of their Vocational Rehab Educators to appointments, or recording their newsletter.   They value their volunteers and the work we do.  More people should know about this organization and get involved.
Wisconsin Council of the Blind & Visually Impaired Inc	162403	1	/users/profile/215559	barbleftseat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2013	The Wisconsin Council of the Blind is an outstanding organization that is always willing to provide information to our Guide Dog Clients.  OccuPaws Guide Dog Association has a number of people that call us for advice regarding blindness and the resources that are available for the blind.  I find that the Council has always been supportive to these individuals.
Happily Ever After Animal Sanctuaryinc	285140	1	/users/profile/375125	Writer	Volunteer	1	04/07/2016	I volunteered here a few times and thought there was not enough staff or volunteers to care for the animals they house.  Many of the cats had kennel cough and the cats seem to get much more attention than the dogs.  They had rescued a large group of springer spaniels and were trying to adopt them out as quickly as possibly and the poor dogs were not socialized and were very frightened. They had been kept locked up in a barn and it is common sense that these dogs needed much more attention before they were to be adopted out to unknowing people who might do who knows what with the dogs. The volunteers are generally very cliquish, like they belong to a secret society.  One of the volunteers who had been there about 3-4 years told me that he had no idea how this organization was ever going to pay for the new building.  This facility houses as many animals as Brown County Humane Society without anywhere near as many staff or volunteers. If you want to rescue a pet from something similar to a hoarding location then this is the place to go. They may mean well but they are not doing very well.
Happily Ever After Animal Sanctuaryinc	275116	1	/users/profile/364679	concernedinGB	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/29/2015	Very concerned about this facility's ongoing struggle to pass state inspections. The number of animals in their care compared to national standards for staff-to-animal ratio is alarming. The three voting board members are all family (Mother, Father, daughter) and the core staff (only one non-family member is on the payroll, a very part-time person). Their debt continues to mount, assets decline - yet they have launched a capital campaign to renovate a new building an hour away from their main facility. The campaign promises many details about the decorative trim and furnishings of the new facility, but nothing about specific goals for how many more animals will be saved in the community. Something in the neighborhood of 1 in 4 new "hoarding" animal neglect cases are turning out to be organizations operating as rescues, and I fear this organization is on that path and the leadership is too personally impacted financially to admit to problems. I encourage anyone considering donating to visit the Marion location and insist on seeing the entire facility first, as well as review state inspection reports for the past few years.

Happily Ever After Animal Sanctuaryinc	232456		/users/profile/295994	Christina2058	Donor	4	11/01/2014	I've contributed financially and helped out at various events for HEA. I'm impressed by their ability to take in, care for, rehabilitate, and adopt out animals. With the extent of need in our community and across the country, this is no easy task! Their joint work with a local vet clinic shows their desire to improve the life of every domestic animal in the city - a goal exemplified by the phrase "Every Single One". Taking care of these animals is not glamorous and the animals at the sanctuary live in more of a farm environment than a home environment - but the bigger picture is that they are living (no-kill) and being given the chance of a forever home from the dedication of the HEA organization and volunteers. 
Happily Ever After Animal Sanctuaryinc	222963	3	/users/profile/286709	anon83	Donor	1	10/15/2014	Abusive towards animals. Starvation. Cats kept in Rubbermaid containers. Only adopt out to very wealthy people, with finances to keep paying off the organization after adoption.  Works in conjunction with big money vet clinics for "seal of approval". Very snobby and ran by "elitists." Animals are almost always emotionally scarred and underweight with health problems the manager shoos off. Animals tend to be "adopted" (i.e.- disappear) as soon as an adopter is interested.  
Rock River Cancer Research Foundation Inc	189391		/users/profile/247227	Imlucky	Volunteer	5	11/27/2013	I am a breast cancer survivor and became involved in the cause the fight breast cancer through the Ridin to a Cure and the Rock River Cancer Research Foundation. I raise funds, help volunteer and more importantly have toured the Facility of Dr. Carol Williams.  I have heard Dr. Williams talk year after year at the Ride and at other professional events and she is always mentioning the support of the Rock River Cancer Research Foundation and Ridin to a Cure.  She is an exhuberant personality that is really making a difference in the world of breast cancer research with a little cell called SmGDS (smidge GDS).  This little cell grows cancer cells and the update on the research now is to the point where they are trying to find drugs that bind to it to stop it dead in its tracks!  Pretty exciting stuff - BUT it costs money and takes time to go through these efforts.  The 19th annual Ridin to a Cure raised over $156,000 dollars this year with over 1055 registrants - this money will vary likely continue funding Dr. Carol's research - which will have to undergo rigorus testing, trials and eventually FDA approval.  Government funding has all but dried up and Dr. Carol continue to look toward the Foundation for funding.  Go DR. Carol and your team!   Donations can be made directly to the Rock River Cancer Research Foundation visit www.rrcrf.org
Rock River Cancer Research Foundation Inc	91791		/users/profile/105112	Dreamer	Volunteer	5	06/23/2011	My experience with this foundation and what they have accomplished over the years has been excellent. They have done a great job funding breast cancer research in S.E. Wisconsin  and have contributed to several important studies at the Medical College of WI and ProHealth. I like knowing donations go toward research and they operate with volunteers that are dedicated and want to make a difference.  The main fundraising event is fun, well organized and brings together people who are passionate about finding a cure for breast cancer.
Rock River Cancer Research Foundation Inc	88272		/users/profile/99209	Rider	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2011	I have had several opportunities to interact with Committee members, Foundation Members, and the many volunteers who work extremely hard in their roles to raise funds for the Rock River Cancer Research Foundation. That said, I have to agree with the comments of "Poolboy." However, no comments or opinions matter to me as much as those of Dr. Carol Williams, PhD, and her associates at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Dr. Carol is quoted in many articles expressing her gratitude for the financial support she has received as a result of these combined efforts. Her exciting and ongoing research would surely suffer without this funding. As I have said to others in the groups mentioned above, "If you have an ego, check it at the door. If you share the passion of these many dedicated volunteers - WELCOME! Join the cause." Go Rock River HOG! Keep the funds flowing for the RRCRF!  Great cause - great group!
Rock River Cancer Research Foundation Inc	88172		/users/profile/99060	poolboy	Volunteer	5	04/30/2011	I read the recently posted review regarding the individual who insinuates that one person is somehow single handedly raised over 2 Million dollars. It's a shame that personal egos and politics can tarnish the extremely hard work of the Rock River HOG Chapter. Our annual event,  Ridin' to a Cure, has raised close to $4 million in the last 16 years for a cause that can and does touch every family, breast cancer. All net proceeds go directly to the Rock River Cancer Research Foundation. The moneys granted are explicitly ear marked for breast cancer research and stay in southeastern Wisconsin.As happens with any volunteer organization that is worth the effort, the passions and commitments required to make it work, usually are driven by strong personal opinions. Those strong opinions can, of course, often do cause some conflicts. As is normal, there are two sides to every story. I only hope that anyone reading reviews about this foundation and it's goal, realize that hundreds of volunteers, not any one individual, have put a great amount of sweat and effort into making this foundation's mission a successful one.

Echo Valley Hope Inc	35873	4	/users/profile/36663	lulubelle	General Member of the Public	4	04/15/2010	My sons father is a volunteer and works and lives at Echo Valley Farm. My son and I reside just outside of Minneapolis, MN. We went so my son could be with both of his parents as our family needed to come together for him due to a traumatic family event. I went knowing very little about Echo Valley, just knowing in my heart that it was important that we be there.   We got in after dark. In the morning after I sat down to breakfast with everyone and was welcomed like part of a family at a table full of people, most of which I was just meeting for the first time. Every meal, breakfast lunch and dinner was enjoyed that way throughout our 4 day stay. It is a beautiful way of doing things and what I observed was that not only did these meals shared keep everyone close, this is also the reason why the farm and everything else they do at Echo Valley runs as smoothly as the local Kickapoo river.   After breakfast I went outside to see the sign that I had not previously been able to see at night when we arrived.
Echo Valley Hope Inc	35514	7	/users/profile/36336	khenn923	Volunteer	4	04/12/2010	Echo Valley has offered me an opportunity to step back from the demands of everyday life, slow down, and become familiar with what I so often neglect-myself. I have visited Echo Valley several times. It is quite unique indeed. A few years ago Dena Eckles the owner showed me an area on the property that she envisioned to be an outdoor amphitheater. I stared out at tall grass, thickets, and mud. Now each year in August the Widenining the Circle concert occurs on this very site which is now a beautiful amphitheater. Much effort and progress has been made to develop Echo Valley's somewhat rugged terrain, so that guests can navigate easily and safely. Yet just as much care has been taken to insure that development has not occurred at the expense of the land. Echo Valley's natural beauty and purity remain intact. In addition to enjoying time for myself on quiet walkways, and in addtion to enjoying the music of various artists who have performed at Echo Valley, other opportunities abound. I have listened to different speakers talk about organic farming and gardening. I have watched videos of Prem Rawat speaking about a way to experience peace within myself. I have enjoyed the simple pleasure of participating with other volunteers to ready Echo Valley for the Widening the Circle concert. I have only scratched the surface. Echo valley offers much more. Activities and events planned in the near future can be found on their website: echovalleyhope.org.Bottom line: Sometime treat yourself to a visit to Echo Valley. Slow down for a day or two and just enjoy.

Owner Dena Eakles insists that the land is not hers, but rather, it is all of ours. Never before had I felt so immediately welcomed into such a loving community. After a drive up from Madison (roughly 2 hr drive), I spent the weekend in meditation and stillness. I left feeling like an enormous boulder had been lifted off my shoulders, and felt rejuvenated and radiant. I will be back to Echo Valley soon, and will return for years to come.

As a large gift donor to Echo Valley Hope, I gave because I could see that they were truly making a difference.  They provide for those that ask giving way beyond what even that person may fully comprehend they are receiving: hope, peace, self-knowledge, resources, reconnection, clarity, sureness, remembrance and service.   It is a magical place in a beautiful valley reaching out to so, so many way beyond its region.Finding Echo Valley and being inspired by the work that the volunteer staff has and is doing changed my life forever.  I will never, ever be able to make excuses for not being true to myself, this Earth or the fact that peace is possible within.  Hope is in their name for a reason and they give it out freely to those in need.  I will continue to be an annual donor and special gifts donor because they are doing the grassroots work most needed in these times.
Echo Valley Hope Inc	34714	2	/users/profile/35589	melodymorrell	Volunteer	5	04/05/2010	Echo Valley Hope is an incredible nonprofit.  The people involved are the most kind, conscious individuals I know.  Every moment of volunteer time and every cent they get is used well.  They are also brilliant at getting things done with re-used materials.  One of their first projects included collecting safe, used car seats and giving them out to a local community in need.  Their yearly benefit concert, Widening the Circle, is completely paid for by donations--and all ticket donations go to other wonderful organizations for food and disaster relief.  I have worked in the nonprofit field for many years, and I have never before had the honor of working with such integrity and clarity of vision.

My eyes have been opened to the frustration and needs of the underprivileged and to the unfairness of the criminal justice system.  The Benedict Center gets it!  The staff provides programs that educate, empower, and direct women to get out of a seemingly impossible hole and get on with their lives. Impressive!

This organization brings women who have had legal and addiction troubles into a vibrant community.  It is a place rich with opportunity and support, as well as discipline.  Whether taking counseling, anger management classes, or working on their GED, most clients are empowered by their experiences there.  Bravo!

While talking with some of these people, many of whom have probably done things that I would find abhorable and some of whom may be innocent, I am reminded that, despite what they may or may not have done, they are people with special gifts and special needs who should not be locked behind doors only to be forgotten.  Through the Jail Book Club I am able to bring in a piece of the outside world and a bit of humanity.

Yet, they are all treated with respect and dignity in order to build their confidence and self esteem. As a volunteer, I felt that I was making a significant contribution to their progress.

Walbridge School	259315		/users/profile/347834	cesk	Client Served	5	09/24/2015	I was baffled by how my math-loving child with a huge vocabulary and a love for inventions and science could be miserable and underachieving at 2 well-regarded schools in Madison--both with lovely teachers and caring staff.  Research and testing finally turned up 2 learning disabilities, plus inattentive ADHD and a pretty high IQ (both of which make the learning disabilities harder to find- AND trickier to remediate- regular tutoring did not work for him).   After less than a year at Walbridge, his self-esteem is restored, he has friends of all ages there, and happily completes his homework (which used to cause weeping and take hours, even for very simple spelling worksheets.)  Frankly, what they have done for him is AMAZING.  There are several VERY experienced teachers there, and the teachers really care and love what they do.   When they had trouble understanding one of  his learning issues and he was acting out and refusing to do some classwork, we met for an hour and a half.  They really listened, and it was really clear to me that (after only a few months) they really understood my son, and his teacher, who was somewhat less experienced,  just needed a different approach to getting him over a small hurdle that was causing him a LOT of frustration.  Within a few weeks things were smooth again, and his attitude, willingness to engage and persevere to do the work he finds hard (handwriting is a real challenge) is just constantly getting better since then.    Meanwhile, they accelerate him in the subjects he loves best so he is both challenged in his strength areas and supported in his weaker ones.  What they do is not voo-doo however:  it comes from the faculty's training and experience in truly differentiating their teaching approach for each child, plus training in learning disabilities and implementing best practices for dealing with the disorganization and the focus problems that come with ADHD.  The small classrooms and safe, positive (but structured) environment supports this approach.  This place is also great for kids with no LDs but social needs such as high-functioning autism or Asperger's, or just bright, creative kids who like to learn their own way and are not really engaged by mainstream educational approaches. 
Walbridge School	53911	1	/users/profile/55069	cellomama	Client Served	5	09/29/2010	T has always struggled in school. He learned to read late and felt "stupid." He underwent testing in the public school and they found nothing wrong with him, though he tested with a very low IQ (having been taken out of gym class for the test). His self-esteem suffered to the point that, as a 6th grader in public school, he was walking into school each morning with his head hanging low and coming home each afternoon asking if he was "mentally retarded." A very sporty kid, who loves to laugh and is thoughtful and generous, speaks French and English -- he is far from being cognitively challenged in any way. Finally, we couldn't continue to allow his self-esteem to be battered any more so I quit my job in order to keep him home and assess the situation. We had him tested privately and came up with a diagnosis of ADHD, a little dyslexia and learning disabilities in math and writing -- basically a different type of learner than the public school was able to cater to.Now knowing more what we were dealing with, we investigated the idea of his attending Walbridge School, where the teachers are trained in all sorts of methods of teaching different learners. The class size is very small - so small that 6 kids studying fractions in math class can all be at different levels and still progress each at their own rate. They teach kids from where they are in their learning rather than just expecting them to "catch up" and "adapt" (two phrases we heard a lot at the public school). Walbridge was extremely flexible in how T started to attend. He was very skeptical about school and didn't want to set himself up for more disappointment. He started with just academics and after 2 months was attending full-time. Now, in his 3rd month of full-time attendance, he is bringing home mostly a's and b's but more importantly, he is learning, progressing, is happy to go to school, his needs are being met and he sees himself as a smart, capable, normal boy! The change is dramatic. In fact, the individualized curriculum at school has much more to do with countering his ADHD symptoms than his medication for it and he no longer takes the medication. We could not be more thrilled with Walbridge. It is scandalous that public school can not help learners like my son, but that is the situation we are in right now and Walbridge gave us a solution.
Walbridge School	53861	1	/users/profile/55001	lsorge	Client Served	5	09/29/2010	Walbridge is a wonderful school, and its teachers are very dedicated to ensuring that each child learns in their classroom and that of the other teachers at the school.  Staff meet weekly to discuss strategies for each child.  My son showed early signs of learning difficulty, and despite attempts in the public school to address his needs, his learning gap grew each year.  Budget cuts in the district also meant that he was not getting quite the level of services he should have.  Homework became a tearful ordeal and his self-esteem was crushed by the differences he could see in his progress from that of his peers.  We decided a change was necessary and noticed a difference in our son within the first month at Walbridge.  No more calling himself stupid, no more resistance to homework.  He realized he COULD learn with instructor attention.  As a middle schooler he is seeking out math challenges, and continues to comment that the teachers at Walbridge are able to help him, whereas at his previous school, whenever they would try, they would get called away to help another student.  We are extremely grateful for what this school has done for our family and our son.

Walbridge School	53616		/users/profile/54755	elbe	Board Member	5	09/28/2010	Walbridge School is a private school for grades K-8.  The philosophy of the school is adapting teaching methods based on how each child learns.  My son attended from grades 3-8.  If this school was not available to us, we probably would have moved out of state.  My son is a unique individual and the public schools are a "one size fits none" type of operation.  Kids at Walbridge are assessed as to their abilities and learning styles.  Because it is a small school, all of the teachers communicate as to which approach is best for each child.  I joined the Board based on our experience.  I strongly believe that every child can and should be successful in school and Walbridge School has the experience and philosophy to make this happen.
Nice Foundation Inc	121282		/users/profile/165016	joy40700	Board Member	5	08/23/2012	This organization is critical to individuals who have the passion to work become an intricate part of the business community, but lack the skills needed to excel in the workforce. This organization provides an opportunity for those individuals to link with businesses and gain those skills needed to be successful.
Nice Foundation Inc	119503		/users/profile/162491	BigMan778	Volunteer	5	07/30/2012	I am really excited to get involved with the Nice Foundation. I truly believe in the mission of the organization and what they are trying to do in making a positive change in the urban and rural areas of our society. I am very confident in Mia Price and her ability to make this organization successful in making a positive change.

Nice Foundation Inc	119332		/users/profile/162244	ekimsnacam	Volunteer	5	07/26/2012	The idea of social responsibility and broadening my horizons brought me to the Nice Foundation Inc. Once I started working there I realized just how special of an organization it was. NFI is teaching a man to fish, not giving him the fish. Its empowering the community's teens by teaching them responsibility and workforce skills. Its empowering the community businesses by helping to obtain and retain talented and ethical employees. And its empowering college students by providing invaluable internship experience and teaching them the value of community. And most importantly, it will fight generational poverty. When I walked into the door and experienced first-hand the ambition and vision of Mia (founder), I knew that it was possible to change the city for the better.

Lindsays Voice Inc.	203768		/users/profile/265819	yvonnebleakly	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I have volunteered with and donated to this organization.  This organization is a very personal, yet businesslike ,non-profit that I would encourage people to donate to.  The funds are used wisely and purposefully.  I also appreciate that they align themselves with organizations that share their mission and encourage blood and bone marrow donation. They are an organization that serves from the heart.  They welcome everyone to volunteer and/or donate with no heavy pressure.

The leader of this nonprofit, Karen Wenzel, is an inspiration to everyone who comes in contact wtih her.  Losing her own daughter, Karen, built this organization to give families faced with leukemia hope.  She is determined to stamp out this dreaded disease and works deligently all year long to raise funds, inspire people to donate blood, and to join the National Marrow Donor Registry.  It's an honor to volunteer for this organization and have the opporunity to help make a difference.

Trees of Hope has become that voice and the catalyst for encouraging the general public to think, believe, and give beyond self.  Karen is a joy to work with and is the epitomy of selflessness.  Having worked with Trees of Hope to coordinate marrow donor registration campaigns and over the last year becoming a recipient of their hard work to raise funds for organizations of non-profit status to elevate services to all new heights, I am proud to write this review and rate it with glowing stars.  Trees of Hope is what Milwaukee needs.  An organization and a voice for people who need HOPE!
Chix4acause Ltd	168343		/users/profile/223231	eath	Board Member	4	09/08/2013	Chix is not just a funding organization.   I realized that when they supported my wife in her successful cancer experience.  They really care about those who are fighting cancer by helping them in a way that helps them ease worries, perhaps relax and realize that there are those who are truly concerned in helping them during this challenging time.  The cancer experience affects one's whole family and this organization considers that in offering Gifts of Love to meet their unique desires.  To Chix4ACause, a Gift of Love is truly based on love.
Chix4acause Ltd	166477		/users/profile/221152	Kari L. Johnson	Board Member	5	08/29/2013	Chix 4 a Cause gave me a "Gift of Love" back in 2008 when I was kicking cancer's butt! I am paying it forward by supporting them as a board member. Today I am cancer free and have had the opportunity to become the President of the Board. It is an amazing feeling to be able to help other people in your community just by volunteering your time.

Working with all the terrific volunteers and meeting our "Gift of Love" receipents has been heart warming and very rewarding.  I have received so much more than I am able to give, realizing the many blessings we all have and talents being shared through this organization. I am very proud to be a board member.  Linda
Chix4acause Ltd	6556	7	/users/profile/8404	Pat	Donor	5	07/13/2009	Everyone has been touched by cancer - oneself, a family member, a neighbor, a friend. With nothing but the raw passion to DO something to help cancer patients and their families through tough times, Chix 4 a Cause was born.  Seeing the need, Visionary Founder Jillian Clark stepped forward. As she shared her stories, others were drawn into the circle, bringing their unique gifts and talents to the service of others ... which led to more stories ... which led to more people being drawn into the circle. The ripples keep growing wider and reaching further.Chix 4 a Cause help with what is needed when it's needed. The help is known as "Gifts of Love".  It might be as simple as a CD player or an iPod that can provide some soothing music during a teen's cancer treatment.  It might be a day at Six Flags for the children who are watching their mother fight cancer with little energy left for such an excursion.Or it could be simply having a cup of coffee with a patient or caregiver and listening.Chix 4 a Cause is a GREAT non-profit organization because it is focused enough to know the people they are serving, while being flexible enough to listen and adjust their service according to specific needs.

Arc-Winnebago County Disability Association Inc	55576		/users/profile/57776	trouper903	Volunteer	5	10/27/2010	This agency does great work.  They have a caring staff who provide services for their clients in many ways.  They spend numerous hours advocating for clients and their families.  With Wisconsin currently undergoing a drastic change in long term care funding for people with disabilities, the agency has helped to advocate for positive change and as the rules changed they held informative workshops featuring speakers from across the state to help individuals and families make informed choices.  They provide planned social experiences for clients and they are available for walk-in crisis counseling.  They provide great services on a very small budget.

Sunbear Squad Inc	121564	1	/users/profile/165417	arsmoriende	Client Served	5	08/28/2012	When I first came across the SunBear squad website I told everyone about it.  It's one of the most comprehensive places to go to find out how to handle a myriad of animal welfare situations pertaining to dogs.  From what to do if you have a neighborhood dog who is neglected on hot summer days to what to keep in the trunk of your car for those times you come across an injured animal.   The more I learned about the organization the more I found out how dedicated these people are.  I've since met the founder and am in awe of how much she devotes to the cause of finding dogs good homes, rehabilitating troubled dogs, animal transfer, education and so much more.  She is truly dedicated - well beyond what most people in this field are.  I wholeheartedly support every effort this organization makes.

Sunbear Sqaud posts information on foods, medical, fun facts, heat warnings, and many other very important information we should know about taking care of our animals. They also post happy stories of animals who have helped people. I have learned so much from Sunbear Sqaud and always pass on the information to others so we can all become Guardians of the animals.

Golden Retriever Rescue Of Wisconsin	213902	11	/users/profile/277109	GoldenLove	General Member of the Public	1	09/07/2014	I find it interesting that the three 5-star reviews all came at the same time...hmmmm. My story is we applied to possibly adopt a golden. We were open to young or old and we would have considered a dog with health issues. GRROW took our $25 "adoption fee" and according to their website we would hear from the them within the next couple of weeks to schedule a home evaluation. We were well aware that we may have to wait six months to a year to actually adopt. Since giving them the fee a year ago we have never heard from them. EVER. No dog, no home visit, not even a phone call or email. We chalked it up as a donation, but if you seriously want to rescue or adopt a golden, look elsewhere.
Golden Retriever Rescue Of Wisconsin	34930	5	/users/profile/35788	ol-bob	Volunteer	5	04/07/2010	I adopted two goldens from GRRoW about 3-1/2 years ago.  During the process, I was very impressed with the efforts made to provide a good match.  Ben and Bailey have proven to be as close to perfect as can be.  GRRoW made sure they were healthy and well cared-for while in foster care.  After the experience, I decided to become a volunteer, and we help with meet and greets, home visit interviews (139 to date), manning the call-in info line and various other activities.  My initial good impression has since been reinforced - especially regarding the efforts GRRoW makes to resolve medical issues and more especially the lengths the teams go to in order to match dogs and adopters.  The extremely high success rate is a direct result of those dedicated efforts.  I'm involved with GRRoW daily, and I will be for the forseeable future.  Rescue is hard work, but a good team of dedicated volunteers produces results - over 1750 goldens rescued and re-homed since GRRoW was founded in 2000.
Golden Retriever Rescue Of Wisconsin	34645	5	/users/profile/35513	sabellaj	Volunteer	5	04/05/2010	My relationship with GRRow started when I applied for an adoption of one of their Goldens.   I was, and continue to be, very impressed by their professionalism.  It was not easy adopting Bailey.   GRRoW was extremely thorough in making sure the adoption was good for both Bailey and I.   Also am impressed by the quality of the GRRoW volunteers.   They are dedicated and willing to work hard for this organization.   The help the Goldens receive is beyond approach.
Golden Retriever Rescue Of Wisconsin	34611	3	/users/profile/35481	hdldwg	Board Member	5	04/04/2010	I have been an active volunteer with Golden Retriever Rescue of WI (GRRoW) since 2005. There are many animal rescue groups throughout the country, but I believe that there are not many that provide as much care to the goldens in its care, as GRRoW does. And by care, I mean many different types of care. From the love each foster home gives its foster golden, to the veterinary services afforded to each golden in GRRoW, these are just a few of the many examples. It takes an army of volunteers to keep a rescue group strong and GRRoW has that. Not only do the volunteers of GRRoW provide love and shelter for GRRoW dogs, they strive to learn more about dog behavior, illnesses, prevention of health issues, and more importantly, their well-being. The leadership teams within GRRoW do an insurmountable amount of work - all on their own time. Being in a leadership position in GRRoW is like having another full-time job. But, we do it because it's our passion and nothing gives us more gratitude than saving one more golden. I've been with GRRoW for 5 of the 10 years of GRRoW's existence and I will be with GRRoW for many many years to come.

St Croix Valley Foundation	136445	1	/users/profile/182359	scvf4	Board Member	4	11/09/2012	I have found serving on this board to be an extremely rewarding experience.  I believe I have made a significant impact through my variety of leadership roles.  The meetings are well organized and productive.  I've personally experienced the results of this organization through enlightened community involvement.  I am a long time community volunteer and this experience taught me the value of different nonprofit organizations effectively coordinating efforts to serve citizens under the umbrella of a community foundation.  This volunteer experience has made me feel as though I have participated in something worthwhile.  The board is committed to working together.  Board leadership in the committee chairs is impressive.  We have an extremely capable professional team.
St Croix Valley Foundation	136441	2	/users/profile/182354	SCVF2	Board Member	4	11/09/2012	Being a board member for SCVF has been a rewarding experience.  Each board member makes significant contributions and their efforts are recognized and appreciated.  I have served on many nonprofit boards and SCVF is the best run, best organized, most efficient organization I have experienced.  Philanthropy in the St. Croix Valley is valued and thanks to the SCVF the future of the movement is strong.  The board has lively discussion but it is united in its decisions and goals.  The small staff does a remarkable job of serving our donors, large and small.  Part of the success is the professional attitude of all involved.
St Croix Valley Foundation	136432	1	/users/profile/182346	SCVF1	Board Member	4	11/09/2012	The staff and board have worked very well together leveraging the impact for increasing gifts to the foundation and as important, providing grants from the foundation.  I've personally experienced the results of this organization through significant growth in gifts to the foundation in a time of uncertain economic conditions, and seeing needed programming benefit from grants increasing the quality of life in the St. Croix Valley, and indeed in other parts of the country.  I have met an abundance of good people that founded the SCVF, and continue to help grow this important charity.  One of the most significant accomplishemnts of the SCVF is the bringing together of like minded individuals (8 affiliate organziations) in the watershed to collaborate for the greater good.  Historically, this would have been impossible, but through persistent leadership, the affiliate organizations comprising the SCVF are learning from each other to increase the giving opportunities to more people.  At the most recent Legacy event, one of our grantees explained how a River Falls Wisconsin charity has helped the homeless, in particular young people that have no homes.  The SCVF Board is very cohesive and effective.  I've witnessed tremendous leadership to bring together affiliate organizations, grow assets under management in difficult economic times and the sensitivity to personally thank donors on a frequent basis.    Based on increased gift amounts, increasing granting opportunities, the Board has been very cognizant of the importance of very clean audits, great return on investments for donors and appropriate marketing to constituents.  The staff is led by an executive director that has grown quickly as a leader by effective listening and seeking significant board involvement through strategic planning.  The staff is well coordinated, professional and highly sensitive to the needs of the donors and the grantees.
St Croix Valley Foundation	136424	1	/users/profile/182339	SCVF	Volunteer	4	11/09/2012	The passion of the people on the board is profound.

The Executive Director, The Program Director and the Step up Step out Director have no knowledge of how to do their jobs. The VAF simply makes things up as they go.

I found their 2012 Form 990 on Guidestar and will not be contributing to this "charity".  It seems that over $800,000 of the total $2.3 million in expenses for 2012 went to professional fundraisers. And the percentage was worse in 2011.  Also almost $700,000 went to salaries.  You should not donate to this charity if you want your money to go to Veterans or services for Veterans.

The students LOVE making a difference and working on Saturdays. I loved working with Bethesda and Luther Prep to form that partnership. EVERYONE wins - but mostly: people with disabilities that Bethesda serves!

Clean Lakes Alliance Inc	284171		/users/profile/374207	Brennan N.	Board Member	5	03/31/2016	As editor of Madison Magazine, I was eager to become involved in the Clean Lakes Alliance because the Yahara Lakes are one of the most important stories we have to share about our wonderful community. They are an integral part of our identity, our heritage, our daily life, and our economy, and we must restore and protect them for our children and grandchildren. As a founding member of the CLA Community Board, I had a front-row seat to the extraordinary collaboration between the city of Madison, Dane County, area nonprofits and the private sector to implement a solid plan for phosphorus reduction. The challenge was--and is--formidable, but phosphorous reduction is happening, thanks to the stakeholders that came together to through their own organizations and through their partnerships with CLA. Community engagement and awareness around the health of our lakes is also critical, and CLA has organized and implemented programs and initiatives that are strong and successful. Because of CLA, the Madison area keeps getting better!
Clean Lakes Alliance Inc	282260		/users/profile/372395	dschroder	Donor	5	03/14/2016	My wife and I moved to Monona, WI in July of 2012.  A member of the Yahara Lakes Association suggested that CLA was an organization in which we should be interested. The suggestion was exactly right.CLA  is giving the residents of the Yahara Watershed the ability and chance to make a difference in the present.  Importantly, CLA is giving us the ability to provide future generations an inheritance of clean water and a sustainable and enviable environment.  CLAs success is based on a number of factors:1)	CLA has become a consistent, year-after-year regional leader.2)	The organization has driven inclusivity, i.e., CLA leadership has invited and convinced all of the key Watershed players to participate: Governmental entities, Private Businesses, The University of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin DNR and all of the Residents of the area.3)	CLAs proposed directions, ideas and plans have been based on good data and science, particularly grounded on a great dialog and input from the U of W Department of Limnology.4)	The plans and goals include a long term view with short term, specific goals.5)	With persistence, CLA has been able to gain good, positive publicity and developed programs and events that both drive good publicity and in turn spark participation, i.e., Lake Monitoring, MONTHLY 101 meetings, a Winter Carnival6)	With inclusivity, CLA has been able to raise money to support our Watershed wide activities.All of this adds up to an effort that is working, growing and offers the promise of delivering a positive environmental inheritance for future generations.
Clean Lakes Alliance Inc	281841	1	/users/profile/371924	mehrlich	Volunteer	5	03/07/2016	Clean Lakes Alliance is a fantastic organization. They do wonderful work to reduce phosphorus in the Yahara Watershed and to engage citizens in the effort to clean up the lakes. As a volunteer, I have seen firsthand the impact this organization has on the local community. The Frozen Assets festival has now become an incredibly popular Madison event, and the Yahara Lakes 101 talks are widely attended. Clean Lakes Alliance is a well-run, driven organization that no doubt will continue to have a positive impact on the Yahara Watershed in years to come.

YWCA Rock County	41933	6	/users/profile/42705	jhermanson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2010	Working with teens can be a challenge.  They have an overabundance of energy.  Fortunately they also have a ton of creativity.  My local group was working on a community-wide campaign, which included posters illustrating the 10 early warning signs of abuse.  The teens knew just the right images and words to use to develop the posters.  However, they didn't quite have the technical expertise to complete them in the amount of time available.  I contacted the Public Relations Department of the YWCA of Rock County and they quickly came to the rescue.  They were thrilled to work with the teens and provided positive feedback to them.  Together we created an eye-catching poster series that impacted youth at our school.  In addition, the posters have inspired other organizations throughout the state to enlist the creativity and energy of teens to advocate in their communities and take on the silent epidemic of teen dating abuse.
YWCA Rock County	40232	5	/users/profile/41149	whaco86	Former Volunteer	5	05/24/2010	My first encounter with the YWCA was as a client. My daughters and I stayed at the women's shelter when leaving a DV relationship. They counseled and supported me, giving me back my confidence and self-esteem. After several years of healing, I returned as a volunteer to help other women see there is a way out. Eventually I served on the Board of Directors trying in another way to give back all that the YWCA staff had given me. The YWCA Rock County empowered me to be a strong independent woman unafraid to stand up and use my voice to promote change!

In three short years I have seen proof of what art and education can foster.  Through residency, education, outreach, and challenging exhibition programs with a focus on social justice, participating artists, students, and community members can be  inspired and groomed into new generations of cultural and civic transformers.  Community reception has been marked by thousands of volunteer hours and support can be measured by the number of organizations already supporting RedLine, including the NEA, The Wisconsin Arts Board and the Milwaukee Arts Board.  With attendance growth and participation, the  Milwaukee community has made it clear that RedLine is wanted, needed, and here to stay.

A few highlights of my residency so far include holding a solo exhibition of my work in their gallery, working side by side with internationally known artists, collaborating with the Milwaukee Art Museum and community teens to create public art, and receiving priceless mentoring in areas of professional development and my studio work. Redline has helped realize I am more than an artist, I am a teacher, curator, and community arts advocate. My work with the community helps me realize the power within myself to make a difference and the power of art in general. RedLine has truly become a second home for me and I am truly honored to be resident in this program.

First Friends Animal Rescue Inc	321194		/users/profile/414460	Richard149	General Member of the Public	5	01/13/2017	The previous reviews are quite old, dating from a time when the owner had suffered a mortgage foreclosure and had run out of funds.  Did Penelope Wagner  bring too many dogs home from the KILL-SHELTERS?  Probably.  I can say that she did so with the best intentions and at great personal expense.  And you LOSE money on dog rescues after paying pull fees, transportation fees, veterinary expenses and food and medication costs.She didn't rescue these dogs to keep them but with the thousands of dogs abandoned during the financial crises she was overwhelmed.   She needed at least one other person to handle the adoptions and she needed to let some of these purebred dogs be put to death.  (The life expectancy of  surrendered animals at some of the shelters, especially down south, is as little as two days.  A stray can expect to live five to seven days after being brought in.)The $9,200 she paid to MADACC to get the dogs back was also a hardship following the foreclosure.  Why did she pay it?    A reviewer on Yelp said it best: "As a volunteer at MADACC I have seen too many injustices there. This is one of the most inhumane, horrid, uncaring, disgusting places I have ever seen.  . . .  DO NOT TAKE ANIMALS THERE! They just KILL them!"   In 2010, Penelope Wagner was underfunded, overwhelmed, and had too big of a heart.  It was just too much for one person to handle.  It would be a good idea to visit her First Friends Animal Rescue Inc webpage and Facebook page to get the true picture.YOU CAN HELP BY ADOPTING A RESCUED ANIMAL RATHER THAN BUYING FROM  PUPPY MILLS AND THE PET STORES THAT TRAFFIC THEIR ANIMALS.  Do a search for "puppy mills" on the internet and look at some of the horrible examples of poor conditions and abuse.  Then look for the stat sheets for some of the "Animal Control" facilities.  The run of the mill AC might kill half of the animals that come in  they just don't have room for all of them!  Some of the smaller town shelters don't even adopt out the strays  a zero chance for those dogs.Please read Michele Boggs's post at https://www.facebook.com/faithfulexpression/posts/10154522545384890 Please SUPPORT Rescue operations and your LOCAL Humane Society as they get NO money from the As-seen-on-TV national fund-raising entities.  . . .  Please VOLUNTEER at a local shelter.Please ADOPT.  . . .  Please adopt OLDER animals  they are a delight to have.  Many of them were surrendered due to an owner's death or illness or for financial reasons and were perfectly good pets.  Please research the breed you are considering to see if it matches your expectations.Please TALK OTHERS OUT OF BUYING PUPPIES so they don't turn around and get rid of them because they are an inconvenience.  A puppy will require hours of socialization, training and exercise each day.You can find suitable animals at you local Humane Society or online at:https://www.petfinder.com http://www.adoptapet.comhttps://www.allpaws.comhttp://www.rescueme.org
First Friends Animal Rescue Inc	56467	5	/users/profile/58961	Real Deal	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/06/2010	Penelope (Penny) Wagner: President/ Founder  First Friends Animal Rescue (FFARI) was running an illegal kennel in Milwaukee WI from out of her home. Keeping in excess of 20 dogs in her basement in addition to the 30 plus dogs that she was keeping in crates in an unheated store front in the middle a below zero Wisconsin WInter. These 30 dogs were found living in a several inch deep layer  of their own waste and confiscated by local animal control. Unfortunately local authorities did not bring crimial animal abuse charges against her and she was charged only with misdemeanors of animal neglect. Animal control had no choice but to release the confiscated dogs to her. She had moved to another location where she and her dogs had caused noise propblems for her neighbors once again and her dogs were allegedly kept in an unventilated shed in the middle of Summer.She has now move again to the Delavan Wisconsin area.It will only be a matter of time until she causes problems there.

It appears that animals were at one time seized from this 'rescuer' because of neglect.  Reputable rescue organizations are never in trouble with the law and always operate legally.  First Friends website tells of a wonderful rescue organization; however, their actions tell a much different story.  Alleged Neglect...

Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance Inc	6663	10	/users/profile/8513	Jane Lee	General Member of the Public	5	07/16/2009	I went in for a hernia operation and that is when they discovered a massive ovarian cyst which turned out to be Stage 4 cancer.  After completing my chemotherapy they don't see anymore cancer right now.  I hope it stays that way.  During my treatment, I received a care bag from the Wisconsin ovarian cancer alliance that brought me a lot of information I was missing. I realized that it is up to us that are dealing with ovarian cancer to spread the word.  I gave a temple talk at my church about ovarian cancer and stressed to all the women that they need to be aware because there is no test.  My CA125 cancer test was only 35 and yet I was in stage 4. So that isn't even very helpful. I was so happy to know that the Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance existed to help me thru this time.  I hope I am here for a long time to help others that come along with ovarian cancer.
Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance Inc	6638	10	/users/profile/8482	friends	Board Member	5	07/15/2009	This last past week I attended the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance conference in Washington DC. I met many survivors, family members and many just trying to learn more about ovarian cancer. My family was touched by this cancer when my younger sister, Joan Sagan was diagnosed with stage 3C back in 1999 and lost her battle in May of 2004. My sister was a oncology nurse who worked to bring the Race for the Cure to Milwaukee in 1998 when Oprah came and ran with us. There were some 3,000 people who came that day to show their support for the survivors and to help raise awareness.In 1999 when getting ready for the second run Joanie was having problems with hers legs. She was treated for blood clots and sent home about a week later. At home trying to make herself comfortable she felt something that was actually a tumor sitting on the main artery of her left leg where the blood clots where found. She knew where this was going. Later she was told she had ovarian cancer. Last year the Race for the Cure had some 9,000 to 10,000 people. My point is that we have a run here in the Milwaukee area to bring awareness to ovarian cancer and last year we had a little over 800 runners and walkers. Can you see where I'm going with this?? How can we grow this run/walk to bring awareness for ovarian cancer to what the Race for the Cure is like. This year our run/walk is on Sept 12th which is Ovarian Cancer Awarness Month. This run/walk is in memory of Nancy Niece but I believe it is for all these women who are battling or have battled this cancer. Why not come and join us to bring awareness to this cancer that has NO test. So until there a test, awareness and education is the best thing we can do for women and their families.

Boy Scouts Of America	74676		/users/profile/81590	OldJarhead	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	When my son was at the age where we were deciding if we should guide him towards sports, the arts or scouting for his future development, we had a lot of information to process. I was working as a police officer at the time, so I figured a good test would be to ask everyone I came in contact with if they has sports, arts or scouting backgrounds. Over the next year and a half, I had arrested 2 professional athletes, many high school student-athletes, a classically trained professional ballerina, a concert pianist, active musicians to name a few. But the huge standout was that NOT ONE single person had indicated they were involved in the scouting program at any point in their life.  That spoke volumes to me and I'm proud to say that my son signed up as a Bobcat Cub Scout that month and has just completed his Star Boy Scout rank 2 weeks ago. His personal, spiritual and moral growth is far better than I had ever imagined.  I can't say enough about the Scouting program... that's why I volunteer to be a leader.   
Boy Scouts Of America	70111		/users/profile/76625	Nonnie	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I had little to do with Boy Scouts until my grandson, now 11,  joined as a Cub Scout. Since then I have seen first hand how scouting, and the Glacier's Edge Council, helps to make a boy a man. From the annual Klondike competition which fosters healthy competition in categories like first aid  and sled pack races to monthly campouts which teaches valuable life-saving and outdoor skills; to a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner made completely with outdoor skills during one of the campouts and generously served to family and friends of the scouts ; to general meetings where they learn too many life-skills to mention; to Jamboree where the boys who attended had a multitude of educational opportunities! Glacier's Edge has talented and dedicated leaders who put the boy's learning first in all they do.  They are a valuable part of our community and certainly deserve this prize. Thank you!!
Boy Scouts Of America	69819		/users/profile/76309	Julus Pahl	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Glacier's Edge Council provides boys with the oportunity to learn leadership skills, citizenship, physical health, teamwork, and self dicipline all in a fun age related way.  The Council owns and maintains three Scout Camps and provides numerous events for both boys and the leaders.  Leaders provided top notch training in order to provide the boys with the best possible program.  My son who is currently a Boy Scout has already gained so much knowledge and independence from the program.  Not only have I seen the benefits of my son but being a leader have seen massive changes with most boys.  I also have gained so much from the program.  Boy Scout troops are boy led and we try to have the boys do as much as possible and the leaders are there to provide support and a safe environment.  Recently we were working on the First Aid Merit Badge and needed supplies to create a first aid kit.  I asked for someone to volunteer to check with the local hospital to see if they could donate the supplies.  Instantly a boy who is usually very withdrawn and has some learning disabilities rose his hand and offered to do it.  He did a fine job and obtained more supplies than what we needed so were able to supliment the Troop first aid kit!  This boy is growing by leaps and bounds every year and I am honored to be considered to be his leader, he has taught me so much already.

If you adopt from them, do yourself a favor and cease all communication with this group.  They are highly critical of anyone not inside their organization, and if you have issues with the dog after adoption, they will sweep their dirt under the rug and treat you like dirt.  They are unwilling to acknowledge any of their shortcomings or implement any course of action to improve the adoption process and eliminate problematic issues.  Quick to blame the new dog owner for any issue that arises.  Medical issues of dogs have been ignored and hidden from potential adopters.   Because of my most unfortunate experience with this group, I am extremely hesitant of going through any rescue group to get a canine companion.

My students are often impressed by the work of the PLC facilitators.  They write about how readily the 4th graders adopt peaceful conflict resolution, how easily the children can access difficult emotions, how resilient and generous their spirits are.  If only, I read, adults could be so open to trying a different way of handling their disputes.  Peace Learning Center has made a difference in many childrens' lives, changing the climate in their schools and classrooms, and also made an impact on the college students who come to volunteer with them.
St Francis Horse Rescue & Retirement Farm Inc	190380	1	/users/profile/248557	Nancyfancy	Volunteer	4	12/11/2013	The horses come first at this rescue.  They are not bragging about their accomplishments but are putting their energies into helping the horses.  They will take in horses absolutely no one else considers.  They are a small rescue and I think that keeps them from getting in over their heads like so many other so-called rescues.   I love visiting and hearing all the stories about the horses.  Some happy and some sad stories.  Both she and Bill really do care about the horses and put so much of their own money and time into this farm.  
St Francis Horse Rescue & Retirement Farm Inc	126053	1	/users/profile/146600	YouToastToast	Donor	5	10/16/2012	I've been donating to St. Francis for a couple of years now and had the opportunity this summer to finally go and volunteer. Mary is one of the kindest people I have ever met, she truly cares for each and every horse at the farm. They each receive the best care possible and are incredibly happy there. Mary puts forth her best efforts to adopt horses out to the best homes, I absolutely adore St. Francis Rescue Farm.
St Francis Horse Rescue & Retirement Farm Inc	64134	1	/users/profile/70104	diana	Volunteer	4	02/07/2011	Mary & Bill run a nice little mom and pop horse rescue.  I mean that in a good way.  They have placed quite a few horses and sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right home but the main thing I like is that they always get a vet's opinion on the quality of life of the animal and future prospects.  Too many "rescues" just keep the horses alive to feel good about themselves and that does nothing for the animal.  They are good people doing good work in a very tough economy and focus on retirement and rehab now so adoptable horses are limited.  I hope they continue to do their rescue work.  
St Vincent De Paul Society Of Milwaukee	193936	1	/users/profile/253341	shopper	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2014	I read the prior reviews and was definitely not going to shop there.  Then in November 2013 I learned that this store was under new management and thought I'd give it a try as I love thrift shopping.   I was pleasantly surprised.  I walked into the store and was greeted and offered a flier for the sales going on that day.    The atmosphere was neat, clean and organized.   Prices of clothing were similar to other stores I'd shopped.  The furniture was priced low and had a large assortment of different items.  An added benefit is that the organization is a true charity and is doing great things in Milwaukee County.   This is definitely a store I will return to on my thrift shopping days!

We currently house 29 lions, tigers and Leopards at our facility. You can learn all about our facility at www.wisconsinbigcats.org . I am writing this review to let voters know that Barbara78 Is the woman who's animals were seized by Marion county in texas for not caring for them properly.(which is the reasoning for the horrible review) At which time we moved them to our facility and others so they could have a good home.. I do not hide the mistakes I made in the past (18 years ago). I am dedicated to the care of these animals as you can see by visiting our facilty.

First explain to me how a known CONVICTED FELON is allowed to own Big Cats. Imagine that a con man owns 'wild and dangerous animals' and has a 501-c-3, Now that's pretty darn funny. Someone with the IRS hasn't been doing their homework...Last year there was a serious accident there and WBCR the blame for it. Thanks for asking and getting this exposed!!!
Family Resource Center St. Croix Valley, Inc.	157591	1	/users/profile/208994	llkoshere	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2013	As a former staff member of the Family Resource Center St. Croix Valley, I can attest to the integrity of the people at the heart of this organization--staff members, board members, volunteers, and donors. I've worked in a number of non-profits in various regions of the US, and as a group, the folks behind FRCSCV are the most committed, ethical, and competent non-profit team I've ever encountered. Perhaps most importantly, they take philanthropic support seriously, very seriously. They make the most of every dollar donated. They also prioritize programs that make the most impact, and they evaluate and make appropriate changes to their work based on the highest standards. As people, members of the FRCSCV team are sincerely motivated by concern for their community, and they believe in and prioritize the absolute importance of family as the foundation for healthy communities and a healthy society at large.  Finally, I think it's very special that FRCSCV's staff, board, volunteers, and donors are all members of the local, Western Wisconsin communities that the organization serves; they understand that the people FRCSCV helps are their neighbors and friends. This only adds to their motivation to do good work. More important than the people who run and fund FRCSCV, of course, are the children, families, and parents who are helped by the organization. In my time as an employee, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of Western Wisconsin parents who told me their personal stories of how FRCSCV programs helped them and their children. I will never forget one of the teen parents I met. She told me that a positive discipline class at FRCSCV helped her realize that she had a choice to parent without being abusive, as her father had been to her. I also remember meeting with a first-time mom whose own mother had passed away when she was young. Since her mother was no longer with her, this new mother doubted she knew the right way to be a mom. But she worked with an FRCSCV parent educator through home visits and classes, and that process helped her feel more prepared and empowered as a parent. She told me she was relieved when she finally realized that she really could do it, after all--she could learn to be a great mom.  Working at the FRCSCV was all the more rewarding because I knew our organization was making such an important difference for parents and families like the ones I had the opportunity to meet. But I also knew, and continue to know, that the stories I heard are just the tip of the iceberg! That's why I will always be a donor of the Family Resource Center St. Croix Valley, and the organization will always have my greatest respect. They are making a real difference for local children and parents and families. What could be more important? 
Family Resource Center St. Croix Valley, Inc.	115156	1	/users/profile/156869	hlogelin	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	The Family Resource Center fills a huge void in Western Wisconsin, where early childhood education programs are otherwise difficult for families to access.  In particular, families who move to this area from the Twin Cities are shocked to learn that Wisconsin does not provide an equivalent Minnesota's ECFE (Early Childhood Family Education) program, and were it not for the Family Resource Center, I wouldn't know where to refer them!  My experience as a volunteer on the board of directors has provided me with a thorough exposure to the programs, operations an staff of the Family Resource Center, and I assure you that they run a great evidence-based program on a very limited budget.  When you give to the Family Resource Center, you know that your dollars are being used well and impacting children and families throughout the region.  Thank you for considering a contribution!

They do a great job working with and teaching parents how to raise happy and healthy kids.  This is one of the organizations that works in the "trenches" with your contributions.  They travel directly to the homes and hospitals to meet new families, teen parents, and kids up to age 6.  There is no "fluff" here, all of your contributions support the mission.  
Northcentral Maltese Rescue, Inc.	205190	4	/users/profile/267303	Recordbarn	General Member of the Public	2	07/05/2014	This may be an excellent dog rescue service, but I'm puzzled why they don't say on their website that much to my surprise, anyone 60 or older will not be considered for adoption of any dog younger than 5.  After completing their lengthy form I discovered from a phone call that the dogs I thought would be a good fit in my home were too young, although I have a playful young Yorkie, under 1 year, looking for a companion.  
Northcentral Maltese Rescue, Inc.	60031		/users/profile/65152	Susan Lynn	Volunteer	5	01/13/2011	NORTHCENTRAL MALTESE RESCUE INC (NCMR) is a dedicated Maltese (and other small dogs and Maltese mixes that need to be rescued badly) rescue that is a nonprofit organization made up of a group of volunteers that do their best to save as many dogs, show them love with medical care and find them the best forever homes.  Mary Palmer is the President and she is very dedicated with a heartof gold caring about each and every Maltese or little dog. She saved a poodle with deformed back legs since another wonderful rescue did not have the funds to give the right medical care.  Mary has since added Rosie to her family since Rosie was doing so well with Mary and the right home was not found so quickly.  Other dogs that appeared hopeless were able to be made well, shown love and are living happily as part of families. To correct major medical conditions, NCMR has provided heart surgeries, liver surgeries, many types of leg surgeries, and other types of surgeries.  Many timespuppies are placed into rescue and are adopted out also that do not need medical care but a wonderful forever home. Other puppies were given up when medical bills became too high (one needed surgery on a leg) and once the surgeries were successful, the right family was found to give the little puppya forever home. I fostered a Maltese for 6 weeks for this rescue group over 5 years ago and I saw first-hand how a scared puppy mill dog can be rehabilitated learning to love and wanting to be loved.  Little Bit was placed in the most loving home.  I plan to foster in the future since it was so rewarding but at the present time, I have a 5.5 year old sick dog and an almost 12 year old sick dog, each from breeders that need most of my attention. When adopting a dog or puppy from NORTHCENTRAL MALTESE RESCUE INC, a new family gets a puppy ready for a forever home with the medical taken care of and the puppy or dog ready to be loved and to love back.   Buying from a reputable breeder may lessen your chances of a problem dog but does not guarantee health since I have two very sick dogs from show breeders.  Rescuing a dog from a reputable rescue group like NORTHCENTRAL MALTESE RESCUE INC, not only is giving a dog or puppy a good home, but the new owners get a dog or puppy who has had medical care, updated on shots and spaying and/or neutering, major surgeries already taken care of and socialization in progress.  Dogs or puppies are not placed until they are ready to be placed to give the family and new addition the best chance of asuccessful placement.
Northcentral Maltese Rescue, Inc.	59855		/users/profile/64898	Ramjet	Volunteer	5	01/12/2011	This is a great group of dedicated volunteers, working to rescue at risk dogs, get them proper veterinary care, and place them into loving homes.  Mary Palmer, the president, is the key to making this work, and puts in countless hours each week caring for the dogs, traveling to pick up at risk animals, arranging for foster homes, and properly checking on the integrity of the people who want to adopt.   She will not place a dog in a home unless she is convinced it is the best place for the dog. Each summner the group holds a two day Maltese Rescue picnic, where families who have adopted and fostered dogs bring them together for fun, learning, and sharing. They also produce a beautiful calendar each year, and our Paisley, adopted from the Rescue 3 years ago, is pictured for June in the 2011 calendar. Here is a link to the group's website for more information:   http://malteserescue.homestead.com/

In 1995, while assisting neighborhood children with a gardening project, Allen began developing the farming methods and educational programs that are now the hallmark of the non-profit organization Growing Power, which he directs and co-founded. Guiding all is his efforts is the recognition that the unhealthy diets of low-income, urban populations, and such related health problems as obesity and diabetes, largely are attributable to limited access to safe and affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. Rather than embracing the back to the land approach promoted by many within the sustainable agriculture movement, Allens holistic farming model incorporates both cultivating foodstuffs and designing food distribution networks in an urban setting.

My first dog Keira was 18 months old and her previous owners turned her into rescue because the had a new baby. When I adopted Keira she was spayed, up to date on all shot and was healthy. My second dog Benjamin was originally a foster that I later adopted. When Benjamin was turned over to rescue he was a mess with allergies, skins issues and 2 ruptured CCL that had not been repaired. Benjamin could not stand on his rear legs and walked by using his front legs and dragging his rear legs behind him.  Benjamin who was appr 2-3 years had severe muscle atrophy in his rear and spine and most likely had not been using his rear legs for at least 1 1/2 yrs prior to his surrender. Newfoundland Club of America Charitable Trust along with North Central Newfoundland Club paid for Benjamin's Cruciate Ligament Surgeries and now Benjamin running to the door to go for long walks.  These organizations truly saved Benjamin's life.

Couleecap Inc	253476	1	/users/profile/341678	CouleeRegionMom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/20/2015	I had lived in the Couleecap service area for a few years and wasn't truly aware of all of the programs that they provided.  I have since been an employee for almost 1 year and am amazed at how many areas of life the organization can help low-income people with. All programs are geared towards low-income individuals and households in the region and aim to improve self-sufficiency and meet basic needs. It is truly "a hand up, not a hand out" organization. Programs can assist with preventing homelessness, reversing homelessness, car loans/car repairs to get to work, accessing social security benefits, home weatherization/rehab, improving employment skills for youth and young adults, emergency food/clothing, distributing food to food banks, drug/alcohol/tobacco use prevention, income-based housing units, 1st time homebuyer counseling, adult job skills improvement, business start-up help, etc. Most participants are very appreciative of the assistance that is provided to them and are definitely in dire need of assistance. All participants are assessed fairly for eligibility, as there are clear guidelines (from the funding sources) regarding who qualifies for a certain program. All Couleecap employees that I have encountered on a regular basis appear to truly be dedicated to making a difference in the lives of those they serve, go above and beyond their job descriptions to help someone out, and are great at referring applicants to other resources as well. Staff are not micro-managed, but are supervised enough that if an employee is not doing their job and participants/public are not being served appropriately, it will be addressed right away. Employees definitely earn their keep here, but that comes with meeting the high level of service that our participants deserve. I have heard many wonderful comments from those I/co-workers have served and it lets me know that Couleecap is doing the right things to decrease poverty and the impacts of poverty. Great place to work, great place to get help, great place to donate to as almost all funding goes directly into helping participants. I wish I would have known about Couleecap's services earlier, so I could refer low-income people in need to a place that truly cares (and so I could start applying for every job posting they had to become an employee sooner)!
Couleecap Inc	148648	2	/users/profile/197984	nanacouture	Volunteer	5	01/29/2013	I worked as an unpaid intern at Couleecap all last semester, and I cannot speak highly enough of the experience. Couleecap is a great place to volunteer and always has tasks available for those willing to help! Couleecap is also a fantastic organization that works ceaselessly to help its clients. The staff works tirelessly to aid those in its four-county service area and is incredibly conscientious. They are constantly working to improve their services and how the internal mechanisms of the agency run. Their programs are diverse and much-needed in the Coulee area. If you're looking for an organization to either volunteer for or donate to, Couleecap is the one. Our area would be far worse off without it.
Couleecap Inc	95677	2	/users/profile/111164	Goofball	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/14/2011	I worked at Couleecap Inc. and it was the worst year of my life.  Instead of capitalizing on their workers' skills, the tendency of the organization is to rely on the "pay grade" status of it's employees and is rank with rankism.As no one makes a great deal of money, those in power there hang on to it as a definition of who they are.In 2010 there was a large turnover of staff, mostly removal of persons who had any ideas that may have been slightly out of the box.The management system is punitive and unresponsive.  There is an entire culture of denial and a reliance on tattle tales and gossip.  It is truly the scariest, most gossiping place I have ever encountered.The organization (mostly the Housing Department,) goes after the funding vigorously, despite their understaffing and true lack of expertise for some of the projects they try to run.A good example of this was their work in Gays Mills, Wisconsin.  The Housing Department took on a project to move the village to higher ground after the devastating floods of 2008 & 2009.  The Housing Director and his assistance had never run a program like that, had no construction expertise whatsoever and eventually, after raising the hopes of the village, did not produce anything viable.It was truly irresponsible.The management refuses to recognize when supervisors who are unfit treat their employees badly.  They just look the other way if that supervisor "produces;" and will not directly deal with that supervisor's inablility to lead.

Good News Project, Inc.	236350		/users/profile/320211	Toni30	Volunteer	5	01/06/2015	I have had a variety of opportunities with Good News Project over the past 8+ years.  Initially I served on the Board of Directors, learning about GNP from the founders, from many who had traveled to the Islands and from local volunteers.  I offered an insight to the board without the benefit of having traveled myself.  I did volunteer locally with the electronics recycling project.  Four years ago I volunteered globally, traveling to St Lucia with a group of 18 other volunteers.  My experience was above and beyond anything I would have imagined.  I was able to interact with many locals through orchestrated visits to schools, nursing homes and the prison.  I helped paint the walls of the three houses that our group constructed that trip.  I worked hand-in-hand with local and GNP volunteers for two weeks, creating many new friendships.  The trip was a great way to allow me to serve others without having to make all the arrangements myself.  All the planning was done by Good News Project!Over the last two years I have met many people who had been offered this life-changing opportunity and learned how they served the people in the West Indies on their particular journey.  I will be leaving in three weeks for my fourth trip (in a row) and I can't wait!  Donors, supporters  and volunteers really do make a difference.   
Good News Project, Inc.	194986	1	/users/profile/254872	FarmerJim	Volunteer	5	02/28/2014	I have been volunteering for Good News Project for about eleven years. It started with a trip to St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the West Indies to build houses for homeless or poorly housed people. My wife and I went back to St. Vincent for ten years and have seen the poverty and needs of people there. We have made friends and contacts on the island and also with the USA volunteers. We have participated in much more than building houses. Many opportunities for using your skills are available. I have worked on repairing school computers and visiting residents of nursing homes and orphanages, studied local agriculture and visited experimental stations. Members become involved in the local life and culture of the community that they are in.  My wife and I also worked on St. Luca last year helping build a dormitory for a school for abused girls.  My wife set up a jewelry making project and taught instructors and students the skills needed and provided the materials. Both my wife and I also volunteer at the warehouse in Wausau from which building supplies, medical equipment and supplies, and school supplies are sorted boxed and shipped to the islands. I have worked in electronic recycling which is a community service and fund raiser. Because of this and my computer skills I have applied for a Microsoft Refurbisher License and now I refurbish and upgrade some of the best recycled computers. They are donated to schools and charities in the West Indies and the Wausau area. As you can see this has become a very important part of our lives in retirement. It has also been an important continuing education in my life. Thank you Good News Project for the opportunity.
Good News Project, Inc.	194073	1	/users/profile/253545	erns	Volunteer	5	02/10/2014	My district is situated in the rural parts of the island of the Commonwealth of Dominica in the Caribbean. The main source of livelihood is fishing and farming. Most times the yield of the inhabitants is barely to feed their families, therefore buildinga proper home  is very difficult. as a result, some people live  in inhumane conditions with babies, toddlers and other young children. Good news organisation has come to the rescue of such families and  has been assisting homeless families in my district for over 30 years  now. I am so relieved to see families who had no place to live get a roof over their heads  as a result of good news organisation. The volunteers are so willing and generous. They are angels and I thank God every day for good news . Had it not been for this organisation, too many persons would be  without a home in my district. Each year in the past two houses were buillt, but unfortunately , through lack of funding, only one was built in 2014. I pray that tthe good Lord will make funds available to the organisation so that more families can enjoy the comfort of a proper home.

CJ Lomas Recovery Foundation U A	199672	4	/users/profile/260666	Susan301,	Volunteer	5	05/05/2014	The CJ Lomas Foundation is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization created by Charlie and Patti Lomas to honor the memory of their son, CJ, who was lost to a heroin overdose in March, 2012.  It was CJ's wish that addicts and their families could have an outlet for financial and emotional support with their recovery.  It is also the goal of the Foundation to bring awareness of the the heroin epidemic to our community. In 2 short years, the Foundation has held 2 annual golf outings and have raised funds to support the inpatient recovery programs for 6 individuals fighting drug addiction.  The 3rd Annual CJ Lomas Recovery Foundation Golf Outing will be held at Muskego Lakes Country Club on July 25, 2014. This year's goal is to assist 12 addicts in their recovery.  I have had the pleasure of working with Charlie and Patti to plan these outings. This family has truly taken a terrible tragedy and turned it into a blessing and act of kindness.  While they wish to have never been in this position, they know far too well the importance of this cause to our community and our neighborhoods.  Please support this most important mission.

Midwest Organic And Sustainable Education Services Inc	155372	2	/users/profile/206275	naturalfarms	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	As a mentor in the MOSES "Farmer to Farmer Mentoring Program" I love the old Chinese proverb that speaks to how we learn best: "Tell me, I'll forget, Show me, I'll remember. Involve me, I'll understand." There is no U or college or school of any sort that I know of in this country where a prospective farmer could "school" to learn what he/she needs. Yes, academic courses are helpful. And conferences, workshops, trade shows and field strips are valuable and almost indispensable. But mentoring, at least from what I have experienced this past year, is designed to cover the weak spots, the blanks, the unknown in the background of new farmers, or those venturing into a new area, such as organics or berry specialization.  "Involve me" comes close to the best of MOSES mentoring program, especially when mentees take the opportunity to get involved with the mentor in those specific areas where they have the greatest needs. MOSES has a prerequisite for a few years of growing experience for prospective mentees. That's very appropriate because with that experience "under their belt" they will have more clearly indentified  areas of deficiencies and needs - thus making their mentoring experience more focused and valuable. Learning is never as effective as when there is a clear need for it, like food never tastes as good as when we are hungry and in need of it. I very much treasure MOSES for all it is, and want to help where possible. I have signed up to help a new mentee this coming season. Thanks, Paul O., a berry farmer from Minnesota
Midwest Organic And Sustainable Education Services Inc	155320	1	/users/profile/206213	Michelle145	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2013	I have been very impressed with the support and high level of service i have received from this organization.  Everyone I have spoken to has been super knowledgeable and friendly.  As a new farmer just starting out I have been humbled and overwhelmed by all there is to learn but the staff at MOSES have been instrumental in helping me get started.  Their yearly conference in La Crosse, WI is amazing!  Full of great workshops and networking opportunities with all types of growing lovers, from enthusiastic organic gardeners to the big boys with thousands of acres of production, along with hundreds of amazing vendors.  I look forward to continuing to tap into the wealth of knowledge offered by the staff at MOSES and would encourage anyone who shares an interest in organic, sustainable food production to check them out.

Wisconsin Parkinson Association Inc	235770		/users/profile/319465	Mr.RSC	Board Member	4	12/22/2014	This charity has made great strides in its local target Parkinson Disease population.I chose to become involved with the organziation, serving on the board after observing and benefitting from their educational services over the past several years. They are an independent, non-profit that provides educational and support services.  Their network of over 60 support groups is an invaluable asset helping hundreds of families in the area.
Wisconsin Parkinson Association Inc	199752	1	/users/profile/260773	Hugo55	Donor	1	05/06/2014	This is a suspicious charity.  It is run by the medical director of the clinic that it is connected to.  It poses as a charity to help people with Parkinson's disease, but actually is used to market and promote this doctor's private practice.  The doctor puts his own patient's on the board and then he manipulates them to make decisions that favor him and his private clinic.  One example I discovered was the provision of Free Community Screenings.  These were promoted as a free service to help diagnose Parkinson's in the community, but the doctor was actually using it to find patients for his pharmaceutical clinical trials that he received significant reimbursement for.  These screenings were paid for by the WPA and included payments to the doctor for his time.   When the organization holds an education event or conference.  This doctor controls the information given out and insists on speaking, where he shamelessly promotes his own practice as the biggest and best in the country,  Again, the WPA pays for the conference and reimburses the doctor for his time.

Society Of St Francis	72632	1	/users/profile/79398	momloved	Client Served	1	02/22/2011	This is a no kill shelter that has 100+ cats. As you would expect it is dirty and smelly. The owner was rude, actually beyond rude. She did not agree with how I treated my 17 y/o cat with diabetes. This treatment was with consultation with my vet. The owner didn't agree with the treatment option I choose and wouldn't let me have the cat I want. Any cat. That was beyond belief too me. I  had to leave the poor thing at "shelter" Smhe was more like a hoarder than a shelter. Dogs were barking like mad in the kennels. I couldn't look. I would guess it was just as bad.

Fetch Wisconsin Rescue	321520		/users/profile/414923	DogLover2017	Client Served	1	01/18/2017	I adopted my first dog through Fetch because of their promise to match me with a dog that fit my lifestyle. I inquired about a dog that was described as 'a little shy' and put in touch with his foster. Only upon filling out adoption paperwork was I informed that this dog was so submissive and scared of people (particularly men like my partner) that he would "occasionally" and "only in the beginning" submissively urinate. This was not the affectionate and happy dog I'd seen in pictures. My attempts to communicate that apartment life and exposure to other people weren't a good fit for him were met with responses of "he just needs more time". I was also advised to just let him use a potty pad inside to limit his time spent with others. I cancelled my payment to Fetch and they did not seem to care about the loss of money, leaving me with the impression that this rescue just wants to rehome dogs and cut off all communication because the dogs are no longer their problem.
Fetch Wisconsin Rescue	319199		/users/profile/410560	Lisa607	Volunteer	5	11/19/2016	I have been a volunteer rescue transporter with Fetch WI Rescue for over a year now. The network of volunteers across the country is truly amazing! It is truly a blessing to work with so many selfless, dedicated individuals with a common goal: to help bring animals to safety and into loving homes. I'm currently fostering one of my transport passengers and I'm in the process of adopting her into our family. I am blessed to have found my calling...My life has been forever changed. 
Northwoods Childrens Museum	189933	1	/users/profile/247406	EnviroFan	Donor	5	12/05/2013	It is easy to support the Northwoods Children's Museum once you visit. The smiles on the faces of the children, parents and staff are compelling! The Northwoods of Wisconsin is lucky to have such a wonderful resource for families. If you get a chance to volunteer at the Northwoods Children's Museum - take it! They are well organized and you will have a good time.
Northwoods Childrens Museum	164332	1	/users/profile/218383	Mommy23	General Member of the Public	5	08/07/2013	I have three children ages: 6, 4, and 3. We were looking for something fun to do on our way home and I came across this Children's Museum. I can't say enough positive things about it! I've been to many larger Children's Museums with multiple floors of activities, but this one was all on one level which I thought was nice. It made it so much easier to keep track of my kids who don't always like to do the same things at the same time. Before the kids can go run off and play, they have to stand under a rainbow which separates the gift store from the museum. They are reminded not to cross the rainbow w/o one of the adults they came with, use walking feet, and pick up their toys when finished playing. My 6-year old was totally into this! As a parent I appreciated someone else telling my kids the expectations. My six-year old was serious about picking up after herself. Had I been the one to tell her it wouldn't have been as effective. Even though the museum is small, you can tell it is thoughtfully laid out and there are so many neat play areas for the kids we could have easily spent four hours there. My kids loved driving the ambulance, scanning their grocery items in the store, putting on fancy dresses and firefighter costumes, being on the inside of a large soap bubble, playing house in the log cabin, going "fishing" in the pond, and having stories read to them in the magical tree. There are too many activities/centers to name them all. I've never seen a place have books with "phone numbers" on the covers. The kids pick up the special phone, dial the number on the cover of the book, and then they listen to the story they chose being read to them. How cool is that?!? I feel the cost is reasonable...$7/person. You can stay as long as you'd like. You can even leave and return for free on the same day. Kids can do arts and crafts for an additional fee. We didn't do this, but there were lots of cool projects to choose from including making designer flip flops, painting a wooden car, and squirting a shirt! Sadly, we live in Sheboygan so we won't be back for a while, but we definitely plan to return and spend more time here in the future :)
Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin	119870	1	/users/profile/162948	POB1	Professional with expertise in this field	3	08/02/2012	As a director of a Volunteer program, it is not easy to place people who need to complete court ordered community service hours.  Many places do not want to take a chance on them.  Another way to look at it might be to be thankful there was a place to complete those community service hours.  It sounded like his Volunteer work was appreciated by Second Harvest Foodbank.  Many nonprofits don't have funds to hire staff, that is why they depend on the generosity of precious Volunteers.    
Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin	117600		/users/profile/159877	Happycamperman	Volunteer	2	07/03/2012	I spent over 80 hours volunteering here, as a convicted felon. I applied for a job there for which I was more than qualified for, and wasn't offered even an interview. I find it to be complete crap that they are more than willing to allow a bunch of convicted felons to work there for FREE, but won't even consider HIRING one. Very unhappy...

Combat Blindness International Inc	91231		/users/profile/104285	Ellyssa	Volunteer	5	06/17/2011	Combat Blindness is a wonderful foundation.  Since learning more about this organization, I have been impressed with how much can be done for so little.  Just $25 can save someone's eyesight!  This means that a child can have a productive future, a person improve their quality of life, and a grandparent can see their grandchild.

International Crane Foundation, Inc.	259329		/users/profile/347850	R.Dellinger	Donor	5	09/24/2015	I did a six-month internship at The International Crane Foundation in 1992 helping rear Whooping Cranes and Siberian Cranes. I met crane specialists from Japan, Russia, Africa, China, Europe ... I have had a membership to the organization since 1992. This is an incredible organization.  It is very well managed. The cranes, the wetlands and the people that live in the area of the cranes all benefit from this wonderful organization. Cranes are migratory birds and their survival requires international cooperation.  The International Crane Foundation is a terrific organization. 
International Crane Foundation, Inc.	102501	1	/users/profile/133791	Amy Bix	General Member of the Public	5	12/19/2011	First became familiar with this group upon visiting their facility in Wisconsin - beautifully maintained and run, and wonderful chance to see and appreciate these gorgeous and interesting birds.  The most important thing is that this group works both within the US and internationally not just to protect cranes, but to support the whole ecosystems and human/animal populations within which the birds live.   I also give to more broadly-based environmental and animal groups, but I appreciate this focused effort too - as a biologist, I believe that the group's work rests on sound science and has a chance to make a real difference.

Youthaiti Inc	170856		/users/profile/226302	Joan37	Volunteer	5	09/20/2013	I have been involved with Youthaiti almost from the start. Working mostly from home base, Milwaukee, fundraising and raising awareness of the needs in Duchity and surrounding areas. I traveled as a volunteer in the Summer of 2011 to see for myself the work that's being done and to help build toilets and also do art projects with children. It's the first time I'd witnessed truly 3rd world conditions, no electricity, lack of sanitation, etc.. I was impressed by the friendliness, desire to learn, hopefulness of the people. We attended several "toilet  inaugurations", when public self composting toilets were completed. Villagers were taught how to use them and celebrated this step to better health. We also helped in community gardening projects that use diluted urine and now compost from toilets to improve health of the soil and reintroduce agriculture to this area. We visited a community that was installing arborlous on peoples' land, simple pit toilets with cement frames over them. When filled, a tree is planted and frame is moved to another spot. Sanitation, washing hands is also stressed. And simple tools are provided for this.

Jeremiahs Crossing Inc	286577		/users/profile/376647	Sandy_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Four Sturdy Legs Beneath Them - Sometimes it only takes a suggestion, and a door to a fantastic opportunity will open.  Our adult son, Curt, has spent his life dealing with severe autism.  Never being able to speak, never being able to make friends, play sports, hang out with other kids because he can't handle the stress and frustrations.  A few years ago a suggestion was made by his doctor that he try horseback riding at a ranch offering therapeutic riding lessons about an hour from our home.  I didn't even know they existed!  A phone call...a visit to the ranch...a spot on the roster...and a new and wonderful experience started for Curt.  He has such a big smile when he visits the ranch and rides 'his' horse, Allee.  It has given him the chance to socialize, bond with classmates, staff and animals - and he is proud of himself!  My husband and I started supporting the ranch in small ways that we could - Jeremiah's Crossing in Babcock, Wisconsin has a rather unique mission - they offer services to their participants at no cost.  Their philosophy is that a chance for a challenged individual to participate in therapeutic riding should not add to a family's financial burdens.  Of course, that philosophy means fundraising challenges for the ranch...and has brought us more opportunities to help out.  As soon as I retired last year I made the commitment to volunteer to assist with riding lessons, and at fundraisers throughout the year, and now this year to join the board of directors.  A day of lessons at the ranch can be physically tiring, but worth the reward I receive when I see the riders - with many forms of physical, emotional, and cognitive challenges - climb aboard their equine companion and for an hour be able to succeed at so much more than they could on their own.  My husband is also retiring this year and feels the same passion to help...he has already started volunteering.  And it all started with that small suggestion...
Jeremiahs Crossing Inc	286576		/users/profile/376646	Jessica_T2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I help horses help kids. Jeremiah's Crossing is a horseback riding program for people with disabilities, located in a rural town in central WI, 30 minutes from all its surrounding 'big' cities. I came to know about the ranch through an interaction that only God could have coordinated and found myself meeting co-founders Roger and Kathleen Harris just days later. After only minutes at the ranch, I could feel the love that they have for each other, their horses, their program and especially, their riders! From day one I knew this would be part of my mission to serve God and my community, doing all that I could to support this incredible program! In addition to volunteering during their lessons, I am also the volunteer Volunteer Coordinator. This past summer I helped Jeremiah's Crossing kick-start our Volunteer Contest, raising awareness in the community about the program and bringing in new volunteers! As a result of the contest our number of volunteers grew, which meant we were able to provide more horseback riding lessons than ever before! However, because of the ranch's remote location and rural surrounding towns/cities, volunteerism (our program is run solely on a volunteer basis) and donations continue to be a challenge. Yet, no riders are charged for a single lesson! This is truly an incredible program, doing God's work and worthy of recognition! I am so thankful to be a part of Jeremiah's Crossing. jeremiahscrossing.org

Call In On Crime Inc	322152		/users/profile/415801	hiawatha18	General Member of the Public	1	01/26/2017	We have repeatedly asked Brian K from this organization to stop calling us.  We've been asking for years.  We used to give to this organization when we lived in the area but we have long since moved away and now donate to similar organizations where we are now located.  I don't know what the problem is or why they insist on calling but they aren't very cooperative with our requests.  Needless to say I won't be donating unless I ever move back to this area.
Call In On Crime Inc	103078		/users/profile/136824	Melinda6	Donor	1	01/09/2012	We used to give to this organization, but our policy on giving has changed in the last two years.  We now no longer accept solicitations over the phone.  We ask all non-profits to submit requests from donations in writing and no longer call.  This organization has called us a total of 5 times since we've asked to be removed from the call list. Plus - based on what I've learned - I'm not sure how this organization functions -- it's supposed to be a crime stoppers network - but it's supporting the arts? I'd steer clear on this one.
St Lucas Lutheran Church	102414		/users/profile/63041	Bob53207	Client Served	5	12/17/2011	This is the very best Choice School in Milwaukee.  It has received the status of exemplary accreditation from the WELS.  It has teachers who truly care to give their best each day to each and every child.  The facilities are first rate as well.  I would highly recommend this school to any parent who is open to providing their child with an education that is Christ-centered.

Big Brothers And Big Sisters Of Metropolitan Milwaukee Inc	147508		/users/profile/195034	Tari	Volunteer	5	01/01/2013	I am so disappointed by the previous post. BBBS Milwaukee is a fantastic organization and is making a tremendous difference for thousands of children in our community. The vast majority of "littles" come from single-parent, low income families. They truly benefit from having another, perhaps more stable, individual in their lives. I have been a "Big" for ten years and have seen my "little" grow and thrive. She is now in college! BBBS did a great job matching us in the first place and they have provided guidance and support throughout the years. A tremendously worthwhile organization, I support BBBS with both my time and wallet.
Big Brothers And Big Sisters Of Metropolitan Milwaukee Inc	116778		/users/profile/158942	nsummerb	Volunteer	1	06/27/2012	I have been a "Big" for over a year with this organization, and it has been a totally underwhelming experience.  I see my "Little" a minimum of 3 times a month.  I made a commitment to complete 2 years with my "Little" so I will continue until the end of the second year.  To be candid, my "Little" is not remotely needy: on the honor roll, active in sports/ music/theatre, and has a very close and loving family with a parent who is an educated professional.  Unfortunately, despite multiple communications with the agency, they affirm that the child is appropriate for the program.  It is my impression that they are keeping this child in the program to bolster their "success" rates.  I believe my time is wasted being a playmate when I could be truly helping a child in need.  Even as a highly active volunteer, I am constantly getting requests to donate money to the organization (which I think is in poor taste).  I would not recommend this organization for volunteering or charitable giving. 
World Ties Ltd	147382		/users/profile/194751	Bea E.	General Member of the Public	5	12/28/2012	More than 10 years ago the Organization TIES PROGRAM began brightening small hearts of children living at a poor orphanage in Arequipa, Peru. They do so every summer by sending  these boys and girls to  see, in many cases for the first time in their lives, the great sea, enjoy an ice cream, and experience a smile.  Thank God these two organizations, Ties Program and orphanage CHAVEZ de la ROSA, got to know one another.   Thank you for always Ties Program.     ~Jorge Meza
World Ties Ltd	122650		/users/profile/167058	Prino1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/20/2012	I am an adjunct staff member for World Ties and have witness the work of Project Kindness first hand.  On trips to India the families generosity has given donations to organizations that are serving children in need of care and protection.  The donations have been received and used for everything from medicines to new health and safety equipment.  The most poignant part of Project Kindness for me is knowing that the families have been able to give back to their birth country in a non intimidating way.  Many families during birth country trips are overwhelmed about who to give to, how much to give and whether their money will be put to use or into someone's pocket.  Project Kindness allows them to know that WORLD TIES LTD respects this difficult position and makes donations to places where the money can be used for the safety and well being of the children.

I regard them as a leadership organization as I know that whatever WBCC does, it will be done well.  They research issues thoroughly and I know I can have confidance in their positions.  The education conferences and seminars WBCC sponsors are always top notch and worth my time. Although their focus is on breast cancer and research on breast cancer, WBCC seems to recognize that general cancer research can have a direct benefit to breast cancer patients and survivors.  I appreciate that WBCC takes the broad view.

Community Benefit Tree Inc	46680	4	/users/profile/47502	geralyn1966	Client Served	5	06/29/2010	I heard about Community Benefit Tree through a family member.  We attended a informational seminar offered by CBT on how to host a benefit.  This seminar showed me that there was some light at the end of the tunnel. Our family had been in a car accident which left our youngest son paralyzed from the mid-chest down.  We needed help to cover the costs of remodeling to accommodate a wheelchair and adding a bedroom to the first floor of our home. CBT had all the information and abilities to help plan a benefit and the volunteers were extremely knowledgable and helpful in sometimes life altering situations.
Community Benefit Tree Inc	45338	11	/users/profile/46231	sheila-oakley	Client Served	5	06/24/2010	Our son was diagnosed at age two with a rare braintumor. He undergone a surgery in 2005 to remove the tumor as well as in 2007 underwent a second surgery as more cells were found via a routine MRI. Five weeks later to the date, he had fluid on the brain resulting from the surgery and was again hospitalized. During this time my husband and I felt that we could do it on our own. We didn't ask for help as when we searched for state and local help we didn't meet the guidelines. We were a middle income family with both of us working so the household income didn't meet the 'needing guidelines'. It was fustrating as our son was placed on hormone replacement (daily medications) immediately following the first surgery and would be life long. He lost his pitutary gland so in order for him to function and live, he needs help with daily oral meds. Not to mention his growth has stopped as without a pitutary gland one will not grow. So being two and through the years he has stayed in a two year old body. In December 2008 through January 2009 he underwent Tomotheraphy Radiation (29 days) to again target more cells that showed on a routine MRI scan. For the time up through the second surgery we took finances from our 401K, savings and other investments to pay for the over $20,000.00 medical out of pocket expenses. Not to mention travel expenses. We were blessed to be able to fall back on what we had to retire on. Going up against the radiation we didn't know what, where or how we were moving forward as we had exhausted all our opportunties of monies. But knew we had to live and provide for our family of two children. During 2007 my husband also lost his job as it moved overseas. So we were extremely unstable of yet another financial crisis. Our families got together and teamed with Community Benefit Tree and had a benefit for our son in May of 2009. The monies raised were to help with medical and living expenses. It gave us HOPE that we had something to help us through the next level of our journey. As the support came from many different areas of the community, CBT also gave their support in guidance when I called and asked questions of concern as to handle various situations. Still to this date of June 2010 I can call them with questions and they guide me in a direction that supports me and my family. Our son continues to get treatment in Milwaukee and is doing good! We live one day at a time and make memories.

Fishing has no boundaries, inc	54400		/users/profile/55796	kat2008	Volunteer	5	10/04/2010	Fishing is a time on the water when everyone is equal.  It is more important today to give those that can not go themselves a helping hand.  Sharing a day on the water is more than just the moment it is a time to remember when and next year when they can do it again.  With disabilities so many some physical and some not when you bring them altogether it gives them a chance to see others some better off than them and some who do not have it so good.  It gives opportunity to feel alive to build confidence.  Most of all to see that special smile it speaks volumes, volunteer at an event you have made a difference to some very special anglers who may not have the chance without you.
Wilson Disease Association	45111	11	/users/profile/46002	rene2	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2010	The WDA has been awesome in term of information, support, and raising awareness for this very common but severely misunderstood disease.
Wilson Disease Association	44639	9	/users/profile/45551	vilma	Volunteer	5	06/20/2010	It was in 1999 when my daughter Vanessa, then 14 years old started to show signs of a liver disease. Her eyes turned yellowish and  she started vomiting.  I sent her at a nearby government hospital but was rejected.  So, I decided to bring her at a private hospital  where she was confined for about 10 days.  Though the blood tests resulted negative of hepatitis they still indicated at the medical abstract as viral hepatitis. She was blood transfused and later  discharged.  After a couple of months, she felt weak and had jaundice again.It was then that we started visiting the doctor almost weekly. There was another confinement.  She was given Vitamin K shots, aminoleban, prednisone and Vitamin B. In 2000, after several months from here  2 confinements, the more she became weaker. She often had muscle spasm on both legs which pained her the most. Her tummy became big.  Her situation worsened when she can't hardly speak anymore. She will just cry and walked like a robot.  At one time, I patiently waited her gastroenterologist after clinic hour and asked him about the real condition of my daughter. All he could say was her illness would require long treatment. In July 2000, she acted strange and utter words she never used to say. When we brought her at the hospital she was tied in bed and acted as if she was possessed by an evil spirit. It was about 3 days when she got back to her normal self. After 2 weeks she was again admitted at the hospital this time she lost her vision for 3 days. After a week confinement and a transfusion of white blood platelets she regained her vision and released. It was in September when Vanessa got into a coma for 3 days.  Being a single mother, I asked my family's opinion and we decided to bring her to Philippine General Hospital. To my dismay she was denied admission for the reason that the hospital is full. It was my faith that I could hold on that time. Through prayer, the Lord directed me to bring her at the nearest hospital which I thought was Medical Center Manila, a private hospital. There she was admitted and immediately underwent series of lab tests. They asked me who my daughter's doctor was. Acting through faith, I mentioned the name of a doctor once mentioned by my brother.In a little while, the doctor I mentioned, Dra Ibanez, arrived. She told me that the lab tests had a 20/80 chance of survival for Vanessa.  That all we could do is pray. At the lobby of the hospital I prayed, "Lord, I know that with You nothing is impossible.  Even if there's only 1% of survival for Vanessa I will hold on to it because I believe in YOU." The next day she regained consciousness. But she was almost paralayzed and can't speak. I know God answers prayer. She brought us to Dra Ibanez because she was able to correctly diagnosed her. She said the medicine is not available locally though there's a branch office of the manufacturer of the medicine. I went to the pharma office but said they don"t have even ! bottle stock of the medicine because there's no patient in need of it. Dra Ibanez told me about her patient 10 years ago who may have some stock of the medicine.  My brother lost no time and search a remote province to locate the patient. Fortunately, he was able to trace the patient who came from a poor family and gave the first 40 tablet of cuprimine. After a month of confiment she was released again on wheel chair. In December she was able to walk and speak again. With only her big tummy as the only signs left, I thought everything was okey. in March 2001, she felt weak and had constant fever that I had to confine her again. She was released and after a week back to her hospital bed and was released again. March 26, on her check up with Dra Ibanez, she was advised to be confined again.  She refused.  She said she had enough of the hospitalization and already resigned to her fate.  She  knew we don't have enough money for confinement. The next day, March 27, from the wee hour of the morning while I continue to wipe her with cold towel to subside her fever we had a heart to heart talk... She left me with her seven last words! One of it is to reach out to other WD patients. A week after she was cremated on April 3 I opened my email and read a message from Mr Philip Sellner, then WDA President directing Ms. Mary Graper to assist me. I extented my gratitude and said their help came a little late. Mary and I had became good friends. Now she is the President of WDA and I was designated as the support contact person here in the Philippines. Through our joint effort and one goal to reach out to WD patients WDA, USA and WDA Philippines had helped out about 30 affected patients, about 20 died and 10 surviving. Inspite of some losts, I know God will continue to sustain our needs through the kindness of WDA. Without them, many lives would had been lost. Now, WDA is the sole hope of all WD patients in the Philippines.  God is awesome! God is Good!

She and her sister do not care about the animals, it's about the donations. The animals live in a prison, some from babies to death, and they use the excuse to find forever homes. They turn away many who love animals and many who walk away heartbroken because they were ignored never considered or verbally abused. They live a lie.  It's all about the contributions. The donations dont go to the animal vet care, the animals are sick, the donations dont go towards spay and neuter, the animals who are spayed and neutered come into the shelter that way, the employees do not get paid and are told they just don't really care about the animals if they say they have to leave. This woman and her sister and her husband have the money to pay.  It is amazing they have gotten away with it for as long as they have. I guess knowing how little Wisconsin has in animal laws and acting as a fake animal rights person are the costume, otherwise, she would care about the animals and not the dollars they bring in from unknowing good hearted people.  Going to sick hearted people. This is all true and not opinion, very much personal experience here.  Also go to Saint Francis Society or SPCA to see a history of the over $800,000 just that charity of hers made in 2 years, just for a glimpse of hard facts into what I know.

The are not advocates for Women and this organization in 5 years has zero significant achivements except yearly increasing salaries for themselves. I am the founder of REAL Women in Trucking . Myself and many other concerned individuals shared a great deal of content to Ellen Voie for the good of all drivers due to the harassment in training carriers, most complaints coming from her sponsors. What she did was collect the information & repakage it as document availabl only to the highest paying sponsors. Free information to protect Women she offers only to the highest bidder. This organization does not represent female truck drivers. It is only a vehicle for Ellen Voie & Char Pingel and should be investigated by the IRS for fraud.

Local Unions No 19 & 127 Health And Welfare Fund	82963		/users/profile/91761	Kate T.	Client Served	1	03/23/2011	We have been union members for 25 years, faithfully paying our dues, which range from 4000-7000 dollars per year.  When my husband found himself in the middle of  a problem between University workers who were blackmailing him to undertake jobs outside of his scope, he went to  his boss who rather than being grateful for finding out about the scandal, told him he could resign now or be fired.  My husband contacted the union, who said not to resign, that they would step in and help.  Then they changed their minds with no warning and he lost his job for being abused and manipulated on the job by greedy co-workers.  This union appears to not step up when it's "clients" need them the most.  They are politically motivated and running in corporate-like mode, no longer protecting their members.

Interfaith Senior Programs Inc	80878	2	/users/profile/88303	Ron Retzke	Board Member	5	03/01/2011	I have been involved with Interfaith Senior Programs for over 6 years, most of that time as a Board Director. I have been involved with a number of nonprofit organizations and have served on many Boards. This organization is among the best.  It has an important mission. Seniors are a valuable asset in our communities. Yet seniors also are among our most frail and some have transportation and other needs. ISP taps into the resources of our senior population and applies it to a number of organizations, schools, and seniors in need. It is connected to the community and aware of its needs. Its advisory boards consist of past Board Directors, community leaders, seniors and clients. It is connected to over 70 congregations.  It has excellent leadership at the staff and Board level. Its Executive Director, Kathy Gale, is widely respected in the community for her vision and leadership skills. The Board is among the most active that I have been on. Most importantly, it achieves results and has made a significant difference in this community. There are pages of testimonials from seniors, family members, professional and students.   
Worldbuilders Inc	313627		/users/profile/404981	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	10/23/2016	A celebrity author funds the overhead? Really? At this point, he's written 2 bestsellers, the last 5+ years ago. Where do you think he's getting HIS money to support himself and his growing family?He started Worldbuilders, a charity that just gives money to ANOTHER charity. And plays videogames. Lots of videogames. And reads books to his kids. And critiques those books (which he "loves"---he rates each 5:5) on GoodReads.What else does he do with his time? What I can tell you--he doesn't work--like at a JOB, that brings in MONEY--so how could you think he is "funding" the overhead for Worldbuilders?As a Worldbuilders Administrator, he is entitled to draw a paycheck. I just wonder how big it is. Apparently, it's big enough he doesn't need to finish his trilogy.Though it looks like he is taking in cash off his Kickstarter boardgame, Tak. There's that, too.
Worldbuilders Inc	274630	1	/users/profile/364083	Agirl	Donor	5	12/18/2015	Donating through this nonprofit is a great way to double your impact. Throughout the year I notice campaigns where they will match my donation to charities like the Heifer project (helping people help themselves, by giving them the tools to succeed and become sustainable). I'm sure that they do much more, but this is the part that I participate in year after year. They are a bunch of fun too, with giveaways and jokes. A celebrity author funds the overhead, so your dollars go to the people in need. And since he's a skilled and wildly entertaining author, the blog and updates are so fun to read.
Milwaukee Pets Alive Inc	276939		/users/profile/173498	Sara49	Donor	5	01/18/2016	This is an amazing volunteer-run rescue that pulls injured and ill pets from MADACC and puts them into foster homes to get all the vet care, love, and attention they need to recover.  I have adopted 2 cats from them.  They are very attentive and educational in their approach to make sure their foster animals find their true forever home.  They keep in touch and are available to answer any questions you may have.  I attend their events regularly and don't know how they manage to raise enough funds for all their hefty vet bills, but they have dedicated volunteers that make it happen.  Truly amazing folks!
Milwaukee Pets Alive Inc	188368	4	/users/profile/245776	MFeeley	General Member of the Public	1	11/12/2013	The executive director rules with an iron fist, is controlling and doesn't have a personality for working with the public. It's her way or the highway. Volunteers are seen as insubordinate and not respecting of authority if they ask a question or provide constructive criticism. Foster families (who should be treated like gold) are ignored or verbally trashed if they have issues with their foster animals or ask questions -- and then are called "crazy" if the foster situation doesn't work out and the animal needs to be moved to a new foster home. Comments asking "uncomfortable" questions or offering constructive criticism are deleted. If you've donated to this organization, you have a right to ask the executive director where your money goes. As a nonprofit, they are required to provide an annual report stating as such, but so far have not provided any transparency as to how it spends its money.
FOND DU LAC HUMANE SOCIETY INC	124642	1	/users/profile/169585	amykellythomas	Board Member	5	10/05/2012	I've been involved with the shelter for many years now; first just as a donator. Then, we adopted our wonderful boxer mix puppy from the shelter in 2005.  From there, I became more active. . .and took over the golf outing fundraiser in 2008. . .and became a board member in 2009! Everyone at the shelter is very passionate about the animals, and do what is necessary to care for them until they are placed in a forever home.  It's serious business--they want to ensure that the animal is placed in the best matched home for it!  And in the end, that's what all of us involved with the shelter want. . .the animals to have the love and security of a family and home :)

We have survived with borrowed space so far but we need our own roof over our heads.Aviators By Design HANGAR PROJECTAviators By Design is homeless and our kids need their very own hangar.  We have survived with borrowed space so far but now it is time for our very own home. You can help us put a roof over our head and bring us in from being out in the rain and the cold. We need to build a hangar that will include adequate heated work shop and training space.  A space desperately needed for our kids to meet and work on their projects. Aviators By Design started with an uninsulated hangar and in the winters when temperatures fell way below zero, it just was way too cold.  There was just no way to keep the area heated.  We did get an offer to move into a heated workshop and we did knowing that this would be a temporary solution.  This facility has worked somewhat but it is too small and we cannot fully assemble the airplane in it.  It is also a shared workspace and that presents problems as tools and parts get misplace frequently.  We need our own adequate space where we can organize, train and secure our very own home! The Mission of Aviators By Design (ABD) is to reach and recruit our youth and non-pilot public with a fired up passionate introduction and entry into the world of aviation; as well as, promote and teach STEM education and safety in aviation.  Our goal is to teach the physics of flight through the STEM tool Fly-To-Learn which utilizes X-Plane Flight Simulator for practical application of principles. The ideals of Aviators By Design center on exposing students to the field of aviation.  Students participating in ABD have been able to participate in field trips to the EAA museum and attend AirVenture at the EAA grounds.  ABD participants have the opportunity to explore flight using X-plane computer simulation software; as well as, enter a virtual flight competition sponsored by GAMA.  We are hoping to recruit pre-high school age students with a new RC plane flight program to get them hooked at an early age.  Then there is the crown jewel of the ABD program:  The physical construction, and eventual flight, of a Zenith STOL CH 750 airplane.  We are slated to have our Zenith 750 completely finished prior to the start of next summers AirVenture program in Oshkosh, but we need your financial assistance to make it happen.  These experiences are absolutely vital for us to help students identify interests in the field of aviation. Aviators By Design has worked hard to raise public interest and exposure to all things aviation.  We have recruited a Physics teacher and a Technology Education teacher from a local school to help reach out and raise awareness with regard to aviation in the student community.  We have sponsored meals at a local airport to bring families in to check out planes up close and have an opportunity to talk with the pilots.  We hold regular meetings and work sessions every other Tuesday that are regularly attended by high school students, teaching staff, parents, and aviation enthusiasts from the community. ABD was founded in 2010 by Jerry Graf who has worked tirelessly to promote aviation throughout communities in central Wisconsin.  He has arranged for temporary hanger space over the last four years for our current plane project, the Zenith 750, until we are able to build our very own hangar hopefully in the spring of 2016.  ABDs vision is not a one and done mentality.  Mr. Graf has already procured two additional plane kit donations for our students to assemble once we complete the Zenith 750.  With our own hangar, and two more planes to build, we have plenty of room to grow the program!  ABD hits virtually every facet of STEM education.  The X-plane Flight Simulator and the Fly-to-Learn curriculum cover a great deal of the Physics and Math behind flight; as well as, giving students the opportunity to engage in the engineering process by manipulating a virtual planes structure in a digital environment that provides feedbacks for further problem solving and design changes.  Keep in mind that is the experience our students get just from working with our computer simulator; not to mention, the technical experience they get building the actual plane.  One of our former student participants is now in his second year of training at Fox Valley Technical College in the Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics program, another is attending Purdue University in Aeronautical Engineering and another is attending the Air Force Academy so we know our program is working. The participants are students from as many as 8 rural area high schools brought together in an after school program that involves building an airplane and teaching them S.T.E.M. skills about flight and its potential.  The current program is open to both girls and boys from ages 14 to 21.  We have had 5 girls participate and we welcome more.  Students come from the following towns; New London, Symco, Weyauwega, Waupaca, Iola, Clintonville, Mosinee and Amherst. Our program usually has anywhere from 16 to 20 signed up and we have usually 4 to 10 students show up for meetings depending on other school activities. With the graduation of several of our members, we have found new students who have heard about our program and are eager to enter the program.  We encourage new students especially girls to join and replace those who have graduated. Please help with your generous donation that supports our unique program for these kids!

Great Wisconsin Headwaters Trail System Foundation	255762		/users/profile/219796	Historyworker	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	Great Headwaters Trails helps communities build bike/pedestrian trails, but that is just a simple job description.  In northern Wisconsin, where tourism is king and the economy is less than robust, these trails are an economic asset as well as a lifestyle and health amenity.  By bringing additional visitors to these small communities every business in them benefits.  Those economic benefits then create more as the income spreads through the community.  Currently a trail is being constructed between two small, economically distressed towns.  The trail is unique physically, passing near the headwaters of the Wisconsin River and through some pristine woodlands.  When complete it will provide four season  access  to beautiful scenery and lure visitors to peaceful small towns.  When the full planned system is complete it will link Vilas County, WI from east to west by bicycle, providing a safe and beautiful way to enjoy the beautiful northwoods.
Education Matters Inc	273107	1	/users/profile/362296	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/30/2015	This small but mighty organization transforms kids' lives!  Currently focused on students in Kenosha, WI, the program provides tutoring to disadvantaged young people, with outstanding results--improvement in reading and math, improved grades, and one student who graduated from high school, defying her principal's declaration that she would not!Leadership training is an important component of the organization's work--students work on projects of their choosing that make a difference in their community.  These have included a run to increase awareness about bullying and a fair to raise funds for a local hospitalized child.  This organization is a good steward of donated funds.  It runs on a very lean budget, and a lot of heart.  Evey dollar makes a difference to a young person and the community!
Rape Crisis Center, Inc.	161881	1	/users/profile/214717	NBMadison	Volunteer	5	07/01/2013	There are so many things to like about the Rape Crisis Center of Dane County.  The organization is professional, extremely well run and values its volunteers.  All volunteers go through 20 hours of training and observe two actual RCC crisis line shifts before they can become volunteers.  I have been volunteering on the crisis line for just over a year and I have found the work to be very rewarding.  The crisis line operates 24/7, and provides short-term support and resource referrals to women and men who have been hurt by sexual violence.  Sometimes I may handle a call from someone who was recently assaulted, while the next call that comes in may be from someone whose assault happened years ago.  The Volunteer Coordinator on staff at RCC is always available to provide ongoing support to volunteers as we cover our shifts.  I also volunteer at RCC to provide a presence at community events, and I've even marched in a parade with RCC staff and volunteers!  How fun is that!  The staff at RCC are truly inspiring.  They are dedicated, hard working women who put in very long hours.  I plan on volunteering at RCC for years to come.

All of them give this organization great reviews. Talking to people who were the boys and girls this org. serves has convinced me that this is an organization that deserves my support and the support of my community. They credit the organization with helping them through difficult times, and inspiring them to strive for more than they thought they could achieve. (I hear really good things from volunteers, too, but it's the clients I think matter most.)

Food Pantry Of Waukesha County Inc	86727	4	/users/profile/97185	Volunteer in WI	Volunteer	5	04/21/2011	I have volunteered at the Food Pantry of Waukesha County for the last six months. The Food Pantry of Waukesha County has a well-earned reputation of being a highly ethical and effective organization, one that helps people through challenging times.  Executive Director Karen Tredwell is a respected leader in Southeast Wisconsin, who consistently and thoughtfully steers the organization. Clients are treated with respect. Volunteers time is well used and their work is appreciated. Qualified clients may choose food once every two weeks. The Pantry offers multiple programs for people with specific food-related health conditions. While serving clients, we hear of people financially devastated by medical conditions, jobs lost and other situations. We witness young people managing three-generation families on the most meager incomes. Over 40% of clients are children. Many others are seniors. The Pantry is their safety net. Many clients come less often than they are allowed, telling us to save the food for those who may be in greater need than theirs. Some volunteers are past clients, people who are grateful the Pantry was available when they struggled to feed their families. Now they are giving back. Once a week I have the honor of working with 20+ other volunteers for two hours as we serve 70-95 people in one of seven shifts a week. I am one of approximately 150 volunteers who collect food, sort it, shelf it and distribute it. Last year volunteers worked the equivalent of 14 full time employees. The Food Pantry of Waukesha County is one of the most efficient not-for-profit organizations I have seen. On a daily basis, it lives its mission.
Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council Inc	193864		/users/profile/253257	DorothyKD	Volunteer	5	02/06/2014	The Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council has a 35 year history of fighting for fair housing in Wisconsin.  The MMFHC also works on fair lending issues (esp. predatory mortgages) and on mortgage rescue scams. My involvement with the MMFHC goes back 30 years when I was a tester.  A tester is a trained volunteer who tries to rent or buy housing.  One tester is white and one is black.  The results of their visits are compared and followed up.   I have been involved in several ways with the agency since then. I am impressed with the professionalism and comittment to the goals of the agency.  I am impressed with the depth of knowledge of the staff.  Anyone who calls the agency gets a quick, true answer to their issue.  If it needs follow-up, that person gets the follow-up help.   I have a tremendous respect for the professional, thorough, accurate way business is conducted.  This is so important if you are really going to be effective in your mission. The MMFHC works well with other agencies in the state and has formed partnerships to do their joint work more effectively.  This has benefited everyone in the state. The MMFHC has been a partner in several significant lawsuits against large lenders like Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America for their poor practices in lending (among other things).  Another lawsuit, partnering with housing agencies in other states, has to do with the way lenders maintain(or don't) the properties they own that are vacant and for sale in different neighborhoods.   Agency staff documented that housing in different neighborhoods was maintained differently.  In poor neighborhoods grass was allowed to grow long, snow was not shoveled, broken windows not boarded up, etc.  In higher income neighborhoods the physical treatment of housing for sale is dramatically different and the agency is able to prove it. The MMFHC is helping people with disabilities who are discriminated against in housing.  This includes people with mental illness.   As a volunteer for the past 3.5 years here, I work on mortgage rescue scams.  I get full support for what I am doing from the agency.     When I retired I could have volunteered anywhere (I was the Milwaukee County Treasurer).  I chose to volunteer at the MMFHC because I have seen the good work that this agency has done in Milwaukee and in the entire state.  Even after all these years since the Fair Housing Act went into effect (federal level) there is still too much of a need for agencies like the MMFHC.   There is also shrinking funding from government sources for the work that the MMFHC does.

He had to spend two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  I wanted to spend every possible minute with my newborn baby.  The Ronald McDonald House allowed me to do just that.  It is directly across the street from the hospital.  I was able to walk back and forth at any time of the day or night to see my baby.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff was very nice.  I appreciated the meals that were available at the house.  I could not afford to stay in a hotel for that much time.  I truly appreciate the help I was offered.  My baby just turned 5 years old this month.  I am still grateful and I have not forgotten my experience at the Ronald McDonald House.
We Are Hope Inc	286714		/users/profile/376784	Sandy_D	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give my time to We Are Hope Inc. our 'Be Smart About Education, ' initiative.  For more than 11 years, I worked for a college where we dispersed over $430,000 in scholarships. I left my college position because we started selling education rather than career guidance.  College debt is now negatively impacting our economy.  This program better prepares individuals & families of the economics of education & how to ensure individuals receive the knowledge to secure employment upon graduation.  Education is important but 67% of students change their major at least once during college which also drives up the cost. We can do so much better to help guide people in selecting the right education for them.
We The Children Fund Inc	190786		/users/profile/249061	WTCF1987	Board Member	5	12/15/2013	We The Children Fund, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1987 as a non-stock corporation.  It is affiliated with a mission center in India called ELYSIOM which works with children living in the slums, by providing health care, food and education.  It also teaches mothers skills they can use in earning money to help support their children instead of having to sell their bodies.  It is a Christian mission center in a Hindu country with devoted teachers.  We The Children Fund charity also works with children here in the states on a one-to-one basis when a need comes to their attention.  They do not have professional fund raisers and thus work with a very small budget derived from word of mouth solicitations by supporters.  The charity is a volunteer organization.   It has no paid personnel.  Within the last two years it has lost its two volunteer fund raisers.  One died and the other is in a nursing home with memory loss.  It was founded to help children who have fallen through the cracks because they are not being helped by any other organization.   The IRS wants a report of wages but there are no wages.

Alano Club Of Wausau Inc 711 Mc Clellan Street	289992		/users/profile/380261	Jeff122	Volunteer	1	05/15/2016	This non-profit was started by two members of AA in 1977 with $4 and a lot of faith in a Higher Power.  The purpose of the club was to provide a safe (dry) place for new AA members and those fresh out of treatment  to FELLOWSHIP.  Today it has been taken over by a small self-interest secular group who never/rarely even attend  AA meetings and could care less about those whom the club was meant to serve. The Alano Club Fellowship Hall is rarely used and  those new to sobriety who would like to use it for fellowship are quickly booted out. It's a shame because Wausau has a tremendous need for someone willing to give more than lip service to those dying of alcohol/drug related diseases.  All I hear from members is,  "The Alano Club has NOTHING to do with AA"..  That means the Alano Club of Wausau now considers itself a private club, for insiders only, and its' 501c3 status should be revoked.

GREEN LAKE FESTIVAL OF MUSIC	29953	1	/users/profile/30944	andrew13	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	The Green Lake Festival of Music defines my summer, gives it immense cultural and social enrichment, and enlarges my appreciation for and understanding of chamber, choral, and piano performance. Over the past twenty-eight years, I have been privileged to serve on the Board on three different occasions, attended twenty choral concerts conducted by the internationally renowned Sir David Wilcox, heard numerous artists who have gone on to major professional careers, and bonded with members of both the Mirrecourt Trio and the magnificent Amelia Trio, currently with us every summer. Best of all is witnessing the growth and inspiration provided young people who attend the two-week Chamber Music Workshop every year. The final Chamber concert, in which the students perform on the last night of camp, is one of my favorites each year--awesome, breathtaking, and so promising for this nation's musical future. Stephen Alltop, the current choral conductor, is a genius in program planning and conducting, also a brilliant organist, harpsichordist, and pianist and utilizes all these talents during the four-day vocal workshop. On alternating years we hear the winners of the Hilton Head and Cleveland piano competitions, and this year were spellbound by a winner of the Van Cliburn competition. The atmosphere at concerts is always welcoming, beginning with delightful pre-concert interviews with the artists and a post-concert reception where one can meet and greet the evening's artists. Taking friends to concerts is a very special pleasure for me, especially since the quality of performance is so first-rate. Overall, my life is infinitely richer because of my immersion in all this astonishing Festival has to offer.

Chain Skimmers Water Ski Team Inc	58816		/users/profile/62931	Nadine	Donor	5	12/15/2010	This group of kids literally run a non-profit business with support from their parents and donations from the public for the shows they put on.  It's really impressive that they have been able to sustain the organization for 40 years, teaching youngsters to ski and cultivating team values in their ranks.  Everytime I've attended a show, it's clear that they put a lot of work into developing young skiers, conducting fund-raising events, maintaining equipment and supporting one another.  If we had more organizations like this one, a lot of kids would find focus and purpose much earlier in life.  Congratulations to the ongoing efforts and struggle to raise funds to sustain this non-profit.

Satellite Child Care, Inc.	208772	1	/users/profile/271519	Concerned_WI_Parent	Client Served	1	08/05/2014	This is not an independent charitable organization.  It is a putrid component of the Dane County Parent Council.  Its employees and one of its board members have violated my family's privacy, and that of other children.   Before donating to this organization really question what they are about.  They are an organization that defrays the cost of professional development training for its for-profit members.  This organization doesn't provide quality child care, or even guarantee it, they just siphon severely needed money for child care from various governments.  This money could be better spent on low income child care access or for respite care for disable children's parent.  But instead it funds lazy, ineffective, uncaring bureaucracy.
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship-USA	201792	2	/users/profile/121460	NCGrandma	Client Served	5	06/03/2014	One of the most formative organizations during my youth and college years, InterVarsity has provided local and national resources for growth in Christian faith and understanding across all denominations and university settings for many decades. For me personally, Nurses Christian Fellowship  was extremely helpful to me as a nursing student, graduate nurse, and throughout 40 plus years of nursing practice. The Journal of Christian Nursing provides excellent advice and help to nurses in all nursing fields, from practice to education and research. Through NCF and IVCF, I learned key skills in how to read and understand Scripture, develop as a leader in my profession, and integrate my faith with my professional work and identity throughout my nursing career. InterVarsity works with and supports the local churches near college campuses, and connects students nationally and internationally. As an alumna, I just recently signed up with InterVarsity Press for discounts on books and bought several to share with family and friends who have questions about their own faith.  InterVarsity is the go-to organization for students and faculty who integrate personal faith and disciplines in academia. I love it!

Green Acres Boxer Rescue Of Wisconsin Inc	97424	1	/users/profile/114341	Kate0484	Client Served	5	09/13/2011	We have adopted two boxers from Green Acres Boxer Rescue of Wisconsin. They have a dedicated number of volunteers who run a very responsible and professional rescue. Their services range from adoption,  surrender, education, and on and on.  Green Acres Boxer Rescue has a thorough application process to ensure dogs go to a good "forever" home and that the adopter finds a dog that will be a good fit for him/her/the family.   The rescue consists of a number of foster homes across the state of Wisconsin.  So, no matter where you are in the state you are they should have someone not too far from you.  The other benefit of the dogs being in foster care are that the dogs get to live with a family while they wait for a home.  Not only is that good for the dogs, but the people adopting as well. The dogs tend to be better behaved and you really know what they will be like in a home setting. To wrap it up I have been very pleased with the three times we worked with them to find a dog (two times we adopted boxers, and the other time we wound up adopting a pit bull. At the time there were no boxers in the rescue that fit what our family needed. They were responsible enough to be honest and tell us that versus encouraging us to adopt a dog t hat wouldn't be a good match...which is why we looked elsewhere and wound up with a pit bull). I fully anticipate to return to Green Acres Boxer Rescue in the future, have recommended them to several friends and family members, and will continue to do so!

Randlin Adult Family Care Homes Inc	34376	2	/users/profile/33341	randlinhomes	Client Served	5	04/01/2010	My name is Norbert Alan Francis Rausch and Im a Vietnam veteran who through the years has lost my way. I did not plan for my present circumstances to evolve as they did. I am now a chronic alcoholic, unemployed and homeless. At one time I was an experienced journeyman machinist of 16 years. Then one morning my past caught up with my present. I literally lived on the streets for close to 4 years, eating my meals out of trash dumpsters, living under bridges, watching other homeless people being mistreated by those who felt nothing for their fellow human beings.I moved from place to place to elude the authorities. My day consisted of finding food, shelter and occasionally tobacco, including alcohol, to numb my overwhelming feelings of despair, loneliness and absolute worthlessness as an individual. This continued for quite some time until one day I overdosed on alcohol and was literally pronounced dead. Yes the good Lord was watching over me. As He has done throughout my life and allowed me to once again breathe. It was then that I thanked God; the people who I thought I had lost through the years, for their support and vowed to never let my actions interfere with the smiles on the faces of my loved ones!!!Enter Randlin Homes and the organizations founders Ralph Schlitz and Linda Larson Schlitz. Both are the guardians of Gods people. These 2 people have more compassion and hope for individuals as myself than anyone Ive come across in my life. The Randlin Homes organization is committed to helping those in need of shelter, food, clothing, leadership, direction and an overall feeling of self-worth. In this organization there is now one whos better than the next. We feel the need to once again be needed as individuals. We once again hear the simple words of thank you for a job well done. Theres the feeling of togetherness, working to achieve a hopeless situation into a positive result.  The feeling of overall self-worth is something that has eluded many of us for years. At Randlin Homes that has become one of the most important aspects of the starting over process. Ralph and Linda are our best teachers. I cannot stress enough what Randlin Homes has done for me and others like me. Im once again proud of myself and what Im achieving along the way. Theres so much to be said about a simple smile where once there was only a found!! This organization has put life back into people just as God put life back into his Son. For all that Randlin Homes has done for this community, that is to lessen the homeless numbers on the street, show compassion for those in need and feed the hungry. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts we still always run short on mans almighty dollar. Weve had brat sales, thrift store sales, clothing sales, mowed lawns and shoveled walks but it costs a lot to help others in need.  Randlin Homes is the only organization I know of that doesnt turn its back on anyone-regardless. It is for this reason that I, and the many other residents who reside here  nominated Ralph and Linda for the 2010 Red Cross Community Real Heroes award. Perhaps with this acknowledgement will come more community awareness that there are many fallen soldiers like myself that need help and that before Randlin Homes there was none here in our community.  Not only will we and the many others who come after thank you but so will the Lord   Ralph and Linda have done what God asked of them and would be a great example for others to follow as they have been to us. We hope that Randlin Homes will be acknowledged as the outstanding organization for veterans that it is.

I advise donors and other stakeholders to beware of this organization. There is reason to believe that this non-profit has been involved with misappropriation of funds. Upper management is not concern with helping empowering their clients, they are instead worried about lining their families pockets up with the funds that the organization receive.  The Human Development Center is only concerned about employing their family and friends and paying them extraordinarily high salaries. I hope for  the sake of the their innocent clients that Human Development Center books get opened and audited by the government.

Wisconsin Womens Network Inc	40483	6	/users/profile/41399	shauna3	Former staff	5	05/25/2010	As the front-line person for WWBIC in Madison, I dealt with dreamers everyday: people who wanted to own their own business. Some were experienced and wanted to expand. Some worked from home and wanted to take it to the next level. Some just had that dream and wanted us to help them realize it. WWBIC answered the call for all and I was proud to be a part of it. From classes helping novices understand the facets of running a business to giving established owners that extra edge through software training or public relations. Past clients were always eager to be speakers during class to tell their stories of success. WWBIC even offers loans to help starters get funding to open the doors to their future.It was a great experience to work there and see lives changed from good to great every day. The offices in Milwaukee and Kenosha offered similar success stories at our monthly meetings. Please endorse the Wisconsin Women's Business Initiative Corporation for their efforts to give women financial independence.

This chamber of Commerce went from being rightfully classified up until 2008 as a 501 c(6) and since then created a new Chamber of Commerce "foundation"  and filed for a 501 c(3) and are filing all chamber of commerce income, expenses, etc under this foundation. This is against IRS code (law) and is not right for every other Chamber of commerce in the area and comparable status (Rockford, Janesville) which are both c (6) organizations and rightfully so according to law.

Fine Arts Foundation of the Westby Area	319777		/users/profile/411617	mjcharles	Board Member	5	12/04/2016	I joined the board of the Fine Arts Foundation of the Westby Area (FAFWA) in December of 2015.  Our goal for many years has been to raise funds to build a Community Performing Arts Center (CPAC)for the Westby Area. At the beginning of the year 2016 we approached the school board with our vision and goal.  The Westby School Board challenged our group to raise at least $750,000 before they would consider placing the rest of the funds needed to a referendum vote.  Projected cost for the building at the time were estimated to be $3,000,000.  FAFWA raised $800,000 in less then a years time and the school board agreed to place a referendum on the April 2016 ballot.  We worked very hard at not only raising the funds needed but also on educating the public on the need and benefits for the Community Performing Arts Center.  The referendum was successful and we are in the process of finalizing the building plans now.  The estimated start of construction will be spring of 2017 with completion sometime in the fall of 2017.  We are still in the process of raising funds to put towards the costs of the center and we are also raising funds to put towards an endowment fund that will help sustain and care for the facility in the future.  Our goal is to bring in entertainment and the arts to help build revenue for the center.  I am very proud of all the hard work the Fine Arts Foundation of the Westby Area has done and will continue to do for years to come.

This is the only group of it's kind in our area for kids and their families who are experiencing hearing loss. On a personal note, we have found the music programming at Hand-N-Hand to be the most effective of all her therapies. We have seen such progress in her but unfortunately it is not a therapy insurance covers. Hand-N-Hand is our only resource for this valuable therapy.  This organization is the most well run small non-profit I have ever been in contact with.

Professional Learning Institute Staff Cooperative	99523		/users/profile/119900	tanyaarentsen	Board Member	5	10/20/2011	My experience with this organization is that they are passionate about getting every single student involved in their own personal learning and having that learning impact the community.  I have seen this organization rise to the challenge businesses put forth about the graduates in this community not being prepared for what comes next in life by scheduling career explorations, using teaching styles that require the students to manage their time, find valid research, and give presentations.  They are a small organization and had their tax-exempt status revoked not because they didn't file, but because they filed late.  As they are still in the process of getting reinstated, tax-deductible donations can still be made through the school.  This organization is comprised of the most dedicated, hard-working people I have ever met and anyone who supports them can know that their support is being used to help the students in Milwaukee!

It provides young girls with tools to make healthy and smart decisions for themselves.  It also provides a safe, encouraging and fun environment where every girl can be herself.  I wish I had a program like GOTR when I was growing up, but the next best thing is being involved as a coach!  I have coached for GOTR Dane County for seven seasons and it has been life-changing for me and for many of the girls I work with.  GOTR Dane County works hard to ensure its programs are top notch and to reach every girl that wants to participate.  I am proud to volunteer with this wonderful organization.

This nonprofit appears wonderful in photos, but firsthand experience demonstrates its fraudulent and highly unethical practice of "rescuing" and shortly thereafter....SLAUGHTERING horses and other large animals.  After 10 years of living in my backyard and barn, Rio, a sweet and cherished equine friend was adopted by Susan Slater and her animal "rescue" owing to the fact that his owner was becoming old and feeble.  This was in the Spring.  Rumors from friends who visited, warned of neglect and another home was found by someone who really wanted Rio.  Did Susan Slater allow the adoption?  No.  Did she return our calls?  No.  After many lies and hedging, she SOLD Rio (along with MANY other horses) for SLAUGHTER last fall.   Blessings to all those dear animals who were cruelly betrayed after promise of rescue and sanctuary.  They died a most brutal and terrifying death because of choices made by Susan Slater, even when other options existed.  The ends do NOT justify the means.

Isaiah 61 Ministries	286935		/users/profile/377007	April_O	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Helping the homeless in Harrisburg. For the last 8 years my family has dedicate countless hours ministering to those in our county that are less fortunate than we are. We believe that all people are loved by God and that we as Christians are called to love those who often are forgotten and overlooked. Those we serve have become friends and family to us. Isaiah 61 Ministries (isaiah61min.org) was born out of our love for serving others and a much bigger a plan that God had laid before us. Being able to help others with food, hygiene products, blankets, tents, clothing, and other basic needs has been something that has opened our families eyes to how blessed we truly are and just how often we take our blessings for granted. The most amazing thing happens when you go out with the intention to serve others...the one doing the serving often is blessed by those they serve. I have learned much from those we serve and have grown to love more deeply through my experiences serving.

The problem is that the dogs arent trained at all. They arent house broken, dont have any basic obedience skills and in some cases have attacked and bitten the very children they are supposed to be helping. I am one of the parents that fell victim to Vickis elaborate scam. I know that I will never get my money back or be able to provide my son with the dog he needed and wanted so badly, so I will settle with spreading the word to ensure this doesnt continue to happen to other vulnerable families. I live in St. Paul, MN and I was fortunate enough to have my story picked up by the local CBS affiliate, WCCO. Liz Collin did a wonderful job putting the story together and I hope to have it seen by as many people as possible. Especially the people in the autism community who I know are searching for help for their children. Please share this link with your network so we can stop Compassionate Paws from deceiving others.http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/11/04/for-10k-families-feel-cheated-by-trained-service-dogs/

Wisconsin Puppy Mill Project	160983	4	/users/profile/213419	MMFBH	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/19/2013	I'm concerned that when Eileen Ribbens was first arrested this past Spring, she claimed she paid for the illegal drugs (which she admitted she had purchased) using Puppy Mill Project money. By the time she appeared at her hearing in June, the story had changed and she claimed that, instead, she had used her OWN money to buy these drugs. But this got me to worrying about how all the monies that have been donated to this organization HAVE been spent over the years. (I know for a fact that at least one small rescue received a donation from the Puppy Mill Fund (through Eileen) and--even though it is a reputable rescue--the money didn't go to help a puppy mill dog OR to educate the public.) Then, when I looked up this organization's last 990 report, it looked to me that a LOT of money had been spent as "donations", and I'm wondering what the purpose of all these donations was. Who received all this money? Were these "donations" to support Eileen's pet projects and special interests/friends? I sure hope not, since spending Puppy Mill Project monies on non-related endeavors would certainly undermine donors' confidence. Perhaps an IRS investigation is in order....

Dane County Friends Of Ferals	154636		/users/profile/205483	nu1986	Donor	5	04/13/2013	Friends of Ferals does an incredible job saving lives and promoting the health of cats, both tame and feral.  They practice Trap-Neuter-Release, allowing feral cats to live but not reproduce, finding many of them outdoor homes with families in rural areas.  They also do a great job of finding homes for tame cats in our community,  and provide spaying and neutering for many hundreds of cats every year.   We have chosen to support DCFOF because they do so much good work in such a professional manner even though they have limited paid staff.   They have a big group of dedicated volunteers and a strong board.  They've had a national grant for several years to work with the county Humane Society to achieve a no-kill status for healthy cats, and they have just celebrated the one year mark of having EVERY healthy cat homed in our county.  NO healthy cats, feral or tame, had to be euthanized in Dane Co. since April 2012.  This is a huge achievement.  Now that the national grant is ending, they need the community to step up and support them so we can maintain this amazing success into the future.

Dan Kapanke admitted to unintentionally violating state ethics codes by paying off personal debt with money from a charity funded through organizations that employ lobbyists.The Republican lawmaker said Wednesday the payment to the city of La Crosse for new lighting at the Loggers baseball park was inappropriate.Kapanke is challenging U.S Rep. Ron Kind for the 3rd District Congressional seat. He and his wife, Ruth Kapanke, own the La Crosse Loggers, a summer collegiate baseball team that plays at La Crosses Copeland Park.The Democratic Party of Wisconsin  filed a complaint Wednesday with the Government Accountability Board alleging Kapanke effectively funneled lobbyist dollars through La Crosse Loggers Foundation Inc. for personal gain.Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate characterized it as a money laundering scheme that gives the foundation the appearance of being a slush fund to benefit Dan Kapanke.In the wake of Kapankes admission, Tate called for Kapanke to resign his state Senate seat and suspend his Congressional campaign. Kapanke has represented Wisconsins 32nd Senate district since 2005.How many times is Dan Kapanke going to continue to claim innocent mistakes when he gets in trouble for unethical behavior, Tate said. This aw-shucks routine just doesnt play anymore.In 2009 Kapanke admitted his office mishandled an open records request filed by the Democratic Party and voluntarily paid the partys legal fees and a $100 statutory fine.The foundation was set up in March 2006 to make charitable donations with money contributed by organizations directly tied to lobbyists.  In 2007 the Ethics Board, now the Government Accountability Board, threw out a complaint by the Democratic Party that Kapanke was collecting income  through that charity.But Internal Revenue Service records show in June 2009 the foundation paid a $16,930 installment due on a $225,000 loan from the city of La Crosse to the Kapankes for improved lighting at Copeland Park.Kapanke said the charity then believed it complied with IRS allowances for donations made for the erection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments or works. Any improvements made to the baseball park belong to the city of La Crosse.If we wanted to hide something we certainly wouldnt hide it on IRS forms, Kapanke said Wednesday. He announced also hed transferred the nearly $17,000 back to the foundation from La Crosse Loggers Inc.AGovernment Accountability Board  spokesman said it had received the complaint but couldnt comment further. Copies also were forwarded to the La Crosse County district attorney, the IRS and the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.La Crosse County District Attorney Tim Gruenke said the Government Accountability Board  would take the lead on any investigation.A phone call placed to the Kind campaign Wednesday evening was not immediately returned.

There are a lot of skills that are needed to take care and ride a horse.   This charity was based on these ideas.  Emotionally and physically injured people get so much confidence in handling horses, especially the terrific ones they have (mostly rescues).  It does change their outlook on life and gives them confidence and self-esteem, all too much lacking in this world.   It situated among the tall pines of the former glacial Lake Wisconsin.

I am assisting a widowed mother of 3 children get herself out of debt.  Your ambulance company came to her home in 2010 to assist with her husband, who was pronounced dead at 34 years old.  He left her with 2 children under 4 and a bill from you for $803.00.  She was unable to pay that bill so you sent her to a collection agency, which is now taking it from her bank account.  You should be ashamed of yourselves; you clearly could have written off her debt rather than selling it to collectors.  She has struggled for the last 5 years to get back to where she was before her husband suddenly died.  While I recognize that your services are always needed in tragic circumstances, I believe you could find a more community minded way to help people in extreme circumstances.  I don't consider your behavior in the status of "quality nonprofit".

Their alleged "reports" generated for the public are not scientific reports nor does any of their alleged data come with any legitimate sources.  Their sources are generic and can NOT be confirmed as they do not list specific sources.  For instance, their source will be "Personnel" with no title nor name of that person in the personnel.  Their Charts and Tables do NOT list any source from which they are generated and come with NO reliable information that the reader could use to substantiate their data.  In other words, they just throw numbers together and make false claims about those numbers.

The new Director, Steve Kinkade, is doing a masterful job, along with his United Way co-workers of creating one, new, strong United Way out of two United Ways that previously covered the whole of Rock County, Wisconsin and a bit of northern Illinois.  The merger has gone even better than most would have imagined and the review process reveals that UWBR has come a long way toward removing any "competitive" elements that might have cropped up due to differences in the two largest cities involved--Janesville and Beloit.  Dealing with the review committee proved to us at the Voluntary Action Center that we are making significant strides in partnership--northern Rock and southern Rock, for profits and not for profits, businesses and agencies.  It makes the Blackhawk Region a great place to live, work, play, advocate, give, and volunteer.
Pathways Church Inc	158263	19	/users/profile/209968	conradclayson	Donor	1	05/19/2013	This so called "church" hired as its leader a man (Brad Liebe) who was fired from his former job as senior pastor of First Assembly of God in Fort Myers, Fl after an outside consultant group proved that he embezzled several hundreds of thousands of dollars. They stated that they could prove he stole even more (they estimated about $700,000) if they were given more records, time, and money. As well as the proven embezzlement there were rumors of affairs. As a result he was fired and his Assembly of God credentials were revoked. This is when Pathways stepped in and hired Brad. Now, they have fired him for proven affairs and are refusing to open their books to the congregation to show that he did not continue his embezzling behavior as well. I would think twice before supporting this "nonprofit" organization.

What I saw the first day were a group of women with many health issues, who seemed disconnected.  What I saw the last day of retreat was a group of empowered women with renewed spirits.  A wonderful transformation had taken place for these ladies.  They were given the room and atmosphere to talk with other survivors.  A chance to know that what they were feeling wasn't crazy that other survivors were going through the same thoughts and issues.  They discussed what had worked for them and together they figured out alternative solutions to what ever affected them.  They had time to walk with nature, seek solitude if they wanted it or to share with others.  They ate healthy meals, did activities at their own speed and choice.  They had FINALLY took time out from their busy lives to focus ONLY on them.  if you are a breast cancer survivor (no matter what stage of your journey that you are in) you have to attend a retreat to understand the transformation that takes place!
Wisconsin Demolay Foundation	115050		/users/profile/156747	ncstorrs	Client Served	5	06/13/2012	My sons have been involved with DeMolay in West Bend, WI as members (from ages 12 to 21) of this organization.  When young men are given the chance to make a difference, and offered positive reinforcement for "doing good things" it DOES matter to them.  Their advisors always respected them, encouraged them, and helped them to do more as leaders of the group. As a capstone to their involvement (after learning leadership, speaking and organizational skills as participants) each boy earned scholarships for college.  The scholarships are generous, and the experience that they gained from being involved with DeMolay has helped them to become more responsible, professional, effective adults.  I would encourage parents to have their sons look at the DeMolay program - in Wisconsin or any community across the country.

Wildlife in Need Center	239132	3	/users/profile/324762	Kim_Banach	Board Member	5	03/11/2015	I have the pleasure of serving on WINC's BOD and have been a volunteer for 5 years and have delivered injured wildlife for treatment. Every day I am truly amazed at the work the Animal Care Staff and volunteers perform. The joys of watching an injured or sick animal improve and move to a larger enclosure, enabling the bird to  spread its  wings or swim makes us all smile.  Imagine witnessing a rehabilitated Bald Eagle, with a wingspan wider than the height of our Animal Care Manger, being released and soaring away brought tears to all our eyes.  Our Education Department throughout the year connects with over 25,000 people of all ages, by educating how to help and protect our wildlife. One of our long term board members said, "The animals need us." We have been Connecting People and Wildlife through Rehabilitation and Education since 1994, and treated over 45,000 animals. We admit all species except skunks ( due to DNR regulations).  WINC is open 365 days a year operating completely through fundraising efforts. If you want to volunteer, donate, or come across Wildlife that needs help- call WINC, check out our new website and Facebook site. We are here to help and educate! Yes I am passionate, but so are all wildlife rehabilitators!
United Way Of Dane County Inc	93811		/users/profile/108169	Dan Rashke	Board Member	5	07/13/2011	I have been involved with United Way of Dane County (UWDC) as a donor, volunteer and community leader.  I like UWDC because I have an opportunity to do more than just write a check for a good cause.  UWDC is focused on bringing people together to engage on important issues affecting the health and well-being of our community  we can all roll up our sleeves and get involved.  United Way of Dane County does an excellent job of getting people involved.  United Way is also focused beyond raising money in the community  there is a desire to leverage the dollars raised in the annual campaign to meet the needs of the community and change the human condition.
East Troy Area Historical Society Inc	193557		/users/profile/252815	Emily79	Board Member	5	01/31/2014	I think that the members of the East Troy Area Historical Society are a dedicated group of individuals, all with their own interests and knowledge base.  The service they do for the community is outstanding.  Twice a week they maintain a top notch historical center with exhibits, children's activities, a theater, regular speakers and special events.  This is a small group of volunteers in a small town who are working with dedication and integrity of a big city museum with professional curators!  I think that everyone would enjoy coming to see what the ETAHS holds for them, the records and oral histories held by this group are fascinating and astoundingly rich.
The Womens Center Inc	173304	1	/users/profile/229395	Christine90	Client Served	5	10/04/2013	I first heard about the Waukesha Women's Center when it was in the planning stages, because one of its founders, Bonnie Martin, was a good friend of mine.  Bonnie was a social worker and saw a great need for the Center in Waukesha County. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever need the services of the Waukesha Women's Center.  But, after a series of business losses combined with the devastating economic depression I found myself suffering from depression and disturbing memories of childhood abuse. Several times during my adult life I had struggled with depression, but no therapist had ever found the root causes of the depression.  Remembering long buried events is like peeling an onion, and it took a long time to uncover memories of abuse I suffered from infancy through childhood.  My therapist at the Waukesha Women's Center helped me understand what happened to me, and how I was able to bury those memories as a good way of coping.   She helped me more than any other therapist; over 25 years I saw 3 therapists.  They taught me coping skills to deal with depression, but really didn't find the cause of my angst. I liked the way the Women's Center is set up so that it is a safe place to visit, and my problems are treated with confidentiality and respect.  When my therapist left, the transition to a new therapist was handled easily.  I enjoyed attending some of the group events, and appreciated learning techniques of art therapy. The Center makes a big difference in the lives of the women affected by abuse, and I am very grateful to my old friend Bonnie for its creation and to my new friends at the Women's Center for improving the quality of my life by helping me come to terms with what happened to me as a child.

Nami Waukesha Inc	232745		/users/profile/296333	carlajayfried	Client Served	5	11/03/2014	I have had experience with this agency as a client and a volunteer.  As a person who had a family member with Mental Illness, I took their "Family to Family" class at no charge.  It truly helped me understand what my family member with the illness was going through.  I learned so much from the class that I volunteered to instruct a Family to Family class.  They also helped in many other ways as well, they help those suffering with mental illness find affordable housing, they try to help  Veteran's suffering with Post Traumatic Stress, train Peer Specialist to help in the process of recovery and offer training to the Police & Sheriff personnel on dealing with person's with mental illness.  This Waukesha Nami  organization is top rate from my experience and sincerely try's to spend most dollars collected for helping Families, those  Individuals who suffer with  mental illness and for Community Service. 
ANGELS WISH INC	61179		/users/profile/66759	KittyLady	Volunteer	5	01/26/2011	Angel's Wish is somewhat unique in the animal sheltering business in that the cats and kittens helped by AW spend 90% of their week in a home surrounded by kids, dogs, other cats, noise, and all the other things that an animal will encounter in any forever home.  On the weekend they are brought to the shelter for people to meet them 1:1 and (with luck) go home.  AW is an all volunteer organization with no paid staff existing entirely on donations it receives from its supporters and local businesses.  People often find us on Petfinder.com and come in to see certain pets based on looks and wind up going home with that pet or another one (or two!) entirely based on their interactions.  It's a very special place.
Service League Of Green Bay Inc	320981		/users/profile/414086	Ashley196	Board Member	5	01/09/2017	I love being a member of the Service League of Green Bay. This women-volunteer ran organization has many different initiatives, and approximately 30 members. Our biggest project is the Back to School Store which provides a new outfit, shoes, socks, underwear and school supplies to 1,500 elementary aged, under-privileged students in Green Bay, and 1,500 backpacks filled with school supplies to Middle School students in need. Among the Back to School Store, we have Basics for Babies, Teens for Independent Living, Basic Necessities, and take part in Giving Tree each Christmas. We provide money to Encompass Childcare for their weekend food program and only have one main fundraiser each year to support these projects. 
Stout University Foundation Inc	142694	1	/users/profile/178088	droeges	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2012	I used to work for this organization.  Every cent is given to students in need of financial aid to attend the University.  As a result of this assistance, I've seen many success stories of grateful students who wouldn't have made it without this assistance.  Working there was always a pleasure because we were always working towards the day when we could award the scholarships.  Donors and students finally met each other and came together for a scholarship ceremony.  It was a time for gathering and celebrating.  
The Animal Lobby Inc	56229		/users/profile/58596	wspca	Volunteer	5	11/01/2010	This is a great organization.  This is the organization that pressured authorities to sentence Barry Herbeck, an animal abuser who obtained dogs and cats by answering "free to good home" ads.   He tortured and killed the dogs and cats.  The District Attorney went to court asking that Herbeck get a fine and be released on probation.  The Animal Lobby, Inc. established a web-site devoted to Herbeck's case, took out full page newspaper ads with the photos of the dead animals and generated thousands of letters to the judge.  Herbeck was sentenced to 13 years in prison.  This is a good group.

Milwaukee Ballet Company Inc	131942		/users/profile/177544	Peter18	General Member of the Public	1	10/31/2012	As much as ballet groups run on contributions from people like the Einhorns, I find their political activities  reprehensible and consequently will participate in the upcoming embargo on donations and ticket sales that your relationship (and other charities) with them has put into motion. Good luck.

American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry Charitable Foundation, Inc.	97535	4	/users/profile/115016	Amiloc	Client Served	1	09/16/2011	Did you know that the program "Give Back a Smile," run by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, regularly collects huge sums of money for the program - although none of the money goes toward the treatment of domestic violence victims or to the dentists who volunteer to treat them? And while they used to refer women with traumatic injuries, they now only accept women whose teeth can be fixed by veneers "in the smile zone only". So, those of you women out there who sustained serious tooth or jaw injuries via violence and abuse? You're out of luck, according to the AACD. I guess you only get your smile back if it's a cheap case! Of course, they still use their previous traumatic injury cases to market the program and solicit donations and to mislead contributors. They haven't come out publicly to admit what they tell tens of women daily, I'm sure, that being "you don't qualify for our program." And this, after charging domestic survivors $20 just to have their application reviewed!
Wisconsin History Foundation Inc	262853		/users/profile/351550	Jack5051	Donor	1	10/10/2015	I started to ask questions when I realized I was talking to a robot!   When you ask a tough question, either the robot talks over you, or it says "I will refer you to my supervisor."  At the end, the robot said, "God bless you!"  I've never been blessed by a robot!  I felt really taken advantage of!  Live and learn.  Next time, the answer's NO.

I was impresssed by the quality of the program and the sensible and even-handed approach to learning about and reporting on complex environmental issues. Since then, Ive partcipated in part or all of several other expeditions and always found them impressive. I'm a founding board member, having served now for 15 years and suffer through the ever-present fund-raising struggle and only wish I culd be more effective at fund-raising so that more journalists could share the IJNR experience.

Gilbert Brown Foundation	253398	1	/users/profile/341583	flowerchild0013	Volunteer	5	08/19/2015	Gilbert Brown is a truly awesome man!  The Gilbert Brown Foundation is a wonderful cause.  No child should have to deal with Cancer, but unfortunately life isn't always fair.  Help the Gilbert Brown Foundation fight childhood cancer.  There are so many ways to help this cause and have fun doing it.  My husband and I are continuously doing different things that we know go to help this foundation.  We do things ranging from golf outtings, and dart tournaments, to simple things such as proceeds from meat raffles, and giving in honor of a recent passing of a loved one instead of flowers.  You can find locations where Gilbert Brown and other Green Bay Packer members are doing various things to include auctioning off signed items, photo / meet and greet sessions where you can spend your money to purchase things as little as pictures taken with them, all the way up to signed footballs and photos and such.  All the proceeds again go to this wonderful cause.   This man and his organization has become very near and dear to my heart, and though I hope I never have to know a child who battles cancer, but it is comforting to know there are people out there fighting for them such as Gilbert Brown and his whole crew!    Give it some thought when choosing where to contribute!    Thanks    Tina
Good Neighbor Clinic Of Sauk Prairie	77161		/users/profile/84281	njnagler	Volunteer	5	02/26/2011	Nobody in this great country should be denied affordable health care.In 1999, Dr. Haakon Carlson began to set up a free clinic for uninsured people.  It started as once a week, with two doctors.  They finally went to twice a week.  Then they were able to add a dentist, and this past year they have four regular doctors, a physicians assistant and a nurse practitioner as well as a diabetic educator, though the dentist had to retire.  In the 11+ years, we have had over 3,000 patients and over 15,000 patient visits.  There are several volunteers that have been there since the beginning.

The WWGP leadership and staff demonstrate an uncommon level of commitment and passion for service. During the time I spent in residence with them, I observed how young people and adults alike embraced their committed service and the positive impacts yielded as a result. Any funders looking for a high-impact, community-strengthening organization to support should give as much as possible to WWGP. They are worth every dollar.

I told him I had checked with my Accountant and he had said that is not true. The gentleman then told me "Some of the most illiterate people I know are Tax Accountants"  My wife is an Accountant and the guy who does my tax accounting is a good friend. I will throw everything in the garbage rather than give anything to this organization. Wise Resources INC. will get nothing from me.

Had problems with a past president who resigned and did not turn over records and archives and took money from the firm. People handling the money have very little knowledge about tax law and non-profit law and have lead it in a bad direction. While the goals of the organization are good, it has stumbled badly since the untimely death of the founder and initial president.

I was then invited to a fund raiser for the foundation, and found that the people behind it, the history, and the concept were all very appealing...A company that makes a product, is nonprofit, and revives a historical site. The Potosi product is an excellent product, and it is only a matter of time before they can contribute back to the community as a nonprofit does.  Not only is the product excellent, the Potosi Brewery and National Brewery Museum which is at the Potosi Brewery are two can't miss opportunities for the beer or history aficionado.

Icringe to think of what might have happened to him. I believe that through safe place for newborns his biological mother learned of the law. That is why after we adopted him we started to spread the word that he was a safe haven baby. First in the newspaper. After that it exploded to TV and radio. We felt it was our duty as the happiest parents in the world to spread the word. We pray that babies were saved by us telling people about the Safe Haven law and also Safe place for newborns. We must never stop trying . Thank you Janet & Mark Kirsling

This foundation is run strictly by volunteers, and all donations go directly to research and education.
Badger Childhood Cancer Network, Inc.	152058		/users/profile/203126	alyssan	Client Served	5	04/04/2013	Badger Childhood Cancer Network has been a massive help to us during the last 2 years as my 5 yr old son has been undergoing extensive, time-consuming, and pricey chemotherapy treatments for Leukemia.  They have helped us emotionally with support groups, and finacially with helping us pay part of our mortgage so we didn't have to default on our loan.  It is not easy caring for a child with cancer but BCCN does their part to help us cope more fully.  I honestly don't know that we could have made it this far without their assitance.  My kids look forward to their free, fun parties and the parties gives the adults a chance to talk openly about our situations, and take our children to a place where bald is beautiful, and they understand the constant hand washing and sanitizing :)  I also feel that the people behind BCCN are approcable and very understanding to our situations because they themselves have been through the journey of childhood cancer.   They are #1 in my book!

If that animal or bird is then taken to Fellow Mortals, their luck has taken a very positive turn!  At Fellow Mortals they will feel safe, will get the best medical care possible, and will be loved while they're there!  Fellow Mortals is now the only charity that my husband and I support  and when I explain this to other charities wanting a contribution, they seem to think that our choice is acceptable and move on to someone else

Dane County Parent Council Inc	208770	1	/users/profile/271519	Concerned_WI_Parent	Client Served	1	08/05/2014	This organization primarily receives money from federal, state, county and local government agencies.  Its disorganized structure and lack of accountability to real people, being only accountable to government bureaucrats, gives it a significant degree of ineffectiveness.  For an organization such as this it pays its employees way too much, a shocking amount of their grant money goes to salaries.     Furthermore, as a parent that used one of their services I was blindsided to discover that its employees had violated my family's privacy, as governed by its own privacy regulations.  They had denied this multiple times before government bureaucrats provided written documentation of these violations.  I was further saddened to discover that their employees routinely violated the medical privacy rights of children by providing their personal information to others without explicit permission.
REVIVAL FIRES EVANGELISTIC ASSO CORP FOOD BANK	48240	2	/users/profile/49215	teardrops	General Member of the Public	5	07/15/2010	From the first time ever hearing of this organization, I found a family of 9 members, running a highly efficient food bank.  But as I walked through their small warehouse, I was amazed to find not only food, but also clothing, furniture and couceling being administered by the organization's own CEO and local non-denominational pastor.  I would quickly learn that this has been a man on a mission since the 1970's, working first, from his own home and using what small amount of money out of his own pocket-he gave "in the name of the Lord" to ANYONE and EVERYONE asking for help.  In some cases, he simply went to neighborhoods known to be living below the level of poverty and one home at a time, in the cover of darkness during the most fridgid weather (at times well below zero)he and his sons would simply leave 2-3 boxes of food during holidays.  Additionally, included in the boxes were x-mas gifts and turkey w/all the fixings.  During the years of 1998 into 2000, he had rented a small building, filled it with toys to be sold as gifts for x-mas.  However,Revival Fires CEO actually GAVE ALL OF IT AWAY to every unsuspecting customer who had thought they were buying the toys-I witnessed as each customer shopped until they reached the register. Then, the items were rung-up in the cash register, totalled then bagged-up. Then each were told quietly that "there is no charge today" giving all the credit to God.  I watched tears of joy, and of sorrow in knowing that "someone cared about (them) and knew they were nearly broke" It still brings a tear to my eyes to think of this act of pure kindness that has gone without notice all these years. This organization has quietly remained "under the radar" by choice because "the mission is one of mercy"-not one looking for a pat on the back, a cameo on camera for credit, or a story in a newspaper or even a simple thanks from the recipients."  Revival Fires has always been and will always be from, and about help through God's blessings."  Well I can only say may God Bless Revival Fires Food Bank as much as they have blessed so many in need of their charity.

They work together along side the Liberian people and with the Liberian government to help better the lives of special needs and orphaned children in Liberia.

Volunteer Intertribal Medicine Inc	237660	2	/users/profile/322469	aeangove	Volunteer	5	02/05/2015	9 Arthur E. Angove, D.O., General Surgeon and his wife Carmen, returned from a medical mission to Bolivia, S.A., and read an article in the Milwaukee Journal about the poverty and scant medical care available to the native Indian communities of Wisconsin's eleven tribes and bands.  After meeting with the Great Lakes Intertribal Council in Rice Lake, WI, Arvina Thayer was assigned to work with the founder and president of the soon to become organization of Volunteer Intertribal Medicine, or VIM as the tribal community workers called it.  Dr. Angove called Earl Thayer,(not related to Arvina) the Executive Director of the  Wisconsin State Medical Society, later changed to Wisconsin Medical Society and the chairpersons of all eleven tribes and bands, and the presidents of all the healthcare organizations of Wisconsin to meet at the Medical Society building in Madison.  When Dr. Angove asked: "Where and what is the greatest medical needs"?, a Winnebago man answered, "Many people have come to do research about that, and there must be a mountain of paperwork somewhere, but nobody has returned to tell us the results".  Dr. Angove responded by asking, "Where do you as a group feel where the greatest need might be"?  After some discussion it was determined that the Stockbridge-Munseeand the Bad River communities were in the greatest need of help.  At that meeting a group of medical and osteopathic doctors, chiropractor, lab techs, nurses, and dentists decided to first work with the S-M people and arranged to  use a newly constructed Potshcheenunc  ) warehouse in Wittenberg.  We strung wires across the rafters and hung blankets to make exam rooms, and used saw horses and plywood for exam tables;  our restroom was out back behind the trees, and water was brought in buckets.  Lunch was provided by the people, fried bread and trout.  Once we were treated with bear meat.  Really, lunch tasted delicious.   A young Mohican boy, Dave Besaw drove around to tell those who needed to see the doctor that if they didn't go to the clinic he'd tell  the Sheriff, so they came!  One woman told me she needed glasses, so after checking her blood sugar level which was over 900 mg/ml, I sent her to  the doctor in Shawano for treatment of her diabetes mellitus.  While getting ready to do a Pap smear, the lady scooted down and the plywood tipped over, sliding the embarrassed woman to the floor.  We learned a lot from our first day.  Dave organized a pony raffle and with the profit bought a mobile home which we used until the Community Center was built which looked like way too much room, but eventually had to use the mobile home alongside the Com. Cntr.   Vounteers came from Minnesota and Iowa to help, and we eventually were able to provide care to all the tribes and bands of Wisconsin, and some in the Cass Lake area of upper Minnesota.  Dr. Angove delegated the leadership to Arvina and Dave, who became head of the Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C., and returned to starting clinics in Yucatan, MX, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti.  Jan Martin, Sec./Treas. of VIM has retired from working at the S-M Community Health Center in 2014.
Girl Scouts Of Birch Trails Council Wi Inc	193592		/users/profile/252853	CharityMom08	Volunteer	1	01/31/2014	This organization hasn't been called 'Birch Trails' in a few years.   Now they're 'Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes' -- with a much larger territory, a new CEO, and several people promoted into management positions who shouldn't be, while many fantastic employees were forced out under dubious circumstances.    They are no longer concerned with what is best for GIRLS -- it's all about numbers (both in membership and, especially, MONEY).    While I still believe in the mission of Girl Scouts, I won't allow my child to be a member of this organization anymore (she was told if she didn't sell at least 250 boxes of cookies, she would be kicked out of her troop -- and the "council" backed her leader up!)    Our area lost our wonderful membership manager when she was fired, and the new one brought in (who only works part-time) is so bullied by her "supervisor" that she is afraid to do anything without permission.    This used to be a wonderful organization.   It's really sad.
People Care Inc	204295		/users/profile/266311	Holly44	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	People Care Inc. is the board of directors which governs the non-profit child care center Children's Day Center and Preschool, located at 525 Madison Ave, Baraboo, WI.  Prior to moving to Baraboo in 2010, my husband and I toured the area day cares. We fell in love with CDC, from its sunny exterior to its large playgrounds, its location in a neighborhood next to a park and its quality, caring teachers.  We were struck by just how dedicated and committed to the children the teachers at CDC are. Studies show that a childs most formative years occur from birth to 5 years old  the ages of children attending CDC. During these years, children begin to learn how to interact in social settings; they develop an understanding of spoken language and body language; they experience new emotions and learn acceptable ways to express those emotions; they learn enhanced logical reasoning skills; the seeds of learning are planted. CDCs teachers facilitate this learning by encouraging children to learn through play. With their guidance, the children navigate through social situations and problem solving. The children develop a natural curiosity and are encouraged to explore in a safe setting. The children are exposed to their potential. The years our children spend at CDC set the foundation for their academic future, and it is the teachers who take their hands to lead them down a path of lifelong learning.  My husband and I began attending Board of Director meetings because we wanted to take an active role in our childrens early education. We didnt realize when we first began attending meetings what a truly rewarding experience it would be to join the board.  Being new to the area, we didnt know anyone. We met all of our friends through CDCs board of directors. We met like-minded parents who also took an active interest in their children's education. We met the parents of our childrens friends. We learned more about the community we lived in.  Non-profit organizations cannot exist without the help of volunteers. To find out how to volunteer or to get involved with events and fundraisers, or to find out about tuition, please call the center at 608-356-4116 or email the board of directors at CDCParentBoard@gmail.com.  Take an active role in your childs early education, too :)
Living Hope International Inc	50284	1	/users/profile/50854	grandmacandy	Volunteer	5	08/12/2010	I have been leading groups of men, women and teens down to Living Hope International since 2000.  I am currently planning on my 14th trip with a team for Sept. and so looking forward to it.  The experiences a person encounters from visiting the children at the youth home are amazing.  I first started when my youngest daughter was a jr. in high school and I wanted her to experience life beyond her comfortable surroundings. My older daughter wanted to come also so we packed up and headed down for the experience of our lives. It was such a transforming experience for us that we needed to share it with others and started taking teams down to volunteer at the youth home there.  As a result my youngest daughter is now teaching in Thailand and helping at an orphanage there and my oldest is in the Philippines working with children and adults there.Every trip I've taken to LHI has been a different experience as I have been challenged by the children and staff at the home.  You are made to realize how important each person is in life including yourself as you are stretched by giving of yourself and going beyond what you think you are capable of doing.  LHI helps one remember that life is not just about me but about how I can make a difference in someone elses life and help that person grow up to be a contributing member to society.  LHI takes the children that no one else wanted-street children, gives them food, clothing, education and family love. They train them to be confident, loving, caring young men and women.  They build up the confidence they need so they in turn can contribute to make this world a better place.As I have been able to enjoy the amazing adventures on my trips to LHI I have personaly become a better person, a more complete person.  By being able to work and play with the children and staff at the home I have learned and grown so much more than I have been able to give.  After about my 4th trip down a child asked me "why do you keep coming back?"  I responded "because I love you and want to spend time with you"  then I got all these hugs from these darling street children that no one else wanted.  Needless to say the tears flowed.  Most of the original children that I first learned to love have since grown and moved on and it is so good to hear from them and see what fine young men and women they have become. Knowing that the money I contribute to LHI goes directly to the needs of the child I sponsor and will not be used for other areas makes me want to contribute to all the areas of LHI.  I know that the money I contirbute will go where I designate the money to go.  They welcome visitors to come and visit the youth home and to share their lives with the children.  LHI is a place where love and truth and peace abound.  Thank you Living Hope International for being there and for being who you are.Candy McGraw

It is run by a small group of highly dedicated, knowledgeable, thoughtful people.  I think only one person gets paid (the part-time education coordinator who is or recently was a grad student at the local university.)  The group has done a beautiful job transforming what was essentially unused and unusable farm land into an incredible nature preserve filled with birds, bugs, fish, animals, native prairie flowers, and oak trees.  They work with the high school ecology club, scouting groups, and other volunteers to continually improve the space.  It is a stunning, huge area with lots of visitors daily.  Middleton is really lucky to have such amazing people helping to beautify the city and improve the quality of life for residents.  Love this group.  :)  *Full disclosure: my mom used to volunteer with them.
WISCONSIN BADGER CAMP INC	153714		/users/profile/204528	Mickeyboy	Client Served	5	04/09/2013	Our son has autism.  Last summer he spent his first time away from his parents in his 13  years.  We had never visited Badger but heard from many people in the field as well as others about Wisconsin Badger Camp and decided to try it for him.  From our first contact with Badger personnel we were impressed and confident that he would be happy there.  As we often repeat, Wisconsin Badger Camp sounded too good to be true  yet it is all true.  The pre-camp instructions and forms covered everything from issues to diet to medications and then some.  The staffing of the camp and the one on one offered was well beyond most places for special needs kids.  When he was dropped off we felt confident that he would be safe and enjoy himself.  He certainly did and he accomplished more than we could have hoped for.  The follow-up was superb and gave us a day by day journal as well as ideas to build on for him.  We also got a daily phone call just to let us know how he was doing.  For those in need, there is no charge which is wonderful.  We will be back this  year and hopefully for many more  years.

We left after the first scene of "A Bad Year for Tomatoes" after multiple jokes about bestiality, incest, pornography, and more.   Thanks GBCT--just what grown adults like to get dressed up for and devote a night of listening to.  The theater refused to issue a refund of $42 after only seeing the first scene.

That means that no matter what its income, it budgets and gives 20% of that income to charity every year (10% directly to those in need and 10% via the archdiocese.)  St. Nicholas has grown to become a full-fledged church, part of the Self-Ruled Antiochian Orthodox Church of North America, under the leader of Metropolitan Philip. The church--both St. Nicholas locally and the archdiocese as a whole in North America--keeps its books open. Our little parish which as of 2013 numbers somewhere around 125 families, has given over $100K to charity over the years.  Please visit our semi-annual bake sales at the Cedarburg Strawberry Festival and Cedarburg Wine & Harvest Festival, every year in June and September.

Highland Community School Inc	176820		/users/profile/162141	GoodFoodForAll	Client Served	5	10/11/2013	Highland Community School is truly an exceptional school.  Almost 100% of the parent body is active in supporting the school, in fact, 100% of the Board of Directors are parents themselves.  Highland's effective model is developing individuals who are prepared to become agents for positive change in our society.  Although the school realizes the significance of performing well on standardized tests, the approach to education is developing the child as a whole: academically, socially, and emotionally.  Highland is a true Montessori environment where children and their families are on a journey of education and learning together.  My three children have attended since 2008 and I am grateful for finding such a supportive community of parents and staff committed to my children's and my family's development and success.

My Home, Your Home Inc.	41235	9	/users/profile/42097	eileenbeard1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/27/2010	Mr. and Mrs. Walker, (the founders) being foster parents themselves, were the example of blending and creating a loving and caring home and work enviroment. They raised their children to care about the needs of children, who were homeless.  Their example reflects in their daughter, Connie, who also adopted a child and understands the struggles our Treatment Foster Parents deal with each day. When Mrs. Walker passed, Connie became the CEO. Her mother mentored her to be a strong woman and to lead the organization to the next level. After 2-3,years of hard work, we are accredidated. Our standards and expectations are raised to provide the best services to our clients. When I came to MHYH there was just Lissy's, TFC and Wraparound.  We have expanded to include ATR, AMAD's, Nurturing and Mentor Programs.  We have had our growth and set backs, like any organization.We have been concerned about marketing ourselves in the community. We are getting better at that. People are recognizing our name and our strong work ethics.We still lack a fund development plan to raise money, but we are not afraid to try something new.  Our luncheon this year was a step in a new direction and reaching out to new people in the community. We have to keep exploring and trying new things to keep our name out there and building relationships.Our Board has come a ways but has a long way to go in helping us reach our potential. They are getting more involved, which inspires staff committment to the agency. Board members were more committed to the luncheon and are not afraid to give a helping hand like our phon-athons, giving up 1-2 evenings to call supporters.Trainings have expanded in the agency for staff and parents. Mandatory trainings are listed and given to parents and staff at the begining of the new year.  Managers, Leads and staff are offered opportunities for trainings, and conferences to encourage professional growth.Treatment Foster Parents are provided with more quality trainings and opportunities to develop a better understanding and skills to meet the needs of the children we serve.I take great pride that I work for MHYH. I am proud to work with a staff that is dedicated to our families. Our families and children are struggling but they always seem to see a light at the end of the tunnel, that things will get better in time. They have amazing strength.We are not perfect, but we are working towards a better and stronger organization.A great day is when someone you have worked with gives you a hug and you see the scars from the cigarette burns are disappearing and they can talk to you about their day, when once they did not speak.

Door County Humane Society Inc	319175		/users/profile/410513	ducksoup5	Client Served	5	11/18/2016	The staff and volunteers at Door County Humane Society are devoted to the care and well-being of every lost or stray pet lucky enough to find temporary housing there.  Cats and dogs are nursed back to health, given all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, and most importantly, given love, companionship and a chance to learn to trust again.  The community supports the efforts of the shelter by volunteering to greet visitors, answer phones, donate food, litter and other goods, make monetary donations, walk dogs and socialize cats.  Although the adoption rate is high, this fine organization will house a four-legged resident for as long as it takes, no time limit!  We have adopted five cats and one dog from DCHS and all are much loved members of our family.  You will be impressed with the facility, the staff and the happy pets awaiting you!  It's a great place and an asset to its community.

National Pku Alliance Inc	286628		/users/profile/376698	Arthur_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A Child Really Does Change EverythingTwo years ago my daughter was born and that's when everything changed. What was supposed to be a typical, uneventful birth turned into a fury of heart stopping moments that led me to truly appreciate those who serve others.It started with 36 hours of labor followed by an emergency C-section, at which point they discovered that the umbilical cord had been wrapped twice around my daughter's neck, causing her to lose oxygen to her brain. Within hours of her birth, she started having seizure after seizure. She was transported to one of the best NICUs in the world as the hospital we were in wasn't equipped to deal with this situation. Over the next 24 hours she had over 100 seizures until finally doctors were able to control her with a combination of two powerful anti-seizure medications. MRI scans showed brain damage to both sides of the brain, caused by lack of oxygen. Her prognosis was unknown. Doctors said it could range from her being completely fine to severe disability to a 50% chance of her not making it past her first birthday. We were shocked to our core.The next day, doctors called us in for more news. She had been diagnosed with an incredibly rare genetic disorder, Phenylketonuria or PKU, where a person's body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine and must be on a strict low-protein diet for life.  With an occurrence rate of less than one in 15,000 births in the US, we had little information to go on. We felt completely alone, scared, and hopeless. Luckily we discovered there was a non-profit organization that helps families like ours, The National PKU Alliance (http://www.npkua.org/). All my life I had heard about charities helping people, but now, for the first time, I was on the receiving end. I realized just how incredible it is that there are people out there dedicating the only life they have to helping others. That's when I decided that everything I do from that point on should have a focus of helping others.  Donating to The National PKU Alliance was a start, but I needed to do more. Because our daughter would have to be on a strict diet that also excludes all animal meat, my wife and I decided this was the perfect time to go vegan and do our part to support animals. I also started a company, CharityPush, that partners with non-profit organizations and helps them raise money just by having people download completely free mobile apps. It doesn't cost the users or the organization a penny and it helps raise awareness for causes that people might not know about. I hope to help hundreds of charities and touch millions of lives, but if I end up only helping one person, that's still worth everything. I hope my daughter will grow up with the power of giving instilled into her core and help make this world a better place.

Despite their stated mission they do little other than lobby the state legislature for legislation that increases their members profits. Over the past few years they have been very successful in influencing legislation that makes it more difficult and expensive for financially strapped schools, libraries, local units of government and charitable nonprofit organizations to get the broadband they need. For example, they successfully lobbied for legislation that prevents the University of Wisconsin from providing these institutions with Internet services and even prevented the University from belonging to another not-for-profit entity in the state that is doing great good - WiscNet.

I am proud to be affiliated with this organization, which has support from numerous local churches of all denominations, and which is the only agency getting an increase in support for 2013 from the local United Fund campaign.
Rotary International	306519		/users/profile/397777	CorruptionKiller	General Member of the Public	1	09/25/2016	Masonic charities are thw 2010 FBI's largest underage child sex slavery network using over 192 lodges and shrines for underage sex expressly for high level master masons. Convicted of the Mann Act in 2010 over 18,000 highest level master masons countrywide were identified as felony child predator violators by name and sexual preference. These children, orphans were supplied by Shriners Hospitals and state Child Services agencies nationwide run by masonic attorneys, typically prosecutors.Previous to these discoveries 22 masonic childrens hospitals networks including childrens miracle network were caught keeping 95% of all donations for illegal, private use. Freemasonry and masonic charities are north, south americas largest child slavery network as well as in the United Kingdom where masonic philantrophy was found not to be non profit but freemasons main source of income. They are scotland yards largest crime organization. Estimated over 100, 000 rapes of children by the 18,000 known masonic child rapists. This is over a short period of time, this is part of masonic ritual and could be tens if not a hundred times higher. All these children end up dead, unable to communicate or killed for masonic research as discovered in Oaxaca Mexico where Indiana residents were caught involved in over 3000 deaths in 2007 in stem cell harvesting and research which is the precursor of the research of organ regeneration at cellular level that will in a few months allow the first legal full head transplant. Ties back to Zapata Corporation for running the mass death research center also led to the largest meth lab facility in the same compound tied back to indiana brotherhood (freemasons) and George Bush Sr.

Encompass said they had openings so I scheduled an appt. for the following Monday.  When I went in for the tour I was informed at this time they no longer had openings.  I never recieved a phone call to cancel the tour.I feel encompass is very unprofessional and unorganized.  I am extremely grateful that my daughter will not be attending encompass.

Dads Of Wisconsin Inc	149128		/users/profile/198685	JimInWI	Donor	2	02/08/2013	I was a contributor to Dads of Wisconsin back in 2010, but ended my support in early 2011 after a first-time poster to the organization's Yahoo group, a father facing custody issues, was attacked by a frequent poster (who wasn't even a WI resident) because he had had children by more than one woman.  The fact that such behavior in the forum was condoned by the organization's leadership ended my belief in their credibility as a supporter of men's or children's interests.  (They also tended to spam my Facebook account with lots of repetitive messages -- or maybe that was SAVEServices.)
Adams County Humane Society Inc	103508		/users/profile/138289	Lorelei S.	General Member of the Public	1	01/16/2012	I looked over the income and expenditures filed with the IRS.  I don't see how such a small, backwoods shelter can spend so much.  When I looked over the board of directors they have listed, I know for a fact that one of the members resigned, and another passed away over 3 years ago.  If they can not keep up to date with little items such as these, how can they take care of animals properly?  It seems as though they already have enough to work with, any non-profit organization with over $200,000.00 in the bank is doing just fine.
Myteam Triumph	286655		/users/profile/376725	Diane_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Redefining Achieve.www.myteamtriumph-wi.orgIn November 2013 I had the privilege of bringing joy, accomplishment, and achievement to Captain Nathan (person with disability) with myTEAM TRIUMPH.  Captain Nathan may have a disability that prevents him from running a race on his own, but this does not limit him.  My support was two-fold.  I donated money and then gave of my time and physical ability by helping push on a team for 14 miles. We were called Angels (able-bodied athletes). The smiles, warmth, and sense of accomplishment we brought to Nathan was far reaching and one that will always have a place on and in my heart. His parents were full of tears and joy when we crossed the finish line.  When we live to serve others, when we put a sense of purpose to our action, when give of our time, THIS is when we truly begin to live and redefine what achievement means in our community and lives.  This is my why.  This is my purpose.  Change with purpose.
Hartford Wrestling Club Inc	189781		/users/profile/247748	johndoe983221	General Member of the Public	1	12/03/2013	In my experience with this club they are not really concerned with the well being of your child.  They are more concerned with weeding out the weak and getting themselves a superior wrestling team for the future.  I would not recommend the club to beginners,  if you are a serious (insider) wrestling parent then you may enjoy the club but if you are looking for your child to have fun then look elsewhere.  My son was part of the club for over four years and the coaches didn't even know his name.  Just like every sport there are many politics involved.  It's an insiders club, and if your on the outside you will stay there.   I do not recommend this club to anyone looking for a new sport for their children.   I do believe in the sport nut not in this particular program especially for a beginner wrestler.

Lancer Youth Wrestling Club	275366		/users/profile/364970	Writer	Volunteer	1	01/01/2016	December 5, 2015Madison.comMr. Schultz and Mr. Treleven,After reading the most recent news of a 20 year old boy groping a 14 year old girl at La Follette High School here in Madison I felt it was time to tell another story.  A story which includes the cover up of a person's legal history and injustice towards a great coach and the kids he fought for.  It was November 2012 when I met coach Ron who was a volunteer coach for the MSCR youth wrestling program and for the Lancer youth wrestling club.  I could not believe the energy and passion he brought into practice with his wrestlers.  If his wrestlers did not know at the beginning of the season they knew well into the first couple months of practice they could be great not only at wrestling but at life.  I remember seeing coach Ron that first year at every practice, every dual meet and every tournament.  His dedication and energy electrified his kids turning a insecure child into an inspired "firecracker" on the mat.  Win or lose he praised their courage and looked for ways to help them improve on the mat by adjusting as best he could for each kid.  He always talked to parents involved in the wrestling program about becoming a community.  From the first day of practice to the final day of the last 3 seasons he helped our kids to become a team and got us cheering wrestlers other than our own.  It was no surprise that he was nominated for teacher of the month in January of 2015 with channel 3 news.  However it was a surprise when I was told that he would no longer be there coaching my kids that same January.In December, coach Ron had decided to resign from the LYWC due to a conflict between some board members and himself.  He was then removed as the head volunteer coach for MSCR wrestling due to the conflict by the board members.  Initially we (parents) were told by the high school head wrestling coach Skiles and school board member Michael Flores that coach Ron had resigned.  However coach Ron did not resign from MSCR stating he would continue to coach for MSCR in his resignation email to LYWC. When I called MSCR to ask why he was no longer coaching I was informed he resigned.  I told them he did not resign and that many parents were concerned that he would not be there to coach.  I offered to forward the email he sent out to LYWC but MSCR refused to acknowledge it.  After the parents realized he wasn't coming back we got together to negotiate the return of coach Ron with the LYWC board members.  The board members agreed to meet with him in order to rectify the conflict but the board members delayed their mediation with coach Ron.  We found out later that the board members were stalling so a background check could clear for a Dante Schiro.  When his background check came through they refused to meet with coach Ron and named Dante as the head coach.  At the beginning of the season there was 40 to 50 wrestlers in the wrestling room for each practice but when coach Ron left we barely had 12 to 16.  On the first day of practice back after break we were called by Mr. Flores and coach Skiles to a parent meeting.  Mr. Flores and coach Skiles informed us that coach Ron resigned from MSCR which confused many of us since we received the resignation email for LYWC.  We asked coach Skiles and Mr. Flores why he resigned which they replied "you'll have to ask him."  They never told us what the conflict was about.  During the meeting former coach Jason Decorah walked in.  He had left the club two years earlier when his son started high school or so I was told.  After a couple of minutes he was escorted out by coach Skiles.  Later I was told by a father he came back to coach.  Some parents in the meeting were disturbed by his presence.  Later I found out why.  Mr. Decorah has a felony conviction for sexual assault in addition to multiple DWIs and disorderly conduct convictions.  He had been observed by parents striking his son at tournaments and in his own way bragging about it.  One father described his oldest son's first couple weeks of practice with Mr. Decorah encouraging a more accomplished wrestler to essentially beat up on his son during practice.  Hearing this several of the parents acting through a mediating parent contacted coach Ron to ask him to mediate with Mr. Flores and other board members.  He agreed but as I stated above the mediation process was a hoax created by Mr. Flores as a distraction to find another coach.  As the weeks passed I found out Mr. Decorah coached at both the youth and high school level prior to coach Ron's arrival and that coach Ron was the reason why he eventually left.  We discovered coach Skiles had concealed Mr. Decorah's history and involvement by never having him fill out a background check with the school district.  Coach Skiles helped conceal Mr. Decorah's past with USA Wrestling by giving the club charter to Mr. Decorah's wife Jasmine so he would not have to fill out their background check either.  It was also reported that coach Ron had been pressured by the LYWC board members including coach Skiles to let Mr. Decorah coach without having to fill out an MSCR background check.  Coach Ron refused most likely because he knew of Mr. Decorah's behaviors and legal issues.  To make matters worse his past was also covered up by another family in the club.  Frank (former volunteer coach) and Sarah Schiro (former board member) who knew of Mr. Decorah's past from seasons preceding my kids participation in wrestling.  They are the parents of Dante Schiro the head volunteer coach who replaced coach Ron.Coach Ron was questioned by several of the parents as to the conflict between the board members and himself as well as Mr. Decorah's participation in the club and the high school.  Some of the parents addressed coach Skiles with coach Ron's answers which he (coach Skiles) denied any of Mr. Decorah's involvement with the high school or club.  With some investigation we were able to locate pictures online of Mr. Decorah at La Follette on the wrestling mat coaching with the high school and LYWC during season practices and at youth tournaments.  We also contacted USA wrestling and found that Mrs. Decorah did have the LYWC charter in her name for 5 years.  After realizing that coach Skiles was being dishonest about Mr. Decorah's involvement and the circumstances why coach Ron was no longer coaching for both LYWC and MSCR we decided to contact administration at La Follette.  The vice principal that we talked to spoke with coach Skiles and refused to pay any attention to the evidence essentially calling coach Ron a liar.  A couple of parents contacted the school district with them (MMSD) eventually stating that Mr. Decorah had no involvement in high school wrestling at La Follette and refused to comment any further on the parent's concerns or evidence.My kids eventually decided that they did not want to go to practice anymore with coach Ron no longer there.  Normally I would encourage them to finish what they started but with their friends and practice partners gone I didn't see the point.  Our last practice yielded 10 kids with coach Dante who only showed to one tournament for LYWC and every other practice for MSCR.  Coach Ron was not just a great coach but a good man.  It was noted by many parents that coach Ron used to buy shoes for kids in the MSCR program as well as sending them to camps during the summer.  When a child needed a singlet he would buy them one when all the other LYWC singlets were in use.  He was stubborn when it came to the needs of his wrestlers.  He always proclaimed "anything less than the best is not good enough when it comes to kids."   If you decide not to investigate this injustice then at least acknowledge that he was a great coach and that many of the parents and wrestlers who were in LYWC and MSCR wrestling will remember him that way.

But that doesn't mean she's  not still doing important  work.   Because Tilly lived,  pit bull dogs in Sheboygan  County are getting spayed and neutered for  free.   Because Tilly lived, pit bull dogs are getting free training  and able to stay in their homes.  Because Tilly lived,  people in our community are getting education about the importance of spaying and neutering.   Folks are becoming less afraid of these amazing dogs, and more accepting of them.   Every dog deserves a chance, and Tilly's it Crew is making sure that  happens.  It takes an army, and ours is strong!  We love our supporters and volunteers we can't do it without them !!!
