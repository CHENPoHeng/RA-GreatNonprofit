Elim Pacific Ministries	287723		/users/profile/377858	EthanT	Volunteer	5	04/30/2016	I probably would not be alive today without the prayers of everyone connected with this ministry. Back in November I was run over by a truck....the dual tries rolled right me crushing my leg and pelvis. I was shattered and out of it for several weeks. Healing prayers though are changing everything. After months in the hospital and now in rehab, I am now learning to walk again! I am alive! I have a future! Thanks to everyone who has helped me, supported me, prayed and visited.  No matter what anyone says, I have  had a miracle! Even the doctors are amazed.  i am hoping that I can soon come back and help again with the Manha Project Summer Deaf Camp Program 
Elim Pacific Ministries	287722		/users/profile/377856	OneDayataTime	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2016	The Animu Project has been helping women and children get a new start. Lots of victims of domestic violence get really stuck and just stay the victim. The Animu Project has been able to help us get a new start in life, with a job, and help with housing too. I love what my life is becoming since I came to the Oasis Empowerment Center. They are willing to help and not just a little bit either...in big life-changing ways too...
Elim Pacific Ministries	287720		/users/profile/377854	LovingGUAM	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2016	I am so happy that the Oasis Empowerment Center is not just for women but is also helping men too. And on top of that, there are 3 different 12 step support groups available each week to be able to keep growing in my recovery.  I think everyone struggles to overcome in some area of our life...food, relationships, or even work. I know I need help to keep things in balance. Thanks for making this place a reality. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	287718		/users/profile/377852	RJ671	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2016	Where can you go to find the kind of help that can change your life? The folks here at the Dream Project are working to do just that. Some of the folks who have never had any kind of stable employment are given an opportunity to work. I love the hot dog cart and when its open we have seen tourists and military come down and eat lunch here. I have a health certificate now and can work in any restaurant around the island. This is really great. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	287717		/users/profile/377850	Soulutions	Client Served	5	04/29/2016	Sagan Mami is a place where even if you struggle with disabilities, you are welcome. I started coming to the Sagan Mami program as was very to happy to find out that they offer time to learn to do arts and crafts. Dolores has showed us how to make candles with sand as the mold. Now some of my stuff is for sale at their store! They are really helping us out
Elim Pacific Ministries	287715		/users/profile/377849	Tommy21	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2016	Hidden Treasures Thrift Store is not your average store by any means. Because the bus system is so bad on Guam, I needed to find an affordable car. Hidden Treasures was able to help me get a car and i am so happy. Its not like they have cars all the time but when they do, its just great. Thank God for their help because now I can get around!
Elim Pacific Ministries	287714		/users/profile/377848	SusieShelle	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2016	This ministry continues to reach people in such practical ways. Yesterday I happened to be there when there was a huge donation of fruits and veggies. People could pick up as much as they needed, all for free. Thank you for making a difference on Guam. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	236018	1	/users/profile/319738	oasisguam	Donor	5	12/29/2014	Every time I donate, I must say, lives are changed. There is nothing that compares with the joy in a mother's eyes being able to support her child in a home. These kind of investments that make a difference, and are the kind that are eternal, and not just about dollars and cents. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	170040	3	/users/profile/225330	Lucy Ann H.	Client Served	5	09/16/2013	I am writing as the first person to benefit from the residential treatment at the Oasis Empowerment Center. I had struggled with drug addiction for 18 years and even with multiple times in various recovery programs, staying sober was hard because of the lack of long-term help. Thanks to the services that this center provides I have had the time and support needed to learn how to live independently and have received relevant training for jobs.  In fact I am now employed by the Oasis Empowerment Center as staff and I am able to share my life experiences with women who have the same struggles as I have had. I look forward to helping more women on Guam overcome this ever increasing island problem.
Elim Pacific Ministries	170030	3	/users/profile/152622	Ruth B.	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	I am nearing the end of my third visit to the Oasis Empowerment Centre serving the ladies in recovery here.  For this trip, a three month one, I had to forfeit my job to enable me to be away for an extended length of time. That is a measure of how I rate the amazing work that is being achieved here. It really is invaluable service and I have seen lives changed as the ladies become free of the addictive mind changing habits that have had a grip on their lives for so very long. Not only does this establishment serve ladies in recovery but also ladies escaping violent relationships and victims of sex crimes offering a safe place to reside while they piece back together their lives and before moving on into other accommodation. They help their ladies go on to gain employment and suitable and appropriate housing for them and their dependants. Ongoing support is offered enabling and empowering them to be and to remain fully integrated back into their society safely. It is one of the few church organisations that I know of which fruitfully exists to serve their community.
Elim Pacific Ministries	112162		/users/profile/152622	Ruth B.	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	I have seen women have hope for their future restored to them through this amazing work and have tangible experience of the love of the living God in their lives. Its an amazing work being achieved here and its impacting many lives in an enormously powerful way.   The material used by this ministry is unashamedly Christian and is very powerful.  On my first visit to Guam I was witness to many receiving a believers baptism in the ocean, most of those being baptised were recovering addicts of some description.  As well as fighting their demons effectively and being equipped with the tools to continue to do that, these ladies often find the only living and active God in the process.  It is life changing.
Elim Pacific Ministries	170029	1	/users/profile/41796	worker1	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	I have had the blessing to be a part of this ministry for many years.  It has fulfilled the acute desire  and heart longing to see homeless, abused, addicted and disabled women and men find freedom, joy, and purpose in life.  Before Oasis there was nowhere for them to receive this kind of care.  It would break my heart every time I would encounter one of these ladies on the street and have no where to take them. Before the Oasis, a young girl coming out of the hospital to the street, asked me to take her home with me, but I was unable to do so, being homeless myself at the time, ( I have not been homeless since being involved with the Oasis over the last 10 years) this young girl was introduced to a bad crowd and was killed by a person in this group. Had there been an Oasis then, I believe this girl would be alive today. Over the years countless women, children and families have been given a new lease on life and saved from the horrors of a life on the streets.  I, being one of them. And for that I am truly grateful.
Elim Pacific Ministries	40908	1	/users/profile/41796	worker1	Former staff	5	05/27/2010	I worked for Elim pacific Ministries for about four years.  Before that I was a volunteer for about 3 years. It was the best 7 years of my life. There is nothing in life that beats being a part of something that is so life changing for a group of people who other wise would have no chance at a better life or any life at all.  I was a part of helping women who were coming out of prison or off the streets. Some from terrible abuse. And many other life Issue's. They are given a new chance at life in a beautiful home setting where their material and spiritual needs are met. They learn the tools they need to live a life of victory.  It is a long term program from anywhere of 6 months or longer. There is no place else here for these women to go. This is one of the most important nonprofits I support.
Elim Pacific Ministries	169992		/users/profile/225277	Silvio5	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	Elim Pacific Ministries is not like any other church outreach I have been involved with. Many churches just preach about getting saved so you can go to heaven. It seems that everything they are doing here is about releasing heaven on earth! I know Guam is a rather poor and remote island with a lot of people on welfare. But this ministry believes in changing the world. They have invested in the other Pacific Islands like Pohnpei and the Philippines and Tonga and Nauru. They have worked to transform situations by setting up a recovery center and a job training center too. The work with the disabled has helped many people move forward in life. Now the domestic violence transitional housing program is really changing lives too. This is what its all about!
Elim Pacific Ministries	169988		/users/profile/225272	Renee35	Volunteer	5	09/16/2013	I worked two summers at Zion Fellowship Church/Oasis Empowerment Center regarding Deaf initiatives on Guam. First summer, i worked as a volunteer and 2nd summer, I worked as an intern. Working with people at this place was a very great and rewarding experiences. They're very friendly and have a great, giving hearts. I would definitely come back and work with them again! :)
Elim Pacific Ministries	169981		/users/profile/225263	Rosie671	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/16/2013	Oasis Empowerment Center has radically changed my life. Throughout the years my journeys have taken me to Ethiopia, Australia, Philippines, and Mexico where I have worked to help Empower people and facilitate change. Oasis provides a safe place for women who are homeless and suffering from life controlling problems. Every time that i return to Guam and join alongside Oasis I know that I am sure to see lives set free, changed, and restored. I love getting to be apart of change and seeing restoration in a tangible way. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	169977	1	/users/profile/225258	KHM-Guam	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/16/2013	Reviewing the documentation for this organization has been quite an eye-opener. Other organizations do one or two specific things. But Oasis is helping people get connected to so many main-stream services, in addition to providing effective recovery counseling that changes lives. The ways they help the homeless get housing solutions, the unemployed get job training, the disabled get assistance, the needy get helped. Its quite impressive.
Elim Pacific Ministries	169923		/users/profile/225200	96921	Client Served	5	09/16/2013	I came to the Animu Project needing a way to start new life because I was tired of all the hitting and fighting at home. They took me and my daughter in and gave me lots of help. I forgot what love felt like

Elim Pacific Ministries	168472		/users/profile/152277	Allison Z.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2013	This is a non profit that aims to give everybody a chance...A place where miracles happen.  Where lives are transformed and set on track to be productive members of society.  Elim Pacific is located in the heart of the beautiful island of Guam, has been serving the Pacific region for 17 years and aims to continue making a difference.
Elim Pacific Ministries	111873		/users/profile/152277	Allison Z.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2012	I have been involved with this ministry for 10 years now and love seeing the way lives are changed and hope is restored. Daily we see miracles as inner healing occurs in the lives of people we serve.  Please come by and see for yourself what is happening here at Zion Fellowship, at Oasis Empowerment Center, at Hidden Treasures. Its really great.
Elim Pacific Ministries	168422		/users/profile/223313	byarbrough	Client Served	5	09/08/2013	After facing significant trauma in my life, coming here was a life changer.  The healing that has taken place in my heart is more dramatic and intense than I could have ever imagined.  They work with the whole person, in a direct, loving, and relational way.  The folks at this fine establishment are changing lives, and impacting the community in a way that is so much larger than their collective ability.  They do more than empower, they walk with you through the darkness.
Elim Pacific Ministries	168344	1	/users/profile/223232	Heather106	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/08/2013	Oasis is an excellent Faith-based NGO. Oasis is able to not only transform the lives of their target population, but also able to positively impact the lives of people within that target population's safety net. Oasis empowers women by building holistic capacity so women are able to overcome their barriers. Such work would not be possible without a committed and humble staff who are relationally engaged with the target population. Staff seek professional development opportunities, and Oasis regularly evaluates the program internally/externally. As an individual with a background in disability and international development I am proud recognize and honor Oasis Empowerment Center's transformative work. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	168317	1	/users/profile/153873	Monica K.	Board Member	5	09/08/2013	Oasis Empowerment Center is a life changing organization that not only helps women overcome their addictions but also builds them up, enabling them to be an asset to society and be able to experience restoration to the relationships damaged by addiction.  Oasis not only meets the practical needs of women, such as housing and food, it also brings healing both emotionally and spiritually, giving them the tools necessary to remain clean and sober and succeed in their recovery.   
Elim Pacific Ministries	113063		/users/profile/153873	Monica K.	Volunteer	5	05/27/2012	In the four years that I have been involved at Oasis, I have seen countless lives transformed, including my own.  The work Oasis does with women is beyond amazing.  I have seen women set free from addictions, I have seen families restored and I have seen women who once were takers from the system become productive members of society who are giving back to the community.  The beauty of Oasis is that they not only help ladies overcome their addictions but they also deal with the root issues which caused these addictions to begin with, thereby truly setting the captive free!
Elim Pacific Ministries	168308		/users/profile/88306	Rob Zimmerman	Board Member	5	09/08/2013	I still am always so challenged by the stories of those who have suffered so much in the course of a life. Pain killers have helped some cope but getting addicted ends up destroying so much more. Hopeless, helpless, many have come to Oasis when they get to the end of their rope. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	111866		/users/profile/88306	Rob Zimmerman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2012	Challenges are huge in this economy but at Oasis, women are being empowered. Former clients serve as staff and mentor others in their recovery. Wages are low but new opportunities make up the difference.  Now that Hidden Treasures is opening, we are seeing families get together in a whole new way too. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	167721		/users/profile/222586	Deborah70	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	I came to Oasis Empowerment Center as a volunteer in October, 2012. I am a woman who has succeeded in recovery and I wanted to help other women who were struggling with addiction. I quickly discovered that Oasis is so much more than just a recovery center. This is a community of loving and powerfully dedicated men and women who live to make Guam a better place by empowering women, children and families through every available resource. I now work for Oasis and have dedicated my life to their cause. Empowering through love, encouragement and knowledge. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	167652		/users/profile/153328	hrustick	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	Elim Pacific Ministries serves a great need in Guam. From ministry to providing housing for homeless mothers and children, this organization is amazing! There are no other nonprofits or for profits on Guam that serve women in this capacity. Elim Pacific Ministries gives food for the body and food for the soul!
Elim Pacific Ministries	112647		/users/profile/153328	hrustick	Volunteer	5	05/22/2012	I work at the Oasis Empowerment Center and it is truly an Oasis for women who are lost and suffering from drug addiction. I have seen family reunification and women get sober. This is a fantastic supportive system for women and really helps them achieve sobriety in a Christian-focused environment. Many of the ladies receive Christ as their salvation and have that extra support in their sobriety and are able to grasp their dreams again. The heart of the Oasis workers is amazing and many of the staff are prior clients giving back - it is awe-inspiring. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	118069		/users/profile/160579	lindalaba	General Member of the Public	5	07/11/2012	The prevention arm of Elim Pacific Ministries is focused on abstinence for Alcohol and Tobacco. Sadly Guam is one of the places in the US where smoking is one of the most used drugs. Alcohol use is also high. The Oasis Empowerment Center created a Real Stories Prevention Video  that I had the privilege of being involved with.  It is having a powerful impact in our local community because it shares real stories and has real actors from here. Cultural relevance is important.  Last month, one of the women we have tried to help ended up losing her battle. She died of COPD before she was able to live a full life. That is why I am committed to make a difference here working with Elim Pacific Ministries.   
Elim Pacific Ministries	113541		/users/profile/154495	nomorebooseforme	Client Served	5	06/01/2012	I was a heavy alcoholic and survived high-school pretty much drunk. Then I had trouble holding down a job because I would drink on the job. I ended up homeless and things started to really crash around me. I did not know if I would even live but I did not want to end my life. The Oasis took me in and I started to get my life changed.  I did graduate the Oasis and then went off island. Sadly I did not keep sober when I joined family and made new friends. When I got pregnant, my mom got abusive and I came back to Guam and Oasis. Things are better now. Nothing seem easy but I love my little boy and and have a job. I found hope at Oasis.
Elim Pacific Ministries	113540		/users/profile/154494	davenjubilee	Board Member	5	06/01/2012	Seeing the women of Oasis and the work of the church have a such a practical focus is important to me.

Ive celebrated my 3rd birthday and now I am helping others. The Oasis is changing lives.  I may not be making a lot of money but I am giving what I can to help.
Elim Pacific Ministries	113535		/users/profile/154487	Brian-Guam	Donor	5	06/01/2012	Ive been helping out by getting the emergency lighting and exit signs installed. Its great seeing progress.

Elim Pacific Ministries	113530		/users/profile/154480	julie96921	Client Served	5	06/01/2012	Before I entered the Oasis, I was a drug addict who was lost and alone, says recent Oasis graduate Julia Han. I had a dysfunctional family, was distant from my kids due to my drug addiction, and my friends stopped coming around after I was busted by the DEA. Julia said she knew it was the time to stop her drug habits, but having no support led her into a depression that resulted into relapse. On her way back to jail she had hit her bottom and seriously contemplated suicide. It was then that she found out about the Oasis through her counselor and probation officer. She entered the Oasis to find a way forward. The Oasis has taught me to appreciate everything because God has created life for us, she said. The Oasis has opened my eyes to being a born again Christian where I realize that everything happens for a reason. The journey I went through was a struggle, but I appreciate my journey because it led me to serve the Lord. Julia has two biological daughters, seven step-children, and two grandkids. For her the future is to continue with her recovery, work on parenting skills, and live life with Gods help. Julia graduated this month from the six-month residential program, and she is still actively involved with classes, activities, and fund-raisers at the Oasis.

I gotta say, I did not have any place to go and I called Allison and the Oasis took me in. It was simple and basic but I got started on a new life. I got my boy back, I got a car, they gave me a job and I even went back to school to become a Social Worker. While I was at Oasis, my life was really growing. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	112952		/users/profile/153716	Rosie Z.	Volunteer	5	05/25/2012	Elim Pacific Ministries is dedicated to Love people where they are at, but not to leave them there. It is wonderful to see how they use a holistic approach to impact the person at the root of the issue so that they can truly start to heal and move forward in their walk with Christ and living in freedom. I love working for Elim Pacific Ministries. I tell everyone I know to come and spend time working here because I know that it will revolutionize their life and the way they minister.

Elim Pacific Ministries	112948		/users/profile/153712	RobZimmerman	Donor	5	05/25/2012	I am committed to see Elim Pacific grow. Not only are there amazing volunteers and staff working together to make a difference, the lives impacted are so inspiring. The new Hidden Treasures project is starting to take off. The Oasis is seeing women's lives restored. Guam seems to have the highest rates of abuse against women per capita. Not only are the interventions effective, lives are made new. Join together to make a difference too.
Elim Pacific Ministries	112946		/users/profile/153710	Gail-H	Volunteer	5	05/25/2012	I came out to help at Oasis when it was first getting started back in 2004.

Matt and Josie really helped me out. Thank You.
Elim Pacific Ministries	112667		/users/profile/153316	Kandis	Client Served	5	05/22/2012	I was able to share some of my story with on the Oasis prevention outreach at various High Schools. Our rape prevention group has made a significant impact as we talked to many high school youth. One thing that seemed to happen because of me being able to share was that several teens opened up to share their stories. At JFK, the teacher gave the students the chance to write to us and we heard of several who were now drinking to deaden their pain that they experienced by being raped or molested. People need to find healing from their pain, not just a way to cope with it. At Oasis, hearts are healed and lives are being changed. Its not just about learning to get by without drugs or alcohol, it is about becoming whole. 
Elim Pacific Ministries	111880		/users/profile/152285	JohnGUAM	Board Member	5	05/11/2012	Guam can boast about a lot of things with its beautiful beaches and gateway to Asia, but it is also gripped in poverty, 43,000 people on welfare, the highest teenage pregnancy rate compared with the USA as well as 3x the number of rapes. We are committed to making a difference in Guam and that is why we are passionate about Elim Pacific Ministries

I was using drugs, and was trapped in a life where i had to sell sex to survive. No longer is that the case. I am now living on my own, I have a job and whats best of all, I have a family. The Oasis is a place where I found that God does answer prayers and makes dreams come true.

This recovery center for women is really making a difference. Ladies are moving from addiction and homelessness to sobriety and a life that is more able to lead towards HAPPILY EVER AFTER than they have ever experienced before. I really like the work Oasis is doing.

Elim Pacific Ministries	38035	8	/users/profile/38849	heatherz	Former staff	5	05/05/2010	I worked with the Job Training side of the organization. Because I am a sign language specialist, I work with the individuals with disabilities as a job coach. The Oasis is empowering women in very practical ways. By helping them find a job and become successful, self-esteem grows tremendously and individuals begin to achieve greater self determination.
Elim Pacific Ministries	38033	7	/users/profile/38846	ethanz	Volunteer	5	05/05/2010	I have helped out with childcare at the Oasis. In order for women with children to come to some of the special events at the Oasis, I was glad to be able to help with with childcare.

We both found Oasis to be a professional (though not sterile) and holistic ministry to those who struggle with dependent/addictive issues. The staff is thoroughly professional and hard-working while maintaining a balance of compassion and accountability with the clients. In the few days I have been here I have had an opportunity to interact with other pastors who are aware of what the Zimmermans are doing here on Guam. These pastors acknowledge the effectiveness and necessity of this ministry..which is a testament to the ongoing work of Oasis.
Elim Pacific Ministries	38017	6	/users/profile/38817	monica3	Donor	5	05/05/2010	I have been working with the Oasis for a couple years now and while there are always new women coming through the program, for me its as if my family keeps growing!
Elim Pacific Ministries	38015	12	/users/profile/38814	allison4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/05/2010	This has been one of the most exciting ministries to be involved with.
