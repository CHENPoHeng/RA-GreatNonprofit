Veterans Airlift Command	323570		/users/profile/417966	smorgan	Client Served	5	02/21/2017	The support that I received from Veterans Airlift Command this past week was beyond exceptional.  Due to this great organization, I was able to get a family member's funeral in Texas with little notice.  After filling out my request,  I literally received a call a few minutes later from Jenna Deibel to see how they could assist.  She took care of our arrangements and made sure we got there on time.  Today I also received a call from Andrew Lourake to make sure we made it home safely and to ask how I was doing.  What a great group of people helping veterans!

Veterans Airlift Command	322027		/users/profile/154144	Coral5181	Client Served	5	01/24/2017	My son was injured in 2005 and I was flown to Germany because he was not supposed to make the flight home. It was an IED and shrapnel the size of a credit card  that tore from one side of his brain to the other through the mid line. No one has survived passing through the midline esp since there was blood in it. It also destroyed the whole frontal lobe of the brain, he was burned, had a broken arm. Even the surgeons at NNMC, now Walter Reed, said he would not survive. But he fought to live frequently coming out of the medically induced coma too soon. Again I was told would have no function or even know me. Numerous surgeries, touch and go, infections, collapsed lung, swelling, on and on. When the body started to stabilize months later he opened his eyes once again, looked at me and smiled with definite recognition, The doctors were stunned. We have flown back and forth for surgeries with the military until he was medically retired 2 yrs after the injury, The VA could not handle his injury and still cannot. So whenever I need to get to Walter Reed VAC has been there for me. Commercial flights are impossible for him, the stress of waiting, the 6 6 1/2 size of him, the amount of medication we have to travel with and what we need to take with us would cost more than a flight. The expense alone is just too much, We need to get to Walter Reed fast at times and we will always have to go at least once a year. VAC has been there for us ever since my son has retired. I put in a request and the flight response happens so quickly it is amazing. My son is a miracle that cannot be explained, walking, talking , memory, huge sense of humor, living a quality life even if he cannot live alone. Every owner/crew we have flown with has kept in touch with us. This last trip they texted to follow his surgery, they all love updates through out the year. They are like our flying family. I am ever grateful for the generosity of these wonderful people, It takes so much stress off of me and especially my son when we need to fly. VAC gets it, from the first contact to getting back home, and they are my heroes. Thank you VAC.

After repeated poor performance by the local VA dealing with an infection it was necessary for him to be flown to Bethesda and seen by his military surgeon. Flying is a challenge with a traumatic brain injury especially with crowds. To be flown by a private pilot was such a tremendous help. It was convenient, stress free and took so much worry off the trip itself that i could focus on my son completely. The pilot and his wife treated us both with as much if not more gratitude for my son's service to our country, as we felt for the flight to Maryland. Our coordinator, Maria, went out of her way to get us the most convenient date and time for the flight as well. I cannot express how important this organization is to us. For me to be able to get to the best medical care possible for my son at no expense is a huge relief and gives me a sense of peace that I can always get him to the best without taking on financial worries as well.

At our lowest moment, desperate to be able to say our last good-byes, give our final respects, and tell the family of our Fallen Brother how much we love them... Veterans Airlift Command stepped up without hesitation.  We would not have been able to attend the funeral of our Fallen Brother had it not been for the true and pure patriotism of this nonprofit.  All of the administrative staff as well as the pilots (Spike & Butch) were professional, personable, and respectful.  THANK YOU for everything!  You helped me bring closure at one of the most difficult times in my life!

The logistics team was very prompt arranging flights to and from, and their pilots were professional and friendly. This organization is top notch, when their passengers are in a jamb and need to get to somewhere quick. That's not all they do; they also follow up and make sure you're ok after the flights. That shows an immense amount of sincerity and that they do truly care. Hats off to this wonderful organization!

There were there for us when we were turned down by others.  All the pilots have been a phenomenal asset as well as the representatives for Veteran's Airlift Command, specifically Andrew Lourake.  He is such a wonderful person and has made us forget at times why we are traveling and for just a few moments we are at peace.
Veterans Airlift Command	306723	1	/users/profile/398014	Writer	Client Served	5	09/27/2016	Veterans Airlift Command is run and supported by "people that do." VAC flew me out of state for a surgical procedure and returned me home with no issues whatsoever. Obviously, the defining features are the pilots and aircraft owners, genuinely wonderful people that are driven to serve and contribute. It is an added bonus if you have an interest or even passing hobby in aviation, because the pilots/owners always have great stories, and the aircraft are beautiful. Being able to fly via general aviation also provides far more options and flexibility when it comes to when and where you travel. This is a great organization, and I hope veterans will be able to continue using it for a long time. I also highly recommend supporting this organization - VAC **serves veterans!!** 
Veterans Airlift Command	306547	2	/users/profile/397812	armyamputee	Client Served	5	09/26/2016	I recently had the amazing opportunity to fly with VAC and the experience from start to finish was exceptional!!!  I truly hope the organization and pilots realize their positive and lasting impact they had on me and Issac, my service dog.   From the moment we met our pilots, we felt like family!  They were so understanding, caring, and supportive!!!  They even had Mutt Muffs for Issac's ears!  So Thoughtful :)  So for us, flying with a commercial airline always presents so many challenges.  Aside from being a below-knee amputee, I am legally blind and even though I have Issac to assist me, there is still always so much stress.  I worry about our seating because Issac is 90 lbs and does not fit well in the limited area, even the bulkhead section.  With my vision loss, direct flights work best as to avoid the confusion of trying to get to the connecting gate.  Sadly, you can not depend on airport staff as we have missed flights before even with their help.  There is always the embarrassing pat down and anxiety that comes along with that as well.  With VAC, all of that anxiety completely goes away!!!  Issac had plenty of room to stretch out and sleep.  Having no stress is a tremendous comfort and alleviates the worry of any issues.  Words really can not express the true emotions of what this experience meant to us and saying Thank You a million times just does not seem to do it justice.  We feel so blessed to have had this honor!  Thank You VAC and Pilots for your continued dedication and commitment!!!  Warmest Regards, Leslie & Issac

This past June I was asked by a fellow Combat Wounded Veteran to be his best man in his wedding and if it wasn't for the Vet Airlift Command I would have had to decline. They had a private plane pick my family and I up at our local airport and transported us where we needed to be. The flight crew were some of the best people I have ever met and they made sure our flight was as comfortable as could be. I could never thank Vet Airlift enough for what they did for me. In my opinion Vet Airlift Command has set the standard on how our Wounded Veterans should be taken care of. Thank you!

Friedenberg was to be honored for his heroism on D Day, June 6, 1944 at the WW 2 Museum this past D Day, 2016. He has COPD and is on oxygen 24/7 and uses a bathroom several times a day and cannot walk coupled with a compromised immune system. There was NO way I could take my Mom and Dad to New Orleans on the airlines. We have 2 Aids and both of my parents are in wheel chairs. I was desperate and then I was connected with the Veterans Airlift Command. I needed a jet that could facilitate 6 of us traveling in total and all of the medical equipment.This amazing organization stepped up and had a Citation 4 meet us in Atlantic City, NJ and take us to New Orleans and then 2 days later home. The pilot Jed was an amazing human being..... kind, concerned, and dotted all i's and crossed his t's. He transported another soldier that day before getting us and it was a long day for Jed. He is a generous man and the Veteran's Airlift Command was beyond patient and understanding on helping us complete this mission for my Dad. God bless this organization.Respectfully,Susan C.

I have now flown with them around 10-15 times. Veterans Airlift Command has not only decreased the costs associated with the travel, but also the stress that comes with traveling. After being injured in Iraq with a Traumatic Brain Inury that caused a brain tumor to grow, I have been able to not be as stressed heading to appointments to see if my brain tumor is progressing and other symptoms that have raised due to have 3 brain surgeries and radiation therapy. I have gotten to know numerous pilots and am so blessed by their generosity. I don't know what I would do without Veterans Airlift Command!

After retiring from Naval Service in 2012 due to wounds sustained in Afghanistan, I turned an old passion, Snowboarding, into a career and competed in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, Snowboarding on Team USA.   After complications with the Limb Salvage I had undergone  since being wounded by an IED blast, I finally had both of my legs amputated below the knee.  Last week, I was invited to return to the World Cup Snowboard Racing Circuit for the 2015-16 season, however, a day before departing for Aspen, Co, I came down with a severe infection in my right residual limb.  While hospitalized, my chances of making it to the classification event seemed grim, at best.  In desperation and no where else to turn, I sent Veterans Airlift Command a message via their website.  Within the hour, they called me to discuss our options and agreed to help me.With less than 24 hours notice, Veterans Airlift Command was able to take me from Salt Lake City to Aspen so that I could meet a classification requirement of the International Paralympic Committee, enabling me to remain eligible for this years race season.  Without their help, I would not be able to continue my carrier this season.The service I received from this organization was absolutely incredible.  The Pilot was extremely accommodating and provided for an excellent travel experience.  My sincerest appreciation goes to the folks at Veterans Airlift Command.Sincerely,Tyler Burdick

My husband was injured in 2009 and just recently left the service. After he got out he was awarded a service dog from another non profit based in Ohio. We live in Tennessee. Trying to figure out how to get there from here with a family of 6 and a wounded warrior who is not allowed to drive was a daunting task. I heard about VAC from a friend who works for Luke's Wings, another non profit who has helped us in the past. Let me tell you, I emailed VAC with our dilemma and was promptly emailed back. Over the course of a week, VAC had taken all the weight off my shoulders and found a flight to accommodate my husband. Not only did Andrew Lourake help us with the flight, but he also helped put us in touch with another wounded warrior in our area. He has proven to my family that there are good people out there who will go above and beyond to help their own. Now that my husband has his service dog, he is able to function much better and his quality of life has drastically improved. Thank you VAC and our pilots for bringing some normalcy back to our lives. You all are truly amazing!!!

VAC does everything possible to help you get to your destination and back weather it is for medical treatment, family to get to their Veteran while in the hospital, trips for health and wellness recovery, and even for your Honeymoon like they did for a fellow brother of mine. VAC gets and understand that we need special services sometimes and are 110% all over it through their network of Hero's as I call them. The pilots, companies, and private organization who honor us by having their pilots and planes fly on their own dime with fuel and aircraft to help us out. Even more impactful when a private owner who flys as a hobby picks up your flight(s) and uses their own time most of them retried to help us out. ALL the organizations and privately owned aircraft and pilots are so professional and compassionate to the Veterans needs always going above and beyond. I always thank them from the bottom of my heart and for what they do for all veterans. This is truly Americans taking care of Americas Veterans which for years has been so over looked. If there was an award for Selfless Act of Heroism Veterans Airlift Command (VAC) and all the organizations and privately owned and operated pilots should and would receive it. Thank You for everything VAC! God Bless! If you all ever need anything I'm there for ALl of You!!(SFC) (Ret) Scott A. Adams SrMinnesota

As a wounded veteran, my long list of fellow team mates wounded in action or killed in action has humbled me over the years.  VAC has always been there for us to ensure we keep supporting our brothers in arms.  One of my team mates that I was wounded with, from an IED blast in Afghanistan, suffered burns to 95% of his body.  VAC gave me the opportunity to visit him in San Antonio, TX.  VAC is an organization of silent professionals, who are asking nothing in return, except to help combat wounded veterans.  Thank you VAC for allowing me to show continued support to my wounded brother.

Thus, I must thank Ms. Maria Miles for getting me to my destination and back on a short notice more than once in times of emergency. Then, many thanks to Lt Col Andrew Lourake, for taking time to check on me to ensure I am doing well. I quickly realize that the Veterans Airlift Command uses 'Empathy' more than 'Sympathy'.

Thanks to the Veterans Airlift Command wounded service members can travel to medical appointments stress free. Last Sunday 09/13/2015 a wonderful American (Walter) gave up his weekend and his personal aircraft to fly me from Tallahassee Fl to Columbus OH for a weeks worth of medical appointments. I was prepared to thank the pilot and slip him a note of gratitude for the owner, but was shocked when the owner landed and thanked me before I could thank him. My flight home was just as smooth as can be and once again was made possible by a couple  from Alabama who gave up their weekend and aircraft to make my life just a little bit easier. It is easy to have personal feelings of sorrow due to pain and the events that caused it but when you meet these Patriotic People it makes your sacrifice feel smaller and once again proud to be American.God Bless the Veterans Airlift Command for they go above and beyond (literally).Luke MurphyStaff Sergeant (Ret.)101st Airborne DivisionAuthor "Blasted by Adversity"

I was in desperate need of a new prosthetic socket and VAC and their fleet of volunteer pilots flew myself and my Fiance from Yuma, AZ to Rochester, MN and back so I could have the care I needed.  These volunteer pilots are the heart and soul of this organization. The benefit for an amputee like myself, is that I didn't have to wait in long airport lines or show up 3 hrs early so TSA could preform inspections. VAC made it so easy, show up on time, load plane and sit back and enjoy the view. The staff at VAC could not have been more helpful and once again the Volunteer Pilots are awesome.
Veterans Airlift Command	236642	2	/users/profile/320651	fwbutler	Client Served	5	01/11/2015	VAC, Our relationship began this past Summer when we contacted VAC to assist two injured friends that were in need of logistical support for medical care. Walt Fricke, VACs founder, did not hesitate to help this special couple reach their destination and ultimately find the medical answers they had been searching for throughout their recovery. In setting up that flight, Walt began some lighthearted badgering that I had never utilized VAC for my own travel needs despite meeting him nearly 7 years ago while I was recovering from bilateral feet amputations at Walter Reed. This past December, we finally used VAC for our holiday travel to Florida to visit family and it was the least stressful travel experience since my injury. I promised Walt that I would call on their services when a good situation arose as I have had my struggles with conventional travel, much like anyone with a disability. TSA, large airports, small seat pitches, explaining my disability multiple times  the experience brings on anxiety and stress, but flying with VAC eliminated every one of these aspects of flying. With Lauras intense semester ending and Christmas break nearing, we reached out to VAC and in less than 24 hours, our pilots were confirmed and arrangements completed. Our pilots were some of the most kind, generous, and caring individuals who donate their own time, resources, and talents to provide us an alternative to commercial air travel. They will be a special part of our lives going forward and we are so thankful to have met them and to have shared in their love of aviation. All and all, we cant say enough about this organization. They have aided countless friends and we are proud of the mission they have taken on to support our disabled veterans. Their staff truly cares and understands the needs of this disabled veteran community. Sincerely,Ferris & Laura Butler

He organized with VAC and was able to secure a plane to get 5 of the members from Washington D.C to Bellingham, WA. It was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had. The team, consisting of Jeff Hendricks, Mike Freeman and Dick Iverson, were outstanding. They flew across the US to come and get us, with the utmost hospitality and food on board, then flew us home!! I couldn't have asked for a better team.

Ten years later, I needed two more months of intense physical therapy, 1200 miles away from my home.  The actual therapy was covered, but we needed to pay for transportation, lodging, and food for two months.  I rented a bedroom in a house, but plane tickets were so expensive, especially one-way.  My wife escorted me down there in my car, but she needed to be home to work her own job and to care for our pets. VETERANS AIRLIFT COMMAND stepped up and quickly offered to fly my wife back and forth to accommodate us.  The pilots and the aircraft were top notch.  Courtesy and professionalism were standard for both of her flights.  It is this simple... If we needed to pay the cost of her plane tickets, I would not have been financially able to travel and seize the opportunity for the physical therapy in that particular facility.  VAC filled a gap that was a critical piece of a much bigger picture, so they saved the day.  Honestly, it is not an exaggeration to say this: I am a better man because  VAC accomplished their mission for me and my wife.

I was offered the opportunity to go to Oregon for the 2 week service dog handler training and at the end graduate with a service dog. I was so excited but I knew I could not fly and it would take about 14 hours to drive. I decided to do some research to see if I could find an organization who would be able to fly me and my mother/caregiver in a private plane. I found Veterans Airlift Command and sent in my request. Andrew Lourake, the Program Director contacted me for more information and towards the end of the conversation he said that they would be able to help us. He put out the request for any pilots able to work my trip into their schedule. It only took a couple of days and Andrew had me in touch with a pilot that had agreed to take the outbound flight to Oregon and his name was Alberto. Unfortunately he was not able to fly me so he had Lee and Terry fly me instead. They were so amazing and made my mom and me feel at ease. They carried our bags for us and the flight was very smooth. The plane was clean and spacious.The pilot that accepted the inbound flight was Dale & his wife Terry. They were so kind and made us feel comfortable. This time my service dog, Pongo was with me. They were very sweet to him. Upon landing they took our bags and wited til our ride came.What do you say to describe people like this? These are people that freely fave their time to help a veteran, someone they have never met, in need. I only wish that there were more people in this world that could see past their own bubble and notice for a split second that they are not the only one living around them. It sure would be a kinder place. Thank you so very much for being that little glimpse of relief during a time of roller coaster moments. Andrew Lourake is one of the most patient, kind, understanding, helpful gentleman I have come across in a very long time. I hope he can continue on the path he is and help as many veterans/military as possible so they too can have that calm for a moment during the storm. Thank you again, Sir.

Such a nonprofit is the Veterans Airlift Command (VAC).  I have vetted many other nonprofits who advertise their services to U.S. wounded soldiers but have found none that performs so much with only a small staff where approximately 95% of every dollar actually goes to assisting wounded soldiers.  I have been a VAC volunteer air crew member for over two years and have participated in nearly 100,000 air miles of  transporting many wounded soldiers due solely to the smart and efficient management of the VAC.  I rank them number one as a nonprofit providing the most valuable service to our nation's veterans and active duty military personnel.  Let me put it another way.....there are no better nonprofits in the U.S. than the Veterans Airlift Command.  Sincerely, Richard D. Iversen, Colonel, USAF, Ret.

The VAC program is critical for me because it gives me a flexible and reliable means of traveling long distances, be they distant trips home, on vacation, or to a medical appointment.
Veterans Airlift Command	212611	1	/users/profile/275665	Todd27	Client Served	5	08/28/2014	I am a 21 year Active Duty Army Infantryman and recently retired Wounded Warrior.  I've spent the last years of my career in military hospitals all America while usually assigned to an organic Infantry unit.  Having a wife and small child, constantly supporting multiple households, traveling for critical surgeries and navigating some of America's most complex airports is to put it mildly, unbearable and nothing short of humiliating for a Wounded family.   While at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center during the initial phases of my treatment, my wife and I were informed our then 4 y/o daughter could not be in the intensive, critical care and surgical and wards where I would spend many days and night.  Additionally, when I needed treatment outside the realm of what the military could offer, the Army would provide that however only pay for my travel as the wounded Service member, my wife's travel as a non-medical attendant, but not our little girl's who I needed just as much as any procedure I've ever had.   Being a military family, we all know "home" is wherever you can make it.  Supporting two residences on one enlisted salary, with a small child and given my medical needs, we needed help that military policy would not provide.  Sometimes we needed additional family so my wife could be with me in critical wards and to do everything possible to have our little girl interact with me as often as possible.  We also needed help so we could travel commercially as a family when not on an air ambulance.  In short, we needed a lot of things that fell through the cracks of what military policy would allow for but we needed to heal as a Soldier and family. I don't recall how we heard of an amazing organization called Veteran's Airlift Command however a few days shy of a scary surgery, we were struggling with how to get family to Walter Reed tend to our daughter so my wife could be with me following surgery and in the intensive care ward.  I couldn't imagine going this surgery without having my family there with me as much as possible.   My wife and I soon found ourselves filling out and submitting a travel to Veteran's Airlift Command.   I honestly didn't think anything would come of it and was already trying to live with the fact that I would have to go through this critical surgery alone.   Within hours, we had confirmation, that a family member was being flown to Walter Reed to help, free of charge.  I was sedated with my family by my side.  Soon another surgery was scheduled in Houston, TX.  Again, we were struggling with the logistics and financial burden of another surgery.  Veteran's Airlift Command came through again with round trip travel at whatever dates we needed in a private aircraft.  We wouldn't have to struggle through airport security.  We had room to be comfortable and bring things we needed for an extended stay.  These trips were numerous and lengthy, sometimes over a month at a time.   It was beyond my comprehension that an organization formed by one man, grown to over 2400 pilots and aircraft could and would be so generous and sincere!  I still don't understand it yet figured the best way I could show my gratitude was to try to raise awareness and give back to Veteran's Airlift Command.  Now, six months into my retirement, although I personally vowed to only give back to VAC, we had a family emergency.  My mother had a heart attack, literally while I was at an event in southern Minnesota trying to raise awareness and funding for VAC.  Having just transitioned into the civilian sector and VA Healthcare system now surviving on my Army retirement and disability, still trying to get on our feet, my mother needed help hundreds of miles away.  I hated to ask Veteran's Airlift Command for help again.  I had no choice and typed out a travel request.  I lost my composure as I realized the gravity of the situation and went into our bathroom with the lights off, hoping no one would hear nor see a grown man crying.  A few minutes later, I heard my wife calling for me.  I couldn't answer her.  She finally found me sobbing, her with a VAC representative on the phone she was holding to her ear.  They had a flight and could have us at my mother's bedside within a few hours.   Yesterday my mother successfully made it through a quadruple bypass surgery.  A surgery she would have had to endure with a lot of anxiety and unknowns.  However,  VAC staff and volunteer efforts allowed my family to be united as my mother's care drifted off into the hands of her physicians and her wishes in mine, she said, "I'm glad you're here, I trust you and everything is going to be alright".

At no expense to the veteran, the veteran has more time worry about their recovery. I am a veteran myself and I'm a triple amputee, I've used veterans airlift command on many occasions and my experiences always exceed my expectations. This organization truly is amazing that does what it can for our nation's finest.

I am a bilateral above the knee amputee that has had the pleasure of flying with VAC several times but most recently for a medical emergency. I had to fly from Walter Reed National Medical Center to St. Paul, MN ASAP to correct a bone lengthening device that had broken through my femur VAC was able to get me a flight that night and help me arrange ground transportation to the hospital.  The only other possible for me to have flown would have been commercial and I would have paid  out of pocket for a ticket with no guarantees that I  was going to be reimbursed.   Also with the pain I was already in from a broken femur VAC made everything as quick and painless as possible. Thank you Veterans Airlift.

They are 100% accommodating and efficient in organizing travel via private aircraft for veterans.  Often veterans are from small town hours away from major airports, VAC can take them close.   Those with severe disabilities have a much easier time flying with VAC, foregoing the major airport headaches.  Their aid and assistance has been a tremendous help in my recovery from my battlefield injuries.  Thank God for organizations like VAC.

Because of this organization our family was able to get home in time to have our final farewell's with my father-n-law when he passed in 2011.  Without the VAC we would not have gotten that chance. My husband suffers from PTSD and a TBI, air travel is a wire walking act to say the least. Everyone we have dealt with in connection with the VAC have been so awesome, they consistently impress us with their humility and professional manner.  The VAC is one of the best nonprofits out there, without them it would be so hard for us to travel home.

I am a wounded warrior missing both legs, and the VAC has made my transportation so much simpler by solving many of my transportation obstacles. I have a limited time that I can sit until my body heals entirely. The VAC has given me a huge favor by "trimming" all of the time that is spent when people drive to faraway airports, waiting hours in the terminals, and sitting on their commercial aircraft. The VAC has made my trips (both medically and non-medically related) not just possible, but also incredibly easy.

He stepped on an IED and lost both of his legs. He would lay in the bed and dream of being able to go home. He was unable to leave the hospital for any extended period and he could not sit in a car for more than an one hour at most. He finally was given a weekend pass 5 months after being injured. He did not have the endurance for the 10 hour car ride, but that is when VAC stepped in. We heard about VAC from other wounded warriors and we applied for a flight online. Less than 12 hours from asking for a flight, VAC had arranged 2 separate pilots to fly us home for a MUCH needed weekend pass home. Andrew began walking weeks later. That trip home was a turning point in his healing. Thank God for VAC.

We were really not looking forward to traveling after my fiance's injury; having to go through metal detectors in the airport with two prosthetic legs is not the easiest for him, not to mention the waiting and long lines.

Afterward, we received emails from both pilots to confirm the details of our flight. Each pilot also provided their home and cell numbers, in order to communicate throughout our trip.  During our flight, the pilots were friendly, made sure we were comfortable, and were willing to answer all questions we had. During our flight, the pilots provided headphones to my husband and I, so that we could talk with them during the flight.   On the way home, I was really concerned about ways to combat the air pressure from getting to my head and ears.

My friends and family threw me a magnificent benefit in January and I believed I wouldnt be able to attend but my pass to go was cleared from the hospital at the last minute. Within days I was set up with a personal jet, with the crew, and mechanic to go with it. The pilot called me on my cell phone and left every detail up to me. I chose which airports I wanted to leave from and arrive to. That was great, as I chose a small town airstrip and didnt have to drive forty five minutes from Chicago to get home after arrival. The crew was hands down the best I ever had. They treated me as if I was a Rock Star the entire trip, with the pilot greeting me at my vehicle and returning me to the same place to say goodbye on the return trip. Times and number of passengers were totally up to my discretion, as at one time they were willing to send out two planes and crews to accommodate my wishes. I must have called the pilot four different times making changes to absolutely no problems at all. The flight attendant also called me the day before asking me what we would like to eat during our flight. She also decorated the plane with red white and blue streamers for American support, I absolutely loved that.  I was able to personally thank the owner of the corporation and also arrived with small tokens of appreciation for the crew and owner before the flight, as that was a justly thing to do. Lastly, I was told from the pilot (told from his boss,) that: they would be offended if I flew commercial airlines and didnt use them again. Im sold on that as I am soon to contact Veterans Airlift Command again very soon.  SFC John Masson

On Saturday, 7 November 2010, we flew our 3rd Mission in support of this country's wounded Heros and their families.In reality, there is so little that we can do to say "Thank You" in a meaningful way.  However, one of the more impactful ways is to help one of these Heros or a family member create a memory of a happy occasion.  Providing air transportation, utilizing private & business aviation, helps to bring family members together for whom this time together would not have been possible.  We are humbled and honored to be of service to those who have chosen to protect our country, our values and our way of life.  They, and their families, are our contemporary Heros.VAC does a very thorough and professional job vetting each potential traveler.  Each of the Missions we have flown are for those truly in need of assistance.  The staff is incredibly efficient and available on a nearly 24/7 basis.  In short, VAC has its the act together and performs at a very high level.  As has often been said, "Results & Performance are the only things that count .... everything else is "conversation".

I was medevaced to Germany where I was given a 5% chance to live and put into a medically induced coma for 3 weeks immediatly after arriving. I pulled through and stayed in Germany for 3 months in the ICU and eventually went into remission and was flown back to the states. I started chemo while in the states and in March of 2010 I relapsed and they realized that the chemo wasn't working anymore and they found leukemic cells in my brain/spine. So I underwent chemo through an implanted port in my brain and then I was told I needed a bone marrow transplant. My brother was a full match, so I was lucky I could go ahead and start the transplant soon. They put me through full body, testicular, and brain radiation, then 5 days of high dac chemo. Then I got the bone marrow transplant. All the radiation, chemo, transplant, time spent lying in a hospital bed, being on steriods and other pills that I'm taking, destroyed my body. I need a cane to walk and when I stand up, I almost pass out everytime. It's hard for me to pick up my laptop or walk short distances without being utterly exhausted. So when it came time for me to move back home my social worker put me in touch with Veteran's Airlift Command. I talked with the coordinator Lisa Young who just asked me what date I needed to be back and she was able to find a pilot and private plane to take me from Washington to Illinois. The program is incredible, they find volunteer pilots and people volunteer their own planes to help fly veterans. They were even willing to buy me a commercial ticket if they couldn't find me a pilot/plane! The whole process was completely smooth and amazing. The pilot and co-pilot were great and they even had packed me a lunch and gift basket of goodies for the ride. I can't even begin to express my gratitude for everything that the Veteran's Airlift Command did for me.Adam BartonOIF/OEF

VAC, with the help of many volunteer pilots and aircraft owners, enables injured Veterans to travel for care and family. We have flown two missions for the VAC and both were the most rewarding flights we've ever had. It's one way to give back to the courageous men and women who have given their health and safety for our freedom. We can't repay them for their sacrifices, but VAC is good place to start!

My son wanted to go see his unit return from Afghanistan and needed transportation. I contacted Veterans Airlift and they were able to provide the needed transportation.  It was a good experience from step 1 to the finish. The application was user friendly and the response time was quick. I would recommend this service to any vet needing transportation. The whole process was a positive one.

Our organization offers disabled veterans weeklong recreational therapy sessions in northwestern Wyoming.  Getting our veterans here to Jackson Hole can be challenging.  Thanks to the VAC, we now have expanded capabilities for air transportation.  The VAC pilots are highly experienced and understand the issues facing the disabled veteran population.  The VAC Mission Coordinator is easy to work with and very responsive to everyone's needs.  We are grateful for the Veterans Airlift Command and will definitely use their excellent service in the future.

Lisa, the Veterans Airlift Command (VAC) Representative that I spoke to told me that we should have an answer within a week. She was very helpful and accomadating, making sure, if I got a flight, that I would receive the best treatment possible. I had no idea how far they would go! Not only did I get a flight, but I got word the next day that both of my flights had been booked! The pilots were very friendly and helpful and "bent over backwards" to make sure that I was comfortable. They were so accomadating that, when I needed to change my flight to land in CA, instead of NV, they didn't even hesitate! I would highly recommend VAC to all of my fellow Veterans for any of their needs! Thank you VAC for a great oppportunity!

As a wounded Vet I used their services and was overwhelmed by the service, hospitatliy and professionalism of their staff and volunteer pilots.  While recovering from an injury sustained while in Iraq, my pregnant wife came down with lymes disease.  I needed to get home in a hurry to take care her and the kids.  Veterans Airlift Command picked my up in KS and dropped me off in MN.  Both the pick up and drop off locations were less than 20 mins from my residence.  No hassles with security or arriving early at the airport, just to sit and wait.  I was home in less than half the time of a commercial flight and it didn't cost me anything.  Great organization, worthy of support!!

My passenger, who had not flown in two years because of his condition, was a bit nervous about the trip and the physical effects of the flight on him.  However, both he and his wife were anxious to get the adventure going.  Both of them were absolutely wonderful, the flight went very well and I left them in Tampa to continue on to their conference.It is a real pleasure to meet people of the caliber of these two individuals.  They are both heroes in my eyes and I was honored to spend some time with them.

We were invited to become mentors for the SOCOM Care Coalition providing other families and veterans assistance when they need it. The convention was held in Tampa, Florida, my husband was cleared to try flying again and this would be our first air travel experience since 2007. Our Care Coalition advocate offered to set us up with VAC for more convenient traveling. Well, we chose to give VAC a try.Despite him and myself being nervous but also excited about this trip we knew that the Veterans Airlift Command would be the best way without the hassle of commercial air travel. Mission Coordinator Lisa Young, was on it in a jiffy, got everything worked out within a very short period of time. She got us set and in touch with both volunteering pilots without any issues. Everyone involved was easy to contact, questions and concerns were taken care of professionally and with ease. Both pilots were wonderful, supportive, helpful, and caring individuals. Not only did they have the ability to calm my husband down but also were hands on to help him into the plane and out. What a wonderful way to support America's veterans to make their travels less stressful and unique! Everyone went above and beyond to make this "first" time flying a great and relaxed time for my husband. He no longer is worried about traveling by air because of this foundation. I hope more veterans will be able to have the opportunity to use this awesome way of travel wether they are heading to a medical appointment or to a convention, no veteran and their family will forget this experience. The kindness and respect shown by the foundation and the pilots is outstanding and something many can learn from. Thank you VAC for giving us this opportunity and a piece of a "normal" life back - I haven't seen my husband feeling hopeful about his future in a while, this experience definately helped to show him he is not glued to just one location anymore, he can and will be able to fly where ever he wants to go. Thank you again, your impact on changing our outlook on what is possible will never be forgotten!

My husband also suffers from medical problems that require him to constantly be on oxygen and to see doctors on a regular basis, requiring me to try to be a two places at once.

There was no way, due to the ages of my children and the status of my injuries at the time, that we could make the trip driving or flying commercially. We contacted VAC and we were surprised at how easy everything was. We were treated with the utmost respect throughout the entire process, both in filling out the application and throughout the planning the trip with the pilot. We were so impressed that a few months later when were going on leave to Tennessee when we were in the same situation with planning the trip that we contacted VAC again. i would recommend VAC to anyone and everyone.

Imagine somebody brings you together."With these words, the Veterans Airlift Command (VAC) introduces its website (www.veteransairlift.org) and summarizes its mission. Consisting entirely of volunteer pilots and aircraft owners who receive no compensation, the VAC provides private air transportation to our wounded warriors who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as to their families.I have just had the honor and privilege to fly my first mission for the VAC, transporting a severely wounded young soldier and his wife to their hometown in Texas. Ryan was a 22 year old gunner on a Humvee that was blown up in Iraq. He has been receiving medical treatment for 2 years. He is doing well, but his injuries are horrific. The FAA has assigned the call sign "Hero Flight" to these missions, and as we flew across the country and I spoke to each air traffic control facility as a Hero Flight, most of the FAA controllers knew the meaning and conveyed a personal message of thanks to my passengers before handing us off to the next facility. Those controllers that did not know the meaning of Hero Flight asked, and my explanation was met with the same expressions of thanks. Ryan and his wife smiled when they heard these air traffic control thank you's directed at them.Ryan and his wife were greeted at our destination in Texas by both their families, and I was overwhelmed by the expressions of appreciation directed at me. What I did was nothing, compared to what Ryan and his fellow soldiers have done. Thank you, Ryan.

I was flown from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington DC to my home in Junction City, KS.  The trip began with a limo ride arranged for my wife and I from Walter Reed to the Airport.  The short walk to plane side was a great departure from the typical full-body searches that all amputees are so familiar with in the TSA lines.  The flight itself was great to say the least and the crew extremely professional.  Our flight landed in a small municipal airport near our home which made for an extremely short drive home and the overall trip was drastically shorter than traditional travel, which at the time was exceptional considering my medical condition.

He was in the hospital in CA for 3 months and I was with him.  He was transferred to BAMC in San Antonio, TX where he remained for another 6 months for surgeries and rehab.  During that time, we did not get away from the hospital very often.  We were apprised of a progam that air lifted wounded soldiers so they didn't have to sit for lengthy periods of time in airports being subjected to stares and long waits while in pain.  Our first flight took us to Dallas and a weekend home with family.  We met the pilot at a small airport and our luggage was placed on the plane, we took off and were home shortly.  When we were to return home, the process was reversed and the flight back to San Antonio was completed.  It was great to get away and not have to sit and wait in an airport.  We so appreciated the trip and a nice weekend with family and at no cost to us.  We had occasion to use their services two more times with similar experiences.  Each flight was special and the pilots were friendly and courteous.  I know other wounded soldiers have been able to take advantage of this service.

My 8 and 9 year old boys went with me to pick up a soldier in New York and take him to Tampa.  I made sure my boys had a little sensitivity training to what they might see (wheelchair, loading, etc.).  I had no idea what an impact this lift has made on my life and a long lasting impact with my children.  They know what it means to be a hero but more importantly they learned how to be his hero and friend.  They know what it means that he made a sacrifice for them.  They probably remember most how much fun it was playing with him and he with them.  It was like an uncle they had never met and he himself was a big kid.  Laughter and friendship filled the aircraft and once we landed they were transformed into his personal travel companions.  Your children should have exposure to this type of philantrophy.  It's a trip we will not soon forget.
Veterans Airlift Command	33305	4	/users/profile/34113	jarndt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/16/2010	I am a social worker at a VAMC and have used Veterans Airlift Command several times to send injured Veterans and Servicemembers home to visit family and friends as many of them are far away from family while they are being treated for injuries.  In my experience, Veterans Airlift Command has been very accomodating to my patients' wishes and needs.  Many of the patients have also expressed not only enjoying their trip home, but enjoying the flight and the pilots.  Your kindness and compassion toward the Veterans and Servicemembers we treat is much appreciated.
Veterans Airlift Command	33303	7	/users/profile/34111	methaz	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	Veterans Airlift Command (VAC) does a great job of coordinating air transportation between Veterans who need help and private/corporate pilots who have volunteered to provide free trips.  I have flown four missions, the most recent taking a Marine with neurological problems due to a brain injury from Camp LeJune to a specialized center in Atlanta, the Shepherd Center.  A grueling 6 hour ground trip, or a potentially confusing commercial flight with two or three stops became a relaxed, point to point two hour flight.  Other missions included getting an Soldier home from the hospital in time for his daughter's graduation, and taking the wife of a service member to Walter Reed to be with her husband during treatment.  As a combat Veteran myself, I understand all too well where the gaps are in the system, and VAC helps bridge one of these gaps.
Veterans Airlift Command	33301	9	/users/profile/34112	irene-spychalla	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/16/2010	As the case manager for the military outreach program at the Shepherd Center, Atlanta (the Share Initiative), I have had extremely positive experiences working with Veterans Airlift Command.  They have assisted in flying veterans as well as active duty service members and their families to our TBI/ PTSD treatment program, and have also been very flexibile in developing transportation schedules to allow our clients to commute between our program and their homes if their treatment focus is the transition back into the home. This allows our clients to apply and practice routines and strategies acquired in our program into in their home environments and then provide feedback upon their return to treatment. Veteran's Airlift Command has been extremely flexible and has been able to assist us with rather complicated flight schedules and destinations (e.g., Atlanta to South Dakota) on short notice and free of charge to our clients. Our clients with PTSD appreciate not having to fly from large, busy airports on commercial airlines and have had very positive experiences with the personal attention of the Veterans Airlift Command Pilots.

Robert Jackson, Jr. and I utilized the VAC services during my stay at Walter Reed Medical Center for surgery during the month of Dec 09 and Jan 09.Quite simply they were a life saver.  Because I ended up funding my own travel and lodging expenses because my command would not provide Cost TDY Orders, cash was limited and time was critical.I utilized the VAC service on 3 separate occassions saving me lodging expenses of approx $1,000.00.  The staff and Management of VAC bent over backward to ensure my requests were met; twice on very short notice.The pilots were all very good and very professional, during the holiday season 7,000 miles away from family (in Germany)this was a GOD SEND!!

We met Marine Corporals Christopher Lawrence and Brett Sobaski at the terminal. Each Marine sat right seat in our Cessnas doing a fantastic job navigating over Miramar Naval Air Station and March Air Reserve Base en route back to Big Bear. First impressions proved accurate throughout the weekend as these two shining examples of courage & patriotism reminded us of the thousands of men and women who risk their lives to keep our country free.Seventy-five community members came out to thank the Marines for the sacrifices theyve made and injuries theyve suffered to keep us free. With the Marine Hymn playing in the background, retired Marine Colonel Bill Alley choked back tears of pride as he presented the Marines with a decorated cake, thanking the soldiers for service to their country. A dozen other Marine Veterans in attendance were evidenced by utterances of Semper Fi and Oorah heard throughout the afternoon. It was a proud day for all of us.Both Marines expressed thanks and appreciation to those in attendance, and again tears started to flow. A standing ovation was immediate and well deserved for these two amazing young men.This was a very special weekend for many people in Big Bear and Roger and I look forward to doing it again as VAC volunteers.Marine Corporals Christopher Lawrence and Brett Sobaski should be a reminder to all of us that there are hundreds more like them rehabilitating in Military Hospitals all round the country. They appreciate any show of support that you can give them. Stop by a hospital and visit, send a card or care package, take them out on the town or a short trip, everything is appreciated.Thanks to all the VAC volunteers and pilots for what they do. It does make a difference.
Veterans Airlift Command	33288	4	/users/profile/34099	rahays	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	OMG! i hardly know where to start. I am an ex-Marine (Viet Nam era) who took up flying at age 60. I have flown over 120 mercy missions for other organizations over the past 10 years, plus several supply flights for charity. I recently flew 2 Wounded Warriors frorm San Diego to Mamoth Mountain for a special weekend hosted by the Mamoth Community in honor of these wounded heros. One US Marine had lost both legs from an IED blast and the other US soldier had been "stiched" across the torso by an AK47. Other than the fact that they both were obviously working at ignoring great pain, they were the most positive, determined and sprirted young people I have been around in a long time. Their outlook for the future could not have been more optimistic; but the burning desire of each was to return to battle and support their buddies. After dropping them off, I was on an emotional high which has lasted through to this day. Such unbelievable courage is so refreshing and balances out any personal negatives I have experienced since that mission. I can hardly wait to be assigned another flight for these amazing Wounded Warriors.

It was one of the best things that happen to my family after having my husband step on an IED. Fighting for his life with me being by his side having to leave my kids behind. Veterans Airlift Command Flew in to a small airport in Atlanta and brought my kids and an adult family member to Washington DC to my husbands bed side to visit. my husband fought for his life for several months.

Veterans Airlift Command	33280	7	/users/profile/34093	cjfulton	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I have volunteered my aircraft and services since the early days of VAC. I spent 21 years in the USAF in fighter aviation related jobs including 350 combat missions in SEA.  VAC has offered me the opportunity become involved in a desperately needed service to those who have given so much for the freedom and priviledges we, as American, enjoy.  Each mission is unique in the experiences and purpose.  Each military hero I fly with has had a horrible experience but has an absolutely indominatable spirit.  Each one and their families leave me feeling humble and proud I can do something--a service that few can provide.  Makes me feel wonderful knowing I have the resources and opportunity to be part of lives, recovery and future success of our great American fighting men and women.  Chuck Fulton, Col USAF Retired
Veterans Airlift Command	33276	7	/users/profile/34091	robert9	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I have been associated with the Veterans Airlift Command (VAC) for the last 15 months.  They are a class organization that provides transportation services for our wounded veterans.  They work closely with other veteran groups such as the Wounded Warrior Project and Veteran Outdoors, and they also work directly with individual veterans.  All these groups focus on helping our wounded veterans in their transition back into civilian life by providing special activities and services and in the case of VAC, helping them travel to and from those activities.  The VAC Staff is superb and works tirelessly to arrange air transportation all over the U.S. and often will little or no notice.  I am very proud to be able to work with this fine group of folks and to be able to serve the wounded vets that have given so much for the rest of us.
Veterans Airlift Command	33275	4	/users/profile/34090	alan4	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	While stationed in Washington DC from 2006 -2008, I became aware of this organization that assists our wounded warriors and their families.  My mobilization was not going to send me into the war zone and I felt that I could do something for those that served in harms way.  I own an airplane and am able to provide the warrior and their families with needed transporation at no cost to them.  The inner feeling of having contributed is tremendous and the reward is seeing how much they appreciate my small efforts.  I have only been able to provide transportation to one family but I managed to donate to the Veterans Airlift Command to help keep it going.
Veterans Airlift Command	33274	4	/users/profile/34089	ltimte	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I flew a soldier who was recovering from his wounds by an IED in Afghanistan and his family from his base in Killen,Texas to Albuquerque,New Mexico, where we meet another volunteer to fly them on to Lake Havasu, Arizona.  The trip was to attend his sister's wedding, which was a real morale booster to aid in his recovery.  These locations are not served by commercial flights, so our help make the trip both possible time wise and economically feasible for them.  They were so grateful, and I cannot adequately express the feeling one gets from providing a little help to those who have already given so much in protecting us and our country.

I have had the previlege to fly some veterans in the past 6 months.  This flying helped them to reach various desinations to better their lifes.  This is a small appreciation to show for what they have given me and our freedom.

Veterans Airlift Command	33262	5	/users/profile/34078	michael18	Client Served	5	03/15/2010	I've known Walt Fricke for a long time now.  It seems we met at an Aleethia foundation dinner before they were called that.  I've shared the VAC with numerous vets and the experience is always great.  I can't imagine why a wounded service member would travel any other way.  The first time I flew in a VAC chartered aircraft was May of 2009.  Having been wounded three years prior I wasn't sure if I was a candidate, but Walt assured me that he had a ton of Marines who were looking for an excuse to fly a wounded Marine anywhere he wanted to go.  That's not to say they are not as excited to fly anyone, but if you are a Marine you know the special bond we share.  Semper Fi!  After that experience I became a big proponent of the VAC and I have witnessed first hand several missions which the VAC made extremely memorable.  One day I received a call from Walter Reed in regards to a retired Sgt. Major who had passed away.  I was on my way to a concert and six of this Marine's family member's needed flights back to North Carolina.  The VAC came through with flying colors!  I know the Sgt. Major's wife is extremely grateful for their help in time of grief and need.  I am extremely honored to be called friend by so many great Americans!
Veterans Airlift Command	33260	5	/users/profile/34075	thomas4	Client Served	5	03/15/2010	As a wounded veteran, I have had the opportunity to be served by the Veterans Airlift Command.  I am a below-knee amputee and twice, while I was recovering from my surgeries, I wanted to spend some time with my family.  They were not able to be here in San Antonio with me.  On one occasion, I was flown home for a long weekend.  The freedom to just show up at the aircraft with my wheelchair crutches and a bag was a great weight off of my shoulders.  The owner and his other pilot were beyond nice and I felt at home even though I was a guest their personal jet!  On the second occasion, I was recovering from another surgey and my wife had planned a trip to Disney World.  Once again, without a prosthesis, I worried how I would manage the kids, our stuff and myself through the TSA security maze and major airport crowds.  Again, the VAC stepped up, and flew me along with my family to Orlando and it made it so much easier.  Again, the Owner and his crew were as nice as could be and treated my family like they were one of their own.  My wife and children will remember that for a lifetime.The Veterans Airlift Command serves a great purpose.  The volunteers give of their time, money and property to enhance my lifa and those of my fellow servicemen.  Thanks to Walt Fricke and all of the great Americans that assist in his efforts!

We have always received outstanding support and the soldiers enjoy the flights almost as much as they like the recreation.  The pilots have been wonderful and they have alwasys treated our wounded with the great care and respect.  I give VAC a five star rateing without reservation.

My last mission was a bust because of a mechanical issue with the plane and I felt really badly for having let them down. This was on December 26 and involved flying up to Northern Arkansas to pick up a Vet and his wife and fly them to San Antonio.  They had originated in the morning near Chicago and were headed back to BAMC after a Christmas break.To make a long and somewhat technical story short, but mid morning, I realized the plane was never going to be able to make the trip and I called HQ to give them the bad news.They put out their equivalent of an APB and - incredibly - within 10 minutes had the leg covered!It is a complete testament to the organization, and the pilots that this type of quick reaction to a problem can be solved.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286425	3	/users/profile/376553	Elizabeth212,	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's a difficult to understand disasters and the aftermath.  We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.

I decided on Nechama since their message was clear - mucking and gutting homes/come one, come all.  After having served first as a day volunteer and then later as a residential, I couldn't be more pleased with my decision.  This organization works so smoothly from top to bottom that it makes things so very simple for all volunteers involved.  All anyone needs to do is show up with a good attitude, ready to go and they provide tools and leadership.  Without question, I look forward to working for and with them in the near and far future.  If you are looking for a group to volunteer with and/or support in any other way you see fit, I highly recommend this exceptional non profit.I'm trying really hard to find something to be critical of but I just can't.  What can I say...they really know what they're doing in this department and have everything covered.

I spent a week with them and my experience was awesome. The staff, team leaders, and my fellow volunteers were great and hard-working people.

Many friendships were made as we helped many families.I would do it again and only with Nechama.

I was very happy with my stay.   The organization was on the ground, set up with tools and actively welcoming volunteers very shortly after the disaster.  The staff was wonderful - they are passionate about what they do, very knowledgeable, and wonderful to be around.  I received a response within a few hours at the most from the time I applied or asked any follow-up questions.  In fact, I don't think I've experienced that good of a response time with any other organization I've ever volunteered with.  The work was well-organized and meaningful.  We did mostly muck and guts as well as debris removal, as would be standard after a flood.  We were provided with all the tools and safety equipment we needed, and our team leaders were a great resource.  The base we stayed at, in the basement of a church, was simple yet comfortable.  We had access to showers every day after work.  I had a great experience with NECHAMA from the minute I expressed interest in joining the project until my last day with the team.  We all worked hard, the atmosphere was friendly and fun, and I truly felt appreciated.  I would go back and volunteer with them in a heartbeat, and wholeheartedly recommend them.

I was very fortunate to find NECHAMA because they were very effective and efficient in their actions. The leaders of this organization certainly exemplify their mission, giving comfort and aid selflessly. They work very hard to walk the talk. The passion, spirit and dedication of the organization is giving flood victims a sense of hope in the aftermath of their tragedy.  Please contribute in some way to this organization.  It tore me up to have to leave and return to my other responsibilities, but I will return to these wonderful people and their effort.

Along with providing housing Nechama makes volunteering easy and cost effective.  Disasters are never good but Nechama has the people, tools and knowledge to make a difference in survivors lives.

I would say we were very fortunate  and grateful to have them here to help us in our time of need
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286395	2	/users/profile/376516	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2016	I have seen pictures and heard accounts of some of the places they helped with flood disasters. They seem well organized and they all seem to have a genuine desire to help these victims start the recovery. They are very hardworking. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286394	3	/users/profile/376515	Debbie196	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2016	This organization was beyond helpful and resourceful to my clients during an extremely difficult time in their lives .. They gave them hope and helped them to rebuild their homes and rebuild their lives.. Even in the dead of winter, with no heat source , volunteers worked tirelessly to assist my clients ... I can't say enough about this organization, their volunteers and their workers..
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286383	2	/users/profile/376501	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2016	A truly wonderful organization filled with dedicated hardworking people who care!  I'm blessed to have had the opportunity to work along side of them during a local disaster.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286355	2	/users/profile/376470	Jon_35	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2016	Having worked in the recovery process after Hurricane Sandy on Long Island, New York, I can say that NECHAMA is true to its cause, giving comfort and aid selflessly to those who are unable to help themselves. The passion, spirit and dedication of the organization certainly gives residents a sense of hope during recovery, while fulfilling their mission through deeds of loving kindness.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	280516	1	/users/profile/370411	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/18/2016	Such a great organization, really committed to helping those in need. They do wonderful work and create a great atmosphere for volunteers to be useful and make a difference. Thank you for the wonderful experience! 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286425	3	/users/profile/376553	Elizabeth212,	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's a difficult to understand disasters and the aftermath.  We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	280463	1	/users/profile/370348	Dee V.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2016	I volunteered with Nechama in St. Louis MO.  Dorothy was an amazing person continuing to get the work order through and made sure volunteers where having fun and feeling needed.  Cody who was a volunteer told many volunteers how to complete work at its finest.  Made sure everyone was safe and having a great time.  Even though I have worked with both Dorothy and Cody in the same program in the past it was great to see their dedication to help out communities that have been devastated by a natural disaster.  Nechama is a great organization and I will volunteer with them again soon!!   
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	279493		/users/profile/369545	Writer	Volunteer	4	02/09/2016	I volunteered with Nechama after the flooding in St Louis, MO. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Within just a few hours we cleaned out two basements and got to experience first hand the difference a small group of people can make given the experience and direction Nechama provides. They are a great organization and have done so much to help those that can no longer help themselves. Would highly recommend spending a day or two working with them. Everyone can do their part!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	279329		/users/profile/369415	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/08/2016	I recently worked with NECHAMA in St. Louis, MO and had a phenomenal experience. The staff was super friendly and helpful. NECHAMA  requested the help from an AmeriCorps NCCC team and we were sent out to help muck and gut homes for two weeks. Not only was I able to obtain valuable skills to use in the future, the staff always found a way to make the work enjoyable and meaningful. I would highly recommend anyone to work with this organization should they get the chance!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	279302		/users/profile/369378	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/08/2016	I worked with NECHAMA for two weeks in St. Louis, MO, and I have nothing but great things to say about that experience. From how well prepared they were for work and to host volunteers, to how attentive they were while explaining the work that needed to get done, they were fantastic. They made my teammates and I feel at home while working with them in St Louis, and the communication and flexibility from all parties made this a fantastic experience! Thanks Dorothy, Cody, and Ross, it was a pleasure working with you all!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	279281		/users/profile/369352	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/08/2016	I worked with NECHAMA for a little over two weeks in St. Louis after the New Years Floods and it was an absolutely incredible experience. The staff are dedicated to making it a great experience for all volunteers, always willing to teach new skills and appreciating the efforts of the group. I'm looking forward to another opportunity to volunteer with them again, and encourage anyone else to do so as well. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	278089		/users/profile/367970	emick2	Volunteer	5	01/27/2016	I can not say enough good things about NECHAMA. I worked with this organization in October 2014 and again in January 2015 in Detroit after the flooding in August 2014. The people that work for NECHAMA and the volunteers that I've worked with are deserving of so much love and respect. Because of my experience in Detroit, I have found my passion for disaster relief and recovery. I could not thank this organization enough for pushing me in the right direction and I would be so happy to volunteer with them again. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	272257		/users/profile/361266	jessbald1	Volunteer	5	11/17/2015	I volunteered with Nechama in June 2015 to respond to the flooding outside of Austin. They are extremely professional and knowledgeable. The respond to a disaster with so much expertise that it makes being a volunteer very enjoyable because you can see how much good they do. I cannot highly recommend working with Nechama enough. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	258657		/users/profile/347174	michelledesch	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	I first served with NECHAMA on the Itawamba tornado response in Mississippi while serving in AmeriCorps NCCC. They offered such a welcoming and supportive environment to not only the disaster survivors, but also the volunteers. They created an engaging and fun environment, while still making the importance of the work we were doing known. I'm so grateful to know a group of such kind and caring people who continue to motivate and inspire others to do good. My time with them has been some of the most meaningful experiences in my life and I look forward to continuing to serve with them on future responses. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	258377		/users/profile/346869	bwk726	Volunteer	5	09/19/2015	I first started serving with Nechama in 2012 on super-storm Sandy after my first service term with AmeriCorps NCCC. Since then I have been on 3  more disaster deployments 1 of which was with Nechama. I have worked in call centers, mucked and gutted homes, participated in rebuilding efforts, and done just about everything in between. No experience has ever been the same as the one that was offered by Nechama. I have never learned so much, in such a fun environment while working with such incredibly motivated leaders and volunteers. Not only am I thankful for the volunteering and learning opportunities that I have been given through this organization but I am  exceptionally grateful to have made some great friends along the way.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	258220		/users/profile/242579	TJV484	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	I have volunteered with Nechama and along side them and it has always been a meaningful experience. The first time was during Thanksgiving after Hurricane Sandy. They expertly walked the line of making my volunteer experience engaging and fun while still making it clear the importance of the work we were doing and how seriously they were taking it. They were well organized and dedicated to the job, and I walked away with a profound respect for what the Nechama staff is capable of accomplishing. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185611		/users/profile/242579	TJV484	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I decided to volunteer with NECHAMA after Hurricane Sandy hit NY and NJ. I had previously worked with AmeriCorps NCCC and it was through my friends in that organization that I discovered NECHAMA. They described it as a nonprofit that had great people with unimaginable work ethics, as I soon found out first hand. The staff and volunteers of NECHAMA went above and beyond to help victims whose lives had been altered with such gravity that when I went to my first site, I was able to tell who was the homeowner we were helping right away. The storm was written all over their face, but so was the look of unwavering gratitude towards the workers of NECHAMA who had been there day in and day out and who would continue to be there until the job was finished. The dedication of the staff and volunteers was an incredible thing to be a part of, even if it was for a short period of time. I was honored to work with them, and I hope I get to do so again.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	258170	1	/users/profile/242596	Samjanda	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	To preface this review, whatever I say here, would not be enough to even come close to describing how amazing NECHAMA is as an organization.  This disaster response group knows how to bring volunteers in and make them feel at home, teaching each volunteer everything they need to know about the project.  I've volunteered at about five different disasters with NECHAMA and each time, I have the best experience.  The work they do is positively uplifting and is all done with a purpose.  It is the most rewarding experience and NECHAMA's approach to helping out at disasters is second to none.  NECHAMA reaches out to anyone in need, with no discrimination, which is why I keep going back.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228878	1	/users/profile/242596	Samjanda	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have volunteered with NECHAMA several times over the past two years and each experience has been exceeding any  and all expectations. The organization is a well oiled machine when it comes to dealing with any disaster. They are organized, fun, willing to go to any length to help others and welcome all volunteers with open arms individually and as a whole. Each time I have volunteered they have provided me with housing, food, and enough work to make my time worth it and with the ability to see the impact made. I would quit my job and just tag along with this organization volunteering everywhere if money didn't rule the world. But alas, I would recommend this organization to anyone looking to volunteer and cannot wait for my next opportunity to serve with them.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185629		/users/profile/242596	Samjanda	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I just got off of serving 5 weeks with NECHAMA through AmeriCorps NCCC and couldn't have hoped for a better experience. The people of NECHAMA are the greatest and truly care about every volunteer as well as every person/family they provide services to. Even though they are a Jewish disaster group, they do not discriminate against anyone and they help anybody in need, no matter their denomination. I had the best experience and would work with them again in a heartbeat.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	257994		/users/profile/346477	Dorothy16	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	I have been serving along side Nechama for the past three years. Nechama is an amazing organization filled with caring, compassionate people with hearts of service! Their attention to detail and love for what they do not only shows in the way they interact with homeowners but assures a powerful volunteer experience! If you are looking to have a meaningful service experience full of hard work and passion this is your organization where you are sure to get things done while learning from some of the best!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	257993		/users/profile/346476	Hmlangdon	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	NECHAMA is amazing! I can't speak highly enough about the organization. I worked with them during a year of service, and those three weeks were my favorite part. I helped doing flood disaster relief. The intense impact made by NECHAMA in just a few short days was enough to bring anyone to tears, volunteers and homeowners alike. The team we worked with was phenomenal, helpful and guiding as my team learned to help out. It was a fun, incredible and impacting experience I'll never forget. NECHAMA not only helped the lives of others, but helped my world view change as well. Thanks for all you do, NECHAMA!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	242737	1	/users/profile/329256	Ryan V.	Volunteer	5	05/08/2015	When you think of disaster, planning, and subsequent rehabilitation efforts needed to aid a "disaster" affected community, more often than not we think of the disasters we hear and see on the news. But the smaller disasters which don't reach the front pages of news still require tender love and care of the affected communities. This is why I love Nechama, no matter how big or small a disaster, they are there to help the families, home owners, and communities who need it. I had the pleasure of working alongside Nechama in July 2014 during my service year as a corps member in AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps. We responded to a flood in Rock Rapids, Iowa. Mucking and gutting home in triple degrees weather did not phase anyone because the service we provided was needed and severely lacking. This is also why I spent the month of December volunteering with Nechama in Detroit providing flood relief and will continue to volunteer with Nechama in the future whenever I can. They care about the people who need aid, not about the number of homes or number of grant funding they can receive. No area is out of the question, no person too old or young to help or be helped. It has been an honor volunteering with Nechama and I wholeheartedly recommend volunteering with them to anyone who wants to give back to our wonderful world.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	242686		/users/profile/329229	Cvanbeek	General Member of the Public	5	05/08/2015	Nechama is amazing!  Last summer our community was hit by a devastating flood.  Homes and possessions were destroyed and hope was threatened! However, Nechama came into town and lead the way toward recovery! Their personnel, experience, knowledge, resources/equipment and most importantly desire to help people brought our community hope and inspiration.  Words can not adequately express my gratitude for Nechama but I will forever be thankful for the way they assisted our community in our time of need. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	242308	1	/users/profile/329070	Amber72	Volunteer	5	05/06/2015	Volunteering with Nechama has been a life changing experience! The staff on site will go over tools and safety guidelines and training! Everything about this non profit organization is tangible! i now know how to take down dry wall, dismantle heavy objects, gut walls and ceiling tiles, spot mold, sanitize work with other volunteers and work together as a team! I love this organization so much! This organization deserves a lifetime full of stars! 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	242306		/users/profile/329068	dvan	Volunteer	5	05/06/2015	Bill and Mark made it so easy to volunteer with Nechama.  I helped with the snow clearing after the blizzards in 2015.  They set clear expectations, gave us a mission and we were off!  All the people we helped were thrilled with the work and the professionalism of the organization.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	242302	1	/users/profile/329063	nicolynneko	Volunteer	5	05/06/2015	I first volunteered with Nechama in Long Island for Sandy response, and have since been on 2 other disaster responses with them. I have fallen in love entirely with Nechama. The people who work for Nechama are some of the most kindhearted and amazing people you could ever hope to meet. They all care so much, to the point where it becomes wildly contagious. If you are looking for an organization that gets you fired up about getting dirty and working hard for a great cause, you'll feel right at home. I could (and have) speak about how at home I feel with these people, and how indescribably wonderful everything about Nechama is for hours. These people are my second family, and I cannot wait to do it all over again soon.

Nechama showed my team the ropes in those basements and guided is through a successful disaster project. They were professional, courteous, thorough and a lot of fun to be around. I would happily work with this organization again, and look forward to seeing them in the future.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	232684		/users/profile/296241	Harold Steinberg	Volunteer	5	11/02/2014	Margie and I joined the NECHAMA disaster relief effort in Livonia, AR earlier this year following a devastating tornado.  It was our first experience with a hands-on disaster relief effort.  We were so very impressed with Dan and Mark that want to create a group who will be ready to respond to a NECHAMA led effort in the Mid-South.  For those in the Memphis area, please come by Temple Israel on Sunday, December 7, 2014.  We will have an information and sign-up table there between 8:30AM - 1:30PM.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	230159	1	/users/profile/293815	Sarah217	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I am an AmeriCorps NCCC team leader and I had the opportunity to serve alongside NECHAMA during the Detroit Flooding of 2014. We were mucking and gutting homes, which I had never done. The people of NECHAMA were the most helpful and positive people I have ever served with. They were extremely knowledgeable and willing to let everyone learn on their own. They made my time in Detroit fun and meaningful. If you ever have the chance to serve alongside any of the NECHAMA staff or volunteers I highly suggest you do so.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228939		/users/profile/292614	larzelere	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	Dan and Mark are truly making a difference in the world. In environments of tremendous hardship and tragedy they make helping out a fun and meaningful experience. I can't wait to link up with them again in the near future to continue assisting the less fortunate.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228733		/users/profile/292411	Holly58	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I worked with NECHAMA in January of 2014 to assist with Superstorm Sandy disaster relief in New York. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with them and gained a lot from the experience. The days were well planned and organized and we were able to get a lot of things done in a short amount of time. I felt that I was able to build friendships with the staff as well as the homeowners that we interacted with and this is an aspect of service that is unique or hard to come by. Overall, NECHAMA works as a very efficient organization and has projects that every volunteer can contribute to.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228472		/users/profile/292160	ZS11	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I spent about 7 months with Nechama in NY working on their Hurricane Sandy recovery project. Never in my life have I met a harder working, more passionate group of people. The staff and volunteers at Nechama genuinely love the work they do and the impact they have on the communities they serve goes way beyond the countless physical hours they put in. If you are looking for a well organized, efficient and inspiring nonprofit to volunteer with I highly recommend Nechama. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228410	2	/users/profile/292101	mlroth111	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	My family and I traveled from Chicago to NY to help NECHAMA repair homes damaged by Hurricane Sandy.  We stayed with NECHAMA's tireless volunteers in an old Army Barracks, shared meals, and worked along side them each day cleaning, repairing, sanding and painting various homes.  These folks were so well organized, worked extremely hard, all living on a food budget of several dollars a day (the power of group grocery shopping and cooking).  We were inspired by their positive spirit, enduring work ethic, tradesman like expertise, and incredible efficiencies.  We received far more via learning and inspiration than we gave in labor and dollars.  It was truly one of the most rewarding experiences of our collective lives.  Thanks NECHAMA!  The Roth Family  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	228352		/users/profile/292046	nick49	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I volunteered with them over a couple of days in Southern Indiana.  They are very organized and easy to get along with.  Overall it was a good experience.

In Seprember 2014, we assisted resident senior citizen in Oak Park, MI to make sure her basement was cleared out. They have a great group that really came in and got the work done. I would work with them again in the future. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	225060		/users/profile/288834	nanfit	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	I met Nechama the summer of 2014 when they came to oak park Michigan like angels to assist our community with horrible home flooding damages. I volunteered 2 times and was in awe of their can do energy, kindness and philosophy of helping to repair the world.  I cannot praise them high enough and the recipients of their help were in awe and ever so grateful As Nechama volunteers  went house to house tearing out moldy basement walls and sanitizing the damaged properties. Nechama is a gem and deserves your support!  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	225008		/users/profile/288779	johnsedor	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	My first time volunteering was in the Detroit crisis! NECHAMA staff were well organized, welcomed me, provided all the equipment and protective gear needed for the job. Our team of about 8-10 worked well together. When there was a question or assistance needed all I had to do was ask, and someone pitched right in to get the job done. "Doing good, getting dirty" was a day well spent with this top-notch organization! JS
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286425	3	/users/profile/376553	Elizabeth212,	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's a difficult to understand disasters and the aftermath.  We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	225006		/users/profile/288777	royal_azure414	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	NECHAMA is awesome. It was a great pleasure working with the volunteers. they are all pleasant and knowledgeable of what to do to assist in helping victims of disaster look forward to quick recovery. I will definitely volunteer with NECHAMA again.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	224972		/users/profile/288742	s.opperer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	A year ago, I wanted to donate  money (for a bad midwest town, hit by a tornado).   When I looked on my computer, I saw the Nechama agency.  This September (2014), I received an Email (about helping, at the Detroit area, following the August flash floods), I retired two years ago (from 38 years with Mich Social Services) and had been a Red Cross disaster volunteer (for over ten years). I thought, this would be a different way, to express my Jewish feelings (about repairing the world-tekun olam).   I have averaged two days, per week (this October) and plan, to finish out, until Oct 31 (when the Americorp volunteers and Nechama, go to other disaster sites).  I'm 68, but have tried to keep up and assist the team (in cleaning out the previously flooded basements and tearing out carpeting and paneling sections).  I have truly had several, good, physical workouts and have indeed become, quite  dirty, yet have found my body energized and my heart very tranquil. Not only, have I experienced a very basic, quantifiable definition, of   helping others truly 'dig out' of a rough spot.  I have had the extreme pleasure and honor, of working, among young, intelligent, dedicated, hard-working, young adults. Not only, have they renewed my faith (in the 'younger generation'), but, I have experienced a very well coordinated agency  (Nechama).   I cannot, easily leave the Detroit area (to chase after other disasters), but I can and will track, the blessed works, of Nechama. I will also plan, to send in donations.  Most people think, that heroes fly around in capes, drive in Bat Mobiles, and have have super powers. But (truth be told); sometimes, heroes come to help (dressed, in overalls, helpmeets, work gloves, boots, air filter masks, and dedication.  Dan and Rachel (the Nechama coordinator and team leader), were kind, patient, tireless, and were 'on top of their games and projects. If they have to come back here (for some other disaster),  If I have the time and energy; I'll be their. Outstanding group.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	216392		/users/profile/279878	Shosh	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	NECHAMA is amazing.  I spent a day volunteering with them and was so impressed by their staff, and their willingness to help others.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	216372		/users/profile/21238	Phil123	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I have volunteered with Nechama for several years.  Recently, it was very personal, as I helped to clean up flood damage on the block that I lived on, in a city where I used to live.  Nechama's willingness to travel to disaster sites, and ability to engage local volunteers is a strength of the organization, along with the dedication of key leaders and volunteers.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	20070	4	/users/profile/21238	Phil123	Volunteer	4	10/27/2009	Nechama provided me with an opportunity to help victims in a 'hands-on' manner and to develop my skills as a volunteer.

The days were very well organized, my time was well spent, I got to know the people's houses we were working on, and I learned a ton!!!  I really appreciated the flexibility that the organization had - you could stay for one day or multiple months.  I'll definitely be working with this organization again, and highly recommend it for others!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	188273		/users/profile/245603	nicolek	Volunteer	5	11/10/2013	I first worked with NECHAMA in January 2007 as part of their relief efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. My most recent experience with NECHAMA was in July 2013 when I brought out a group to assist with their efforts on Long Island after Hurricane Sandy. Both times I found the process (from initial sign-up through the actual volunteer date(s)) to be very well organized and the staff to be extremely well trained and knowledgeable. The staff is able to work very quickly to get a group of virtually inexperienced volunteers up to speed about the task at hand. Because of the staff's great guidance, the volunteers feel very accomplished at the end of the day. I am looking forward to volunteering with NECHAMA again! 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	187619		/users/profile/244649	smwrld	Volunteer	5	11/02/2013	the heartaches of 2012 left me desperate to do something valuable. maybe because the worst ones shared my name, Sandy. As I searched for affordable volunteering, looking as far as Guatemala, I realized my childhood home was a 5 hour drive away. My connection last Feb with NECHAMA in Bayshore was one of the most rewarding weeks I have spent in a decade.  The physical and emotional work was equally balanced by support and comradery (and humor) from the volunteers (there for months) and staff. I was heartbroken leaving with so much to be done and knowing I was only one of many volunteers who would become a part,  of the NECHAMA family.I am looking forward to joining them in rebuilding on Long Island this Winter.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	187019		/users/profile/145314	ajbredeson	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	My favorite part about working with Nechama is that Nechama doesn't sit around. Nechama gets to work. I've worked with Nechama three different times since 2010, in Nashville, Milwaukee, and New York. It can be so frustrating waiting on responses from the public sector. It can be discouraging that the private sector ignores those who cannot afford to help themselves in the aftermath of disasters. It is inspiring that Nechama continually responds quickly and efficiently to natural disasters. It is a testament to this great organization that Nechama continues to bring in energetic, willing volunteers, and especially that it has so many return volunteers. Nechama is a reason to be optimistic about our society, as it shines in even the worst of situations. I am proud to have several memories of working with Nechama, and I know I will form more in the years to come.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107312		/users/profile/145314	ajbredeson	Volunteer	5	02/29/2012	Working as Team Leader with AmeriCorps NCCC, I received 24 hour's notice that my team would be heading to Nashville, TN to help with flood recovery efforts. Initial information from AmeriCorps was minimal, so we didn't really know what to expect. About 48 hours after arriving in Nashville, it was clear my team and I were in for a life-changing experience. Our time in Nashville was, indeed, life-changing, and this is mostly if not entirely because of Nechama - Jewish Response to Disaster.  We had the privilege of working with Dan Hoeft, a couple other staff members, and several Nechama volunteers. In an organized fashion, Nechama brought swift action in the form of direct service to people whose homes had been severely damaged by the floods. Nechama was all about doing the work that needed to be done. We worked long hours and worked incredibly hard, led by Dan and the Nechama crew. In one month we mucked and gutted a few dozen homes, and provided support to a few dozen individuals and families that were in crisis. My time with Nechama helped propel my into a career in human services non-profits. Nechama changed my life as I watched it change the lives of so many others. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	186463		/users/profile/243471	n-squared	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have been privileged to work as a volunteer with Nechama on Long Island for the post-Sandy recovery and rebuild. The staff and Field Team Leaders make up an incredibly compassionate and skilled group of people who are dedicated to bringing relief to those who need it most. Following the storm, many of us on Long Island - and across the country - felt a need to do something ... to help. Nechama provided the leadership, expertise and resources, helping families get back into their homes and resume their lives. It's very rewarding as a volunteer, but more important it's a wonderful service for the community. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with Nechama.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	186386		/users/profile/243392	Old Guy	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I am a 72 year old multi- return volunteer.  I am also used to working with all age group people to accomplish tasks.  The Nechama model allows rapid integration of volunteers and maximizes their time on site.  The jobs are scoped out in advance, materials and tools are always available and they take advantage of the skill level and expertise you already have. There is a great degree of comfort in knowing working conditions are safe, well monitored and food and housing are more than adequate. On a more personal level, it has been great meeting, interacting, and helping in the lives of those affected by disaster.   This is not only victims but volunteers.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	186166		/users/profile/243147	steelcity	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I volunteered with Nechama in Moore OK and also in Lyons CO. They are an incredible group to work with. The staff is very professional and fun to work with in challenging environments. They show up to help immediately after disaster strikes and add tremendous value to the clients the moment they arrive on the scene. I look forward to volunteering with Nechama again in the future.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185893		/users/profile/242865	jcmo	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I have volunteered three different times with NECHAMA doing Hurricane Sandy disaster response work. I have worked with other disaster relief groups, but NECHAMA is by far the most organized and equipped to deliver the relief these clients urgently need. I like the way they scope our the work at the job sites and have the necessary materials and plans ready to hit the job running. Their team leaders treat each client with dignity, respect, and warmth. NECHAMA recruits a wide range of ages, religions, and skills in the volunteers, but they consistently deliver outstanding results by training and motivating the crews.  I plan to volunteer more with NECHAMA. regards,John
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185869		/users/profile/242840	pattyappleseed	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Big cheers to Nechama! They do amazing work, have an awesome staff, and really do good work for people who need it the most. I spent over a month with them in Lyons, CO after the flooding and it was one of the most rewarding months of my life. And they make it fun to work. I noticed all the volunteers coming back day after day, they felt the same way I did I guess. And look at the reviews. 93 of them, with a 5 star average. That is amazing! Thank you Nechama, and thanks to all of you volunteers who make it possible for Nechama to continue the service that they do.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185766		/users/profile/242733	jinglestelf	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I have volunteered with Nechama twice this year, once in April and once in August. Both times were on Long Island helping Sandy victims. This organization does a great job of giving people back their lives. They also do a fantastic job of taking absolute strangers (people who volunteer) who may or may not know anything about rehabbing and turn them into a cohesive, productive team. I knew nothing when I went, now I can install insulation, hang dry wall, make mud and apply it, sand and paint, and the biggest thrill of all, I used a sawzall. I have met awesome people both staff and volunteers and I had a great time too. I will continue to support this organization. I plan to go back next year....where ever they need me.

NECHAMA is an organization that is accepting of everyone and is really there to do good for others with no agenda. Anyone who has the chance to work with them should take it. Seeing this organization grow in scope will be amazing as they will be able to help more people. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	185676		/users/profile/242646	sterf	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I volunteered with Nechama during Christmas break from an AmeriCorps program. It was absolutely the best use of my vacation. Nechama provided food an lodging for volunteers which made it possible to volunteer for more than one day. I gutted houses, scraped tile off of floors, hauled branches. I met some amazing people, volunteers and homeowners. The homeowners were so appreciative of the work Nechama has done to help them recover from Hurricane Sandy. I was an great experience all around and I have been itchy to get involved again.

The team was well organized, planning everything the night before, having the supplies and equipment ready, and mixing abilities to make sure things were done well.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to work with other volunteers across age and skill levels.  We had a team of high school students on their vacation working with us, and I know they learned a lot.  The field leaders for Nechama were great at mixing practicality and humor to make it a worth while experience.  I am already trying to find another opportunity in my schedule to join them again.

I have never felt more like I was doing something good for the world than when I was working with them. Though I was only 19 when I worked with them, it was by far the most eye opening experience of my life. It wasn't just that we were helping people pick up their lives after a tragic experience. My time with Nechama woke a part of me up I didn't know existed before. I felt more like myself in the month I was with them than I ever had before in my life.  Through the rest of my life, I will always look back on my time with Nechama with affection. It will serve as a constant reminder of what kindhearted, driven people can accomplish when they decide to work together. It will also serve as a constant reminder of what I can do. So much of what we accomplish in life is dependent on what we think we can accomplish. I will always be grateful the Nechama for reminding me that I can do more than I think I can.

They were a self-contained mobile rescue operation with all the tools, expertise and leaders to guide our volunteers in the clean-up effort. The Nechama folks are great, caring people.  A testament to their loyalty are those who come back and volunteer in other areas just to work with the folks from Nechama.  You know you're going to have a good volunteer experience in a difficult situation with these trusted leaders.  I would work with them again and have referred friends to them throughout the country.  They serve a very worthwhile, non-denominational service.

I spent time doing search and rescue, as well as relief, it was a life changing experience and I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that Nechama provided to me.  The service they provide is paramount and I hope that the organization continues to flourish.  I am proud to have been a part of such an amazing organization.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107416		/users/profile/145461	Chris Quaka	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2012	I worked with NECHAMA during the TN Spring floods of 2010.  They trained and provided leadership to over 80 AmeriCorps members from across the country.  As the federal disaster coordinator directing these crews, I was constantly impressed with NECHAMA's want to serve the community.  NECHAMA consistently followed through on committments to train, educate, lead, direct, and support volunteers in the field.  Their focus on serving all residents in affected communities was always central to their work.  Their coordination with other agencies and the quality of services they provided were second to none.  Before I met Dan and NECHAMA I worked on the ground for 6 months post Hurricane Katrina, 2 months post Hurricane Ike and managed thousands of AmeriCorps teams on disaster from base for 5 years.  The services NECHAMA provides are second to none.  If you have the chance to work with them...do not pass it up!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286425	3	/users/profile/376553	Elizabeth212,	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's a difficult to understand disasters and the aftermath.  We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107357		/users/profile/145367	Gene B.	Board Member	5	02/29/2012	I have had the great fortune of volunteering with NECHAMA for 15 years.  While I am the Board (though I swore that I would never attend another meeting after I retired) my real passion is working as a volunteer in the field after the disaster.  This is where I meet and work with some of the greatest people in the world -- both the other volunteers and our clients, the disaster victims.  NECHAMA has built it's reputation based on the simple principle of "how can we continue to provide better service to our clients ..... those who have lost so much, so suddenly.  The staff, though incredibly small in number, are among the most dedicated and compassionate people I have known.  I can not count how many times I have heard a spontaneous comment from a volunteer say, "This has been a life changing experience.  I certainly has for me!!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107310		/users/profile/145311	doracyts	Volunteer	5	02/29/2012	I really like that i can work with my family with NECHAMA.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107308		/users/profile/145309	Drew2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/29/2012	I serve as the Assistant Director for The Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services of Minnesota & North Dakota. I can say without a doubt, that the work of Nechama is nothing less than outstanding. You wouldn't know that they are a small agency with few resources, because they travel the entire country bringing relief and hope to those communities in need. I am proud of the work they do. Collaborating together, Nechama, The Salvation Army, and our other VOAD partners are able to solve complex problems to unforeseen challenges. When they are not responding to disasters, they are actively involved in training and other preparedness related activities with their government and non-government partners. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107304		/users/profile/145305	Lori Jargo	Volunteer	5	02/29/2012	I had the privilege of working with NECHAMA in the spring of 2010 when flood waters ravaged Rhode Island. The entire organization, from the top down, is wonderful, but the real stars are the crews in the field. Dan Hoeft and Seth Gardner were the crew chiefs during NECHAMA's deployment in RI. First of all, these guys really know their stuff when it comes to the mechanics and logistics of flood remediation. As a bonus, Dan and Seth also have fantastic people skills. It was clear from the first day that Dan and Seth cared deeply for both the flood victims AND the volunteers who turned out to help. Many times I observed Dan quietly reassuring flood victims, some of whom were having their entire lives carted out to the curb. As far as possible, the job was never done at the expense of a client's emotional well-being. Volunteers worked hard but nobody got hurt. We were encouraged to try out new tools and new skills. I found that I have a natural affinity for swinging a sledgehammer. One of Dan's greatest assets is his sense of humor. It was an emotional time but our ability to laugh at ourselves (and not at others) helped make the experience great. It was an honor to work with Dan, Seth, the volunteer crew (Chad and Dave) from Minnesota, and the entire NECHAMA organization. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107200	1	/users/profile/145152	DaveC	Volunteer	5	02/28/2012	I enjoy working with NECHAMA because I feel fulfilled with the kind of work that we do.  I enjoy working with the equipment, the staff, volunteers but mostly, helping those who are in need.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107181		/users/profile/145106	Seth G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2012	I first came to NECHAMA as an unwilling volunteer at the age of 16.  Packed off on a deployment to St. Peter, MN in 1998, I actually had a horrible time.  But some part of me must of loved it, because all through college I came back and back again.  After college, I went to work for the organization and spent 5 years with them.  I've now engaged with NECHAMA as a volunteer, an employee, a donor, and now as a partner in the field of disaster response/emergency management and there are few organizations that make such an impact.  Foremost in my mind is NECHAMA's focus on the mission:  providing comfort to disaster survivors.  They have been flexible in the field, always pivoting to meet the needs they see.  They have been a critical part of disaster response in the upper midwest, and a key partner to the other organizations and government agencies they have worked with.  And finally, for me, they were a critical connection to a Judaism that I hadn't mattered to me before I worked with them.  Today, I am a disaster response/emergency management professional and a Jew because of NECHAMA.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107157		/users/profile/145068	Chad O.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2012	I have volunteered with NECHAMA on multiple occasions and have found the experience rewarding each and every time. Knowing almost nothing about emergency management and even less about cleaning up following floods or tornadoes, NECHAMA offered me the chance to travel with them and they taught me what I needed to know as we progressed through the cleanup process. Everything was done with safety in mind and most importantly, was done to assist the homeowners with nothing expected in return. After a short time, NECHAMA had me leading teams  of volunteers in these efforts as I had gained enough knowledge to become a leader in the process. This organization is built solely on giving back to those most in need and is one that excels at doing just that. I have become a professional in this field since my time volunteering there thanks to their efforts.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107156		/users/profile/145067	Holly10	Client Served	5	02/27/2012	NECHAMA helped our non-profit when our area was hit by a severe tornado-like storm.  We called and they were there at dawn with chainsaws and skilled volunteers, clearing our road and helping us put our facility back in working order so we could open the doors to our clients.  They are well-organized and easy to work with.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107149		/users/profile/145058	smgearhart	Volunteer	5	02/27/2012	Stayed/Worked with them during the Nashville flood cleanup of 2010.   The job included standard flood cleanup jobs.  Gut, remove debris, sanitize. Nechama was easier to work with than most other groups I've worked with.  Great bunch of people, knew their stuff, and had the tools to get the job done.  I guess their biggest weakness is the lack of manpower.  Disaster relief is expensive, so they relied heavily on volunteers for their labor force.  However, even when the work force wasn't there, they got the job done.  I was working with 3 other people on a job site of clearing a basement.  We were exhausted and just wanted the day to be over.  Not one of us quit until that basement was cleared out (the moldy insulation was already effecting the homeowner).  Another point that I really liked about Nechama was that they did not push their religion onto me as so many other religious groups tend to do.  I'm Catholic, they are Jewish based, it didn't matter at all and I actually learned a lot about Judaism over those three weeks.  One more point that always stands out after these trips are the amount of thank you's that you receive from people.  Nechama is helping the elderly and the poor move on from an extremely traumatic experience.  Without Nechama, they would likely be in the same positions a year later, with no way of cleaning out their house on their own.  These people have fallen through the cracks of society's safety net, and Nechama was there to catch them.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107123		/users/profile/145010	ettaz	Client Served	5	02/26/2012	NECHAMA is one of the world's best kept secrets that should get out.  As victims of the RI floods of 2010, we were,for the first time in our lives, on the receiving, instead of the giving, end of disaster relief.  To say we were overwhelmed and shocked with the 12" of water that kept seeping into our finished basement, as a result of the freak flood, is putting it mildly.  Along came Dan Hoeft and his crew, who knew just what to do and came prepared with every pump, tool, and even cleaning supplies to get us on the road to recovery.  They worked tirelessly for two days at my house and came back the next day and helped my neighbor.  I praise their skill, compassion, and advice and am so thankful for their help.  What a smooth non-profit organization they are!

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107112	2	/users/profile/144984	Howard5	Volunteer	5	02/26/2012	I first met NECHAMA: The Jewish Response to Disaster in September 2005 immediately after Hurricane Katrina decimated the Mississippi Gulf Coast and, by overwhelming the poorly constructed levees, New Orleans.  I was serving as lead staff for the United Jewish Communities (now Jewish Federations of North America) Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Mitigation Committee.  In that role, I was responsible to help coordinate the resources of all Jewish non-profit organizations as the Jewish community responded with money and hands-on resources to the immediate and long-tern needs of victims in the disaster zones and in evacuee host communities.  NECHAMA immediately deployed two full trucks/teams to the outskirts of New Orleans and UJC helped support its efforts with several grants.  NECHAMA drew hundreds/perhaps thousands of volunteers to its work sites over an extended stay in the region and helped gutt and prepare for rebuilding hundreds of homes in the region.  In August 2006, my wife and two sons joined me for a week's deployment with NECHAMA where we worked alogside volunteers from several states in three different homes that week.  In one case, the homeowner, an African American lay church leader, told us that in the entire year since Katrina hit, the only people who reached out to help him clean his home were the volunteers provided by NECHAMA.  In subsequent years, I spent some time visiting work crews deployed in Atlanta and helped facilitate arrangements for NECHAMA deployments in upstate New York and Nashville.  This is an organization which, with very limited financial and human resources, provides immeasurable benefits to victims in their darkest moments after a disaster strikes. Its volunteer and professional leadership is selfless and totally committed to the Jewish tradition of "Tikkun Olam", healing the world.  In light of all the good it has done and continues to do, NECHAMA should be recognized for its efforts as a world-class volunteer, non-government organization.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107064		/users/profile/144910	majordkh	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/24/2012	I have worked with NECHAMA on several occasions over the past 4 or 5 years and find them to be top notch in disaster response. I have come to rely on them as a primary partner in every disaster I have managed. Keep up the great work and I look forward to working with you again in 2012 and many years beyond. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107057		/users/profile/144900	Noah H.	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	A couple years back I got the opportunity to work with NECHAMA when they came to Fargo/Moorhead to help with the rising waters. My uncle Dan and his team had come to visit my sister and I the night before, and had asked if I wanted to help them out. I had said yes. We went fix up the basement of a house, cleaning and reattaching  pipes and putting in new sheet rock and such. The way that the workers handled the volunteers was incredible, they knew the answers to all the questions and not one body was simply standing around. They had all the equipment that they needed to keep volunteers safe as well as working. If someone didn't know how to do something they'd simply show them and move on to do other things. The whole experience was incredible. It is a great thing that they do.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107052		/users/profile/144894	tunguskaenigma	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	     I was fortunate enough to work with Nechama also, while in Nashville to help with the floods as an AmeriCorps NCCC member. During that time, I got to work closely with Dan. He treated all the home owners in need with great respect, and he made sure the group I was with, knew exactly what we were doing. Once we got the skills down, we were even given one of the trailers to break off on our own, to further help the Nashville community since he felt so comfortable with our groups work ethics to entrust us with his organization supplies until our project came to an end. Dan was a friendly, caring, dedicated and humorous guy who made working with Nechama a true pleasure
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107050		/users/profile/144893	John56	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	I was allowed to pleasure of working with Dan and Nechama in Nashville Tennessee right after the floods in 2010.  I was a Corps member in Americorps NCCC, and Nechama proved to be the absolute best organization I worked with.  Unlike many other non profits I worked with, Nechama was very quick about getting things done in the field.  They don't waste any time; they identify the problem and do what they can to fix it.  They also recognize when someone is able to accept responsibilities and delegate work to become more efficient, and in turn help more people.  I was one of the many who was trusted to take on more responsibilities, assessing homes and leading crews of volunteers to help the victims of the flood.  As bad as disasters can be, Nechama are the BEST at helping people move forward.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107049		/users/profile/144892	Robert32	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	Nechama is the best in the country at flood recovery!

Keep up the awesome work and I look forward to working with Nechama at the next available oppurtunity.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107038		/users/profile/144870	Mary67	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	I worked with Nechama as a member of AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps in the towns of Hammond, Oronoco, and Zumbrota Minnesota. It is this organization that inspired me to not only finish a Master's degree in Nursing but to pursue a career doing International Disaster Relief. I have NEVER worked with a better organization. It may seem like an exaggeration, but it's very true. The communities that we worked in where in desperate need and Nechama was there from the moment the flood water receded. The people in the community knew our supervisors by name, because they had gone in and talked to everyone about their needs and fears... they had listened to the stories about what had happened. I am so glad for the time that I was able to work Nechama... I would do it again in a heartbeat.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107037		/users/profile/144867	adinab	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	Before volunteering with Nechama, I had no idea what disaster relief was all about.  There is no way to understand the complexities of demolition and repair after natural disasters without caring and dedicated guidance.  The individual attention and care each volunteer receives from the staff at Nechama illustrates their incredible passion for their work.  After the staff showed the volunteers how to utilize the tools properly, they had confidence and trust in us to work independently.  It is because of my service mission to Birmingham, AL that I was so inspired to continue working with Nechama in New Jersey after Hurricane Irene.  Keep up the great work Nechama, and continue inspiring us all!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	107023		/users/profile/144849	shimon i	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	Last May I had the privelege to work for Nechama in Birmingham, Alabama. We aided tornado victims whose homes had been ruined and we helped get them started on the rebuilding process. On this trip, I got to see what a difference Nechama makes on people's lives, and how when Nechama helps someone they do so with care and sensitivity. But like many acts of kindness, often the largest beneficiary is the one who is giving, and this is no exception. Nechama helps both victims of disaster, and those who volunteer to help victims of disaster. This is why they are such a significant organization.

I watch their website and keep up with their deployments because it is fascinating to see how hard they work.  I've been to their office/warehouse and found it very interesting - the equipment is fascinatina and when I met some of the board members and saw how committed they are I could see what a wonderful organization this is.  They get nothing in return but the wonderful feeling of helping others.

Our group's experience with Nechama was truly inspirational.  We learned how to work as a team to help people we never met before in our lives.  We learned that good people and good hearts who are willing to work hard could touch those who have suffered and make a difference in their lives. Thank you Nechama and may you continue to have success in your future selfless endeavors.

Even if they spend a week on just one house, to Nechama, each and every person matters. I trust Nechama and would volunteer for them again in a heartbeat!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106960		/users/profile/144736	Laura Kate L.	Client Served	5	02/23/2012	Last April, we were out of town when we received a phone call asking if we were ok. A tornado had gone through our back yard and we didn't know if we had anything left.  It wasn't until the next morning that I got home to see that our house was still standing, although very difficult to see under all the fallen trees. The tornado had picked up the woods at the back of our yard and dropped them on our house and our yard had disappeared under the tangled pile of fallen trees that was taller than our house. A few days later, the people from Nechama came knocking on our door, asking if they could help. They spent several days working in less than ideal conditions. While it was warm when the tornado came through, the typical Wisconsin weather returned and they worked through the cold and snow to clear our yard and our house of debris. Without their help, I don't know how long it would have taken us to get everything back to normal. This organization did so much for us and for our neighborhood in the weeks after the tornado. I can't begin to describe how wonderful they were for all of us!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106957		/users/profile/144732	imagoodboy	Volunteer	5	02/23/2012	Ever since I found out about  NECHAMA at an open house three years ago, I have been hooked.  I have had the opportunity to volunteer with NECHAMA both in Eden Prairie and out on deployments.  At first I saw an opportunity to work on all the cool stuff in the trailers.  On my trip to Nashville I found myself completely removed from "my normal", helping people that if not for NECHAMA, most likely would not have had any help.  One day. we where cleaning out a house for an elderly man, in a neighborhood of small simple houses,  It seemed to me, that this elderly man did not have much in a neighborhood of people without much.  By the time we showed up the house was empty of its contents but for pictures of his granddaughter.  He was so proud of her and her military accomplishments. That seemed to be his most valuable possession, a picture of his granddaughter I experienced from this man such deep appreciation that someone, not only from outside his neighborhood, but "Jews" where here to help him.  I felt that the help we brought was something he never would have expected in a million years.   I felt his appreciation and thanks in my sole.  That one encounter was all I needed to do more.  Now, any time someone thanks me for the work I do with NECHAMA, my eyes tear up.  I don't get it.  Thank you NECHAMA for giving me the opportunity to help others for no other reason than they need help and if we don't help, who will?.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106956		/users/profile/144731	Aliza A.	Volunteer	5	02/23/2012	I have been volunteering with Nechama since 2006. The first time I volunteered with them was in New Orleans, since then I've worked with Nechama in Birmingham AL and Bergen County NJ.  Every time we work together it's an incredibly rewarding experience. Their staff is so dedicated to making sure the volunteers have a safe and meaningful experience and that the homeowners are treated with respect and care. When I was with Nechama in Birmingham in June 2011, our bus driver was so inspired by the work we were doing with Nechama, he rolled up his sleeves and volunteered with us, he even committed to bringing his church down to help out.  Working with Nechama has truly changed my life as well as the lives of all of the Yeshiva University students I've brought along with me to volunteer. They are truly making a difference in the Jewish community and in the disaster relief community. I hope there won't be a need for disaster relief work in the future but if there is the first people I would call would be Nechama.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106951		/users/profile/144720	Kristen Vetter	Volunteer	5	02/23/2012	2009 was a very stressful year for Linton, ND.  Our flood devastated many many homes in our county.  It was the perfect storm in which 3 cricks thawed on one day after a Thunderstorm in March. This was followed by 22 inches of snow in a 48 hour period.  The word spread about our situation and Nechama was the first to come. We established trust within hours of their arrival. They followed through with what they said and did the right thing time and again.  The first week they helped organize living quarters for volunteers to come in and clean flooded homes and farms.  They attended leadership meetings and offered support.  They treated us as if we were their own.   Individual home owners still ask how 'Dan' is!  We still feel their shield of peace and strength even though it has been 3 years and miles between.  With their help we rose to the occasion and came out stronger!  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106939		/users/profile/144680	philly923	Volunteer	5	02/22/2012	A couple of years ago I found myself unemployed and trying to fill time between resumes and job applications- when I heard that Rhode Island had gone through record-breaking severe flooding...knowing I was only a road-trip away, I wondered how I could help. Through the power of the internet, I came upon Nechama, and was inspired by their mission and personal stories. It didn't take long to see and feel the tremendous passion that their staff put into their work, and how quickly I felt at home with their team. I have shared with friends and family my experience, and truly feel grateful for the incredible opportunity they gave me, by allowing me to give of my time, my labor, and my heart during a community's time of need. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106930		/users/profile/144654	BetteB	Volunteer	5	02/22/2012	While I came through Hurricane Irene unscathed, many other people in Bergen County, NJ, where I live, weren't so lucky.  Nechama gave me the opportunity to help my neighbors with thorough, professional, individualized, and compassionate clean up of wind and water damage.  Nechama's tireless staff models the organization's mission "to do good getting dirty."  I am honored that Nechama let me help; trained me to safely use all kinds of tools; reminded me that misfortune knows no race, creed, or color; and now calls me a friend.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106906		/users/profile/20842	Tikvah	Board Member	5	02/22/2012	An amazing organization that takes the eternal values of the Jewish tradition as learned through our texts and applies them directly with our hands and feet!  This is an important way to make the world a better place especially when people are in the midst of the challenge of recovery than to be present to them through the work of NECHAMA!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	19640	12	/users/profile/20842	Tikvah	Board Member	5	10/25/2009	Recently I joined Nechema on their deployment in the Atlanta, Georgia area following the flash floods that occurred there in early October.  The day began with helping to do the final spray washing and sterilizing of a home that had already been cleared.  It was hard and at times, messy work, but everyone pitched in and did whatever was needed.  While there, a man approached us to ask if we could possibly help his neighbor.   The operations manager, who was very welcoming and easy going, explained the procedure.   A short time later, the neighbor came and we began to clean out his house.   Along the way, we removed soggy walls, insulation and contents that had not yet been cleared out.  On the lawn were still many personal belongings.  As we carefully picked them up, we would check with the owner to ask if he wanted to keep them.   It was clearly a difficult process for this gentleman.  As the day wore on and his home was slowly gutted, it was possible to see a small flicker of hope in the midst of his shock.   It was amazing to be with Nechama, a group of volunteers ready to assist in helping people find their way to recovery.  With all the work being done at no charge and all by volunteers, the sense of Tikun was not only real in the physical transformation of the homes, but also in the personal sense both for the victims and for the volunteers.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106905		/users/profile/144602	erlich_robert	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2012	Nechama gave us a great tour of their facility back in January.  They did a wonderful job of explaining their organizations mission and how they help during natural disasters.  I am a youth director for a synagogue and brought my youth group members.  They had a great time watching the movie, touring the garage, looking at the tools and eating MRE meals!

We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106903		/users/profile/144601	randyize	Volunteer	5	02/22/2012	A close friend of mine has been a Nechama volunteer for years.  When the tornado rolled through north Minneapolis this past summer, I asked her to copy me on any email requests fro volunteers which she received from them.  My place of emplyment is just down the road from their headquarters and, after receiving a forwarded request for volunteers, I was able to quickly contact them and plug myself in to their disaster relief effort.  The fact that they have staff trained in disaster response enabled them to assemble a group of volunteers (myself included) in a van equipped with every conceivable tool and piece of equipment we might need, drive right to command central for the relief effort, move to the head of the volunteer registration and then deploy to the actual disaster area and begin working in astonishingly short order.  I learned throughout the course of that day and the next few days of working with the team that this was the 'B Squad' as Nechama already had several other teams out working in other disaster locations outside of Minnesota.  They might have been the backup squad but they functioned like an 'A Team'.  I had a wonderful time working with this group and had the opportunity to meet and work side by side with some wonderful individuals while at the same time bringing much needed relief to some of my fellow Minnesotans who had their lives disrupted by this terrible storm.  I'm not Jewish or even religious in any sense of the word but felt as though I was as welcome and as much a part of their team as anyone else.  I have gone back and volunteered my time helping them to clean and reorganize their equipment and, I look forward to the next opportunity I will have to get out in the field and assist them with some local disaster relief.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106877		/users/profile/144534	emiphoto	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2012	Nechama is simply a wonderful organization. The time I have spent working with them has been nothing but rewarding, even on cold rainy/snowy days, even on blistering hot days. I've slept on church floors, in trucks, in converted grocery stores and in FEMA camps but always a good night sleep after a hard days work. As a firefighter/emt/rescue tech I volunteered with Nechama for 3 weeks in 2006 after Katrina. i ended up actually working for them helping run the deployments and helping with equipment upkeep. One of the great things about Nechama is their agility - they don't have to send requisition forms to 5 different departments to get things done, they just do them.  They are well versed in the technical as well as the personal side of disaster management, Furthermore the cooperation with so many other faith based and governmental organizations has been wonderful. I strongly recommend working with Nechama as a volunteer, donor or if misfortune strikes, as a client.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106871		/users/profile/144523	Daniel24	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	NECHAMA is a truly wonderful organization. Their exceptional care and dedicated staff are unparalleled compared to other similar organizations.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106870		/users/profile/144522	mattmatzelle	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	I had the privilege of working with Nechama in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after a flood had hit the area. We spent a long time mucking and gutting basements for people who did not have the means, ability, or knowledge to do so themselves. They stayed longer than any other organization in the area and made a huge impact in a time of need. I am grateful for having had the chance to work with them. This is a dedicated organization that not only prioritizes helping people in need but, safety and preparation as well. They are well outfitted and prepared to handle wind and water damage and can boast some of the best stocked tool/supply trailers I've ever seen. The most important things about them, I believe, is their efficiency and planning. These factors add up to an exceptional organization, capable of helping people in hopeless situations with speed and effectiveness. If you have a chance to work with these people it will be something you never forget.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106869		/users/profile/144520	Amanda20	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	I have been working with Nechama ever since i can remember. My parent s brought me along to a disaster relief job and I had a blast. I feel really good when I help people that have lost their home and many other things because I actually know what I'm doing. Volunteering with Nechama and even 8 Days Of Hope has changed my life completely. They showed me that I'm not just ment to go to school and get a job like every other normal teenager, they showed me that i can get out there and do something better with the gifts and knowledge god gave me:)

I always have had rewarding deployments working with the great team that NECHAMA has devloped. I always look forward to teaming up with NECHAMA to help people in recovering from disasters. I would highly recommend for anyone to help NECHAMA with labor and or funding, they are a  wonderful group. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106863		/users/profile/144507	6drama	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	I volunteered with my family in North Mpls. I really enjoyed being able to work and clean up other people's yards.  I felt really good in the end because I knew I did a really good thing.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106861		/users/profile/144499	garylee51	Client Served	5	02/21/2012	The group that came from New Jersey did a very good job helping us to restore our small country church in SE MN.  They helped scrape paint, clean up the yard.  I enjoyed working with the young people that came, they were courteous, full of energy and even though they were Jewish, they didn't mind working on a Christian Church.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106860		/users/profile/144498	hanahcytron	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	In the last five years, Nechama has come to have a much of a place in my heart as my friends and family. My first deployment was to a small synagogue in Iowa, where they were hit with a tornado. Although the building remained intact, the surrounding area of strewn with branches, trash and various debris. After a hard day's work, it felt so good to look around and realize that this synagogue was that much farther on the path to reopening for its' congregants. From then on, I volunteered as much as I could, traveling around Minnesota on deployments and helping out in the office. Nechama has changed so many lives for the better, and in the process taught its' volunteers many incredible life lessons.

Their tool  trailer is awesome, we have the volunteers but don't have the tools, so that is nice.  Not to mention everyone I have worked with at Nechama has been great, especially Dan and Gene.  Exceptionally great organization.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106856		/users/profile/144492	AnneShields	Volunteer	4	02/21/2012	I have been a disaster volunteer since 2006.  I became aware of NECHAMA in 2008 when I volunteered with them in Oak Island, TX.  Volunteering through NECHAMA makes it easier for me.  It is always ready to deploy when needed and it is always willing to use me when I am available to help.  The mobile tools trailer is such an asset.  It has what is needed for helping those who are in need or if it doesn't have it, it will get it or figure out an alternative.  I appreciate that the donated funds appear to be stretched as far as they can go.  The few paid employees share the same accommodations, generally, as I do when I'm volunteering - meaning the cot and sleeping bag are sufficient as well as the makeshift shower and donated meals.  I am wealthy in time and labor, but not monetarily.  NECHAMA helps make it possible for me to fulfill what I have been called to do - to serve others - because usually my only expense is my transportation to the disaster.  To summarize, I have volunteered through NECHAMA in Oak Island, TX; Waterloo, IA; Oronoco & surrounding area, MN; Wadena, MN; Minot, ND; and St. Stephens & surrounding area, MN
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106851		/users/profile/144487	GailRosenbaum	General Member of the Public	5	02/21/2012	I am a youth adviser for 7th and 8th graders in the area. I took my group for a tour of NECHAMA and it was fantastic! This was a very eye-opening event for some of them who had never considered the impact that a disaster might have on their own homes, much less a family who had very few resources. At the end of the day, the kids had a good idea of the wonderful work that NECHAMA does to help communities in need. They were also enthusiastic about volunteering with NECHAMA in the future. I very strongly recommend NECHAMA.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106846	1	/users/profile/144473	cobenik1	Client Served	5	02/21/2012	I am the pastor of a small rural church in SE MN.  This historic building had suffered water damage a few years before we came to serve there.  We contacted Dan at Nechama to see if there was any break in their busy schedule to help us.  Nechama has the expertise to do this kind of work, and the equipment to get it done.  So a small crew from Nechama came and cleaned and gutted out the church basement in just two days.  I and my family learned a lot as we worked along side Nechama.  A month later after the severe flooding in two neighboring communities, we were able to work alongside Nechame with an Americorp team in the town of Hammond MN.  It is great to work with a group that knows what they are doing.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106842		/users/profile/144469	evad	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	Nechama provides the volunteer with outstanding training, strong onsite leadership and quality equipment.  The mission of anyone being able to join their workers at the site of the disaster is truly wonderful and has allowed locals to join in and help themselves and other around them.  This policy has provided the volunteer with a better understanding of the community in which they are working and a better connection to the whole community.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106838		/users/profile/144466	teammemberrich	Board Member	5	02/21/2012	The survey lets you pick one "Role" from the list - "Volunteer", "Client", "Board Member", etc.  I have been fortunate to have been at one time, ALL of the above choices.  As a volunteer, I worked in New Orleans.  As an employee, I worked in Western Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota.  As a board member, I worked in Southern Minnesota, Northern Minnesota and Minneapolis.  And as a client right in my own home and neighborhood.  The reason I am a board member now is because Nechama so intimately touched my heart, soul and existence that I had to be a part of the organization.  I simply cannot put into words what Nechama has done for me.  Nechama mucked and mopped out my house, and  Nechama mucked and mopped out my life.  Working for them was the best thing I ever did.  Nechama is small, but pound for pound, it is the most effective non-profit ever.  You will never find a non-profit of this size with this much reach and impact. 
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106828		/users/profile/21279	Cheryl	Donor	5	02/21/2012	People want to control their lives but when Weather disasters happen, they are exposed to this unpredictable turn of events.  This is where Nechama excels.  They help bring assistance to those who need help with clean up after a storm or flood has affected whole neighborhoods.  I have been a volunteer doing debris clearing.  I have helped with fund raising and gladly share what I can by donating cash that can be used to buy supplies, perform maintenance on their equipment.  What a worthy non-profit.   What an positive impact it makes on people who just do not know where to turn in this emergency for which they have no control.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	20108	4	/users/profile/21279	Cheryl	Volunteer	5	10/27/2009	What a worthy group.  When people are most vulnerable after a weather disaster, Nechama (Hebrew for comfort) works with local agencies to bring resource to clean up operations to those in need.  I am a cash donator, a worker volunteer and a back office helper. Even though I have not been a victim of weather, I can only imagine with home loss is like to to circumstances beyong anyone's control.  The group is highly organized with web sites, email notifications, communication programs.  The logistics to respond are superior due to a dedicate forward team to determine where the most appropropriate help can be deployed.I have worked on the clean up on several floods and tornados.  Often, the clean up could be weeks or months after the dozens of groups volunteer upon hearing the news.  But, Nechama steadily seeks the opportunities to make impact for improvements.  With flooding, the mold and mud abatement is often months after the damage so the victims are affected on a continual basis.  From the leadership who gathers donations to the workers who a frugal in their spending to the volunteer the whole team makes a major difference one home, one location, one city and one disaster at a time.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106826		/users/profile/144442	Rhonda3	Board Member	5	02/21/2012	I joined the Board of NECHAMA in November 2009 moved by the mission to provide clean up and recovery services to uninsured and under-insured homeowners in the aftermath of flooding and devastating wind related storm damage and to represent the Jewish community in providing these services.  During my tenure with NECHAMA, I have come to understand the critical role that faith based organizations like NECHAMA play in our national system of emergency management and disaster recovery by coordinating with national, state and local emergency management professionals, recruiting and supervising volunteers, providing much needed equipment and manpower, and doing the hands on work necessary to help disaster ravaged communities begin the recovery and rebuilding process.  NECHAMA has a stellar reputation among emergency management professionals and disaster recovery organizations nationwide for its response and readiness capabilities, willingness to oversee unaffiliated volunteers, and willingness and ability to train other volunteer organizations to perform recovery work.  The work of NECHAMA is gratifying not only for the comfort and support our work brings to disaster survivors and their communities without regard to religion, race or economic circumstances, but also because NECHAMA provides a positive reflection of the Jewish community and Jewish values to the community at large, affords members of our community a platform to live out their Jewish values by helping with disaster recovery as donors or volunteers, and builds bridges between members of the Jewish community and other ethnic and faith based groups as we work side by side for the common good.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106793		/users/profile/144396	Darrin A.	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	I have had the opportunity to volunteer with Nechama on several occasions in the field and "behind the scenes" at their facility.  It is quite apparent that everyone involved with the organization is very loyal and dedicated to helping others.   The first time I volunteered for Nechama was after flooding in Iowa.  Amazingly, this was several months after the floods.  I was surprised that once the media hipe of the disaster is over and the community starts loosing funding and help, there was Nechama!  They are there to the very end making sure that everyone that needs help, gets it.  I will definately work with Nechama in the future!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106792		/users/profile/144397	kevinamassey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2012	Nechama has always been one of my most trusted partners in the disaster response field.  Nechama lives out its mission with integrity and consistency.  You can trust Nechama.  Nechama's volunteers and staff are leaders in the field and I am proud to be counted among their friends.

NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106787		/users/profile/144389	audstudent12	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	In 2010, I served as a Team Leader for AmeriCorps NCCC.  In May of that year, my team and I were sent up to Rhode Island to perform flood relief work along with Serve Rhode Island and members of NECHAMA.  Our supervisors, Dan and Chad, spent two weeks in the field working with us and teaching up the correct way to perform assessments and perform mold remediation work.  They taught us all the appropriate techniques and safety precautions when it came to performing mold remediation at a resident's home.  Because of their hard work and willingness to work with us, my team was successful in doing mold remediation work in over 50 homes in the state of Rhode Island.  We were also able to work with additional volunteers and teach them the same techniques that we had been taught.  Whenever I had a question about a task that we were performing, I was able to give Dan a call and he would help me out.  Even when I served a second term as a Team Leader, I had a question about a type of mold that was in our spike housing and after sending him a photo, he responded with an answer and how to effectively treat the mold.  I will never forget the generosity that NECHAMA showed my team during the two weeks that they worked with us in Rhode Island.  The work that we completed in Rhode Island was life-changing for the residents and we could not have done that work if we didn't have the assistance and knowledge from NECHAMA.  If you need assistance, definitely call on NECHAMA.  They are a great organization backed by staff with extensive knowledge, caring hearts and a willingness to help others in their time of need.  I definitely endorse NECHAMA.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106786		/users/profile/144388	ab2williams	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	Over the past several years Ive worked with Nechama on two separate occasions; Nashiville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky.  On both occasions the Nechama team was extremely professional and dedicated to supporting the local community.  There dedication and commitment to supporting others is evident by their actions. Nechama provides coaching / training for the other volunteers.  Nechama show compassion and support for the people effected and Nechama truly makes a difference in peoples lives.  Most importantly, Nechama not only takes care of those effected by the disaster, they have a way of influencing others to make a positive difference.   
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106782		/users/profile/144384	Leanne '.	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	I have opportunities to volunteer with Nechama and assist with the flooding in SE Minnesota.  The agency and the volunteers involved have true dedication to helping those in times of disaster.  The agency is open and accepting of all volunteers and provides a great opportunity to provide to those that are in need of assistance.  Volunteering with Nechama provides a great opportunity to really make an impact on people's lives- dealing with a disaster is a very traumatic event and its an asset to have an organization like this that can come in and provide a helping hand.   I have to give a lot of credit to the volunteers and coordinators that truely take time out of their lives to serve and help others.  
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106779		/users/profile/144380	stephanie_sideman	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	I had the opportunity to volunteer with Nechama in New Orleans, Iowa, and Alabama and was impressed with the organization each time. The group leaders helped us to learn the skills needed to deconstruct homes that had been hit by a hurricane or flood. We were given great instruction and a chance to help a families impacted by disaster. Nechama, the Jewish responce to disaster, brings people of all faiths togethr to help any family in need.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106777		/users/profile/144378	Eitan L.	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	I was a volunteer with Nechama on two different occasions. My first experience with them was during this past summer in Birmingham, Alabama to assist with damage done by a Tornado.  My second time serving with them was later that summer in New Jersey to help a family whose house sustained severe flood damage. The leaders of Nechama are not only some of the coolest dudes I have ever met but they are also professional and knowledgable when it comes to disaster relief. The Nechama staff gave us thorough training before we started to work and then remained a constant presence on the work sites during the duration of our volunteering. It should also be noted that Nechama does an exceptional job at ensuring the safety of its volunteers on site despite the dangerous nature of locations that have suffered damage.  I have done 2 trips with Nechama in the past and i look forward to doing more in the future.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106771		/users/profile/144372	Sara L.	Volunteer	5	02/20/2012	My AmeriCorps team served with NECHAMA this past spring in Mississippi after the tornadoes tore through the south. After we teamed up with Dan Hoeft and his crew, we wasted no time and got to work clearing debris from victims' yards, so that they could start putting their life back together again as soon as possible. Although this was very emotionally and physically demanding work, the members of NECHAMA supported each of our needs and not only guided us, they made sure that we felt fulfilled and uplifted throughout the whole experience. I have nothing but good things to say about this organization and would most definitely serve with them again.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106649		/users/profile/87145	mok4747	Volunteer	5	02/17/2012	I've volunteered with Nechama several times, most memorably on two week-long trips to Mississippi and Louisiana to help clean up after Hurricane Katrina. I met some of the most amazing people (both volunteers and locals) and did some of the hardest (and most rewarding) work of my life on those trips. I have consistently been impressed with Nechama's organization, transparency, and dedication to its ideals. I just can't say enough positive things about it.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106632		/users/profile/21196	Eytansw	Volunteer	5	02/17/2012	I volunteered with Nechama in Iowa after the flooding in 2009. The staff was the perfect balance of friendly and professional so that work got done, but you could still enjoy being with other volunteers. They had the tools necessary, and have been improving their care to an interpersonal level. All around, a great organization
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	20033	4	/users/profile/21196	Eytansw	Volunteer	5	10/27/2009	I saw the most challenging and enriching images of my life while on my deployment in Iowa. The people provided a perfect atmosphere for motivation and productivity. I wish every summer I could find time to go back again and help.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	286425	3	/users/profile/376553	Elizabeth212,	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's a difficult to understand disasters and the aftermath.  We see them on cable stations and our local news stations.   Homes that are ripped from foundations in tornadoes, buildings bought to rubble in earthquakes, tsunamis that roar through villages leaving death tolls that become just a figure.  That is till you're in one. Pictures don't show the smell of mold and tears of many too proud to realize that our lives are forever imprinted with a nightmare.My name is Liz Treston, I live in Long Beach, NY.  October 29, 2012 seems so distant for many that did not have the Atlantic come surging through it's city and front door. We were lost, devastated by the sheer destruction.  We're also stereotypical New Yorkers.  We wanted things fixed and back to normal the next day.  We were in for a sad awakening.I don't know how we met.  I was helping my neighbors gather information from disaster relief groups.  There were many names.  There are many souls upon this planet given a calling that says I refuse to let others give up.  There will be hope and a tomorrow.My hope and a number of souls came to City, in a white van with NECHAMA written on the side. My family was assessing our damage.  It was cold. We were lucky in many ways no one was hurt.  The van stopped at my house. I was expecting another offer a water and a meal as I protected myself in a cocoon of uncertainty."We're here to help", said a young man.  His face clean shaven and his hands with recent callouses. "Think we're okay".  I knew their were others who were in worse shape then myself. When you're in  the thick of the guts of your house laying in the street you don't think clearly. You worry about others. Maybe this man saw my soul. He slipped me a card and said to call when I was ready. I gave him the names of neighbors that I knew needed more help.That's what happens.  You see kindness and a glimmer of a sense that things will be okay.In a few months it will be 4 years since Superstorm Sandy slid up from the South and stole out houses.  It never stole our souls though because of the men and women from places that come to post disaster areas like NECHAMA.I hope that you can give to this incredible selfless group.  You truly never know when a disaster will come.  I am glad to know that when the water recedes NECHAMA will be there for you. When the water did recede in Long Beach I became an active member in learning and disseminating information.  With the guidance of Dorothy Maples and others from the Long Term Recovery Groups we started our own non-profit to help our residents prepare for  future emergencies. Again without NECHAMA and it's continuous efforts across boundaries and borders too many souls will feel lost.  Help them let those in disaster areas find their way home.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106627		/users/profile/144142	DinaG.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2012	I volunteered with Nechama twice this past summer, in Alabama doing tornado relief and in New Jersey after Hurricane Irene. I have witnessed first-hand how Nechama is always there to comfort any and all victims of natural disasters. Nechama provides the tools and equipment necessary, the constant motivation, and the proper supervision so that volunteers remain safe at all times. I have worked with several disaster relief volunteer organizations, and I can honestly say that Nechama is by far my favorite and deserves to be the top rated disaster response charity of 2012!
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106593		/users/profile/144082	pjacobs	Volunteer	4	02/16/2012	I have volunteered with Nechama for over 10 years, helping to clean up damage from tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes, both  locally and nationally.  In some cases, just showing up, and demonstrating to those with damaged homes that others care, fulfills the mission of providing 'comfort'  ('nechama' in Hebrew), as much as leaving a home ready for rebuilding provides hope. Nechama also provides a valuable service by absorbing many 'emergent volunteers' in its work - people who show up to help, but who are not part of an established organization.   Nechama is also well known for arriving with the tools and equipment needed for effective cleanup.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	106591		/users/profile/144079	midsouthvoad	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/16/2012	In April/May 2011, Memphis, Tennessee experienced a 100 year flood along the Mississippi River.  Many homes were flooded in our city and county.  The local chapter of NECHAMA joined with Methodists, Muslims, other denominations, nonprofit and members of the business community in helping to remove debris and deconstruct affected homes.  Their willingness to lend a helping hand will forever be remembered in our community.  Thank you NECHAMA!  --Loretta Hurt, Communications Officer--Mid-South VOAD | Emergency Support Coordinator ESF 14 -- Emergency Operations Center | Project Manager--United Way of the Mid-South
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	20360	4	/users/profile/21515	David & Susie	Board Member	5	10/28/2009	A friend of ours inspired us with the idea of participating in good work by giving some combination of the 3 Ts  giving of our Time, Treasure, and/or Talent.  We all have something to give  and it is our privilege and indeed a Mitzvah (Hebrew for commandment) to do so.  Being involved in NECHAMA fulfills our desire to participate in Tikkun Olam, the imperative to repair the world  which reflects the Jewish values of Justice, Compassion, and Peace.  In fact, NECHAMA derives its mission from this Jewish value.  Volunteering with NECHAMA is the perfect family activity.  With our three children ranging in age from 18-23, we still enjoy sharing activities that reinforce our family values and provide opportunities for the family to work together on meaningful projects.  Shell Lake and Siren, WI and a total of 12 weeks in New Orlens, LA gave us a wide range of expiriences and introduced us to many wonderful people, both volunteers and clients.  Our involvement with NECHAMA reminds us of the things we need to think about on a daily basis  and be thankful for.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	20136	4	/users/profile/21309	nechama	Volunteer	5	10/27/2009	I have been a Nechama volunteer for 5 years.  This group allows me to directly assist individuals impacted by natural disasters in a way that is extremely beneficial to the victims and satisfying to the volunteers.  Because of of their organization, logistics, training, and equipment, we are able to right in the thick of the action and lend a helping hand where it is really needed.

The world needs more groups like this one.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	19917	8	/users/profile/21101	stevelear	Board Member	5	10/27/2009	Nechama has changed my life.  Because of my experiences with Nechama since 1993 I have learned the importance of relationships and the lack of importance of material items.  I have benefited from the "doing"" vs the talking.  I have met incredable people and have made lifetime friendships. I have been rewarded with large amounts of psychic income by helping victims of natural disasters.  My life has been richly rewarded by my involvement in this organization representing the Jewish Community at the time of disasters helping those in the greatest need.
NECHAMA - Jewish Response to Disaster	19694	11	/users/profile/20889	AnnaSchorer	Board Member	5	10/25/2009	Nechama gets disaster victims started on the road to recovery. Volunteers work in teams to clean out debris from homes.  Nechama's goal is to help those with the greatest need, and volunteers from every background, with or without experience are welcome to join.
North American Bear Center	316616		/users/profile/143841	Don- J.	Donor	5	10/29/2016	Great organization.  Been there 3 times since 2010, an hope to visit them in 2017.  The resident bears are awesome to see in person in the summer. You can also watch them on live cam daily.  There are daily presentations given outside with the resident  bears present by the  interns that are very knowledgeable.  The bears inhabit about a 2 1/2 acre enclosure , designed with the bears happiness in mind. There are also daily 'met the bears' behind the scenes  tours to get up close an personal.  Of course there is a fence between you an the bears, at all timers,  since it isn't a petting zoo.  It is worth the time to visit when in Ely, Minnesota.  Please also visit The International Wolf Center, an Dorothy Molter Museum.

NABC has given me a MAIN REASON for going again.  TED, LUCKY, an HONEY are so interesting to watch an enjoy.  the addition of HOLLY bear in DECEMBER gives added incentive to visit.  ALL the bears are greatly loved an cared for. ANY negative comments in reviews are by a couple people with personal vendetta against NABC an people who support the organization.  please ignore their untruths. i have donated to NABC an will continue to.
North American Bear Center	179187	1	/users/profile/143841	Don- J.

North American Bear Center	149411	1	/users/profile/143841	Don- J.	Donor	5	02/14/2013	I have been supporting NABC since 2010 since I found out about them via a  tv report.  Ive been there in 2010 spring an saw in person what a great place it is.  I will continue to support them an their bear education.  Its great to see the resident bears Ted, Lucky an Honey in their 2 1/2 acres.  Bit even greater is seeing the videos an educational material on the wild black bears near ELY,MN.  The black bear is a very misunderstood animal and NABC is showing the truth about the everyday life of them.  On a sacle of 1 to 10 i give them an 11.
North American Bear Center	139334	2	/users/profile/143841	Don- J.	Donor	5	11/14/2012	Been to NABC a couple years ago.  It was a great learning experience.  the educational value to learn about black bears is a 10 out of 10.  they have 3 bears in a great 2 acre plus enclosure.  it is worth the time to visit an enjoy Lucky, Ted, an Honey the 3 resident bears.

North American Bear Center	316604		/users/profile/143847	Emily22	Donor	5	10/29/2016	I have not been able to physically visit the Wildlife Research Institute and the North American Bear Center in Ely, but I feel as if I have. The research done by Dr Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield has been significant in opening the eyes of so many people around the world about the true nature of black bears. Along the way, Dr Rogers has taught us much about other wildlife in the area and the ecological consequences of many human endeavors...both positive and negative. We have also learned of the difficulties of dealing with the many misconceptions about black bears, even among those who should be the protectors of this wildlife resource. I donate as often as I am able to WRI and the NABC, and look forward to the long continuation of this research.
North American Bear Center	315237		/users/profile/270737	handymandy	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2016	I've been to the bear center 4 times when I've traveled to Ely for an annual gathering of bear supporters and friends. It is one of the highlights of my trip! It has so much information on bears and how to coexist with them. The recent additions and improvements make it a state-of-the art museum! And I adore seeing the resident bears, Ted, Lucky, Holly, and now Tasha. If you haven't been there it's worth the trip!
North American Bear Center	208050	2	/users/profile/270737	handymandy	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	I have been to Ely the last 3 summers for vacation. The first place I stop is the NABC. I love to go there, see the displays and see the bears. Contrary to some other reviews I've read, they do not keep the bears "locked up" in cages. They have their den areas where they rest but the bears are out a lot. I particularly enjoyed seeing Holly, the newest resident bear. This 19 month old  bear is a joy to watch. It's especially fun to watch her and Lucky play and to see her start to stand up to Honey, the dominant female. The staff and volunteers are great. They are always ready and willing to help, to answer questions or to inform us of what the bears are doing and why. The gift shop has a lot of merchandise, most of which is very reasonable. I could have spent a lot of money there. I highly suggest people stop by there, especially if you have children. It's very educational. Before I started going to Ely, I thought all bears were aggressive and violent. Not so with the American Black Bear. They are gentle creatures. They are very smart. They are wonderful mothers to their cubs. Do yourself a favor. Go see the NABC.
North American Bear Center	313307	4	/users/profile/404680	moonlight1232	Volunteer	5	10/22/2016	I started volunteering for this organization a few years ago. I had been following them for several years prior to that and decided that I wanted to be a part of this team, in whatever manner i could.. What I've found is that people all over the globe volunteer for this organization.These people give their time for a company that is striving to educate everyone on the scientific research information that comes from years of study.   Working with all of these wonderful human beings is such a great experience and I have learned so much from being a part of this amazing group of people. Information that was learned from my childhood has proved to be false, which gives me much knowledge to continue to grow as a person.I strongly advocate for the North American Bear Center (NABC) and hope you find this information useful and give them a 'look'.. One of the links for more knowledge is: http://www.bear.org/website/Their 'sister site'  for additional information is: http://www.bearstudy.org/website/
North American Bear Center	313237	5	/users/profile/404608	sk8bears	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	One of the best things I ever found was the bear.org site for the NABC.I have always loved bears- Smokey Bear was my favorite book- so when I saw on the news that a bear was going to be born live on camera I tuned in and was hooked on this place. I waited and waited for days - setting my alarm hourly during the night to check if a cub had arrived yet. Then watching and hearing the new cubs was amazing.  Watching them grow was amazing and the information that I learned and the old myths that were dispelled kept me coming back for more and more . Then I was asked to volunteer as a moderator. It has been one of the best experiences I have had. I can't say enough about the level of education the NABC provides to anyone interested in learning. From the cub room for the youngest visitors to seeing the live bears up close on a behind the scenes tour to learning and sharing on the chat page for those too far away to visit.  You know they are doing something right when you have guests and volunteers from all over the world.  People fly across the ocean to visit family- see New York and other popular destinations but to have world travelers make The North American Bear Center their destination speaks volumes about how wonderful the NABC is
North American Bear Center	313139	5	/users/profile/404510	Lisa589	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	Everyone there is so inviting to answer any questions, the staff are amazing.  Its a great place to learn not only about black bears but other wildlife. 
North American Bear Center	313063	5	/users/profile/404434	supportthebears1	Board Member	5	10/21/2016	The North American Bear Center is a wonderful educational facility. It has something for everyone.  Whether you are interested in science, biology, or nature, you are sure to find something of interest.  All of the displays are easy to read and understand.  The videos of wild bear behavior are outstanding.  You could easily spend 3-4 hours there and still not see everything.  What better way than to learn directly from the bears?
North American Bear Center	312994	5	/users/profile/404364	TheRonald	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2016	NABC has so much useful information on how to co-exist with black bears. As well as what to do when or if encountering them and how to prevent encounters. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Will take the time to discuss in detail any questions you have. Always very friendly. Pleasant way to start the day in the chat room chatters and moderators are the best for family friendly interactions. 
North American Bear Center	312958	6	/users/profile/404331	Grace45	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	My husband and I were able to drive up to Minn from Alabama to visit the Bear Center a couple years ago, we had been watching the den cam's in the wild and at the center before that, was over joyed to get to meet the staff and see the bears at the center in person.  Since that visit they have done many more updates and improvements to the center, it's still on our bucket list to go back again.  I have had the joy of being included as one of the online chat mod's for the bear center and have learned so much from the staff, other mod's, Doc and the researchers.  I even won a personal phone call from Doctor Rogers, that was like a phone call from our own kind of Rock Star :) or should I say Bear Star, CrittersRUs
North American Bear Center	312952	5	/users/profile/403767	4 Bears	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	This is an exceptional educational facility devoted to teaching the truth about black bears. The Northwoods Ecology Hall focuses on the other animals they must co-exist with in Northeastern MN.  They have 4 resident Ambassador bears . Hourly programs are offered to see these bears close up. Worldwide podcasts daily for additional learning anywhere in the world. Numerous exhibits, videos, pictures and documentaries for additional indoor learning. Knowledgeable staff to answer all your question. A must see if you are in Northeastern MN. 
North American Bear Center	312857	3	/users/profile/404229	Anita58	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	This year was my 6th annual trip to NABC from the UK.  Each year I have seen improvements have been made.  Apart from the bears who are always a joy to watch, there is always so much to learn.  Not just about bears but all wildlife of the Northwoods.  The staff are always very welcoming and so helpful, always willing to stand and talk to you and answer any questions.  And this year the outside has a stunning new entrance - especially seeing it at night it really catches the eye.  This year there was another new bear to get to know - Tasha - a little cutie.  But it was sad that dear Honey had passed on due to old age - she was a much loved bear.  She has been laid to rest near the carpark with lovely tributes.  It is good to know that the bears are so cared for and loved even when they have passed.  I will certainly be going back next year and will look forward to it.  And in the meantime I am so glad to be a volunteer, which I have done since 2011.

North American Bear Center	312730	5	/users/profile/235991	SmittenbyBears	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I have been volunteering for three+ years with this remarkable organization that strives to replace misconceptions with facts about the true nature of black bears. I love visiting the Ely, MN Center, a truly one-of-a-kind facility. It's a treat to see the four magnificent ambassador bears that help people learn from the bears themselves. I have learned so much from the wealth of interesting exhibits, articles, photos and videos and the engaging staff that provides wonderful care for Ted, Lucky, Holly and Tasha. Even at home, I am able to visit virtually every day through the Center's live webcams and chats. The North American Bear Center, by carrying out its mission to advance the survival of bears worldwide, is helping people learn to co-exist peacefully with black bears and I am grateful to be part of that!

Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	 I would like to say a few words on my experience going to Ely this yr for the Lilypad picnic..At first when we made it to the Bear Center to sign in for our name badges. I meet some of the Lily fans signing in an then when I walked into the Center I could not believe my eyes how Beautiful it was in side an to meet all my FB friends on Lily's wall was so uplifting an every one was very friendly an so nice to be around, Then I saw Doc walking in the door an I got the biggest bear hug from the bear man himself an it was a joy to finally meet him an meeting Mrs. Donna Rogers she is a sweet heart in an out an we talked about having Doc put some food on Pat's tree for Lucky to climb up but she said that Doc told her the bears were on a diet we laugh an then I saw Lucky coming an got over 375 pic's why I was there..At the picnic it was truly amazing an then I bough some tickets an had my Daughter Lisa put in the jar for the Ground Breaking Shovel with Doc an Donna name on it..My Daughter said mom they are calling the number for the shovel but i was doing something an then they called my name an I had tears in my I was so excited to win the shovel that started the Ground Breaking for the Hope Center...My visit to Ely was the best thing that ever happened an I hope to come back again..I say it's the best place to visit and I would recommend every one to visit Ely Minnesota in your life time. A wonderful place..Sheryl Keller

Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	I have not been to the north american bear center but would love to see Ted-Honey-Lucky, And to see all the nice things that the center has to offer.And i have been learning all that i can about black bears with the help from Dr.Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield.I think it is wounder full to keep others educated on these beautiful animals.The more we learn the more we all understand the way these bears live.And help in the misconceptions of these beautiful animals.And I own it all to Dr.Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield.
North American Bear Center	312468	2	/users/profile/403839	Terri86	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	In the four years that I have volunteered for the North American Bear Center, I have witnessed unwavering dedication to bears. Not only has the NABC added extensively to its physical facilities, but all involved work tirelessly to involve the worldwide public in observing and learning about bears through live webcams and numerous outreach resources including speakers and materials for educators and groups.  Drawing on the researchers' many decades of data, as well as their own experience, staff members are bursting with knowledge about these fascinating creatures and are just bursting with excitement about sharing it.   
North American Bear Center	312404	1	/users/profile/403768	Zephyrx	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2016	The North American Bear Center is one of the best attractions in Ely, MN.  Visitors learn about black bears and also learn about all species of wildlife in the north woods eco system. It can be visited for an hour or for an entire day, based on the amount of information you want to take in from the multiple displays, movies, or the "behinds the scene" tour, to see the live bears up close.Each year there is something new and different.  This is a powerful way to learn about all north woods wildlife species and is a summer adventure I never miss.  ELy is very fortunate to have the North American Bear Center to educate the public about behavioral patterns of the Black Bears.
North American Bear Center	312398	5	/users/profile/403762	Mike196	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I am a volunteer moderator who moderates chat on the live cameras of the NABC website. I came across NABC in 2010 watching a bear in the wild give birth in her den on camera. I was fascinated with bears before so that was wonderful seeing the birth and growth of a cub. Then I learned that the biologist and researcher, Doctor lynn Rogers, who placed that camera in the den also walked up to awake wild free bears in the forest and placed tracking collars around their necks. That seemed impossible and frightening to me. I had to find out more . i found out that much of what I "knew" about black bears was wrong. NABC is dedicated to educating people about what the real nature and tendencies of black bears (and to a lesser degree other bear species) in the hopes that truthful researched and published scientific facts about bears will help us to coexist with them to the greatest extent possible. Replacing myth and irrational fears with facts is seldom a bad thing so I volunteered to help in my small way. Ive had almost entirely good experiences from this and I am better off in the ways that are easier to feel than to describe or put numbers to from interacting with the wonderful people involved with "our" bears.
North American Bear Center	312349	3	/users/profile/238908	Crosswind	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	The North American Bear Center is a wonderful organization focusing it's efforts at educating the public about black bears and other wildlife native to northern Minnesota. The facilities are beautiful and the staff outstanding. I'm proud to be a volunteer.
North American Bear Center	182155	6	/users/profile/238908	Crosswind	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2013	I have been to the NABC several times in the past year and will happily go back again and again. The displays are educational and easy to understand. Knowledgeable and friendly staff and volunteers are available to explain everything. It's a family friendly place with displays and interactive areas just for kids. Honey, Ted and Lucky, the resident bears, provide an up close look at an animal that most people will never see in the wild. I'm looking forward to the opening of the educational center next spring. 
North American Bear Center	312342	2	/users/profile/403696	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2016	It is a must see educational experience from the driveway to the entrance of the Bear center WOW then you step in and it takes your breath away !! through out the Bear center nothing but excitement and it changes your thoughts  about Black Bears and sends you in a direction you never expected to get to. behind the scene tours are no charge and cap off a great experience !!  
North American Bear Center	312329	3	/users/profile/403683	2bears	Donor	5	10/20/2016	My experience with this non profit has been exceptionally positive. The education provided to visitors to the NABC is well detailed, informative, and interesting. The staff at all levels are helpful and professional. 
North American Bear Center	312325	2	/users/profile/235048	mjfourn	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I have been affiliated with the North American Bear Center as a volunteer since 2010 when I was enticed into watching a live den cam of a female bear (Lily) giving birth to a singleton cub (Hope).  It was love at first sight as I learned more and more about the nature of these intelligent, shy creatures.  I watched with pride as the Center grew from one man's dream (Lynn Rogers, Ph.D) to a national treasure of black bear education and advocacy. The NABC is currently home to four ambassador bears enjoying nature in a 2-acre habitat and has expanded to include not only bear exhibits, but also those depicting Northwoods flora and fauna in all seasons.  It has developed highly successful international volunteer and internship programs and has created outstanding educational programs for both adults and children.  It is an honor to be associated with this highly acclaimed, world class educational center that is meeting its mission of replacing myths about black bears with facts.
North American Bear Center	210973	1	/users/profile/235048	mjfourn	Volunteer	5	08/17/2014	I have been a remote volunteer (and donor) for four years and have been enriched by all I have learned along the way. Although I live out of state, I am dedicated to the mission of the North American Bear Center - to replace misconceptions about black bears with facts. I have visited the Center numerous times and am continually impressed and educated by the range of exhibits and programs - from the Cub Room for children to nature trails for all, behind the scenes photo tours, multi-media exhibits, life-size mounts, and a vast array of educational displays.  And, of course, a chance to view ambassador bears Ted, Lucky, Honey, and Holly as they live their bear lives in a beautiful 2-acre enclosure including waterfalls and pond. One day is simply not enough. Initially founded in 2007 as bear biologist Dr. Lynn Rogers' lifelong passion, the NABC is a forward-thinking organization. It has grown to create programs that reach beyond its walls - traveling black boxes for educators; daily podcasts on the activities of the ambassador bears in residence; live Web cam from the enclosure; a family-friendly Web chat room where fans become friends; international speakers bureau and volunteer program; nightly updates by Dr. Rogers himself, and so much more. Run to Ely to visit the North American Bear Center, or at the very least, tune in!
North American Bear Center	178411	4	/users/profile/235048	mjfourn	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I am a proud "virtual" volunteer with the North American Bear Center.  I became involved several years ago when Dr. Lynn Rogers, chief researcher, installed a den cam that allowed the world to witness the birth of Lily's Hope and learn what happens during hibernation.  Like all who tuned in, I was hooked by the thrill of watching the bear world up close and personal and learning directly from the bears. I soon became a pond chat addict, forging strong bonds of friendship with other Lily and Hope fans. A "bearhead" community was born. As the denning season drew to a close that first year, the cameras and my attention turned to the ambassador bears on-site at the NABC, Ted, Lucky, and Honey.  They live in a man-made habitat where they can forage and climb trees and play and den.  I learned so much by watching their daily antics and reading about their behavior and habits in Dr. Rogers' nightly updates. I jumped in to volunteer as the Volunteer Coordinator, formalizing and expanding the global volunteer program which has attracted talented, dedicated volunteers in 13 countries. Others jumped in to start a Facebook page and organize highly successful fund raising campaigns. The BBC jumped in to film several documentaries. The NABC is a unique non-profit.  It is the culmination of Dr. Rogers' long career thinking about and interacting with bears in an entirely new way. And, his desire to share his knowledge (replacing myth with facts) so that humans and bears can co-exist.  And, his determination to stay the course despite overwhelming obstacles. Dr. Rogers embodies the American pioneer spirit. I have had the privilege of visiting the NABC twice.  It is an amazing place. The exhibits, programs, videos, mounts, and photographs are top-notch, designed with attention to detail and facts.  The staff is welcoming, well-informed and dedicated to caring for the ambassador bears and educating the public.  The gift shop is well-stocked with one-of-a-kind items.  The NABC is making an impact around the world - on the life of bears and the humans that want to learn about them. It is a national treasure. 
North American Bear Center	210841	2	/users/profile/273643	LoriC.	General Member of the Public	5	08/15/2014	Absolutely wonderful place to visit if you want to learn more about bears, their habitat and behaviors.  Also a lot of information regarding other wildlife who share the Northwoods.  I have been to the NABC at least 4 times and never get tired of learning....you can't help but learn when you go there!  the videos are the best.....to see actual bear behavior in the wild is priceless.  And I will DEFINTELY be going back....there's always more to learn!
North American Bear Center	208582	2	/users/profile/143873	dbialek	General Member of the Public	5	08/04/2014	I have made the North American Bear Center a destination vacation for three years.  The opportunity to see the ambassador bears in a setting that mimics the wild habitat as much as possible for animals in captivity, has been awe-inspiring. Learning about wild bear behavior has made me better equipped to co-exist with the animals in my rural home.  You can't help but become engaged by the bears and can't help but learn something in the highly entertaining yet education-centric environment.  And the web-cams make it possible to "return" to the NABC any time I want.  
North American Bear Center	179600	2	/users/profile/143873	dbialek	Donor	5	10/18/2013	Kindle your relationship with Nature and the beauty of Minnesota's Northwoods, with a visit to the North American Bear Center.  Young & old alike are enthralled by the beauty of the exhibits and education about the region and its flora and fauna is achieved, almost by osmosis! I have spend several days there, and haven't absorbed everything yet. So, I'll be going back as often as I can to see the live bears & the facts about  wild animals including bears and how we humans can be better neighbors to them.
North American Bear Center	106498	20	/users/profile/143873	dbialek	Client Served	5	02/15/2012	I have had the distinct  privilege of visiting the NABC, meeting the staff, volunteers, Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield, and meeting THE BEARS. If you have not afforded yourself that opportunity, please put it on your bucket list!  The Black Bear has been vilified erroneously for generations but if you open your minds and hearts, you will learn truth from fiction. One of the most docile of creatures whose life is spent in search of food, preferably wild, natural food, the black bear is more apt to be afraid of humans than to approach them. These huge creatures, weighing as much as 700 pounds in the wild, are gentle enough to handle a new born the size of a stick of butter without inflicting any harm.  The work of Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield, research conducted under the auspices of the Wildlife Research Institute, is awesome to say the least, and groundbreaking.  The three bears who live at the NABC are no longer "wild", but were rescued by Dr. Rogers; 2 were "pets" until they became too large for their captors. The NABC environment is as close to wild as could be... and the bears are ambassadors for their wild North American counterparts and other similar bear species world wide. I cannot say enough about the awesome experience of getting to see the bears up close, and getting to meet the folks who have made Mother Earth and the Black Bear their life's work.
North American Bear Center	208532	2	/users/profile/236117	Barb24	General Member of the Public	5	08/04/2014	I have been to the North American Bear Center numerous times.  I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone, including families with children.  If anyone wants to hear the truth about black bears, this is the place to go.  There are many display's and articles about black bears.  There are also 4 resident black bears that live there that cannot be released back into the wild for numerous reasons.  Please give yourself at least 2 hours to see everything.  I assure you, you will not be disappointed.
North American Bear Center	179473	3	/users/profile/236117	Barb24	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	Wonderful place to learn the truth about black bears.
North American Bear Center	208502	1	/users/profile/271200	amy_lulani	Volunteer	5	08/04/2014	The NABC represents an entity that has truly made a difference in the world of nature and bears in particular.  It is a place of learning, a people-oriented visiting area to see bears in a large living environment where one may see bears as they live in a totally safe place.  It is not 'the wild'; it is as close as anyone can observe from a safe place.  Their organization is admirable.  During the time I volunteered, we viewed instruction videos, it was all so easy and doable; they have first class people working there, several who have applied their already honed skills in their previous careers, to this organization.  They are all passionate and their mission is clear.  I support this organization wholly in passing on all that I've learned wherever I can; as well as in the form of donations.  I also support Doc Rogers' work, inspite of the 'forces' that have targeted his research, which interestingly strengthened the thought that bears are not those vicious predators that 'hunters' have made them out to be.  The education and outreach programs have been superly run, and the school children who were lucky enough to see the den cams with mothers and their newborn cubs, will have a special memory and hopefully be inspired to continue the worthy mission of more bear education.  
North American Bear Center	208456	3	/users/profile/271151	jun.clark	Client Served	5	08/03/2014	I had to consider *MY ROLE* because I have, in fact, never been to the NABC. Yet, I visit the website daily and have since 2010 when Lily the wild black bear was in labor in a den in the woods of Northern Minnesota, I was hooked. A thirst for knowledge of not only black bears, but nature, in general. Dr Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield has never failed to amaze me. The recent addition of little Holly as indeed been a blessing.  The NABC has served to educate people throughout the entire world and has developed programs to be implemented in schools to replace misconceptions that have been ingrained in peoples minds for years about black bears with current scientific research.  The NABC is on my bucket list!  My experiences listed below signified by *checks* are my visits by internet and heart. :)
North American Bear Center	208246	2	/users/profile/152170	Suzie Saliga	Volunteer	5	08/01/2014	This is a wonderful place for both children and adults to learn about bears.  I've been to the NABC every 4 years and will continue to return.  It's a long drive for us, but well worth it.  The displays are fantastic and they are now adding another addition to the NABC...a large northwoods ecology exhibit.   The 4 ambassador bears are free to roam on 2.5 wooded acres with natural food to forage on and many trees to climb.  There is a beautiful pond for them with a bridge and 3 waterfalls. It's really fun to watch the bears from an outdoor balcony or from the expansive indoor viewing window.  I can't say enough about how I enjoy watching the bears interact. I've been a volunteer den watcher for 4 years and have learned so much about mother and cub behavior.  Each mother has her own individual way of caring for her cubs.  I feel very appreciated for the work I do.  I also volunteer on Lily the Black Bear Facebook page for the Bear Facts and Fun group adding educational information in a creative format.   As humans continue to encroach on black bear territory, we need to understand these beautiful gentle creatures.  The more we learn, the more we can peacefully coexist.  The NABC is a great place to learn and have fun at the same time.
North American Bear Center	183716	3	/users/profile/152170	Suzie Saliga	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I learned about the North American Bear Center when the live birth of a cub named "Hope" was broadcast on the internet.  Since then getting to the NABC was on my bucket list.  Even though it's about an 8 hour drive from here, my husband and I have been to the North American Bear Center twice and it's been an enriching experience with so much to see and learn.  You can easily spend a day browsing through the photo gallery, watching bears through a large viewing window, and watching the excellent videos.  There is also an exhibit area for kids.  With humans encroaching into bear territory, the center educates people about how to coexist in harmony with black bears and highlights the work of the black bear researchers.  I highly recommend taking a trip there.  
North American Bear Center	111761	20	/users/profile/152170	Suzie Saliga	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2012	The North American Bear Center is a wonderful place to learn about bears.  There are 3 resident bears that live in a beautifully well maintained wooded area with waterfalls and a swimming pond.  There is a deck and a large indoor viewing window where you can see them when they walk past. The displays and exhibits at the Center are extensive, and it's easy to spend at least one whole day visiting there.  I highly recommend it and am going back again this year.
North American Bear Center	208239	2	/users/profile/143849	Kerry M.	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2014	I have visited the NABC the past five years, and hope to continue every year ~ it is such a grand place to learn, meet wonderful people who work there, see the resident bears, and just walk around watching videos and looking at pictures. They have a fantastic enrichment program and the staff are incredibly dedicated and helpful.  There is so much to learn from visiting the center, you will want to come back for more.  The Hope Learning Center is coming along nicely and it, too, will have vital information about the true nature of black bears and their lives.  It's a magical experience...
North American Bear Center	179943	5	/users/profile/143849	Kerry M.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	The North American Bear Center in Ely Minnesota has become one of my most favorite places to go every year.  The Center is packed with information from videos to books to pictures - and the three bears that reside there are visible from outside viewing to a huge window inside the Center.  There are daily gatherings, teachings, exhibits and more ~ a children's section and new Hope Learning Center soon to open.  One could spend a day there and not see it all!  The gift shop has something for everybody - at great prices.  It has provided thousands of visitors a chance to truly understand the Black Bear and how to co-exist with them.  The staff at the NABC consists of loyal, hardworking and knowledgeable employees and volunteers who make it their mission to give each and every visitor a warm welcome and a reason to return.  There is something for everyone - regardless of age - to learn and to remember with fondness.  It is a magical experience, for sure.
North American Bear Center	149408	3	/users/profile/143849	Kerry M.	Volunteer	5	02/14/2013	I have learned more about black bears and how they live from the North American Bear Center.  Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield, biologists, have gained the trust of the research bears and never use tranquilizers to collar them or check their heart rates.  They are humane and dedicated researchers who have spent countless hours making this educational process what it is today. They are about what is best for the bears, and how to spread the word about these wonderful creatures.  I admire and respect their work and their humanity, and will  forever be indebted to them for what I have learned.Kerry Mahoney
North American Bear Center	111836	11	/users/profile/143849	Kerry M.	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	You will not find a more dedicated and professional group of people who work for the North American Bear Center.  The Wildlife Research Institute biologists, Lynne Rogers and Sue Mansfield, have done more to educate thousands of people all over the world about the black bear and how they live their lives in their natural environment.  Their tireless efforts and compassion have enlightened and inspired countless  followers who trust and respect their humane research.  Children of all ages are now able to learn about and  understand these amazing bears in classrooms throughout the country.
North American Bear Center	208017	1	/users/profile/270705	Maureen_S	Volunteer	5	07/31/2014	I have been a den watcher since the winter of 2012. Seeing how mother bears take care of and interact with their infant cubs has been an invaluable experience. If not for the work NABC is doing I would still think black bears are vicious, people-eating beasts. But seeing how tender and loving momma bears are with their babies has gone a long way towards dispelling my previous notions about black bears. I would not change the experience I've had working as a den watcher for the world.
North American Bear Center	207894	1	/users/profile/270595	Lori110	Volunteer	5	07/31/2014	This is my third year of volunteering for the North American Bear Center and I plan to continue! What a wonderful place! Everyone is friendly and informative.  They are dedicated to educating the public about the North American Black Bear and coexisting with them. Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield do amazing work..... Love them!
North American Bear Center	192788	5	/users/profile/143710	Mary66	Volunteer	5	01/18/2014	As soon as you walk in the doors to the NABC, you will see many smiling faces eager to answer any questions, and to guide you through the many exhibits that are at the center. These folks are eager to educate all visitors and not just information on the black bear, but a wide variety of creatures as well, polar bears, wolves etc. You will not regret your visit to the NABC!
North American Bear Center	111454	18	/users/profile/143710	Mary66	Volunteer	5	05/05/2012	The North American Bear Center has a wealth of information, but we have so  much more to learn. Even Dr. Rogers will tell you after over 44 years of research, he does not know everything about black bears. A visit to the NABC in Ely MN will be well worth your time. Please support the new Education Building. Every little bit helps. 
North American Bear Center	192787	4	/users/profile/236247	Diane90	General Member of the Public	5	01/18/2014	I have followed the work of Dr Rogers and Sue Mansfield of the NABC and the WRI in Ely, MN.  I have to say they have changed my entire view of the North American Black Bear.  Learning about how they live, what causes them to react to many things, and how to deal with being around a black bear, is so great to know.  I do not fear them, but I respect them as Dr. Rogers says, he teaches how to co-exist , yet in the realm of things he teaches how to hunt as well in a way that is most humane.  Wonderful place to see, wonderful place to learn.  
North American Bear Center	179604	3	/users/profile/236247	Diane90	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I have volunteered for years for this wonderful organization, I have learned so much, and help to educate people on the importance of co existing with our wildlife, in this case Black Bears.  I respect the work and dedication, Dr Rogers and Sue Mansfield have done.  The hours of work, and more than 250 volunteers make this a wonderful place to visit and learn.
North American Bear Center	192786	3	/users/profile/152347	Michele21	Volunteer	5	01/18/2014	As a volunteer I am so looking forward to my visit to the NABC in 2014. I can't wait to see the resident bears,Honey,Lucky,and Ted. The addition of Holly Bear in December is so exciting,and I can't wait to see how she reacts to her new "friends". I have been following the research of Dr. Lynn Rogers,and Sue Mansfield for four years now,and have learned so much about the North American Black Bear through their education,and webcams,and will continue to support them 100%. 
North American Bear Center	192777	6	/users/profile/236246	Shannon56	General Member of the Public	5	01/18/2014	This is a wonderful place to take you family for a visit a learn all about the black bear . 
North American Bear Center	179603	4	/users/profile/236246	Shannon56	Donor	5	10/18/2013	I have been watching the Ted, Honey and Lucky now for 5 years from the pond chat at NABC , This is a wonder place to learn about the black bears, and they also have a wonderful gift shop. ..
North American Bear Center	192454		/users/profile/251282	SuesanT	General Member of the Public	1	01/12/2014	Under new management, very poor experience!  We waited for over an hour to see a bear only to eventually find out they were locked up away from visitors view.  Walking around the few exhibits we had questions but no one there could answer them.  $38.00 for 4 of us, definitely not worth the money.  
North American Bear Center	192331		/users/profile/251112	JudgeGrizz	General Member of the Public	1	01/09/2014	In 2013, The bears are now locked up in small cages all day long. But when  I visited in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and all 3 bears were visible if you stayed for more than an hour. The bears now look depressed and angry .  Why ? The new staff does not appear to know how to run the place. The have scripted answers for your questions, and it feels like a museum. They call it a museum now, and ignore the needs of the resident bears.  
North American Bear Center	192008	2	/users/profile/250639	mdw20	Donor	3	01/03/2014	I rate them a 3-1/2. Well first off, I rarely rate anything with the "highest" or the "lowest".   To make it to this list it shows me that the organization has worked hard, but there is always room for improvement.  If someone gives them a "1" it shows me that it is a disgruntled employee (past or present) or unfortunately a visitor that talked to an employee that day that probably shouldn't be working there.  And if there is a "5" rating I question that because there is "always" room for improvement and I wouldn't want to close the door by the "5".  All corporations have these problems.I visited in September 2011 and found they were going through "growing" pains and employee changes.  However, the bears were well taken care of and the employees I encountered were polite and professional, even though it was an emotional day for them with "Hope".  Now with the new cub "Holly" they will face even more challenges and people that won't agree with them.  However, I believe their number "1" focus is the bears and they are trying to improve their life and surrounding forest.  It is important for people to realize these are wild animals that are not able to return to the wild because of humans.  We must remember they are not pets and try and give them a surrounding they might have had in the wild.  Takes time and patience. Let the professionals do that and outsiders can learn from it.They do need help on their live "chat" pages.   Unfortunately it is difficult for the moderators to determine who is actually interested in learning about the bears or trying to create an unstable chat room.
North American Bear Center	191656	3	/users/profile/250148	Love4thebears	Donor	5	12/26/2013	So exciting for the educational bldg. and Holly the bear cub this year!  Everyone will enjoy it!Susan999 was dissatisfied with the viewing arrangements on her trip there this month and gave a 1 star.  I hope we all can talk her into coming back again in the summer. The bears will be out and enjoying the pond and land.The antics of the new cub will be priceless! Maybe the Bear Center can give Susan999 a discount.I guarantee she will have a better experience. I have learned so much about bears in the past couple years.  Many more years of learning to come!   
North American Bear Center	191455	4	/users/profile/249939	BearilynBunroe	Client Served	5	12/24/2013	I really enjoyed the Bear Center.  The live bears do come out of their cages and walk around a beautiful natural setting.  If you are elsewhere in the Center, the loudspeaker announces when a bear is out so you don't miss it.  The day I went, they were not out the entire day but for several hours.  You can take photos of them from an outdoor bridge as well as watch them through a large indoor window with seating.   However, this place is about much more than just going to see live bears, and the occasional talk about them by a researcher.  There are many exhibits on bear behavior, including lots of videos of bears in the wild (including footage of bears in their dens via "den cams") and other materials developed by the researchers such as recordings of sounds that bears make that can be played by pressing buttons.  I also enjoyed a large exhibit on how bears are portrayed with a "fierce" image in magazines and movies, when in reality black bears just aren't that fierce.  Lots of great bear photographs taken by the researchers too.  For children, there is a whole children's room to teach about bears through touching things and other kid-friendly exhibits.  There are some very large taxidermed animals such as a moose in addition to bears.   The NABC is one way that the Wildlife Research Institute (the research arm of the Center that studies bears and reports on the findings) educates the public.  I already knew a lot about the WRI from social media, but while at the Bear Center I also had a chance to see a very nice documentary on its work with bears, which plays in the movie theater continuously.   I was also privileged to take one of the classes offered by WRI researchers and learn even more about bears.  This organization is the only one I know that is actively reaching out to the public about bears and getting them interested and involved.  Visit the NABC and you will probably learn some very cool things about bears.  This is not simply a "bear zoo" where you take your kids to look at the bears, it's more on the level of the Smithsonian or a similar educational institution, so come prepared to learn!  There are also many other ways to get information about bears from the NABC and WRI, including website updates about bears being followed by the researchers, e-mails, and social media pages.  I have loved the opportunity to challenge my beliefs about bears and learn more about these wonderful creatures!  
North American Bear Center	188545	2	/users/profile/246049	Doggiemom	Donor	5	11/14/2013	The North American Bear Center and the Wildlife Research Institute have studied the black bears of the Minnesota north woods for 40 years. Their innovative approach to working with bears without tranquilizers or invasive means has allowed them to see bears in their natural habitat and in their relationships with other bears and their own cubs. The den cams allowed, for the first time, researchers and the world to rejoice in the birth of Hope on camera. She was later murdered by a human predator. The Hope Learning Center is in her honor. This is an OUTSTANDING organization that is truly a Great Non profit and deserves the support of all who enjoy wildlife. 
North American Bear Center	186566	6	/users/profile/243575	Cyndi4	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	The den cams, websites online updates, emails, and of course the wonderful NABC building itself give so many opportunities to learn about black bears. Since the age of 3 I've loved bears.  This wonderful non-profit organization has provided so many learning opportunities. Through Dr. Rogers' and Sue Manfields research many myths have been unraveled about bears partically the ones portraying  Black Bears in a negative light. Through their education we can co-exist with these magnificent animals. I've had the opportunity to not only volunteer as a Den cam monitor but to also attend Dr. Rogers' Black Bear Field Study program.  The learning experiences that I have had are amazing.  
North American Bear Center	186355	3	/users/profile/208641	Paula32	Donor	5	10/31/2013	This organization opened my eyes to the wonderful world of black bears. I had always respected them, but NABC has educated my family and me about how the intelligent and peaceful bears are. This research group is absolutely wonderful and I have never been associated with such a highly respected organization. I am very thankful for all the wonderful work they  & I know God is blessing them. 
North American Bear Center	185597	2	/users/profile/242564	mobr	Donor	5	10/30/2013	The North American Bear Center is great non-profit providing valuable information to learn how to co-exist with these beautiful bears. I have learned more about black bears from NABC than anywhere else. The three bears at the center are loved and well cared for by a dedicated staff. I would recommend anyone who has an interest in wildlife and ecology to visit the center or their web page at www.bear.org
North American Bear Center	184449	4	/users/profile/241386	catsk9s	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	This is the most amazing animal research group. They have done so much to educate the public as to the real personalities of the North American black bear and showing us that they are gentle, shy creatures. I am a 6th grade teacher in So. Calif. The work of the NABC/WRI has been a mainstay in my science curriculum because of the real life/real time information my students have learned. I still have students from the first year the den webcams were shown (Lily and the birth of Hope) who contact me each year to tell me they too are still learning and following the bears. My students all feel they are part of the research as we all learn together. I can't say enough about Dr Rogers, Sue Mansfield and the other people with the NABC. Outstanding biologists as well as very ethical people.
North American Bear Center	184013	3	/users/profile/240951	Emma12	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	I've learned so many things about the black bear from the North American Bear Center.  This organization has taught me and countless others, how and where black bear den, what happens in the den during birth, family interactions, what bears eat & how they survive in a bad food year, how bears are not the ferocious animal that some make them out to be, how mother bears share their territory with their cubs & possibly the most valuable information they provide is, the importance of people learning to coexist with bears and how this is possible. This is just a smidgen of the information learned from the North American Bear Center. The information about black bears, that they provide is priceless. They make learning fun and interesting and I recommend them to every one I know.  
North American Bear Center	183563	2	/users/profile/240475	julesanne50	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Have had an interest in bears for many years, found the website of the North American Bear Centre on line, have learned more about bears on there than anywhere, in fact I found it so appealing I travelled from the UK just to visit the bear centre , you will not be disappointed! And of course they have the 3 resident Black Bears, Ted, Honey and Lucky, I urge anyone who wants to learn about bears to visit the Bear centre , will be going back again soon !
North American Bear Center	183476	3	/users/profile/236634	sk8bear	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I have always been drawn to bears- not sure why but Smokey the Bear was my favorite story book as a young child. I had always heard how dangerous bears were but i loved them just the same.  Then I found the NABC and started learning what bears were really about and saw and learned from Honey, Ted and Lucky firsthand how intelligent yet timid a bear could be.  Watching the bears work with enrichment toys proved how smart and curious bears are. The staff and volunteers at NABC is one of the most dedicated group of workers I have ever had the pleasure to see in action and be a very small part of. I wish i lived close enough and was wealthy enough to help them more  than i can right now.  For now I can do my online volunteering and spread the word about this wonderful organization and to teach others what they have taught me- some of it taught by the people of the NABC and some taught by the bears.  
North American Bear Center	183445	3	/users/profile/240358	Elaine V.	Donor	5	10/28/2013	The North American Bear Center is a wonderful place.   I've spent hours there watching videos of the wild bears living their lives.  The exhibits are beautifully done and very informative.  Love the one that shows all the different kinds of seeds found in a bear's scat.   When you want to take a break from the exhibits you can spend time  looking at the beautiful pond,  maybe one of the resident bears will come by. The NABC does so much to educate people about black bears.    
North American Bear Center	183374	3	/users/profile/240285	Leslie46	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	The NABC is a great nonprofit. I am a teacher in CA and thanks to Dr. Rogers, Sue Mansfield and all at the NABC our class has followed the collared black bears for 2 years. NABC gives my "city" students the opportunity to step inside the Northwoods of MN and enjoy their science lessons following the black bears.
North American Bear Center	183160	3	/users/profile/240064	volunteer169	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Excellent informative displays and videos from bears living in the wild. Highly educational facility. Staff very helpful and engaging. Live den cams are a must to see and experience. I didn't realize that hibernating bears do not sleep the whole time as we were told. Mother bears actually take care of their cubs many hours a day, in between taking naps. 
North American Bear Center	182196	5	/users/profile/238962	ourhope	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I have been a volunteer for the NABC for 2.5 years and have visited the Center on two occasions in the last three years.  The reason I am so fond and supportive of the center is due to their sense of the need for research in the  Minnesota northland and an equivalent  need for a better understanding of the black bears we have come to know.  I have found Dr. Lynn Rogers to be an ecological thinker and a guide to a modern environmental consciousness.  All the staff at the center promote coexistence as well as cohesiveness in the world regardless of species.  It is difficult to express in words the sense of knowlege as well as tranquility that the work of the center brings to those who visit and understand the work done.  Additionally, those  connected with the center stimulate an excitement about learning in visitors of all ages and locations in the world.  There is such value that their work brings; a sense of fairness and ethics sorely needed our world today. 
North American Bear Center	181594	4	/users/profile/238324	muutmuut	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	Excellent displays, information, video, current information on bears.  Live bears help you learn behavior, interactions, and food preferences.  The Center teaches with audio, visual, and sensory methods to accommodate our individual ways of learning and all ages.  The wonderful children's room contains toys, pelts, books. microscopes, a children's den.  Learn from the bear food garden outside the museum.  Walk on trails to learn plants and get a feel of the north woods.  Hoping to open next summer is an ecology addition that tells about other creatures and plants in the world of the bear.  This addition will have an interactive learning center.
North American Bear Center	181434		/users/profile/238159	FreeLily	General Member of the Public	1	10/23/2013	This "charity" preys on the lonely and vulnerable by sharing cutesy bedtime stories in their nightly update.  They are shameless in their solicitation of funds, even though the principal owns over $1,000,000 of land in the Ely area.  They are masters of manipulation.
North American Bear Center	181241	6	/users/profile/199943	Mary161	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	The North American Bear Center in Ely, MN is a state of the art educational setting to learn the truth about the American Black Bear.   There are over 60 video displays, full size bear mounts, and three living black bears who call NABC home.     Schools bring students to the Center for hands on learning.    A world wide audience watches live cameras year round that show the three bears roaming their 2.5 acre enclosed forested area.   Live cams in dens during hibernation show that bears definitely are not asleep all winter long.   The NABC has become a destination place at "the end of the road" in Ely, MN.  In 2014 the Hope Education Building will be opening, along with the Northwoods Exhibit of animals, plants, and the sounds of the north woods that the black bears would come in contact with in the wild. 
North American Bear Center	149960	1	/users/profile/199943	Mary161	Volunteer	5	02/24/2013	I am a volunteer with the North American Bear Center in Ely, MN.   Like many, I found them with the den cam placed in Lily the Black Bear's den in 2010.    I used the den cam and the daily research Updates in a class of middle school students who did not enjoy anything to do with reading.   We read about Hope each morning.   Through that connection I made my first trip to Ely and met the staff of NABC and volunteered for the Educational Outreach Program.    Teachers and educators from around the country developed curriculum, meeting Minnesota Graduation Standards, that can be taught by educators from preschool - high school levels.      This year I was able to take part in the Bear Keeper course so had direct contact with the bears, staff,  and most importantly,  visitors from around the world who came to Ely to learn about the bears.   I support the NABC and love to share what I have learned about black bears.
North American Bear Center	180949	7	/users/profile/237662	deemolean	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	The NABC provides so many fun and educational ways to learn about bears.  The web site and Center is filled with information about primarily black bears but also brown bears and polar bears.  The website has a webcam and chat line focusing on the Center's three resident bears, Ted, Lucky and Honey.  The bears have 2 1/2 wooded acres that can be observed from the deck at the Center.  The Center is filled with videos, film, photography, print information, taxidermy of bears and a woodland trail.  Opening soon is an Ecology exhibit.  
North American Bear Center	180837	6	/users/profile/184138	Deborah P.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	The North American Bear Center provides so much information and research through their bear center and website, that I have learned so much about Black Bears that I would have never learned anywhere else.  I was fortunate enough to have witnessed Jewel give birth to Fern and Herbie 2 years ago and it sparked my interest so much that I am now a volunteer.  Thank you,Deborah J Macklin
North American Bear Center	180703	5	/users/profile/237393	Judy92	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2013	A wonderful, educational organization which has taught thousands about the true nature of Black Bears.
North American Bear Center	180605	4	/users/profile/237291	Judy91	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2013	I started watching the den cam when Jewel gave birth to Herbie and Fern.  This web site has taught me so much about the Black Bear's behavior.  There are so many myths out there about these beautiful animals.  Dr. Rogers and his research staff are so full of information.  I wish these cams had been around when I was in school.  Thank you Dr. Rogers.
North American Bear Center	180335	3	/users/profile/236996	lrnewman	Donor	5	10/21/2013	I have learned so much about the North American Black Bear because of this organization. education and entertainment and now I have a deep understanding and incredible love for this majestic and often misunderstood animals. 
North American Bear Center	180296	4	/users/profile/199311	Margaret29	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	I live in New Zealand, where there are no bears, and discovered the NABC through watching the live dencams.  My interest in bears grew and I travelled to Ely to do a bear study course and visit the NABC, which certainly didn't disappoint !! Not only is it an excellent center for education (as a teacher I would love to be able to take children to there) but there are also 3 resident bears who just "do what bears do," and are absolutely fascinating to watch. Their natural habitat and freedom allows them to demonstrate the true nature of black bears and the respect with which the staff hold the bears is wonderful to see.The NABC also has an authentic welcoming environment, which is not always a "given" in wildlife centers. The displays are amazing and a lot to take in (especially when there is bear activity outside) and the staff and volunteers are friendly, informed and are ready to answer all the questions about black bears (and other wildlife) that you can ask! Because I live so far away, I have also been very appreciative of their excellent mail order service from the shop...they just can't do enough to help!I can't wait to go back to Ely, sometime in the future. And the NABC will be my first port of call when I do!!  I look forward to seeing the new Hope Learning Center and other new additions... and of course, the bears!!! 
North American Bear Center	149521	2	/users/profile/199311	Margaret29	General Member of the Public	4	02/16/2013	Rarely in adult life do you get opportunities to learn about and experience life in a way that enhances -indeed changes- your own view of the natural world. Having watched the wonderful work of Dr Lynn Rogers and Sue  Mansfield from afar ( N.Z.) via the Internet,  I was privileged last year to do their Bear-study course and while there, to visit the NABC. Nothing I can say in these few words will adequately  describe how wonderful an experience it was. Professionally, these people, and those who work and volunteer at the NABC,  are at the very top of their game, and I suspect this is due not only to their passion about bears, but also their passion about people and their desire to educate and dispel the myths - harmful to both ursine and human species- that have evolved over the centuries.Add to this excellence a whole lot if fun and humour and you will start to get a picture of the NABC /WRI. I simply can't wait to go again!
North American Bear Center	180007	6	/users/profile/236657	HelenA29	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	I first came across the NABC after watching My Family & Me on the BBC. As a result I started following the adventures of Ted E, Honey & Lucky on live cams & pond chat, which led me to volunteer as a den watcher. My first year was the winter Lucky & Ted shared a den, a fabulous introduction to the bears & their antics. Since then I have been privileged to share in the lives of these fabulous creature, even though I live in the UK. Like thousands of others I have learned about the true nature of bears from watching & recording the den cams, reading the updates and learning from the bear facts on the website & on Facebook. I am currently saving to come to Ely, to visit the NABC & see the beautiful Northwoods.
North American Bear Center	179939	1	/users/profile/236585	Dan N.	Donor	1	10/19/2013	A total waste of money. they never use the money as stated. 
North American Bear Center	179914	5	/users/profile/236561	Jan Prohaska	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2013	What a treasure to have the North American Bear Center right here in MN. I have learned so much valuable information from Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue.  The bears have a beautiful pond with waterfall for them to play in along with acres of land for them to run around in. There are only 3 bears there so there is plenty of room for then to roam around and play. Dr. Lynn Rogers is very well respected world wide by not only fans but other biologists. There is a beautiful new education wing being added onto the bear center so that even more education can go on there.
North American Bear Center	179865	4	/users/profile/236512	concernedaboutTEDLUCKYANDHONEY	Donor	1	10/19/2013	For 3 solid years, they highly encouraged all the followers to donate to Nutsonlie for Ted Lucky and Honey! They gladly accepted our donations, but they failed to mention that all those donations went directly to the Wildlife Research Institute instead, for feeding the wild bears in the research areas. The curator and staff at the NABC at the time, had to buy nuts at the local feed store in town with their own money! Deception at it's finest!
North American Bear Center	179856	4	/users/profile/236502	MissClarity	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2013	A couple years ago I began watching when Jewel (study bear) gave birth to Fern and Herbie. The experience was awesome as I had no idea bears are so gentle, caring and loving. One thing (of many) sticks out in my mind. Jewel, a first time mother, noticed Ferns left eye was not opening.  Jewel,  examined the eye several times knowing something wasn't quite right. She took her long claw and gently worked on getting the eye opened. It's important to note that had the lid not opened Fern's eye would be underdeveloped to say the least.  Fern began to cry while Jewel patiently tried to get the eye opened and then she would rest and then return to the task. One time when Fern cried, Jewel held her in her big paws, look at Fern then cradled and rock Fern so lovingly and vocalized to her little girl cub. Something happens inside a persons heart when they are so fortunate to see such a tender moment and be able to relate because, afterall, Fern cried and sounded just like a baby.  All this and so much more was shared with people all over the world on Live Bear Cam from the North American Bear Center known also as the Wildlife Research Institute in Ely, Minnesota under the guidance of Dr. Rogers who has been educating children in 500 classrooms and people all around the world via the Live Bear Cams and "Daily Updates". For 50+/-years Dr. Rogers and the wonderful volunteers have made it possible for all of us to grow in bear knowledge and our appreciation of the unique lives of bears. And what is really great is that almost everyday there is a "Daily Update" on the website and emailed to us giving the world a close and personal knowledgable experience that changes our lives in special ways. YouTube has lots of videos from the WRI (Wildlife Research Institute). Our families are surely blessed. Try it. You'll like it.
North American Bear Center	179848	4	/users/profile/152212	Allison K.	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	I love this charity and everyone involved in it. I have learnt so much about Black Bears, and other species, and the surrounding fauna. Schoolchildren go there on excursions and are warmly welcomed, and have alot of fun while learning. Being from the UK, this is my no 1 destination to visit.
North American Bear Center	179829	3	/users/profile/236475	bocoluv	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2013	I like this website. It has lots of information about black bears. I was writing a report on bears for school and got lots of information at NABC. On the bear chat, the moderators really helped with any questions I had. They make sure everyone is nice to each other on the chat. Watching the bears is my favorite part. I love watching them run around the pond and seeing them in their dens in winter. Since I started getting on this website, I have gotten lots of information and learned many cool facts about bears I would never have know. They are really organized and have very accurate information. NABC has befriended the bears they have their. I am so happy I learned about this site.
North American Bear Center	179827	3	/users/profile/236470	gsbear	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	As a charity, you can be comfortable with how the money is spent.  You are free to visit, or check on the cams or check their facebook & updates daily.  They incorporate their city & community with classes for the youth & training for adults.  Everyone is welcome.  Any questions you may have about bears can be read with their education materials or ask a moderator in the chat room.  I cannot think of a charity I feel this positive about the way the charity operates.  Love the people & of course, the bears.
North American Bear Center	179668	3	/users/profile/236314	beret.amundson	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	This is the premier facility in the world to understand and lean about North American Bears, particularly Black Bears. From the rescued Black Bears in residence, to the reading, video, pictures, and childrens center, it is not only educational, but a very fun place to visit. You will learn so much and enjoy every moment. 
North American Bear Center	179655	3	/users/profile/143780	slomoe	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	The North American Bear Center is a top shelf organization and is very well run.  I have been a volunteer for four years and I wouldn't trade it for anything I've ever done.  The staff at the bear center is second to none and extremely easy to work with and add to that the displays, the many video monitors, and the beautifully well kept grounds and you have a recipe for 100% success.  It's truly an honor to volunteer for such a fantastic organization.  
North American Bear Center	179631	6	/users/profile/236273	ComesTheDawn	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	I've never even seen a bear in the wild.  As for most people, I was taught to fear them if I ran into one in the woods. I had no knowledge of their behavior and diet, so the only conclusion I'd logically come to was my becoming a shredded lump of flesh for their lunch or dinner feast. That was the OLD me, before I stumbled upon the world of the NABC and WRI. Dr. Lynn Rogers and his assistant, biologist Sue Mansfield, possess the X-Factor that separates them from their peers.  They are visionaries who have a tireless, unrelenting passion for and dedication to the bears which is impossible to ignore.  We are sucked into the saga of the lives of these beings of the Northwoods.  The den cams are priceless pieces of education and entertainment that yearly introduces us to the newest members of the clan. We can see the cubs development during the first critical stages of life, and how Momma Bear coaxes them away from the den for the last time to tackle the outside world.  It's emotional, dramatic and bittersweet - the stuff of real life. But, most importantly for me,  I will continue to follow the bears to learn from THEM how I can be a better human.
North American Bear Center	179612	3	/users/profile/236256	MarciaBonacci	Donor	5	10/18/2013	The North Anmerican Bear Center is changing the world's view of black bears.   Their passion and commitment to teaching how to co-exist through education is inspiring.  
North American Bear Center	179593	1	/users/profile/152357	Princessthekitty	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	I have been watching Ted, Honey and Lucky at the NABC via pond cam for four years, and have been reading the Researchers updates and following the den cams of the research bears in the wild since right before Lily gave birth to Hope.  The education derived from the 3 bears at the Bear Center and the Research Bears in the wild was life changing.  I learned how intellectual and timid and mild black bears are.  Their child=rearing skills are phenomonal.  And I learned, through the 3 bears at the Center, the individual personalities and foraging habits of back bears.  I was privileged to visit the NABC last year and was very impressed with all of the exhibits.  And was able to get close to the bears on our photo shoot.  What a great experience.  The staff are so friendly and their educational talks were great.  I also donate when I am able.  I plan to go back to visit this Spring when the Hope Educational Center opens which will provide a great educational opportunity to students worldwide on the life of black bears.
North American Bear Center	111962	8	/users/profile/152357	Princessthekitty	General Member of the Public	5	05/12/2012	I have followed the NABC and WRI since Jan 2011, watching the den cam hen Hope was born.  Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield have and are doing a great job researching the lives of Shadow's clan and educating us on the truths about black bears and dismissing the myths.  Their research is known worldwide and highly respected.  I plan to visit Ely in July and visit the NABC.  I have learned so much from this research.  Both the NABC and WRI are doing a great job educating about black bears.
North American Bear Center	179546	1	/users/profile/199125	Maureen K.	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	Plan to spend at least two days at the North American Bear Center in Ely, MN. The Staff and Volunteers are happy to assist you. Stay for the presentations. Meander around at your own pace. Everything you ever wanted to know about Black Bears is available on site. Books, videos, exhibits. For Adults and Children alike. Bring the whole family. And the most amazing experience of all.... observing live Black Bears in their habitat. If you aren't familiar with Ted, Honey and Lucky, go to the Facebook Page: Lily the Black Bear. You're in for a surprise, a treat. The North American Bear Center was created by Dr. Lynn Rogers, world-renowned Biologist and wild Black Bear researcher, who also specializes in field study of these amazing, beautiful creatures. Come to Ely, MN. Visit NABC. You won't forget it.
North American Bear Center	149422	2	/users/profile/199125	Maureen K.	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2013	Several years ago, through the technology of web cams, a website and a Facebook Page, more than a 100,000 people (and growing), worldwide, were introduced to the habitat and behaviors of Black Bears. Beyond the inaccurate media hype of terror and aggression, Dr. Lynn Rogers showed us a new reality of life in the Northwoods with these mostly gentle creatures. Through videos made by the BBC, we learned more about Black Bear families and how to co-exist with them. Education is the key. The North American Black Bear Center provides "Education Boxes" to Teachers for a nominal rental fee. The contents bring information about Black Bears right into the classroom. If you can make the trip to Ely, visit the NABC. It is similar to a Natural History Museum dedicated to these animals. Meet Ted E. Bear, Honey and Lucky, the outdoor Black Bears that live on protected ground year round. Visit the web cams on the Wildlife Research Institute website to see Lily and her two cubs born last month. Check out Jewel and her two yearlings, Herbie and Fern. And there's always the Pond Bears that live on the premises. I have learned more about Black Bears from Dr. Rogers than I have from any TV program or books. The reason behind that is Dr. Rogers, via cams and his ongoing research, let's the Bears teach us themselves. What a wonderful experience!
North American Bear Center	179544	2	/users/profile/236189	jmherzog56	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I can not even begin to tell you how the NABC has changed the views of many people regarding the Black Bear.  What a wonderful Center to visit.  So much information and well presented.  The area for the kids is wonderful.  The new addition of the Hope Learning Center will be such an asset to the town of Ely, the State of Minnesota and the world.  So many visitors to the center from all over the World.  I commend the staff for a great job in presenting the North American Black Bear.  What a beautiful animal, misunderstood by many, but with the NABC, we are all learning the truth about these beautiful animals.
North American Bear Center	179529	2	/users/profile/236176	minisbears	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	We as a family have visited the NABC twice....both visits were wonderful The exhibits are very educational and interesting. The theatre area for viewing the resident bears is wonderful, and the theatre area for viewing the 'BearWalker' video is superb. We enjoyed the outdoor viewing area for the bears. My family is certainly looking forward to future visits to see the progress on the new educational wing that is currently being built. The children's room is awesome...a wonderful area for young children to learn about the American Black Bear and various wildlife from the area. The various video stations showing actual bear behavior in the wild are such a great visual tool. A special treat was the time we actually got to meet Dr. Lynn Rogers while at the NABC...thanks to him and his unique approach to studying the bears the world can learn to appreciate and co-exist with these beautiful creatures. 
North American Bear Center	179520	2	/users/profile/236165	bakerykris	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	This research of black bears has taught me and my family how to co-exist with black bears.  The importance of understanding these beautiful animals and the continuing education will only benefit both bear and humans.  Learning about the lives of black bears has brought better knowledge to the world and shows the importance of black bears existence and much needed protection.  These research bears have changed many minds of their reputation from negative to being positive thoughts.   
North American Bear Center	179461	2	/users/profile/96769	Deb Wells	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	The North American Bear Center (NABC) is a top notch non-profit organization whose passion for what they do shines through in the outstanding quality of their work.  The NABC has educated people across the world about the true behaviors of black bears & has helped to dispel many myths about this misunderstood animal.  The NABC has also teamed up with teachers to develop a fabulous educational outreach program to take the things taught at the NABC into school classrooms.  The materials include a curriculum map, lesson plans, interdisciplinary ideas, as well as black bear boxes to provide a hands on experience for the students.  I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to volunteer for this organization for the past several years, as every time I am there it is an enriching experience in which I learn something new!
North American Bear Center	179437	2	/users/profile/236083	Jacki T.	Donor	5	10/18/2013	This organization conducts research and education on the real lives of black bears.  This is done in a unique way through observation and a mutual respect.  By having live den cams, the public has witnessed live births, nurturing, and family development not previously known.  The den cams are used in many elementary schools as part of a black bear educational plan.  NABC has dispelled the belief that black bears are aggressive and to be feared.  NABC is also a valuable member of the Minnesota and Ely communities bringing in tourist dollars and support.
North American Bear Center	179405	2	/users/profile/236053	Juliejules	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	Having fear of Black Bears as a child on in to adulthood. I found the North American Bear Center. The education about bears here is GREAT! Not only do they teach you about bears but also about the  life bears live and how to live with them. 
North American Bear Center	179389	2	/users/profile/236036	Kimberly55	Donor	5	10/18/2013	A valuable educator and teacher about the ecology of Minnesota and the black bear. Donors have formed a community that supports one another, as well as, the North American Bear Center.
North American Bear Center	179335	3	/users/profile/235979	luvbears	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	Since I found this organization about 5 years ago I found it very valuable educationaland enjoyable on so many levels. Learning about black bear behaviorsAnd their lives in General has helped me learn the true nature aboutthese beautiful animals and lessen my fears about them.  The researchersare wonderful and compassionate.  I have since become a volunteer and feela part of this non-profit organization and it's fun too. I feel it truly deservesa high status as a great non-profit 
North American Bear Center	179326	4	/users/profile/235969	Clarebear	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	Living as a transport from the city to bear country of PA, we were petrified when we met our new neighbors .... bears!  After many nuisance phone calls to our local game commission with complaints, we researched and found www.bear.org.  We have learned so much about bears, their demeanor, meanings of their actions, their habitat, vocalizations, and much much more.  The den cams were the most educational tool afforded to the public to view in real time.  World wide viewing of the den cams is an amazing resource to learn about black bears, and the North American Bear Center is responsible for this wonderful education and opportunity for us to get to know our neighbors.  We now co-exist in the beautiful bear country mountains of PA, and look forward to my third visit to Ely, MN.  Thank you to the NABC for the continued education of black bears, and sharing your research studies and the den cams with us all.  
North American Bear Center	179316	1	/users/profile/235958	Livelife	General Member of the Public	1	10/18/2013	Not a very good experience. The bears are in cages most of the time. The staff were not helpful at all. Displays look dated. I read the number one reason for the death of bears is murder, ie hunting! The way it was worded was incorrect in my opinion. Correct me if I am wrong but isn't a non-profit meant to be neutral and not be for or against ?
North American Bear Center	179266	3	/users/profile/235906	Janet79	Donor	5	10/18/2013	The North American Bear Center and it's sister organization, The Wildlife Research Institute, are leaders in educating the public about all bears, and in particular the North American Black Bear that live around the Bear Center's headquarters in Ely, Minnesota.  NABC/WRI have used cameras in hibernating bear's dens to broadcast live births over the internet.  These "den cams" have reached hundreds of thousand of viewers world wide and have been broadcast to numerous classrooms throughout the United States.  School children learn about black bears through packets that that the NABC provides to their teachers.  Additionally, the NABC uses Facebook to update the public daily on the activities of the bear's in it's research study.  These particular research bears have GPS collars and are followed by Dr. Lynn Rogers or his associate biologist Sue Mansfield.  The researchers have earned the bears' trust through non-aggressive means and they can walk with the bears to study them.  They change the batteries in the bears' collars by simply offering a handful of nuts and gentle words.  Many hours are spent learning about bear behavior and building a repetoire with individual bears.  Not all bears will allow the researchers to walk with them, even though they may have known them since birth.  It depends on bear personalities, just like humans!The NABC and WRI websites have tons of information available to the public about all species of bears and can answer almost every question you can think of from what bears like to eat, to what they really do all winter long in their dens.  The NABC has a unique center that the public can tour and see exhibits and three beautiful bears that live on-site.  Ted, Honey, and Lucky will steal your heart with their antics.This is such a great non-profit organization and I recommend you make a donation to the North American Bear Center.
North American Bear Center	179217	3	/users/profile/235857	Linda228	Donor	5	10/18/2013	The North American Bear Center is a wonderful nonprofit organization and deserves to be recognized for their truthful knowledge about black bears.   They use this knowledge to teach people all over the world about the black bears. 
North American Bear Center	179199	3	/users/profile/235839	JasD	Donor	5	10/17/2013	The knowledge shared by the NABC is very important.  Black bears have been misunderstood for a long time, and many have met tragic deaths due to this.  This is a unique educational organization with a wealth of facts to spread worldwide.  Its use of technology (live streaming video and live chat for instance) is effective in reaching people of all ages and countries. There is so much passion and dedication demonstrated daily by the volunteers and regular staff. Actually watching bears go about being bears on a daily basis is amazing.
North American Bear Center	179192	3	/users/profile/235830	sjstark	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	The North American Bear Center (NABC)  is an exceptional nonprofit organization!  The organization provides accurate and very educational information about black bears and other wildlife not only at the  NABC site in Ely but also through schools and social media.  They have an exceptionally well-organized volunteer organization that provides a variety of volunteer opportunities - you can help out any way you want, for any amount of time, and from any location in the world and you can be assured that you will be working with other volunteers who are very enthusiastic and extremely well-informed.  I can't say enough about this organization!
North American Bear Center	179167	2	/users/profile/143845	Laurie6241	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	The NABC offers excellent educational facts about not only the Black Bear but other bear species as well.  The numerous constantly playing video clips of the various aspects of bear behavior have opened my perception of what bears really do - and that they actually like to play and are intriguing to watch!  The three resident bears - Honey, Ted and Lucky - are in a very natural and wild environment.  When the staff interact with them for the bear enrichment, it's done in a way that the bears are not 'showing off' as if in a circus, but to show how they would react to the item if found in the wild.  There is SO much information offered that I find I learn something new each time I'm there, and there are constant upgrades/improvements each time as well. I see they now have a 'pet relief' area which is a nice amenity when traveling with pets, and the Hope Learning Center will be completed soon with more exhibits and state of the art learning tools - very anxious to see it all put together!!!  I am a member, will continue to give my support because I believe there is still a lot we don't know about bears and the NABC provides that newly found information.  I encourage friends and family to check it out!
North American Bear Center	179155	3	/users/profile/235796	ChristineW	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	I am one of the North American Bear Center's biggest fans.  They have so many beautiful, educational exhibits there. They have a children's room where the kids can learn so much about bears. Lynn Roger's research is so very important to teach the world to co exist with black bears. I highly recommend to anyone to make a visit there....Well worth the trip!!! 
North American Bear Center	178908	2	/users/profile/144001	cubbiesRcute	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	 My husband and i have spent over 35 years canoeing in the Boundary Waters  Canoe Area Wilderness. While we have both desired and feared an opportunity to see a black bear in the wild we have yet to come across one.  We happened to be in Ely during the  opening of the NABC. The information available then challenged all our beliefs(fears) about black bears. The Center has grown incredibly and now, with the den cams, the many videos, the expanded displays and the huge amount of  research-backed educational information available to anyone who walks thru the doors our desire to be able to observe a black bear - preferably a mother with cubs - in the wild has increased!    In the meantime, our frequent visits to Ely include stops at the NABC to visit  and learn more from the friendly staff  and the  volunteer  Bear Educators.  We don't miss a chance to watch, learn and smile at the antics and behaviors of Ted, Lucky and Honey. These bears seem to become more entertaining each visit. Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield have provided the world with such  a large and growing  base of information . The not-yet-completed Hope Education Center will be a fantastic place for educators and learners alike. i can hardly wait to see it filled with groups of curious children and adults! 
North American Bear Center	111768	14	/users/profile/144001	cubbiesRcute	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	The amount of bear related education at the NABC is amazing! All my life i had been under the misconceptions that many people learned about black bears. I had always been afraid. Now based on the scientific research available at the NABC and online thru the website, i would like nothing better than to have a bear wander through my yard or campsite. The information is myth-busting! Black bear behavior has been misunderstood for so long. They are not the vicious, aggressive creatures portrayed on sports magazines. That concept arises from long-held fears, not from documented facts.  The bear center is a wonderful place with a growing education outreach program!
North American Bear Center	178869	3	/users/profile/235496	sarahssophia	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I have known of Lynn Roger's work over the past 30 years.  I have always been curious of more respectful techniques of approaching the study of animals.  As a Montessori teacher, our greatest gift as a guide to the children we work with is observation from knowledgeable principals and honest assessment, even when the children prove us off course in our understanding.  I have watched and read his body of work over these years and have learned so much about the behavior of the NA Black Bear and the growth of his respectful approach through observation and walking with the bear community...peaceful coexistance.The work of Sue Mansfield and the NABC continue to reveal the true behavior of this magnificent animal we live so closely with here in Minnesota. As a teacher it opened up the eyes and hearts of the children/students I work with from preschool to Jr. High.  The 5 & 6 year olds followed the den cam over the years writing stories and illustrating pictures of the bear family.  They eventually wrote a play called, "Little bear takes a walk" from a 1970's story book.  It was complete with Dr. Rogers calling out, "It's me bear" and much more about the life in a MN woodland.  The upper elementary children worked cross level with the "bear box" exploring the videos, reading the books,  writing from their own experience and discovering new research and truths.  One of the greatest gifts of the NABC work is how children can practice the scientific method by choosing a topic, observing the behavior, document their observation, discuss and come to conclusions.  Our whole school community participates in activities and residencies at our Land School.  We have corridors that bear pass through at the LS and are developing a program of education with the help of the NABC/WRI and its amazing body of research and observations.  It is not only informative but playful and enjoyable for the children to study.   Our goal is that of Lynn's...peaceful co-existence here in MN and elsewhere with the North American Black Bear beginning with education.  We would have never gone so far without the NABC and Lynn/Sue's work.  This is an amazing organization.
North American Bear Center	178826	3	/users/profile/235448	chpasterski	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	I teach in the Green Bay Area Public School District and I use the Den cams as a teaching tool for students.  The students absolutely love the NABC and WRI websites.  There is an unbelievable amount of resources available that are fun ways to learn for students.  Recently I had the opportunity to bring a couple of students to North American Bear Center.  The staff there is phenomenal and the center has great exhibits.  The students learned the truth about bears and about the fabulous research that is being done.  I wish that every student had the opportunity to experience this wonderful place that is in Ely!
North American Bear Center	178738	3	/users/profile/235365	signcutter	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I have volunteered for the North American Bear Center for about two years now. I first learned about the research of Dr. Rogers long before there was an internet or den cams! I read some of his research on bears when I was in college studying wildlife management. I was impressed with his study methods, which were so different than those used by other scientists. And, he was getting results! His methods worked better than the old tranquilize, test, and release methods, in my opinion. Plus, it was much less stressful on the animal. I have followed his research since then. When the den cams became popular, I was able to share them with my students, who loved watching wild bears raising their young. The den cams were a hit with kids.  I think that the staff at NABC are some of the most dedicated, hard-working researchers I know. If I did not agree with their study methods, I would not be a volunteer. However, I love volunteering here and I support the research completely. I started volunteering by making a set of playing cards for the Black Bear Boxes, which are educational boxes that schools can borrow for their classrooms. I then joined as a volunteer both for the Speakers' Bureau and the Bear Facts and Fun Games group online. I write a weekly educational (and fun) short piece on bears, which is posted on the Facebook page of Lily the Black Bear.  I thoroughly enjoy volunteering for the NABC. They have a large group of very dedicated volunteers worldwide. This is an absolutely amazing and fine group to be a part of. I plan to continue volunteering for them for a long time to come. 
North American Bear Center	178648	3	/users/profile/235277	lwaters12	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	The American Bear Center quite literally saved my sanity.  Having booked a holiday from Britain to spend a month with my father, a resident of Ely, he sadly died before I arrived.  Donna Rogers and the staff at the center offered me the chance to work with them for the month.  For my grief stricken step-mother and I, it became a sanctuary to which I ran too every morning.  I will be eternally grateful for their kindness and the extraordinary experience very few people from England ever get the chance to have.  I tell everyone at the High school I work at, at any opportunity, all about the brilliant work that goes on and my office has become a shrine to three of the most beautiful creatures that I have ever had the fortune to share my time with.  I am very proud of my bear educator certificate and will treasure it always.  I hope to return as soon as I can to carry on as a volunteer.
North American Bear Center	178597	2	/users/profile/235227	Tracy52	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I was a den watcher for a year and wanted to make the trip to Minnasota. Just to see the North American Bear Center. So I did  sure glad I made the trip learned so much about the studies and how important  they are. Already planning another trip can't wait well worth it.
North American Bear Center	149437	3	/users/profile/199163	HSinMN	Volunteer	5	02/14/2013	I have never been involved with a group of people more dedicated to a cause than those that work for and with the North American Bear Center.  The researchers, curators, educators and service staff are amazingly devoted to their work and to educating the general public about the American Black Bear and its place in our environment.  So often we forget that we humans are the ones who continue to infringe on the habitat of all species of wildlife - and it is so rare to find an organization with no motivation other than to help us all learn how to respect our environment and all of the creatures that share it.  As stated on the Center's website (www.bear.org), "The mission of the non-profit North American Bear Center is to advance the long-term survival of bears worldwide by replacing misconceptions with scientific facts about bears, their role in ecosystems, and their relations with humans."  It is fascinating work and I am honored to learn from those who do it and support them with my contributions. 
North American Bear Center	149418	3	/users/profile/143704	mbear	Volunteer	5	02/14/2013	I am a proud supporter of the NABC/WRI and have been a volunteer for the NABC/WRI since 2010.  I have learned so much about black bears and continue to learn something every day.  Thank you Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield!  My fear has changed to respect - I marvel at the interaction between bears that I have observed and learned from.

I have learned so much about black bears,especially replacing misconceptions with scientific facts about bears, their role in ecosystems, and their relations with humans. I lean something new everyday thanks to Dr. Lynn Rogers,and Sue Mansfield. I'll be in Ely this July for the 4th annual Lily picnic and to see the new "Hope Learning Center".

North American Bear Center	145401	6	/users/profile/149957	Corynorhinus	General Member of the Public	5	11/30/2012	Fantastic operation on low budget.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff and top quality exhibits with true bear information gleaned from first hand research not inferred from remote samples and prevailing opinion.  My traditionally taught biological training was challenged and I walked away all the better for it.  Please help support their critical mission.  I can't think of a more dynamic organization!
North American Bear Center	111898	12	/users/profile/152178	sleepy812	General Member of the Public	5	05/11/2012	Kara asked where the money went.  Its never been a secret.  At first the money went towards the huge debt for the existing facilities.  Even before that was fully paid off a program was started to provide support for teachers in the classroom to educate students about black bears.  Currently money is being raised for a new building to further support that education.  Most of the staff are unpaid volenteers and even Dr Rogers recieves only a very modest salary.  Its certainly not enough for the countless hours he devotes to bears.  This is a great organization that has lready accomplished a lot and will continue to accomplish much more.
North American Bear Center	111896	9	/users/profile/152294	dazzle	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	This non-profit ranks among the unique. The leaders, researchers, work 7 da/wk and easily 12-14 hrs./da. so that others will understand the important niche the American Black Bear holds in the world of wildlife and how humans can learn to co-exist with them. There are no big salaries or performance vehicles, only hours of forest trekking, data compiling and communication. The NABC is among the finest of non-profits-a gem of integrity and "do onto others".

Exhibits, lots of information, a cub room for kids and their three residents, Ted, Honey and Lucky. Three happy bears that live in one of the most beautiful natural enclosures one can find in the world. I visited last year and this summer I will cross the ocean again from Spain to visit the NABCs and meet its wonderful staff. Bear lovers with the mission to educate the world about the true nature of black bears. 
North American Bear Center	111817	13	/users/profile/143925	Julie42	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	Last year i had the pleasure of visiting the N.A.B.C, It was a wonderful experience, the staff were more than helpful, so much to do and see, its not until you go there you realise how much you dont know about bears ! I learnt so much! seeing the 3 captive bears was the highlight for me, they have  a wonderful natural area in which to forage like wild bears and a lovely pond too. I cant praise this organisation enough and i hope they get more visitors to learn about the wonderful Black Bear . I will be going back again this year! I live in the UK and it is worth the trip on so many levels, thank you Dr Lynn Rogers and his Biologist Sue Mansfield for giving me the chance to learn !
North American Bear Center	111763	6	/users/profile/152172	lovesbears	Volunteer	1	05/10/2012	I found them to be inconsistent with what they tell you, always begging for money and yet the money does not seem to go for what they tell you initially. And be careful of the supporters still there for if you disagree, they name call, tell you to leave , and try to ruin you. The researchers and those involved are shrouded in secrecy and always telling volunteers not to tell anyone what you see like during hunting season when they were trying to keep hunters away and during trips to the center where you are allowed to kiss and touch the bears.  
North American Bear Center	111750	17	/users/profile/152153	Kandiyohi	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	I've been to the North American Bear Center and I fully support their mission - to educate people about black bears.  Dr. Lynn Rogers, Sue Mansfield and all the staff at the Bear Center are passionate about black bears and it shows.  A previous reviewer, here Kara Johanson, is a former "disgruntled" moderator on Lily the Black Bear's Facebook page, who along with a few others, were let go from their moderating duties due to their extreme power trips.  People complained about them, and they were let go, to start fresh with the FB page.  "Kara" also known as Jill Wheaton Lindsay, has now made it her mission to find every outlet she can to discredit Lynn Rogers' work and slander him.  It's called slander and harassment Jill.  If you're not careful, you just might find yourself in an embarassing situation and in a bit o' trouble.  ;)  Your first mistake was accidentally "outing" yourself.  LOL
North American Bear Center	111726	5	/users/profile/143689	Kara J.	Donor	1	05/10/2012	If their expenses are only a third of their revenue, something is very questionable.  Where does the rest of the money go and why do they keep begging for more?

Washburn Center for Children	47709	3	/users/profile/48438	gogo	General Member of the Public	5	07/03/2010	My daughter has worked at different non-profits throughout the years. She did an internship at Washburn & was ecstatic to be hired on permanently!  Her work (crisis/trauma therapy) is challenging, to say the least, but she thoroughly enjoys the organization & the teamwork & support of her co-workers. Finally getting through to a client, or having one huge success story, recharges her drive & stamina so she can dedicate 110% to every child or family. Washburn provides a tight-knit structure of dedicated professionals who take pride in themselves, each other, & their jobs in the organization they represent.

We were afraid he would do some very serious things if he was not stopped.  We were so lucky to find a wonderful therapist who had a whole program for young children who were fascinated by fire. After finishing the program, he lost his focus on fire.  This was priceless to us!!!

Washburn Center for Children	46159	4	/users/profile/47038	kmiller1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2010	Bloomington Public Schools in collaboration with Fairview, Children's Dental Services, and Washburn Center for Children has opened a clinic in one of the District's Early Chilhdood Family Center site which I am coordinator. Washburn has a psychologist on site serving children 0 to 5. The psychologist has been wonderful in her involvement with our students and families including being open and effective with referrals made by teachers or through our early childhood screening process. Parents and staff have expressed many times how much help they have received from asking questions of the psychologist, having her visit their classrooms to do observations, talking to parents, and advising. Before when a concern about a child arised we had only early childhood special education for support which did not always meet the particular emotional/social needs of certain children. Now ECSE and Washburn work very close together in meeting needs for the very young children and thier parents. On behalf of staff and parents we applaud Washburn!

Building stronger communities takes caring, nuturing and supporting one child at a time, I'm thankful that Washburn has such a dedicated staff to ensure this support continues for another 127 years.

Washburn staff continued to see her children. This seriously mentally ill woman has worked hard to maintain her mental health and raise happy, healthy and productive children. Over the years she, I and Washburn staff have kept in contact and made efforts to help this family reach their goals. Today  her son has graduated high school and  her daughter is in graduate school training to be a psychologist.
Washburn Center for Children	45323	9	/users/profile/46216	lindseylsmith	Volunteer	5	06/24/2010	I had the opportunity to volunteer for Washburn's annual golf tournament.  I didn't know much about the organization prior to the event, but throughout the experience I was able to learn a great deal about the organization.  As a teacher I have always wished for a way for my students who are in need of counseling services, but do not have the means to attain this, to have a place to turn toward for help.  I now know that Washburn Center for Children is this place.  I am so impressed with their staff, and the passion that lies within each one of them to help children gain what they need so that they are able to experience greater success in other facets of their lives.

Washburn Center for Children	44465	5	/users/profile/45351	steppingstone11	Volunteer	5	06/18/2010	I began volunteering for Washburn because they do work that is near and dear to my heart-- treating children's mental health issues similar to those experienced by my stepson.  I have CONTINUED working with Washburn because I have learned that they are top in their field, setting standards in children's mental health especially related to the treatment of childhood trauma.  They are an extremely well-run organization that provides essential interventions to children that truly turn their lives around.  Washburn's services SAVE THE COMMUNITY MONEY by improving troubled children's ability to live normal, productive lives vs. failing in school and entering the juvenile justice system.  The earlier a child receives help for behavioral and emotional problems, the better their prognosis and ability to turn their lives around.  Washburn works closely with families to involve parents in their children's mental health by improving parenting skills and linking to other necessary family services.  Washburn provides services to families at all levels of society--suburban, urban, poor and well-to-do.  They are a crucial community resource.
Washburn Center for Children	44464	7	/users/profile/45350	trisha3	Former Volunteer	5	06/18/2010	I had an internship with the Family Focus program at Washburn in 2008. I saw firsthand the positive outcomes and changes in the children and their families' lives. In this field one sees small steps toward postive change.However at Washburn I saw significant major changes in family interactions and the reduction of stress and concerning behaviors for children.  I believe it is the skilled interventions and techniques the staff utilized with children and caregivers that made the difference. Currently I use the knowledge and skills  gained at Washburn in my work with families and will continue to do so as long as they remain effective.

In delving deeper into the history and performance of this agency, I am astonished that more people don't know about it and that they consistently have such strong and profound impact on the mental health of children in our community. Of course, their work touches EVERYONE, not just clients/participants. This planning process is but one example of the way that the organization planfully and proactively approaches their role in meeting the unmet needs of the community. With all this great success, Washburn stands head and shoulders above many other players in this field and I think that plans to capitalize on the good will that the success engenders - maintaining contact with those served by the organization and those who previously served as volunteers - will take the fund development and community relations efforts to an even higher level of success. Congratulations, and keep shooting for the stars!

Washburn Center for Children	43943	7	/users/profile/44838	washburn	Board Member	5	06/14/2010	I have served on several Boards but none that spoke to the heart as much as Washburn Center for Children. It can be most difficult for people to understand the needs of a child when the illness can not be seen. It is easy to recognize the need for a hearing aid, or food, or clothing, however the need for mental help is often gone without notice. Without the help of Washburn more children would go through life with less happiness and more pain due to trauma. I have seen first hand the results of healing due to the care of the Washburn team and I thank God for their work. Susan St. James

The Wildcat Sanctuary	286488		/users/profile/265738	fortheloveofanimals	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Giving Back to The Wildcat Sanctuarywww.wildcatsanctuary.orgI am a longtime volunteer at The Wildcat Sanctuary (TWS) in Sandstone, Minnesota.  The Wildcat Sanctuary is a 501c3 non-profit, no-kill big cat rescue.  The mission of TWS is to provide a natural sanctuary to wild cats in need and inspire change to end the captive wildlife crisis.  I have had the pleasure of helping with many tasks at the sanctuary, from building enclosures to cleaning to making fire hose hammocks to picking up tiger poop.  Every task I do, I know I am making life better for a big cat whose previous life was most often filled with abuse and neglect.During a particularly heavy snowfall in northern Minnesota, the cats enclosures had over three feet of snow in them.  The tigers residing at the sanctuary dont mind the cold and snow but the lions (there were three at the time) tend to spend more time inside during the winter months.  (Each animal can escape extreme weather in a temperature controlled building.)  You can imagine when a tiger walks in new fallen snow they immediately create a path.  Well, the same would be true for a lion, if they would actually walk in the snow.  So, in order to coax the lions outside, we had to go into their large enclosure and shovel paths for them.  (Anytime people are in an outdoor enclosure the cats are safely shut in their indoor enclosure.)As I shoveled lots and lots of snow to make the paths, I thought, I am an average size woman shoveling a path for a 400 lb. lion!  I affectionately say the lions are big babies in the winter; but I really know that this is due to fact that they are an African species.  Of all the shoveling I have done as a Minnesota native, shoveling snow for lions is the only time I have gotten excited about shoveling.After we finished shoveling the snow, and the lions were let back into their outdoor enclosure, they immediately investigated every inch of their new path.  It was so gratifying to see them happily exploring and romping in the fresh snow.   Its an honor and a pleasure to give back by volunteering at The Wildcat Sanctuary.  Its hard, gratifying work and I am so grateful this wonderful sanctuary for big cats resides in Minnesota.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	203708	3	/users/profile/265738	fortheloveofanimals	Donor	5	06/25/2014	My first introduction to The Wildcat Sanctuary was in Isanti.  I sponsored a big cat and along with that sponsorship came an exclusive tour of the sanctuary.  On my ride up for the tour, I remember thinking, I hope this is a reputable sanctuary and I wont be disturbed by what I see.  I know that all sanctuaries are not what they claim to be.  Sure the photos on the TWS website looked great, but websites may not be a true reflection of a place. Upon arriving at TWS, I was thrilled to find out that Tammy Thies was giving the tour!  The Executive Director and Founder of the sanctuary had made time in her day to spend with me!  After that first visit to TWS I was moved by the mission of the organization, impressed by all they were doing for the cats and completely wowed by Tammys commitment and dedication.  From that point on, TWS became a top favorite cause of mine.   Over the years, I have been a financial supporter of TWS as well as introduced others to TWS. Tammy possesses the expertise to lead the sanctuary into the future.  She is respected nationally for her knowledge and skills, for which she is called upon frequently.  Minnesota is very fortunate to be home to this sanctuary that not only provides the best home for life possible for formerly unwanted and abused big cats, but serves as a resource for the entire country.  This has all been built and accomplished under the leadership of Tammy Thies.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	204495	1	/users/profile/266514	Marie_Schoubert	Donor	5	06/28/2014	My husband and I have been donors to The Wildcat Sanctuary for many years now. We volunteer for another Wild cat sanctuary in another State where we live, so the best we can do to help such a wonderful organization and woman that we admire as Tammy is to give our support through donations.  My husband uses his company matching  program (X3) every year. We know how close Tammy is to all the cats and how much she cares for them. We love her news letter and website which brings us even closer to her and all the animals. We specially appreciate her handwritten personal thank you notes for our contributions. We wish The Wildcat Sanctuary all the best and hope one day we can make it to help them as well. Marie S
The Wildcat Sanctuary	203726	3	/users/profile/265768	Lisa356	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I have been a fan and a donor of The Wildcat Sanctuary for about 10 years now.  This organization is the epitome of what a exotic cat sanctuary should be.  The care and love the cats receive is next to none and I am particularly fond of their ever expanding enrichment program.  They also help educate people that these animals belong in the wild and not in our homes.  If we are to save wild cats, we need to save where they live and not breed for captivity.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	203705	3	/users/profile/135923	wildcatadvocate	Donor	5	06/25/2014	I have been both a donor and a volunteer for TWS for many years.  Ive seen them go from a small organization in Isanti County years ago to the large, nationally recognized and accredited sanctuary they are today in Pine County, MN.  Having been a Senior Keeper at one of the top sanctuaries in the country, I have had a lot of personal experience knowing what helps rescued wild cats thrive.  For TWS, that has always been their #1 goal.  Their cats enjoy huge natural, free-roaming habitats  something few sanctuaries have the luxury of providing.  They receive excellent preventative veterinary care and no expense is spared when a cat is sick or in need.  Habitat improvement, expansion, and new construction to provide even more for the cats is never-ending.  When TWS went through a rapid growth cycle, there were management issues that could have been handled better. As with so many sanctuaries, its difficult to be an expert at caring for wild cats and be an expert business manager, too. But, new much-needed policies have been put in place to assure donors that sound business practice management is a priority.  Many have watched the organization grow, watched the rescued cats thrive, watched the education and lobbying efforts pay off, and watched the social media fanbase top one million.  For those, its been extremely rewarding to support this wonderful charity.  For those who have just found TWS, I truly believe the best is yet to come! 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102813	2	/users/profile/135923	wildcatadvocate	Donor	5	01/03/2012	I learned about The Wildcat Sanctuary almost 10 years ago.  I've watched this sanctuary grow from having less than 20 rescued wildcats to now well over 100.  What has impressed me the most is that they have stepped up to take in rescues when no one else would.  They did so without fanfare, expecting nothing in return except the peaceful recovery of these abused, injured souls.  Since they're not open to the public, since they are a true sanctuary of solitude, it's not as easy to raise the funds they need like other organizations and zoos.  But they won't compromise the animals' need for peace, not to be disturbed by visitors.  It means they work doubly hard to provide the wonderful habitats, the nourishing food and healthcare that their rescues need.  The staff are all the most compassionate people I've ever met.  They work through some of the harshest weather conditions, drive across the country and back, non-stop, to pick up rescues, come up with the most innovative and exciting forms of enrichment for their cats, take in some of the worst cases when no one else will, and do it all on a small, tight budget.  Their dedication and drive to educate the public about the danger of having wild cats as pets is also impressive.  I have been a donor to this organization for many years because I've personally seen a tiger that has been starved, nearly to death, now swimming, chuffing, running with reckless abandon, happy to be alive, all because of the keepers' love.  The animals come first, no matter what, and that is what convinced me that this place is so special.  I'm proud to be a supporter of such an amazing organization!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	198981	2	/users/profile/259811	GoWildcats77	General Member of the Public	2	04/25/2014	http://www.ag.state.mn.us/PDF/PressReleases/AssuranceOfDiscontinua20140422.pdf This organization is a great advocate for neglected, abused and abandoned wildcats, however, its reputation has been tarnished by this investigation.  By removing the people responsible for this mess, then and only then can this wonderful organization rebuild its reputation and become the sanctuary it used to be.  New people, more structure and accountability, and full transparency are needed in order to regain the trust of its loyal donors and the general public.  The reason for the rating is that I will not donate to this organization until there is trust that the donations will not be used inappropriately, but The Wildcat Sanctuary has and will eventually have a great impact in the future.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	142370	1	/users/profile/139388	deludewig	Donor	5	11/25/2012	A great group whose priority continues to be what's best for the "critters". 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104627	1	/users/profile/139388	deludewig	Donor	5	01/26/2012	At time of first contact with TWS they still offered sponsor tours, and that was all it took to convince me the cats were "in good (great) hands". Since that time, the facility upgrades, enthusiasm of the staff, cat updates, and the many events/fundraisers continue to indicate to me that providing the best possible environment for the cats is their #1 priority. A REALLY GREAT group/organization that i am happy/proud to support!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135775	1	/users/profile/181660	MonicaC	Donor	5	11/08/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary does so much for so many animals with the most effective use of resources I've  seen in my decades of philanthropy.  I will never forget hearing the lead keeper describe how Sabrina the tiger, who was found unconcious after her (private) owner passed away and arrived at the Sanctuary terrified of people, turned to her one day and "chuffed" a greeting.  Just one of many miraculous rescues they have accomplished.  Truly a privilege to be connected to them. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135456	1	/users/profile/181318	Thad D.	Donor	5	11/08/2012	I first learned about TWS from the Best Friends magazine, after which I looked into the organization myself.  Around the same time, I watched the documentary, "The Elephant in the Living Room," and I was so moved by plight of those captive wild animals and TWS' mission to not only find a better "home" for animals in similar conditions but to end the practice altogether that I immediately became a fan.  I particularly like the fact that TWS is not open to the public, endeavoring instead to give those animals as close to a wild existence as they can get. They are no long gawked at or used as some sideshow exhibit to make money, but actually get the chance to be wild cats.  I also checked TWS on Guidestar before donating, and it is a very transparent organization that puts donations to good use.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135346	1	/users/profile/136469	Tracy K.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	This organization truly deserves recognition for all that they do and for that which they have accomplished. Their philosophy and goals are mirrored in all that they do, not merely words. I am honored to help in whatever manner I can at this sanctuary, as the dedication of staff, interns & other volunteers is a reflection of true compassion for these animals, not as ownership, but genuine care for their needs and best interest.  In addition to the hard work & endless demand of caring for these  cats & others in need, the Director & staff make very effort to make opportunity to help educate the public on the problems caused by the exotic pet trade and their repercussions. This is an organization that I hope to be involved with as long as I am capable! 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135329	1	/users/profile/181194	Larry19	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	I hope to get to volunteer there the next time Scott Lope is helping you out and I will be bring my camera to get the most awesome photo for you and your super big hearted place for these beautiful animals!!!! Thank You!!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135245	1	/users/profile/181110	Laurie27	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	TWS is an amazing place with such dedicated staff and volunteers. Although each cat has a sad tale, they are the lucky ones to end up at TWS. Love their commitment to give all their cats wonderful enclosures and enrichment.  Love the effort they put into promoting the sanctuary through social media with their FB posts, videos, PSA's, etc.  Also, they are a leading and credible voice in the effort to ban exotic pets.   
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135234		/users/profile/181100	Mary130	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	So often;  people, organizations and cities call the Wildcat Sanctuary, "Can you? Will you?"  And the answer is always "Yes".  They will rescue, feed, support and give a protected life to numerous felines of every possible description".  And not without sacrifice.....and not without a struggle....and not without great financial burden.  This organization demonstrates one of the simplest principles of a great humanitarian,  the care and preservation of our vulnerable, priceless wildlife.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135226		/users/profile/181089	geriwilson	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	This organization is doing a very important work to educate people that owning exotic pets is not ok.  Too many people get in over their heads when they think an exotic pet is such a great idea.  When it doesn't work out, they are lucky if they can find someone to give their exotic pet sanctuary.  Room is limited!  Don't own exotic pets!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135222		/users/profile/181085	Kayti C.	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary does an extraordinary service to helpless felines.  They've made a huge impact on the community considering they've been pushing for knowledge about what is a pet and is not a pet.  They truly understand the concept of humaneness and compassion.

The Wildcat Sanctuary	135156		/users/profile/181023	Stacy V.	Donor	5	11/07/2012	I have been a longtime friend of Tammy Theis who started the Wildcat Sanctuary and have seen it continue to grow. It is amazing what Tammy and her staff do for these cats when the take them in and help give them as much as a fulfilling life they can. I have seen cats when they first arrive at the sanctuary and then months and years down the road. These cats have changed from being very scared, afraid and untrusting to very happy cats. I know this may seem weird to say but you can tell by their face how happy they are. You can tell they know they are safe! It's sad that there has to be Wildcat Santuaries out there, but they are amazing for the care they give these cats to help them through the rest of their lives. I can't say enough about this because The Wildcat Santuary is an amazing place for these cats!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135130		/users/profile/180999	noons28	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I just learned of the Wildcat Sanctuary through a friend.  What they are doing for the wildcats is awesome.  The no-kill cat rescue in Sandstone sounds like a safe haven for these cats.  I especially am impressed with the free roaming habitats they supply so the cats can live the wild at heart.  I know these cats are safe there.  AMAZING!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135095		/users/profile/180961	Sousaphonish	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I interned at The Wildcat Sanctuary in 2011 and have kept up with the sanctuary ever since. The work they do for the cats is fantastic, as well as their efforts in raising awareness about the captive wildlife crisis and related current events. The Wildcat Sanctuary is a place where the best interest of the animals is the final determining factor in every decision. Despite the sanctuary being closed to the public, they keep their supporters engaged in the cats' lives with frequent updates to their website and various social media pages. They inspire people to care about cats they can never meet, which is a truly impressive feat. Interning at the sanctuary changed my career goals and increased my participation in animal advocacy. I plan to continue to support this sanctuary as long as it exists. Hopefully someday their mission will be accomplished and we'll run out of captive wild animals needing to be saved!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135092		/users/profile/180958	KayR	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	I admire the Wildcat Sanctuary for their heroic work in saving exotic cats from bad situations and providing them loving lifetime care. Perhaps even more important is their dedication to educating the public about the issues surrounding the inappropriate use and keeping of exotic animals. Thank you, Wildcat Sanctuary, for all that you do!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135085		/users/profile/180953	blaken79	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	I learned about the Wildcat Sanctuary a few years ago and I have nothing but love for Tammy Thies and ALL of the staff and volunteers that make TWS a home for these beautiful creatures.  I hope and pray that TWS is able to provide help to cats in need for many years to come!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135082		/users/profile/111963	cjgs1943	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	This sanctuary is truly devoted to the welfare of these big cats.  It costs so much to feed and are for them all, but, somehow, TWS does it. Daily. Weekly. yearly.  I don't worry too much about the big cats because I know, that come hell or high water, these magnificent creatures will be taken care of.  I'm disabled and on a very limited income, but I do what I can to help.  If only more people would! 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	135077		/users/profile/180944	Nova-Chevy T.	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	YA'LL ARE AWESOME!!!! TAKING CARE OF THESE ANIMALS TAKES ALOT OF DEDICATION. AND YA'LL HAVE IT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK FOR THESE ANIMALS!!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	126629		/users/profile/171623	Denise29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2012	Wild Cat Sanctuary is amongst the top facilities in the United States for their advocacy of exotics animals. They have done a fabulous job providing permanent homes to abused, or unwanted exotic cats of the world! They are the voice of the animals, and exceed over and above in the care of these animals!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	125735		/users/profile/136281	Terri U.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I fell in love with the Wildcat Sanctuary from the moment I heard about it. Within a week, I had attended a volunteer orientation and was volunteering at my first event.  The TWS mission is to, "Provide a natural sanctuary to wild cats in need and inspire change to end the captive wildlife crisis." Everyone associated with TWS believes that wild/exotic animals belong in the wild, and dedicates their time to living that mission. No More Wild Pets. Keep the wild in your heart, not in your home. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102918		/users/profile/136281	Terri U.	Volunteer	5	01/05/2012	This is an incredible group of like-minded people I have been around in a long time. The dedication everyone has for the cats and exotic animal trade problem is inspiring.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	106925		/users/profile/144643	Nathan F.	Donor	5	02/22/2012	I recently sponsored a serval named Mesa with the sanctuary. I have been getting emails sent to me that specifically give me updates on how she's doing with her enclosure mates and what she did with her recent enrichment. It's a lot of fun being involved in something you care about. Also, any non profit group that is able to with just one picture, convince me to give them $250 for a feline sponsorship is also going to get a five star review. Can't wait until I get to go there, and it is definitely in my book of potential careers
The Wildcat Sanctuary	105102		/users/profile/141093	gloomy_eeyore_lover	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2012	Living in Oklahoma, I have not personally attended any events held by the sanctuary but as an animal lover, I LOVE the email updates they send out! I do not recall how I found out about The Wildcat Sanctuary but I am so glad that I did. I really enjoy the emails about the enrichment they provide the cats every holdiays like "St. Catrick's day" and videos of them playing in paint to creat artwork! They even have some great sounding fundraiders events like a Mardi gras themed dinner. And although it is sad to read an email about a cat passing on, the memorial text they write makes it VERY obvious that they truly care and love these beautiful animals.Thank you Wildcat Sanctuary for all the hard work you do to provide a safe and loving haven for the cats.       Christina
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104910		/users/profile/140787	vanessasal	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2012	Just looking at The Wildcat Sanctuary's website and facebook you can tell that they really care about the animals in their care. They often post pictures and updates on all of their animals to keep people up to date and the goings on at the shelter. It's amazing to see all of these animals happy and having a good life with people that care about them.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104887		/users/profile/140754	Justin8	Donor	5	01/30/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary Is Doing Such Important Work With These Animals And Does NOT Allow The Cats To Be Exploited Like Animals In The Zoo. I Love The Enrichment Activity The Provide For Them And The Always Improving Habitat Space. I Love This NON PROFIT It Is My Favorite In Minnesota!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104879		/users/profile/108638	AnimalLover	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary provides excellent care to their rescued cats as well as enrichment to prevent boredom. Although they do not allow visitors, they have a fabulous website and youtube videos where you can really see inside the sanctuary and get to know the cats!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104711		/users/profile/140468	stephpierre	Donor	5	01/27/2012	The people involved with The Wildcat Sanctuary wonderful and the facility is excellent. I highly recommend either volunteering or making a donation - I've done both and am proud to be a part of a group of people that truly care for the animals. Awesome place!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104321		/users/profile/139878	sarcasm23	Donor	5	01/24/2012	We met Tammy just as she was moving her Wildcat Sanctuary from GA up to MN a little over 10 years ago.  We werent familiar with what she was doing at the time, but were very impressed by her giving nature (she was rescuing 2 Siberian Huskies from a rescue group we were volunteering with at the time). On our first visit with her, we saw the passion and professionalism she exhibited with her organization.  Over the years we have witnessed how the Wildcat Sanctuary has expanded and has overcome some major obstacles (emergency rescues, a major site relocation) all without compromising her principals and doing whats best for the residents at the Wildcat Sanctuary.  We feel very fortunate to call her a friend and know there are many very lucky wildcats to call the Wildcat Sanctuary their home.  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104274		/users/profile/139795	amy.s.richman	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I have been volunteering since I was a small child and The Wildcat Sanctuary is by far one of the best groups I have ever worked with.  The volunteer "staff" is like family to each other and we are all so proud to be associated with this organization.  TWS is run with an incredibly high degree of professionalism and humanity; the staff is truly in tune with the animals we care for and it is a joy to be a part of something that makes a difference for the lives of these animals.  Not only does TWS assist in rescuing and caring for wildcats of all shapes, sizes and colors, we also educate the public on the captive wildlife crisis and play a role in current and future legislation on this matter.  We don't like that there is a need for places such as ours but until the day comes when all wildcats are left to be wild, The Wildcat Sanctuary is truly a slice of kitty heaven here on earth.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	104202		/users/profile/136317	jerrihatchla	Donor	5	01/23/2012	Fabulous sanctuary for these amazing animals.  I cannot imagine where these precious cats would be without them.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103522		/users/profile/138345	lulabelle31	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	I volunteer on-site at The Wildcat Sanctuary once a month and also occasionally work at a booth during an event off-site.  Every dollar and volunteer hour that I have seen offered to TWS has been taken gratefully and used to its fullest advantage to help the cats.  I can honestly say that this organization is 100% about putting all of their effort towards providing the best life possible for their residents as well as spreading knowledge to end the captive wildlife crisis.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103514		/users/profile/138324	Chandar	Donor	5	01/16/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is a wonderful organization.  As a donor, I have been pleased to fund new enclosures and help to bring big cats in crisis situations to a far better life at the Sanctuary.  I enjoy the beautiful videos taken of the cats at various times throughout the year.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103434		/users/profile/137869	Marie S	Donor	5	01/14/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is such a wonderful place. The cats are so lucky to have people like the volunteers, staff and owner to take care of them. They deserve the BEST. They are always in my mind!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103323		/users/profile/137557	Michelle52	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	I have been volunteering with the sanctuary for about a year and a half. I always look forward to heading out there. My only regret is that I don't live closer so I could go more often. They do wonderful work providing forever homes for wildcats in need and educating the public about the captive wildlife crisis. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103312		/users/profile/137524	Stephanie M84	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	I interned at The Wildcat Sanctuary and they are a wonderful organization who is focused on taking amazing care of their resuced cats as well as public education about the captive wildlife crisis.  The staff will do anything for their cats and are constantly raising funds to improve cat enclosures.  As an intern I was able to make many unique enrichment items that I had never seen given to big cats before but was clearly enjoyed by them.  The creative and forward-thinking staff take this charity to the next level.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103178		/users/profile/137189	Larry H.	General Member of the Public	5	01/11/2012	I have attended several Wildcat Sanctuary events and the work they do is amazing!!!!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103154		/users/profile/137115	Barbara45	Donor	5	01/11/2012	This is an amazing sanctuary with dedicated and compassionate staff.  The large, natural enclosures are designed with the animal in mind.  Heated dens!  How awesome!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103149		/users/profile/137090	michelle.braun5	Donor	5	01/11/2012	We need more wonderful people in the world like the volunteers/owners of this great place!  They work so hard every day all day to make a great home to these rescued big cats!  I encourage everyone to donate to them!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103127		/users/profile/137002	dpalmers	Volunteer	5	01/10/2012	I have been a volunteer for The Wildcat Sanctuary for 6 years and have watched this place grow into a top notch facility.  They manage their funds very well and put the needs of the cats first.  They are a sanctuary for animals, not a zoo for people.  Many of the cats have come from abusive backgrounds and need time to heal.  They get excellent veterinary care, good food, spacious enclosures with room to run,  perches and heated and cooled enclosures to escape extreme temperatures.  What impresses me is the quality of care they are able to give with the limited funds they receive.  They work so hard and truly care for these animals.  Their role in educating the public about the captive wildlife crisis is so important.  I highly recommend this organization.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103121		/users/profile/136980	yellowjeep2	Donor	5	01/10/2012	It's a shame that a place like this is needed but thank goodness they are around!  These people are truly angles for all of these animals and the many more out there!  I have been a monthly donor for 4 years now and I will coontinue to support the wonderful work they do!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103094		/users/profile/37660	tricia2	Donor	5	01/09/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary takes in abused and neglected big cats and provides them with an environment as close to that in nature as possible.  If not for TWS these animals would have no other place to go and would most likely be put down.  Caring for such large animals as wild cats is expensive and difficult, and is something that not many sanctuaries can do.  TWS does an amazing job of making a success of such a difficult mission.  The animals have large spacious enclosures so they can run and play.  They receive any medical care required, no matter how expensive.  They of course are fed on a daily basis, and we all know how the price of food has skyrocketed in the last few years.  TWS deserves all the support we can provide, so it can continue with its difficult, but critically important mission.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103045		/users/profile/88359	macyjacobnathan	General Member of the Public	5	01/08/2012	TWS is the next best thing for these awesome animals.  Since they cannot be returned to the wild, sending them to a sanctuary such as TWS where they can live out their lives in dignity and peace is the best alternative.  They are all living in enclosures that duplicate their natural habitats. Are cared for with love and concern.  Health needs are meet immediately. Enrichment is provided so the animals do not get bored or stressed.  This is an awesome sanctuary.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103044		/users/profile/110313	Dee D.	General Member of the Public	5	01/08/2012	The WildCat Sanctuary: They will never know freedom, Can they at least know compassion? This sanctuary not only provides compassion, but also respect and exemplary care for the cats in their charge. The cats live in spacious natural habitats and receive enrichment, expert medical care and a proper diet. TWS also works to educate the public about the serious issue of privately owned big cats in the United States and why these magnificent cats are deadly animals to have as pets. As a true sanctuary, TWS does not buy, breed, sell or exhibit animals. TWS is closed to the public, giving the cats additional privacy. You can clearly see these cats are well taken care of by the dedicated staff of TWS and are happy and healthy.  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103030		/users/profile/136601	cblake6	Board Member	5	01/07/2012	I have been working with the cats at The Wildcat Sanctuary since 2004 and I have been on the board of directors since 2005.  This is a truly unique and wonderful organization.  Our executive director, Tammy Thies, started this facility with the best intention possible-to provide a home for life for exotic cats that have been abused, neglected or exploited.  We do not breed, exhibit or sell these cats that have been through so much.  The staff and volunteers that aid the organization help these cats to live out their lives in peace and allow them to be as wild as they can.  I feel TWS is an example for all other sanctuaries to emulate!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103029		/users/profile/136598	Melissa48	Donor	5	01/07/2012	I am so impressed by Wildcat Sanctuary....the tigers, lions, cougars, servals, Lynx and other great cats always look happy & well fed in the videos and photos....I really like the philosophy of those who run Wildcat sanctuary....the problem of captive exotic cats in private hands is serious in the USA and Wildcat Sanctuary is one of the few that truly understands the best way to care for a tiger or lion cub illegally smuggled into this country who may face death or torture at the hands of the ignorant.....We should support Wildcat Sanctuary and perhaps others like it so that the tragedy which took place last fall in Zanesville Ohio never happens again.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103027		/users/profile/136591	stimmerman4126	Volunteer	5	01/07/2012	I've been a volunteer for many years and watched this organization grow and mature into a very effective, self-sustaining non-profit. Even though they still work extremely hard for every dollar, more and more donors and philanthropic groups are seeing the difference TWS is making and jumping on board. This is an amazing group of the hardest working people I have ever encountered. Their mission has never waivered, they have a clear vision of what needs to be done and are taking all the right steps to make it happen.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103026		/users/profile/136589	lindahayes92	Donor	5	01/07/2012	My husband and I have been watching this sanctuary almost from its beginning and have been so moved by the evidence of the kindness and the ability of these people to take in wildcats that have been damaged by other humans and bring them to health and trustfulness that we have always put them in the top list for our donations, even when we have had very little to give.  Tammy Theis' determination to help these cats began this whole beautiful effort and, over the years, many other people have been inspired to help.  We expect to keep donating to The Wildcat Sanctuary as long as we can.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	103014		/users/profile/136530	lizmn417	Volunteer	5	01/06/2012	TWS provides a peaceful haven for wild cats in need of a forever home. The cats are provided with top-notch veterinary care, a nutritious diet, and a beautiful habitat. The TWS staff cares deeply for the resident cats, and works to understand their unique personalities and preferences. Providing the cats with enrichment opportunities for mental stimulation is an important part of the care plan. While many of the cats come from unfortunate circumstances, they can live out their lives in contentment at the sanctuary.  As a volunteer, I have learned how vulnerable captive wild cats are under current laws.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102994		/users/profile/136476	Brynn B.	Volunteer	5	01/06/2012	My mom first told me about TWS. She has been a volunteer for a handful of years-she shared the most amazing and heart-warming stories of rescue and recovery with me. Two years ago she invited me to TWS' annual fundraiser. I knew the moment I walked in the door that I would be a volunteer and supporter for life. That was the first day I learned about the captive wildlife crisis, an was completely horrified to learn the details and see photographic proof of the dire conditions many of the cats endured before TWS. It is inspiring to hear the stories and watch TWS staff and volunteers at work. However, it is truly life changing to be on-site and see for yourself the progress of these cats. They will change your world, if only you open you heart and mind. In addition to rescuing and caring for wildcats, the strive to educate as many people as they can in hopes to save cats in the future as well. The organization and supporters are remarkable, and have forever found a place in my heart. To this day, the most spectacular moment in my life was when I was writing an article for TWS on Trista, the senior keeper. I shadowed her one afternoon- following her on-site and watching her go about her daily duties with the big cats. I will never forget the sights, and especially the sounds, of feeding time in the big cat building- standing in a hallway, surrounded by three lions, two tigers, a jaguar, and a black leopard with only a linked fence between us. Did I mention we had a bucket of raw meat sitting at our feet. I could hardly breathe between my excitement and fear, yet Trista was calm, composed, and professional. I will never forget that moment.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102992		/users/profile/136470	ryan.blake21	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	I am a former volunteer and mentee of Tammy Thies.  I volunteered when TWS was much smaller and i've seen it grow.  When I was there it was amazing to see the life a creature change, from being protective of a bowl of dirty water to become a healthy and lively animal that is accepting of compassion, as they should be.  While I would love to see TWS get smaller (because there ultimately isn't a need for it due to people not purchasing and buying illegal animals) it has grown, to what I feel as, a national scale in awareness and rescues.  The dedication and heart that Tammy and her staff and interns put into the TWS says a lot about the organization as a whole.  Everytime I would go, I always felt that the volunteers there were passionate about being compassionate and doing even the dirtiest of jobs to make the life a wildcat, that never experience the wild, better.  Education is the key to success and TWS is all about it and does an amazing job of it.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102989		/users/profile/136466	jaypol2	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	I have been aware of and a supporter of this fine organization for  some.time.  I donate and know the money is well spent to give these animals a good  life and freedam  to roam.  They are sheltered, they are well fed and they are loved.  They have a home for life, and still this sanctuary  allows the animals natural  and spacious habitat to live  wild aheart.  God bless them one and all                                                                
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102984		/users/profile/136448	Augusta	Volunteer	5	01/06/2012	I have been a volunteer at TWS for almost five years now, and I am still in awe everytime I participate in a volunteer day on site.      About a year ago, I was fortunate enough to be onsite when several tigers arrived from a sanctuary in TX that was closing.  The tigers were skinny, nervous and scared.  One paced in her new home, never stopping the entire time I was there.  This past December, I had the opportunity to see the same tiger again, only this time she was stretched out sunbathing in the warm Minnesota sun, without a care in the world, beautiful and happy.  I know that it not just the passage of time that made the difference, it was a year of hard work, good medical attention and lots of TLC.  I am proud to be a volunteer at TWS and know in my on little way - I am making a difference
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102971	1	/users/profile/136432	embachh	Volunteer	5	01/06/2012	I've been a volunteer with this organization for almost 10 years and have been constantly amazed at how much TWS does for these amazing creatures with so little. The passion and enthusiasm for the work that the staff and volunteers have is inspiring.  The work can be grueling, but so satisfying, especially when you see the posts that you wired together forming the foundation for the pen that a tiger is roaming around. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102968	1	/users/profile/136426	Peter11	Donor	5	01/06/2012	I'm retired and can't afford to give much, but whatever I can afford I gladly give to help preserve a tiny bit more of the wonderful bio-diversity our beautiful planet holds.  These magnificent cats are iconic reminders that humans are not the sole inheritors of the earth.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102967		/users/profile/136418	trink	Donor	5	01/06/2012	TWS is a wonderful place.  because of my friend Susan Timmerman i learned of this organization and the plight of these big cats.  Tammy and her crew do amazing things to create an environment as close to the wild as they can.  i share the news letter and videos with many friends.  i campaign for TWS on my own.  i know 2 friends of mine who have donated.  maybe there are more.  i sent the enrichment videos to my grandchild.  this group of people are cats are tops in my book!!  i have donated for years and will continue!!  fantastic!!  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102966		/users/profile/136421	esmevans	Donor	5	01/06/2012	We've been supporting the Wildcat Sanctuary for a number of years. Tammy and her staff have created a humane and responsible approach to the serious problem of treating wild cats as pets or, even worse, merchandise. The cats in their care are treated with loving respect, and their needs come first--which is as it should be. We feel honored to be able to support this work!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102963		/users/profile/136402	Bethann B.	Donor	5	01/06/2012	I volunteer at a sanctuary in FL that has similar goals and beliefs.  They don't breed their animals, and the care and love the animals receive is amazing.  If these animals have to be in captivity this is so much better than a zoo.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102959		/users/profile/35498	floridapotter	General Member of the Public	5	01/06/2012	As a volunteer at a similar wildlife sanctuary, I am always impressed by the care and facilities provided needy wildcats at this sanctuary. Their actions have been life-saving for many of their residents and Tammy is ceaseless in her quest for perfection
The Wildcat Sanctuary	34625	4	/users/profile/35498	floridapotter	Donor	5	04/04/2010	I've supported TWS from afar after learning about their good work from a fellow volunteer at Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, FL.Both of these organizations are unique in their dedication to offering sanctuary, primo care and never breeding or exploiting their creatures. All on a tight budget and with many volunteer hours.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102955		/users/profile/136354	Tammie W.	Donor	5	01/06/2012	I learned about the Wildcat Sanctuary from a coworker about four years ago.  Since that time I have been in awe of the work Tammy, her staff and volunteers are doing.  From finding a new home for the sanctuary ( allowing the cats to roam and exist with dignity) to the rescues of those animals in need, the Wildcat Sanctuary exhibits a generosity of spirit that should be embraced and acknowledged.   
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102951	1	/users/profile/136343	mteg24	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	I just learned about the Wildcat Sanctuary this year, and since following their site and email newsletters, I can't believe how much love the people who run this organization must have for their animals. It's such a treat to get an update, photo or video, to see just how happy these big cats are in their home at TWS. I wholeheartedly support their cause and their ambition to educate the public on their mission.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102950		/users/profile/136345	Olga C.	Donor	5	01/05/2012	I am an animal lover and I am particularly fond of big cats, and cats in general. After reading up on what TWS does, I felt compelled to donate to their cause. I think we being the creatures with elevated thought should follow their lead and take better care of the planet's inhabitants- trees, cats, etc.  I love reading about how the cats celebrate various holidays and think that the pictures they share of these awesome creatures, helps to bring attention to their need as fellow living creatures. I wish them continued success and hope they are always there to help those felines in need! :)
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102947		/users/profile/136338	jwalsh_1	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	I am impressed with TWS in their ability to put the cats they rescue first and to let us "see" and learn about these animals via their website. It is amazing how the animals are doing and thriving in their habitats TWS provides for each resident, they truely look happy and well taken care of. TWS does a good job of educating the public and is always there, no matter what state, to help another cat in need. Thank you to all at TWS for all you do, you go beyond all expectation when taking care of the residents!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102946		/users/profile/136327	Dana3516	Donor	5	01/05/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is an amazing organization!  It is wonderful to know that there is an organization that rescues cats and gives them a good environment in which to thrive, get healthy and live safe, happy lives.  I have donated money and items from their 'wishlist' many times over the years and also sponsored a tiger.  I was given the opportunity to go up to the facility when Titan and Lilly were brought together for the first time.  What an amazing experience and opportunity to see that your donations do make a difference.  The tigers were so happy that day. You can't put a price on that.  It feelings good to know that you are making a difference in the life of a wild cat.  The staff do an excellent job to keep it going.  I only wish I could do more.  Oh - and I love the vehicle wraps you're doing.  I've seen a couple around town. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102942		/users/profile/35470	vickyh	Donor	5	01/05/2012	I've supported the Wildcat Sanctuary for more than 10 years. It all began with a billboard that took my breath away at an airport. And then I met Tammy Theis, the founder and director. I got to see first-hand the care that these animals get. I got to see the sacrifices made for their well-being. I got to see the Wildcat Sanctuary grow over the years. There is no organization I believe in more. I cannot imagine a staff more committed to their work.  Residents are given more than just food and shelter. They receive enrichment, caring... compassion. Every animal deserves this. But especially these animals, who are often abused, neglected, rejected. This is why I feel very good about donating to this organization, and why I would (and have) eagerly recommend it to my friends and family.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	34604	1	/users/profile/35470	vickyh	Donor	5	04/03/2010	The Wildcat Sanctuary is one of the most amazing places I've ever seen. They make do on a shoestring budget, somehow always making sure that the cats in their care have what they need. The Sanctuary was founded by a woman who has amazing empathy for these creatures, and she has assembled a caring, nurturing, and knowledgeable staff.They work hard to ensure that the cats are not only fed and given medical attention, but that they have the enrichment necessary for a full life. The cats have toys, pools, and caves. This is probably one of the best possible situations for these animals in captivity.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102941		/users/profile/136328	jenniferldrews	Volunteer	5	01/05/2012	I have volunteered for a few years now for TWS. The work that Tammy and the keepers is wonderful. They respect the wild nature of the cats while giving them compassion and letting them have fun. Moving to AZ and not being able to volunteer in person at TWS gives me an opportunity to still be connected. I continue to financially suport TWS and spread the word about the great work is done there. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102940		/users/profile/136324	KimberlyC	Donor	5	01/05/2012	While I do not have experience with Wildcats, I have had years of experience in animal rescue, wildlife, and wolfdog rescue.  I know the sacrifices that are required to provide for animals that, through no fault of their own, have been abused, abandoned, or forgotten.  The staff, volunteers, and interns work for the good of these cats to provide them with quality care, food, and enrichment to provide them a happy life.  I donate whenever I can and, if I lived closer, I would volunteer.  The organization communicates to supporters and it is clear, via video, Facebook, etc. that the cats are in the best hands they could be in.  You can rest assured that any donations that are made go directly to benefit and care for the animals.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102938		/users/profile/136319	Emily18	Volunteer	5	01/05/2012	I have volunteered in the past at the Wildcat Sanctuary. Sadly for me it was relocated to an area that was too far for me to get to and I miss not being there.   There are a lot of people who love and want to protect animals, but I've never met anyone who walks the talk more than the staff of the Sanctuary.  Not only do they focus on giving the animals care and dignity, but they focus on educating the rest of the population on the crisis of private ownership of wild cats.  The focus has always been the cats for no other gain than to give the cats an amazing life for the rest of their days.  I've volunteered many places with animals and people and the Sanctuary is by far and away the most impressive.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102934		/users/profile/136311	Erin14	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	I am proud to support an organization as committed and caring as The Wildcat Sanctuary.  They know the importance of protecting these cats and are always respectful of the animals they serve.  This organization deserves all the credit and good reviews it can get and then some.  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102932		/users/profile/136307	BonnieB	Donor	5	01/05/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is a wonderful and caring facility that does not exploit the animals it cares for.  Tammy Theis is not trying to turn a profit by running this sanctuary and she relies solely on donations to save these wonderful creatures.  I once sent an email with a question that was very important to me, Tammy personally responded to my message.  This is an outstanding organization that puts the welfare of the animals first.  I feel very privileged to be able to donate to TWS on a regular basis!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102930	1	/users/profile/136303	Apropos S.	Donor	5	01/05/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is a selfless cause with excellent management, prudent use of every dollar and a pure, clear vision of its mission: to ensure that the rescued, wild cats are given the very best opportunity to live the balance of their lives in a safe, private, respectful and enriching environment. TWS believes - is hopeful - that through increasing awareness and education, the senseless capture and exploitation of these wild creatures will someday cease. Man cannot continue to cage, dominate and abuse - simply because we can.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102929		/users/profile/136301	jkdracer	Donor	5	01/05/2012	In a loving and compassionate manner, the Wildcat Sanctuary cares for those abused by the cruelty of mankind.  With adoration and a touch of humor, they bring to light and share with the world the joy an exotic cat can have in a loving and caring environment.  They are unwaveringly committed to these beautiful animals and deserve all the recognition possible. We can only hope their efforts will help enlighten the world and bring laws that end the horrible practices that plague these majestic creatures. 
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102927		/users/profile/136302	Cassandra E.	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	I had the privilege of being able to volunteer a few times there, but the commute was so far from my home that I had to stop.  The facility and staff there are amazing and I feel the work they do is so important, as these animals did not choose to be in captivity.  All of the animals are so well taken care of and loved, though thouroghly respected as the wild animals they are.  I also like that the facility is not open to the public, so the animals are not in a zoo, but more of a forever home, to live the rest of their lives in peace, happiness and dignity.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102911		/users/profile/136262	Millie M.	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	I love this organization and their mission statement....Give them dignity. The Wildcat Sanctuary saves animals and also educates about the sad realities of people who own and cannot care for these exotic cats. They are abandoned and would not survive if not for the love, kindness and support of the sanctuary. I love donating in honorarium at holidays and believe in what they are doing 100%!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102910		/users/profile/136259	Theodora B.	General Member of the Public	4	01/05/2012	I was lucky enough to have the privilege of visiting the Sanctuary with a friend who volunteers there.  The Sanctuary is not open to the public, so I felt very lucky to meet the staff and see what they do and how deeply they care for the animals.  The facility is populated by healthy animals in spacious enclosures.  Although I wish we didn't need places like The Wildcat Sanctuary, I wish that every facility that serves such a need were exactly like theirs.  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102907		/users/profile/136251	mplsredd	Volunteer	5	01/05/2012	The WCS is one of the best non profits I have volunteered for.  In addition to providing a forever home to wild cats, they also have an important role in the community educating the public to keep the wild in their heart not their home.  There is finely tuned individual thought that goes into each resident that comes to the sanctuary, from what they eat and prefer, suppliments they may need and enrichment and love they so deserve.  The staff is dedicated to giving a wonderful and caring environment to every animal.  I have been volunteering with WCS for almost two years now and I love it.  I help clean enclosures, replace water and provide enrichment for Hybrid Haven, home to 50+ cats that have been bred with wild cats that someone bought as a "pet" and then found out it's not a good idea whether it be they pee all over, attack other animals or people, etc.  I am rabies vaccinated which is a requirement to DAC.  But there are so many other things you can do without being vaccinated, like help build enclosures, create enrichment for the cats, data entry, off site education booths, and fundraising.  I can see myself involved with them in some shape or form for as long as they can use me.  I can not gush enough.  
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102905		/users/profile/136249	Janet22	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2012	They that take care of the animals, are AMAZING..They can not speak for themselves..Some one has to..The Wildcat Sanctuary is Great in my eyes..They are Angels to the animals..Great Job for a very hard rescue..
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102904		/users/profile/136245	Jan_4	General Member of the Public	4	01/05/2012	Any place that takes in animals is alright in my books, but the Wildcat Santuary is top notch!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102896		/users/profile/136212	Kb2lily	Donor	5	01/05/2012	The people at TWS are so dedicated to making the cats' lives better. They give them large habitats and the right food/nutrition and work hard with the special needs ones to overcome their fears. This NPO is so giving to benefit the cats. They take in cats from other sanctuaries that have gone under from poor management and make the cats healthy and active again. All their monies go to supporting the cats. These guys are fantastic!!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102893		/users/profile/136202	hoopjeans	Volunteer	5	01/05/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is one of the few sanctuaries in the country that truly upholds the promises made to the animals in their care.  This facility exists only to serve the needs of their resident cats, but more than that...they work to change the systems that allow for irresponsible private ownership.  Without the work for The Wildcat Sanctuary, our society would me much worse off.  Thanks for all the good work you do!  The animals deserve it and your supporter love it!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102888		/users/profile/136162	Linda51	Donor	5	01/05/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is one of the greatest places I have ever been allowed to visit.  It is not open to the public because this is the home to over 100 rescued animals.  There are big cats and small cats and in between sizes.  They are all cared for by the wonderful volunteers and staff that Tammy has assembled.  They take great pride in their work and efforts to give these beautiful animals the respect and care they so deserve.  When you see all the amazing things they have done and it is all operated by non profit funds and volunteers it is an amazing sight that so much can be done with so little to help these animals live out their lives in peace and tranquil surroundings.  Any amount of donation can help and know it is such a worthy cause.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102883		/users/profile/136153	jmkboyer	Donor	5	01/04/2012	The Wildcat Sanctuary is one place where they *really* get it right.  Tammy and staff make every choice and create every habitat based solely on what is right for the beautiful cats they have rescued.  The staff works tirelessly to grow the Sanctuary as well.  When an animal is in need, and it's an appropriate fit, TWS finds room.  My husband and I are prolific charitable donors and we carefully vette each organization we donate to.  TWS is beyond reproach and worth every donation of time or money you can give them.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102878		/users/profile/136141	Michele A.	Donor	5	01/04/2012	It is unfortunate that the need for the Wildcat Sanctuary is present in our modern society. For the cats though, it is fortunate that the WCS does exist and operates at such a high standard. Perhaps someday I will be able to volunteer my time, as this cause is very worth the time and effort of any individual.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	102874		/users/profile/136134	Janice W.	Donor	5	01/04/2012	I have supported The Wildcat Sanctuary from the very beginning. This facility provides the best possible outcome for the beautiful animals who have been abused and neglected. The Sanctuary exists in order to right the terrible wrongs done to these wild cats. It is so heartwarming to see a rescued wildcat lazily sunning itself in its large, grassy enclosure. The hardworking, dedicated staff deserve our donations and support.
The Wildcat Sanctuary	62949		/users/profile/68828	Grace K.	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I was an intern at TWS for a summer, and they have an amazing program. They really focus on educating the truth to interns, volunteers, and public about exotic animal ownership. They are encouraging and a great staff to work with. Their number one priority is the safety and well-being of the animals, and do everything in their power to provide a comfortable and peaceful home for these amazing cats.  They are hard workers, and all the animals are treated with the greatest respect. Each animals enclosure is designed for their specific requirements (whether it is breed or personality specific). They always take full advantage of interns and volunteers lending a hand to help build and create a bigger and better place for the animals to live. They are constantly at affairs such as Pride Day, Quarry Days, etc. to get their message of stopping exotic animal ownership out to the public. They are a great place to volunteer!
The Wildcat Sanctuary	62942		/users/profile/68818	Sharon S.	Donor	5	02/03/2011	I was introduced to the Wildcat Sanctuary by my neighbor, who was a volunteer there.  I fully support their mission, and believe that they provide a service that is very much needed.  As long as people insist on having wild cats as pets, we will continue to need the sanctuary to rescue them once their owners can no longer take care of them.  I also support them because they give these beautiful animals a natural surrounding, and give them the compassion they deserve.  They did not ask to be abused, I applaud the Wildcat Sanctuary for letting them live their lives in dignity.

We have not only received pjs from them, but also raised money/pjs through a benefit car show for Sweet dreams for kids.   We were lucky enough to receive a pair of pjs for my son who had his first surgery.  Wendy and her family are truly amazing, and the love they give to others is such a blessing!

Working with Wendy and her family was such a wonderful experience for me, my staff and the children in our summer program.  Wendy was involved from start to finish. She always her family available and was at the site often. We also worked with the University of Minnesota Gopher athletes in helping to contribute to this organization. We held a car wash and numerous bake sales to help contribute. The children in our program were able to see this community service project from start to finish. Some staff and myself will be delivering the PJ's to Children's Hospital in October.  Thanks for an amazing opportunity.

Wendy used her difficult experiences and turned them into something positive for people going through similar situations.  Wendy puts all of her love into this organization and it shows.  Her devotion to the cause and helping children feel better by providing them new pajamas when they are sick and in the hospital is what makes Sweet Dreams for Kids such a wonderful organization.  Sweet Dreams for Kids is a wonderful nonprofit and its founder, Wendy, is a wonderful individual.  All that is done is done out of true love and kindness.

Juliana opened a package from Sweet Dreams for Kids about found a pair of pajamas in her favorite colors.  You should have seen the smile on her face.  PRICELESS!!   Since Juliana's been sick (half her life) she had had such an amazing attitude but, as her Dad, I can see she's getting tired of being sick.  So many children struggle with sickness and never complain...never whine and, out of the blue, some beautiful organization called Sweet Dreams for Kids makes a HUGE difference in a child's day.  It is more important than I can express.   Sweet Dreams for Kids not only lifts the hearts of the kids they serve but the family as well. Thank you Sweet Dreams for Kids for making such a HUGE difference!!

She originally had a scheduled surgery which was only supposed to have a 5 day stay, well she had different plans!! I received a Facebook message asking if if be interested in receiving a pair of comfy Jammie's for her.  We arrived home after 11 days and had a package waiting. Brooke's face absolutely lit up as she opened it!! She wanted to wear them right away :).  Now onto our second pair!!! After just 3 short days of being home she ended up back in the hospital for another 30 days, enduring yet another surgery.  After the first week, I remember chatting with Wendy on Facebook and she offered to send us a second pair!!! I mean what company would do that I thought to myself!!  This is absolutely an amazing program Wendy!!  I'm happy that I got to share this experience with a few other families  while we were there.  I will forever be grateful to you  Wendy  and your amazing Sweet Dreams for Kids program!!!
Sweet Dreams for Kids	196929		/users/profile/257425	Neal Z.	Client Served	5	04/02/2014	A few weeks ago, I was contacted by somebody who introduced herself as Wendy from Sweet Dreams for Kids (http://sweetdreamsforkids.org/). I imagine most of you, as I, had never heard of this organization. The organization is based out of Minnesota and what they do is provide thousands upon thousands of brand-new pairs of pajamas for seriously ill children and their siblings. One of their slogans is they want to take the "ick" out of sick. Wendy, the head of this organization reached out to me via email after becoming aware of Izzy's battle on CaringBridge, and stated that she was so touched by the entire story that she wanted to send us a pair of pajamas for Izzy and for his siblings as well. It sounds like a little gesture but her words of encouragement to me were anything but "little." She is yet another one of the many good Samaritans that exist in this world, committed to assisting families during times of medical crises and need; wanting to make a positive difference in the lives of the affected. Yesterday, when the door bell rang during dinner, Roovy sprung up to answer the door and received a package that contained four brand-new pairs of pajamas; each sized appropriately for our four children. After dinner Roovy and Batya expressed excitement when changing into their new pajamas, and were both enthralled with their new gift. One of the many things I've learned throughout this journey is that the "little" things are not little at all, and sometimes make all the difference in the world. What captivated me was in that box with the pajamas was a colorful, hand written note to Izzy, that read; "Thinking of you Izzy with love from Sweet Dreams for Kids" (I will post that picture as well, on caringBridge). As I have just pontificated, the so-called "little" things in life are anything but "little." Sweet Dreams for kids is yet another organization that attempts to put smiles upon the faces of those whose lives have been turned in upheaval, due the serious illness of a sibling. I recommend that each and everyone of you visit their website (http://sweetdreamsforkids.org/) and if possible, provide them with financial assistance, so that they can continue to provide this invaluable service to families such as mine. 
Sweet Dreams for Kids	196746		/users/profile/257160	magicmary	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2014	What is better than an organization who does nice things for children who are in the hospital?  It is such a stressful time for families when young children are sick, especially when they are in an extended stay situation.  Putting pajamas on a child is such a little thing and brings such unfettered joy.  We should all be giving to this organization to make it easier for doing their work.  I'm so glad that I know about this organization and how easy it is to serve this fragile audience.  Thank you Wendy for all that you are and better yet, all that you do.

Sweet Dreams for Kids	142410		/users/profile/188878	mnmanny	Donor	4	11/25/2012	I met Wendy many year ago and she told me about her daughter who had to have some hospital care and HATED the hospital gowns.  This led Wendy to get new pajamas for her daughter so that she could feel some sense of normalcy!  I told her I thought this was a great idea and she asked me if my Lion's group would be involved!  I said, why don't you ask them yourself...in a presentation at our next meeting!  She did, we collected a whole lot of pajamas for her and periodically afterwards, and now she and her family  set up for our annual Pancake Breakfast!  Wendy has done a terrific job in making many kid's stay at a hospital a more pleasant event!  Good job, Wendy!  - Manny Camilon, Jr. ,SLP Lion's Club

It has always been a joy to see the updates on what they are doing, and that Wendy (the founder) has faced similar health challenges with her children and has found away to bring light to an area that can be so dark. After my Daughter had surgery at the age of 22 months, we did a pajama drive in her honor. So many people we knew and didnt know, all around the world donated pajamas. After my daughter recovered from her surgery, Wendy sent us stickers to put on the Pajamas and we delivered them to the Childrens Hospital on behalf of Sweet Dreams for Children. It was nice to share what Sweet Dreams for Children does for children.

For sick children in hospitals to receive new pajamas, to be able to shed their hospital gowns, provides a small degree of normalcy in a situation which is often upside-down. Sweet Dreams for Kids, run locally out of Minneapolis, reaches children throughout the country and brings much-needed comfort to families of children in hospitals.
Sweet Dreams for Kids	152206		/users/profile/183816	Danica H.	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	My son was only a couple of months old when I heard about Sweet Dreams for Kids. We were in and out of the Picu constantly. He was born with Down Syndrome, along with an Asd, a hemangioma in his liver, and pulmonary hypertension. The hemangioma ended up needing some surgeries to stop damage it was causing to his heart so we ended up with even more hospitalizations. I spoke with Sweet Dreams for Kids about getting him some jammies he could wear during long stays (when they allowed him to wear them). She was just as pleasant as can be and I just loved communicating with her. I instantly fell in love with this place because of how well I personally was treated. I couldn't decided which kind of jammies I liked most for my son so she picked out a cute pair for me, and even sent me a spare! I cried when I got his package, I was truly touched by the kindness of this group. I highly recommend this non profit group to everyone who has a child in the hospital and wants to get them something cute and comfy they can wear during their stay. My son has finally outgrown his, but I am keeping his jammies stored away to remind us of the kindness of others during our very hard times. He is finally 10 months old and has been out of the hospital for almost 2 full months. THANK YOU SWEET DREAMS FOR KIDS! I will forever remember and support you and your group.

I got in contact with Sweet Dreams for Kids so that he could have a little something special to remember how much he is loved and to bring him a little comfort for future hospital visits and stays if needed. I was overwhelmed by the kindness of this place. It is such a thoughtful and selfless thing to do just to make these children feel that much more special than they already are. This is such a wonderful place. I am going to keep his pajamas for him so he can know what kindness can come from such wonderful people when he grows up.

Sweet Dreams for Kids	139221		/users/profile/185329	Carol82	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	My 9 month old grandson received a pair of pajamas from this organization last Christmas while in the hospital for his open heart surgery. He may not have realized what a nice gift this was, but his parents and grandparents sure did. He looked so cute Christmas morning with his new pajamas. This kind gift helped heal the entire family. They have inspired me to give back to my community.
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137774		/users/profile/183775	BLLR	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	I've seen this organization bring smiles and a cozy nights sleep to children who really need them!  Children who are fighting for their lives and need comfort in a world of hard times!
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137770		/users/profile/183771	Linda147	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	Their donation of new pajamas to kids while sick in the hospital is a great idea. The smiles they bring are irreplaceable. Sweet Dreams for Kids is a great nonprofit organization that makes a difference in the lives of many.
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137764		/users/profile/183765	Karen127	Donor	4	11/12/2012	I donated pajamas to Sweet Dreams for Kids in a child's name that I personally knew, who has been fighting a form of leukemia himself. They not only sent me a personalized thank you note, but they sent my friend's son a brand new pair of pajamas as well!! He was ecstatic!! Thank you Sweet Dreams for Kids for putting smiles on children's faces, and warming their parent's hearts!
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137729		/users/profile/183728	Lindsey F.	Donor	5	11/12/2012	I have a friend who's son has been in and out of the hospital since birth, due to a congenital heart defect.  She decided to do a pajama drive to show gratitude for Sweet Dream's and what they did for her son.  This is such a simple and inexpensive idea that can be so meaningful to a child.  To be able to share this feeling of being home and comfortable, something never gave any thought to, until now.  It warms my heart to know that the children who have no choice but to call the hospital home for the holidays, will be a little more comfortable in pajamas given with love and hope.  What a wonderful ministry!
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137728		/users/profile/183727	sammy5678	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	This organization is wonderful because so many kids in hospitals aren't happy and are bored. These pajamas can really brighten their day up and make them forget about whats happening in the hospital. 
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137203		/users/profile/183160	Aimee O.	Client Served	5	11/12/2012	My 2 year old, Cayden Jae has Neurofibromatosis..and has been in and out of the hospital. I have to say children who face a hospital stay often have many fears which stem from isolation and unfamiliar surroundings. Gifts like from Sweet Dreams for Kids helps to bring a bit of home into the sterile environment of the hospital, making it a less scary place. These types of gifts also provide needed distractions from the pain or boredom associated with the hospital stay. Some kids must stay in the hospital for extended periods but remain quite mobile and active, at least if this is the issue they can still be comfortable while doing so. Getting useful or decorative items when their condition prohibits any activity helps alot. As a mother with a little one that has been hospitalized several times I can say that  items such as pajamas, socks, slippers, brushes and toiletries help even if the child remains unable to be active. A funny pair of socks or slippers and some new character pajamas may brighten their day while they are confined to a hospital bed. I love Sweet Dreams for Kids and plan to share with everyone I can on Facebook and let them know that this is available to them if they need it!! Keep up the incredible work Sweet Dreams!!     
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137163		/users/profile/183121	ImLN	Donor	5	11/11/2012	An incredible organization! The dedication, the smiles, the impact.

Sweet Dreams for Kids	137033	1	/users/profile/182987	Wendy40	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2012	This is a great organization. They make HUGE smiles on the faces of ill kids, hospitalized. The kids dont have to wear the ugly hospital gowns! My hats off to them. Seeing the faces that they give the kids, I sure hope that when my son gets his PJ's he will smile as much too!!
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137027		/users/profile/182980	Allison22	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2012	There are good people in this world, and then there are AMAZING people. This family falls in the amazing category. I am a mother of 4 and I know how much my kids LOVE their pajamas, and I've also spent 10+ days in the hospital with sick children. ANY sort of gift that can make your child smile through their pain is worth it's weight in gold. Sweet Dreams For Kids not only gives the kiddos a present but brings a little bit of normalcy to a foreign and often uncomfortable few days. I wish there were more people in this world like the family behind SD4K! 
Sweet Dreams for Kids	137022		/users/profile/182975	Valerie711	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	As someone who has long worked in non-profit, I am always most pleased to see a non-profit that manages to do great things, with little administrative cost. Sweet Dreams for Kids is exactly such an impressive operation, in that a family started it as a family project, and continues to run largely as such, despite the fact that the impact of their (now not so little) operation is well into the thousands of clients served, all over the country. Having started as a family project, in direct response to their own child having spent years in hospital gowns, Sweet Dreams for Kids continues to collect brand new pajamas and donate them to pediatric treatment facilities, through generous PJ drive volunteers all over the country, so that ill children can have the sweet dreams that comfy PJs bring. Wendy, the driving force behind SDFK, can turn any willing volunteer into a successful PJ Drive Volunteer Admin, and indeed this Minnesota based charity has put PJs on hospitalized children, far and wide, from California to Virginia, Minnesota to Texas.  Schools, youth groups and worksites have all joined in this great work, and truly the limiting factor to PJ drives is only the imagination of someone wishing to help, so if this sounds like a great charity to you, just do it! Contact SDFK and learn how to conduct a PJ drive that will help hundreds of children in your own area to smile!
International Wolf Center	314664		/users/profile/271189	Kelcie S.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2016	I had the opportunity to serve as an educator/intern in 2014 and in prior months. I have always felt apart of a team, a family if you will, of strong staff who are dedicated towards serving the missing statement and educating the public about wolves. Working for the wolf center has not only been a dream of mine but also something which I have and will always cherish as one of my favorite memories and internships. I love the mission of the wolf center and educational tools they not only provide their staff but the public as well. Come join us for a unique experience, where you may learn about wolves and (hopefully, if you are patient) see them up close through the glass. 
International Wolf Center	208491		/users/profile/271189	Kelcie S.	Volunteer	5	08/03/2014	Ever since I was a little girl in grade school, I had always wanted to visit the center. I tried to persuade my parents to take a trip up to visit but the cost of travel was always too much. We spent our summers doing other things instead. However, the desire to visit the center never died. As the years progressed, I actually almost forgot about the wolf center because I turned my attention away from wolves and began to focus on birds. I was always told "forget about working with wolves, it's practically impossible in the wildlife field" and the bird passion later sprouted. Now, as a college student, I am on my way to becoming a wildlife professional. Every summer I attempt internships despite them being out of state. Last summer I was located in Wisconsin and remembered the Wolf Center. I became a member and planned on visiting because I was finally within driving distance. However, my vehicle then decided to have a gas leak and my journey was halted. I still received updates about the center through their membership magazine, wolf logs, and wolf cams. The later two located on their website. I began to secretly desire to pursue wolf related internships again and as the 2014 summer approached, I found an internship application and applied. I was in absolute disbelief when I was interviewed and the fact that I was hired as a Summer Educator was practically surreal. I could not believe it. Everyone told me it was impossible and yet I still managed to prove people wrong again.  In short, thank you IWC for the opportunities you provide. Not only do you provide college students the chance to work with you through internships but you also have volunteer experience for anyone interested in helping the center out. Membership opportunities include a quarterly magazine filled with factual based articles and various other fun things as you climb the membership ranks; such as limited edition Ambassador Wolf coins. The website, wolf.org, offers people the chance to view the wolves via wolf cams, wolf logs, and weekly youtube videos that update folks about the center's activity. Now that I have experience working with the staff members at IWC (board members, wolf care, educators, store management, etc) -  I can honestly say that each and every one of them is truly wonderful! I love that the center's goal to be as factual and scientific as possible rather than constantly telling you to "Save the wolves! Just because!". The wolf center makes sure that each of the wolves are properly cared for  and it truly shows based on their physical appearance, behaviors, and interactions with one another. Sometimes you see animals pacing back and forth in the enclosure but the center's wolves are rather relaxed and do not have to worry about constantly being bothered. The wolves are medicated, vaccinated, and more. On top of all this, there are various programs and events that the public can get involved in so that they may learn factual based information about wolves. I truly have nothing bad to say about the wolf center. Thank you IWC for all the wonderful opportunities you offer!
International Wolf Center	299165		/users/profile/181036	Dana20	Client Served	5	08/03/2016	I have been a visitor to the IWC in Ely at least twice a year for the last 13 years. The facility is beautiful and their programs are all really well run and interesting. I admire their stand on education without undo persuasion. I highly recommend that anyone interested in learning more about wolves visit the website to learn more. Go to Ely if you can, it is a great place!
International Wolf Center	135173		/users/profile/181036	Dana20	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I had the great honor of being a "pup nanny" to two wolf pups at the IWC this past June.  This incredible experience was both humbling and inspiring.  I am so proud to watch Luna and Boltz on the live webcam now and see what beautiful adult animals they have become.  I know the thousands of visitors to the IWC in the coming years will see these wonderful animals and be moved by the plight of wolves in the wild.  I am a life-long supporter of Wolf awareness and have found no organization more worthy than the IWC in regards to teaching people about the important role the Wolf plays in the eco-system. The IWC teaches with us about Wolves with facts not with emotion or preaching.  I am an active supporter of the IWC and highly recommend anyone who is passionate about Wolves also support their efforts.
International Wolf Center	298855		/users/profile/389743	Writer	Client Served	5	08/01/2016	The International Wolf Center is an amazing and educational place to visit, with dioramas to give good, scientific information while not overwhelming you.  Being able to see their ambassador wolves is an unforgettable experience, and well worth getting one of their Adoption Kits.  Love visiting this outstanding place!
International Wolf Center	298837		/users/profile/347690	slt617	Donor	5	08/01/2016	The IWC has the best programs for learning about Wolves and their importance in the natural world. An amazing facility affording viewing of captive born pack to learn about these beautiful animals. Volunteer programs and learning adventure trips provide various opportunities to learn about and engage with nature
International Wolf Center	259172		/users/profile/347690	slt617	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2015	I have visited the IWC several times since 2014, learning about wolves and also participating in programs that directly impacted the wolves environment. The educational information and opportunity to observe wolves is excellent. This is a worthwhile center which deserves continued support. If I lived closer I would volunteer year round
International Wolf Center	298778		/users/profile/389670	Jennifer R N.	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2016	International  Wolf Center  is one of the bestttttttt examples of specialist in wolves caring for their every needs without over involving the wolves in their care to be humanly socialized. Over the years I have followed their dynamic care and educational background that they provide,  making the public awareness strong. They introduced many wolves as pups that needed to survive and allow them entry with adult wolves, adaptation  and prosperity they give. I  enjoy being a member,  support their efforts,  and in this climate where delisting of wolve off the endangered species act, horrible things are happening to wild wolves in their few ecosystems.  We need wolves to thrive not be hunted.  Please spread the significance of their center we need more like this. 
International Wolf Center	298771		/users/profile/96637	bagel4	Former staff	5	08/01/2016	The International Wolf Center offers many great opportunities to learn about wolves -- both at their facility in Ely, MN where you can see the ambassador wolves and take part in wonderful programs,  and online at www.wolf.org where you can watch the wolf web cams or get information about wolves around the world. The staff is knowledgeable and conveys a real passion for these beautiful animals. The Wolf Center does a great job with environmental education for people of all ages.
International Wolf Center	86345		/users/profile/96637	bagel4	General Member of the Public	5	04/19/2011	My family and I visited the International Wolf Center in Ely, MN and it was an amazing experience. Seeing the "ambassador" wolves was a life-changing experience for my children and for me.  The staff was knowledgeable and helpful and the facility was amazing. I can't wait to go back and take part in the many programs they offer for adults and children.
International Wolf Center	298747		/users/profile/389640	JohnVander	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2016	The International Wolf Center is a vital key to my work as a children's educator. Real time facts and no fooling around with myths and legends. They take their work seriously and as a result they are foundational in the work of preserving one of earth's most amazing creatures.
International Wolf Center	298746		/users/profile/389639	cnrizzo	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2016	This center is world class! The center alone is a wealth of information,  but the staff add so much to the experience!  I always leave leaning something new. I will continue to keep visiting and supporting the International Wolf Center. 
International Wolf Center	295978		/users/profile/386745	Gailyn B.	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	This is one of the best non-profits. Their mission is education. They teach science and let people form their own opinions based on facts. They are not political. 
International Wolf Center	295378		/users/profile/386182	Melinda30	General Member of the Public	5	07/11/2016	I've visited this center back in March and have planned another trip next month and I live in South Carolina.  It is amazing to see these gorgeous wolves up close.  The staff is very knowledgeable and the facility is beautiful.  Must see. 
International Wolf Center	295366	1	/users/profile/386170	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/11/2016	I have been enthralled with wolves since 1993, and when my family took me to the International Wolf Center in 1998, I knew that this passion was more than just a small fancy. As I have grown, I have also watched the Center grow: enriching the exhibit enclosure with a pond, more rocks and trees; creating retirement enclosures and a pack holding area; the expansion of the wolf lab for the care of wolf pups; new technology being added into daily programs to aid in the dissemination of information to the public. Through the murky waters of economics, ecology, politics, and preservation, the IWC has sought only to educate the world about wolves, because an individual will not fear what they do not understand (and the wolf has endured through decades of misunderstanding). I had the honor this year to participate in the Wolf Pup Care program, which made a childhood dream of mine come true. All of my experiences with the wolves and staff of the IWC over the decades of my life have been formative, and I cannot imagine the Northwoods of Minnesota without the presence of this humble facility. Their work with leading experts in the field of conservation and biology have uncovered more about the secret lives of this animal  in the last 20 years than we previously knew, which enables the public to be on the leading edge of information. I would be pleased to see the IWC receive funds through this campaign so that my children and grandchildren may also have the opportunities to see such majestic creatures exhibit their natural behaviors so we can do right by their wild brothers and sisters.
International Wolf Center	295365		/users/profile/386169	JessicaKatzenberger	General Member of the Public	5	07/11/2016	I visited the International Wolf Center for the first time on a Girl Scout trip when I was 10 years old - and I was immediately hooked. I fell in love with wolves at a very young age, but the chance to get so close to them turned it into an addiction. Since then I have visited many times over the years, and I recently became a member as well. The IWC does an amazing job educating without prejudice - they give you the information from both sides of any topic, and let you make your own judgment.
International Wolf Center	261433		/users/profile/350042	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2015	The Best Wolf Learning Center in the world.  The Ambassador Wolves, Staff and the Center itself with the Store, many Programs, Wolf viewing area and social media including Webinars make this a must see destination!
International Wolf Center	261059		/users/profile/349651	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2015	I have loved wolves ever since I was a kid.  I read every book about wolves in our local library in Philadelphia.  Wolves are terribly misunderstood, and I really dislike how they continue to be viewed as something to fear.  More people should live like wolves do.   My trip to the International Wolf Center in Ely was a great experience.  The people there are very knowledgeable, and eager to answer questions.  The big viewing window looking out on the wolf yard is fascinating.  Some of the wolves walk up to the window and look you right in the eye as though you are the one on display, not them.  The people at IWC have a great Facebook content, and keep wolf lovers up to date with the new pups, the pack, and the retirees.  Their page is constantly teaching "wolf".
International Wolf Center	260938		/users/profile/349530	Gail60	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	I have loved the International Wolf Center in Ely, MN since the first time I visited in 2010.  I have always been in awe of wolves.  I am a proud member of the IWC and drive up there every year and sometimes twice a year.    Since visiting there I have learned so much about wolves that it has only intensified my feelings of awe.  I have adopted two different wolves, and  I always look forward to what I can learn the next time I visit.  I have the utmost respect for the way the curator Lori and her staff protect both visitors and the wolves.   The center offers wonderful programs and the staff is always willing to respond to questions.  
International Wolf Center	260864	2	/users/profile/349458	Don_43	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I've been a member of the International Wolf Center since 1999 when I first learned of the wonderful educational programs that they offered.  I participated in several of these adventure programs and in the process learned much about wolf ecology and behavior plus met many people during these programs that shared the same passion for the wolf as I do. About 10 years ago, I decided to move near the center and became a volunteer. I'm now a part of the wolf care staff and helping out with various educational programs that they still offer to carry out their mission to "teach the world about wolves".
International Wolf Center	260798		/users/profile/349386	Nuthatchlady	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	As a naturalist, I have lead many bus tours to Ely, MN to visit the Wolf Center.  We have always had wonderful educators from the Center provide interesting and thought provoking programs with a non-biased approach.  The information is up-to-date concerning wolf research and wolf politics.  Our tour participants learn so much and with the experience of viewing the wolf ambassadors, they take away first-hand knowledge of wolf behavior.  I have used the wolf cams during many of my own programs on wolves and the participants are always engaged and curious.
International Wolf Center	260663		/users/profile/349245	Amber77	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I loved volunteering so much fun and the staff was always friendly and willing to answer questions can't wait to go back someday soon 
International Wolf Center	259752		/users/profile/348274	MapleWolff	Former staff	5	09/25/2015	The international wolf center is a top notch nonprofit. The non biased approach to wolf education the Center takes on is like nothing else. I am extremely proud to call myself Center Staff.  
International Wolf Center	259739		/users/profile/348262	Megan92	Volunteer	5	09/25/2015	I was able to help out to clear out the wolf pens when I was at Vermilion Community Collage. Plus for a class I studied the behaver of the main pack. All of this was because the main caretaker was one of my teachers and club adviser. 
International Wolf Center	259320		/users/profile/347841	Doreen8	Donor	5	09/24/2015	My husband and I have been a member and donor of this great cause, for about 10 years.  It is great talking with the staff members that are in the cites and up in Ely, MN.  They teach about the habitat that wolves live in the wild.  You can learn about behaviors of wolves, how they are doing in the US and abroad.   It is always very interesting to learn at the center about what's for dinner - for the ambassador wolves that are located on site;  behind the scenes and if you are there in the evening, you might have one of the ambassador wolves come close to the window so you can get a nice photo of them.  There are other programs that you can be involved with; for instant how they can search for collared wolves, in the wild with the use of telemetry; signs of where the wolves have traveled by recognizing wolf tracks, etc.   So much to be educated about wolves and their survival.   
International Wolf Center	259163		/users/profile/347681	barbarawhitney	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2015	After hand-feeding an alpha black male wolf, who'd been caught and brought into Mpls, (via a bet) to get him set free back where these two guys found him, I became very interesting in wolf and how wise and sweet they truly are.  That's when I got involved in the Int'l Wolf Center online.  The information given is very educational, the people very kind and courteous, and the pictures and film (since I'm now in WA) just amazingly beautiful and caring of the very species I worked to get free.  The guys who caught him, could not get near the cage they had him in, they had to put a ladder against the top of the cage to feed him.  I bet them that within one week I would hand-feed him and while they thought I was nuts, they agreed.  I spent everyday talking to him telling him that it wasn't just him who had to trust me, but that I also to trust that he knew where the food ended and the hand began.  They told me I didn't have to do so, but wolf and I had something to show them about respect and compassion.  He lifted the raw steak off my hand, set it down, came back and licked my hand clean of every bit of blood residue and then he sat down and grinned at them.  They took him back the next day to right where they'd found him.  Right in the Int'l Wolf Sanctuary territory.  I told them about him and they watched for him and his pack, and that's how we began to communicate.  If there's a pledge, a petition, a film or a picture they want me to look at (this is 30 years later) they make sure to send it to me via FB.  Questions are answered quickly, and they are very open to answering even the silliest of ones as well, without any attitude.  I highly recommend this agency for this award as they've been instrumental in making people aware of wolf's true habits and personality and have always answered any question I might have, or any other petitions I might post as well.  They are my heroes and I couldn't say anything bad about them, because I've only experienced kindness and respect.  Please help them and others learn about wolf and how wondrous a creature wolf truly is.  Thank you.
International Wolf Center	259160		/users/profile/347676	Holly75	Donor	5	09/23/2015	We first visited the Internal Wolf Center this summer. We were so impressed with the quality of their educational programming we joined as members that day. We've since enjoyed their YouTube videos, webinars and returned to the center as part of a day long bus trip from Minneapolis to Ely that included an amazing behind the scenes tour. I have long been concerned about the future of wolves  and feel that supporting the center's mission to teach the world about wolves is the most helpful investment I can make.
International Wolf Center	209562		/users/profile/272322	Jim_106	General Member of the Public	5	08/08/2014	When visiting Ely with my son, we had the fortune of discovering the International Wolf Center. This rich experience changed my knowledge of wolves both in history and in ecology. My son was duly impressed at the dedicated pack of ambassador wolves sand their behaviors. The learning experience was a lasting one, and both my son and I became regular donors/supporters and remain so even years after the visit.The center is well laid out with visuals about wolves in literature and mythology, challenging some of the most prevalent myths and revealing atrocities humans commit against a species they fear and lack for understanding.  If more people could experience the International Wolf Center, such ignorance and cruelty as has taken place would be itself replaced by a deeper appreciation of wildlife in general and wolves in particular.
International Wolf Center	209466		/users/profile/272229	Terri43	Donor	5	08/08/2014	Several years ago, I first visited the IWC.  I came away with a new perception of the role of wolves.  Now, every time we visit Ely (most recently, three summers in a row), IWC is my primary destination.  Was privileged to learn about pups with the most recent additions and watch them grow.  We always spend several hours at the center.  I most like the educational programs and the films we have viewed in the theater there.  Always watch the weekly You Tube videos, too.        
International Wolf Center	209168		/users/profile/271941	BetteQ	General Member of the Public	5	08/07/2014	My family and I have loved wolves for many years. Last year our vacation was in Ely and the IWC. We had a fantastic time! Lori was wonderful. She explained the wolves habits and personalities in great detail. She, along with all the other employees were so professional and helpful. We are happy to support  the Center, and are looking forward to another vacation there. Ely is a beautiful town, with friendly people and amazing shopping. IWC please keep up the great work! The wolves, people in Minnesota and the world appreciate all you have done and continue to do. If you're reading this and haven't visited the IWC, what are you waiting for? You will not be disappointed! Great memories await you! Bette Q
International Wolf Center	209134		/users/profile/271902	Cheryl99	Donor	5	08/07/2014	I have loved wolves since childhood and have been an active donor and supporter of the Center for 10 years. My busband and I attended the International Wolf Symposium they hosted in 2013 and intend to sign up for the Oct 2014 Wolf Trek. I would gladly volunteer my time (now that I'm retired) and fund the financial expense for the opportunoty to help socialize new members to the ambassador pack.  That would be an absolute dream come true for me...and something I truly believe I was put here to do.  My love for wolves defies explanation. I am so proud of the Center's work and the impact they have made in helping people understand wolves and their role in sustaining healthy environments. They have and will continue to truly make a difference for wolves...and I shall support them all the way!
International Wolf Center	209103		/users/profile/271874	tbaw22	Volunteer	5	08/07/2014	I visited Ely for the first time a few years ago and fell in love with the town, the people, and especially the IWC.  They brought to life a love of wolves I didn't know I had until I visited.  What an amazing place and amazing people, working tirelessly to educate the world about wolves.  I've been back each year and plan to continue the tradition for many years to come.  The IWC is one of my most favorite places, anywhere.  
International Wolf Center	208433		/users/profile/271119	Traci6	Donor	5	08/02/2014	I discovered the IWC via the weekly youtube videos & have only visited thru the internet. This is one of those few non-profits that achieve their mission statement everyday. I have learned so much about wolves in the past year. The IWC has ignited a passion in me about wolves that I wish I was younger so I could go back to school & study wolf biology. From  photos, logs, & videos I feel like I know the Ambassador Wolves personally. When Artic wolf Malik died I donated a small amount in his memory. A few weeks later I received a photo of him with a wonderful letter. When Shadow passed away, again small donation, I received a phone call. Just amazing the way the IWC treats it's members & public. From Lori & the entire Wolf Care staff, to the board, to the volunteers, this entire organization is truly inspiring. I am planning my first visit for 2015 & can't wait!!!

IWC does a fantastic job of teaching people about wolves and the environment.  The on site visits by people are something they will never forget.  Volunteers and staff work together to provide an valuable learning experience.  I am proud to be a volunteer for IWC.
International Wolf Center	147443		/users/profile/90830	Judy Hunter	Board Member	5	12/30/2012	I'm a proud member of the International Wolf Center board of directors. Isn't it great that this is such a multi-faceted organization? The International Wolf Center is a comprehensive resource for students, teachers, outdoor enthusiasts, biologists, naturalists, scientists, researchers, environmentalists, conservationists, and anyone who values and appreciates wolves and the important role they play in our environment. Our members and donors fall on all sides of controversial issues. At a time when polarized debate occupies much real estate in contemporary culture, an organization like the Wolf Center plays a more valuable role than ever.  Our mission of education makes us a leading organization in the world of wolves.  We strive to teach everyone about wolves and humans and the impact we have on the environment.
International Wolf Center	83034	1	/users/profile/90830	Judy Hunter	Volunteer	5	03/23/2011	The Internatioal Wolf Center is a mission driven organization with a mission of educating people about wolves and their behavior.  The education is centered around the environment and how wolves and humans are vital in the balance of nature.  I have watched the pack at the Center grow and have seen the difference a wolf can make in the life of an individual.  We have a lot to learn from their behavior and how they function in a family.  
International Wolf Center	208093	1	/users/profile/270775	KateJ	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/31/2014	I have been a supporter of wolves for a long time, and this particular organization always comes up in conversations I have with another non-profit that I work for. This seems to be one of those model non-profits that others look up to. Even their website shows a sense of compassion and professionalism and sincere desire to make a positive difference to wolves and their habitat. If I ever travel to MN, this is one place I will most definitely visit because I believe it is a worthwhile venture.
International Wolf Center	208019		/users/profile/270709	Ladymindful	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	My visits come via the internet. For a long time I was watching Malik & Shadow. When I saw a wolf was missing I sent them an email. They let me know that Malik had been euthanized. Shadow followed his brother two months later. Via webcam I can see the staff interact with the wolves. They are very caring. The site is very informational and their goal is to save wolves and educate the public. I have donated several times. They do a fine job.
International Wolf Center	208013		/users/profile/270702	Gangoom	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I have been a life-long supporter of wolf conservation. My annual trips to Ely, MN to visit the International Wolf Center convinced me that they do a magnificent job supporting the preservation of the wolves and wilderness. They do it in a professional, mindful,  and knowledgeable way to meet the needs of  the public at large and the needs of this unique species through the power of education.
International Wolf Center	207981		/users/profile/270675	conniedibratto	Donor	5	07/31/2014	I discovered the International Wolf Center by accident when I was surfing the web for live web cams related to wolves and I've been a faithful observer or voyeur of the wolves at the center ever since.   I personally loved watching Shadow and Malik and how they interacted with the wolf care staff.  It was a pleasure to be a small part of their lives even though I won't be able too see them anymore since they have both left us.  Grizzer has now moved into the space and he's a delight to watch as well as Aidan, Denali, Luna and Boltz in the Exhibit area.  The wolf care staff are wonderful, knowledgeable and helpful with questions submitted to them on Facebook and through their website.  I've yet to visit the IWC but it is definitely on my bucket list.
International Wolf Center	192055	1	/users/profile/250639	mdw20	General Member of the Public	4	01/04/2014	I visited the center in 2011 and found it very informative.   Staff and volunteers were very helpful.   They allowed us to walk around and move at our own pace.   If we had questions that someone was unsure of they always directed us to someone who would have the answer.  Nice displays.  Never easy to see wildlife confined to a restricted area but they seem to have made life for the resident wolves comfortable.  I plan on visiting this Spring or Summer again.Since wolves are now legal to hunt again in Minnesota, I feel this organization can hopefully help the wolf population not be diminished.
International Wolf Center	188191		/users/profile/245472	Tanner	Donor	5	11/08/2013	The International Wolf Center serves an important function in educating people about wolves.  I traveled from California to Minnesota for the express purpose of visiting the IWC and thoroughly enjoyed the center's educational displays, staff presentations and discussions, and the opportunity to see the center's ambassador wolves in action in the wolf yard.  The center also maintains an excellent Web site that allows the public to follow the ambassador wolves and upcoming center activities.  Seeing these magnificent animals up close was a wonderful and exciting experience, especially after having had the chance to learn all about the center's wolves via web cam and weekly updates.   I believe that the IWC's educational focus helps to fulfill a vital need by providing a better understanding of wolves and the role they play in the environment.  
International Wolf Center	186512		/users/profile/97066	Rebecca Mesa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2013	I started out as a volunteer for the International Wolf Center in 2006.  When a position opened I applied for it and got it.  I've been a staff member now for almost 7 years.  I love working for the Center and love my job.  It is very gratifying to work for such a worthy cause and the people I work with are fantastic!  I love the contact I have with all our members/donors and enjoy hearing their stories.  I also see first hand the dedication and care our staff has for the wolves and the people who support them and us.  And, of course, I love all the wolf education I get too!  We truly are THE organization to go to for accurate and honest wolf information.  Information is power, and with that power, a lot of good can be done.
International Wolf Center	126539	2	/users/profile/97066	Rebecca Mesa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2012	After I retired from the Air Force and moved back home to Minnesota, I began volunteering for the International Wolf Center in April 2006.  I absolutely loved it!  Such a wonderful staff and volunteers, and I felt appreciated and knew I was helping a good cause.  In Feb 2007 an opening came up in the Membership department and I applied and got accepted.  I've been here ever since and can't imagine being anywhere else.  I see the passion in the people I work with every day, and it is so inspiring.  Education of the public is so vital to the well being of the wolves.  We must not only love and care about them, but must know them and understand them the best we can, and pass on that knowledge.  The International Wolf Center reaches people all around the world, and we often hear from our supporters about the impact we've made in their lives and for the wolves.  Thank you to all of you.
International Wolf Center	86645		/users/profile/97066	Rebecca Mesa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2011	I was a member of the Air Force for 21 years.  In 1996 while home on leave I went to the Minnesota State Fair.  I visited the International Wolf Center's (the Center's) booth outside the DNR building and picked up some educational materials.  When I got back to my duty station I filled out a membership brochure and mailed it in.  I've been a member ever since.  I moved back home after retiring from the Air Force.  In 2006 while on my way to a local lake, I passed a sign for the Center.  I didn't realize their administrative offices were so close to my home!  I signed up to be a volunteer.  In 2007 a position opened for a Data Entry/Membership Assistant and I applied.  I got the job and am so honored to be a part of this organization.  Every day I see the hard work the staff and volunteers do and the good they bring about.  We are a very professional group of people dedicated to educating people about wolves.  Knowledge is power, and the more people learn about wolves the better they will be able to provide for their well being.  I remember my first trip to see our ambassador pack up in Ely.  I got the the tingles so strong and the beauty of these animals just brought tears to my eyes.  As much as I've been there, that same feeling never goes away.  It's an absolute love story.
International Wolf Center	185357		/users/profile/242319	Lisa309	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	The IWC does it right!  They take the time to educate the public by engaging the visitor to become appreciative of Wolves. They want the public to walk away with a diverse look at the species and its importance of survival within the ecosystem.  What I find fascinating is that they don't glamorize the wolf to the public they paint a realistic picture of the species and how it isn't always cute but an integral part in the balance of nature.
International Wolf Center	185207		/users/profile/242166	boltz	Board Member	4	10/30/2013	The International Wolf Center does an excellent job of delivery their mission of education.  We teach the world about wolves through the Center in Ely and the experience of observing wolf behavior on site.  The Center also just completed a Symposium that attracted wolf biologist from all over the world to come and share their experiences with wolf research.  It was an opportunity for everyone to learn and network.
International Wolf Center	184260		/users/profile/241197	Sharon97	General Member of the Public	4	10/29/2013	After many years of being a member, I was finally able to visit the International Wolf Center in Ely, MN. I was very impressed, beautiful facility. Very educational. I give it an A+. Only wish we lived closer so I could volunteer. They try to educate the public and give them the knowledge on wolf behavior.  Very impressed on how they get the children involved in different activities, they are our future.  Keep up the good work!!!
International Wolf Center	183698		/users/profile/240611	Eve S.	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	Absolutely wonderful educational facility. Love hearing about wolves, enjoy watching the exhibit pack, and they have wonderful programs for all ages. Really makes the public aware of the contributions animals like wolves make to the environment. 
International Wolf Center	183646		/users/profile/240563	debie_campbell	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	The IWC is such a top notch organization.  I am a proud member and I have confidence that my dollars are used wisely for the many facets of what the IWC does.  I have been to the center twice and plan on trying to come each summer for many years to come.  They have numerous educational opportunities  available.  You can watch weekly updates on YouTube  with great narration by Lori Schmidt.  You can see that the wolves are taken care of far above any standards required by the USDA.   I like that the IWC does not take a political stance on the issue of wolves and thereby creates an environment In which all sides are able to come together and have a science based discussion on wolves and their role.  I had very high expectations the first time I visited the center, they blew my expectations out of the water!  I began planning my next visit the next summer immediately after returning home.  I am planning my visit for next (2014) now. 
International Wolf Center	183456		/users/profile/240369	JacobTepsa	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	It is a great place! I love going to the International Wolf Center! They have an awesome YouTube channel showing many things that the wolves at the wolf center do. The staff are wonderful. The International Wolf Center hosts some pretty cool events.  Dr. David Mech and  Nancy Gibson have worked together to make this a great place. They have good and well known experts at the wolf center. Nancy jo Tubbs has done a great job as the Chair of the Board of Directors. I would like to thank all the staff and the people at wolf Center for making great trips for me. This wolf Center is doing a great job and keep it up guys! Thank you!I would also like to thank Rob Schultz and Judy Hunter for showing me around and also you guys are so great and are so good at your job.Lori Schmidt Wow, you do so many great things for the Wolves at the wolf center, Thank you. You are a great Wolf Curator.Jacob Tepsa
International Wolf Center	183270		/users/profile/240180	Nina13	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	I was involved in wolf studies in the late 80's and early 90's and had the opportunity to see the pups  raised and how they evolved. The Wolf Center is a great educational opportunity for children and adults alike. I have been there several times over the years and am always pleased with the visit. They also offer great hands on experiences. International wolf Center is one of my favorite non profits.
International Wolf Center	180711		/users/profile/237393	Judy92	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2013	I love learning about wolves, and always look forward to the weekly updates on the resident ambassador wolves as well as the great narrated videos. 
International Wolf Center	147855		/users/profile/195631	PBAnderson	Board Member	5	01/08/2013	PaulAs a board member of the International Wolf Center, I have worked with Dr. David Mech since 1990.  His incomparable experience comes from 55 years of wolf research, being a member of the Eastern Timber Wolf Recovery Team and the Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Team and a former member Mexican Wolf Recovery Team. He authored the first Red Wolf Recovery Plan. He has written nine books and three scientific monographs pertaining to wolves and has authored 300-plus scientific articles about wolves and wolf prey. Dr. Mech collaborates with wolf biologists all over the world as Chair of the Wolf Specialist Group of the International Union of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) of the World Conservation Union.  Although Dr. Mech founded the International Wolf Center and supports it in many incredible ways, he is not a spokesperson for the Center. Dr. Mech speaks about wolves based on his and other scientists' research and for his own agency, the U.S. Geological Survey.To understand wolf biology, it is essential, but not always easy, to learn the factual, unbiased information that science provides. The International Wolf Center is very fortunate to have Dr. Mech and his associates, who are the worlds leading wolf researchers, as resources for the information we share with the public about the real wolf.
International Wolf Center	146930		/users/profile/193991	Nancy jo	Board Member	5	12/18/2012	In 2012 the International Wolf Center board heard some odd scuttlebutt implying that the Center supports the state's hunting and trapping policies and is funded by the state's Department of Natural Resources. This is pants-on-fire false. The DNR acts (only) as the Center's landlord and, in fact, the Center pays the state an annual lease fee. All parties agree that, as a well established 501c-3 non-profit, the Center is independently guided  mission, policy and operations  by our board of directors. With education as its tool, the Center takes no stance on issues, including hunting. We provide science-based information about wolves and strive to be a place for educated dialogue. We respect people's ability to form their own informed opinions about difficult questions. To those of you who have connected with the International Wolf Center  through our ambassador wolf pack, educational programs, distance learning, Web site or our interpretive facility in Ely, MN  THANK YOU. Your commitment to wolves and their habitats is key to their continued survival. We appreciate your feedback and value your input.
International Wolf Center	146902	1	/users/profile/193951	trailsend	Client Served	5	12/17/2012	I frequently teach about wolves in classrooms throughout Wisconsin. I've had nothing but positive experiences with the International Wolf Center  through educational programs, resources on its Web site and at the staff at the interpretive facility in Ely, MN. The members of the ambassador wolf pack there are some of the most impressive educators around. I'm just part of a community of more than a million people who benefit each year from the Centers work to provide education and outreach about wolves to people of all ages everywhere. The Center inspires me to a commitment to wolves that keeps me reaching out to the most important people in the wolf's future  today's school children.  
International Wolf Center	146899	1	/users/profile/193948	Debbie73	Volunteer	5	12/17/2012	For me, the International Wolf Center is a valued place where people of opposing views on wolves can come together. This intersection allows factual data to be the focus, so anyone can feel free to ask tough questions and learn. As the saying goes, knowledge is power. Providing people with relevant, up-to-date information and a range of perspectives encourages healthy, respectful dialogue and empowers all of us to make informed decisions. In a contentious world, the Wolf Center is a treasure that deserves my donations and my membership.  Debbie H.
International Wolf Center	141060		/users/profile/187286	MichelleV	Donor	1	11/18/2012	I was a member of the IWC for years but stopped donating and visiting after Minnesota wolves were removed from the endangered species list, a hunt/trapping season was put in place and the founder of IWC, Dr. David Mech, claimed to be neutral on the issue but has written articles and been quoted several times saying things that only support killing wolves and lessening the population.  I received a Membership magazine from the IWC this quarter that even talked about the hunt as if it wasn't going to happen, it mentioned our DNR taking into consideration a public comment on the hunt.  The article was grossly outdated because the hunt/trap was put in place long before the article was written and the DNR never took the publics comments into consideration.  80% of people surveyed by the DNR are against the hunt/trap and yet David Mech keeps making comments in favor of the DNR's decision.  I gave money for years to the IWC thinking I was educating people on wolves to diminish the irrational fear people had in order to keep our gray wolf population safe so they could keep growing in numbers.  Instead our state wasted countless dollars bringing back the wolf from the brink of extinction only to have them slaughtered once more. http://www.wolf.org/wolves/learn/basic/resources/mech_pdfs/311Considerations4DevelopingWolfHarvesting.pdf
International Wolf Center	141057	1	/users/profile/187282	Melissa110	Donor	1	11/18/2012	I won't be donating to any wolf organization that supports wolf hunting. And Dr. David Mech does.
International Wolf Center	135986	1	/users/profile/181891	BettyM	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	It all started with a visit to the International Wolf Center booth at the Minnesota State Fair and a trip to the flagship educational facility in Ely in 2001.  I  had always been interested in wolves and their behavior, so I inquired about volunteer opportunities which led to my first experience helping at the 2002 Minnesota State Fair booth.  Ten  years later, I am still volunteering.  It is a privilege to help the Center because I support its mission to advance the survival of wolf populations by teaching about wolves, their relationship to wild lands and the human role in their future.  I enjoy working with the staff and other volunteers and it is rewarding to know that you are truly appreciated for your commitment.
International Wolf Center	135766		/users/profile/181649	Carolyn32	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I had the honor of being a Pup Care Participant this summer at the International Wolf Center, and have participated in several events over the last few years  The staff is always great to work with, and they do a fabulous job of educating the world about wolves.  I look forward to every visit!
International Wolf Center	135711		/users/profile/181590	hcrossing2	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I have been a member of the International Wolf Center since 2000 and a volunteer since 2004. The staff has been fantastic to work with. Extremely knowledgeable, caring about their work and very outgoing. Every visit results in learning something new about wolf pack dynamics. By volunteering, I have been allowed the opportunity to see behind the curtain and observe how hard the staff and other volunteers work to make the center a success. A big thank you to Lori, Donna and the rest of the crew for letting me be a part of your world. -Garth
International Wolf Center	135494		/users/profile/181357	wolflvr4evr	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	It is truly an honor to volunteer for an organization of people so dedicated to educating the public on this intriguing, majestic animal.  Animals tend to bring out the best in people and this organization is no exception!  Once you view the website, volunteer, or visit the Ely exhibit, you will feel the energy and be hooked as a supporter for life!

This place does so much good in educating people truthfully about Wolves. They take great care of their captive Wolves and work really hard to ensure the future survival of Wolf populations. I think this place, its Wolves and its staff are amazing!!!
International Wolf Center	135326	1	/users/profile/181191	Audrey7	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The International Wolf Center is a great place to learn more about wolves, their environment and their interactions with humans. They give factual, science-based information to help people decide how they feel about wolves and the controversies surrounding wolves. I've talked to thousands of people each year at the many educational booths the Wolf Center has at various public venues in Minnesota. I've also volunteered at the Wolf Center in Ely, taking care of wolf pups, working on the enclosures for the wolves and doing fund raising. It's a great organization to visit, to volunteer with, and to donate to. You can see your dollars at work right away in the lives of the resident wolves and in the education the Center offers to visitors to the Center and the website, wolf.org. 
International Wolf Center	135299	1	/users/profile/181161	ERC52	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	In 2004 I had my 1st opportunity to volunteer at the International Wolf Center for pups Grizzer, Maya and Nyssa.  It was as experience I cherish and will never forget.  This year in 2012 I participated in the pup care program for Boltz and Luna, another fabulous experience like nothing can compare.  It is wonderful to be able to keep up with the pups and the pack via the web cams, wolf logs, utube and visits to the center.  We are fortunate to have the Center in our community.  Their role is important, to educate people about preservation of the wolf and our lands and to understand how humans and wolves can co-exist.  The International Wolf Center plays an important role in supporting our community and it is my pleasure to support them.  Ellen
International Wolf Center	135239	1	/users/profile/181105	Leslie29	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I have been involved with the International Wolf Center for many years. I became a member over 15 years ago after talking with some of the volunteers at the Minnesota State Fair booth. Four years ago I started actively volunteering for the organization, and now I work at many events where we educate the public about the organization and their flagship center in Ely, MN. I have never met such a dedicated group of staff, and I can say the same for the volunteers. Everyone is very involved in promoting the mission and goals of the center. I was lucky enough to be chosen for the Pup Care Program this past summer. What an awesome experience! The focus of everyone was the socialization of the pups so they would be comfortable in the exhibit with the existing ambassador wolves and with wolf care staff in Ely.  I am also involved with the local offices here in Minneapolis on a  monthly basis. This is a great organization to volunteer with and support!

International Wolf Center	135203		/users/profile/181066	CherieW1	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The International Wolf Center in Ely Mn offers a wealth of information to visitors at their facility as well as through their website and educational programs. I have followed the events at the center for four years before I actually ever personally visited the center this summer. I had the privilege of being a participant of the Observation Team during the introduction of Luna and Boltz into the Ambassador Pack. It was an experience I will never forget! I remember observing not only the wolves (which is what I was there to observe) but also the visitors to the center, as they watched with great interest as the drama unfolded amongst the pack.  Adults and children alike were mesmerized looking out from the observation room and watching the dynamics of the pack unfold. I look forward to my next visit to IWC!

International Wolf Center	86816	1	/users/profile/97302	Nanjot	Volunteer	5	04/22/2011	If a friend asks "Were you raised by wolves?" it's time to check your table manners. Do you snarl at your siblings when they try to share your food? Have you ever scratched your ear with your foot? And we won't even ask how you mark your territory. But we will invite you to come meet your "relatives" in the Ambassador Pack at the International Wolf Center in Ely, MN. Bring your friend. You can both learn how real wolves act and what we humans can do to help the extended family survive when wolf habitat is shrinking and some human folks now live next door to your old pack. I'm a volunteer at the Center and never tire of watching our resident wolves teach visitors about the real wolf. No offense. 
International Wolf Center	86692		/users/profile/97136	schmidlo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2011	I work at Vermilion Community College as a Natural Resource Instructor but I also serve as the Wolf Curator for the International Wolf Center.  I started working in the NR profession in 1978 and as the Wolf Curator for the Center in 1989.  I've seen a lot of growth and strength from this organization in the past 25 years.  The Center focuses efforts on serving  visitors in a wide-variety of ways including on-site, web-based, print media, distance learning, seminars, learning vacations, retail operations, shared curriculum... the list goes on and on...Many a student has started their professional wildlife career by observing the ambassador wolves, taking a ethology course, spending a day at the Center or engaging in behavioral studies via the Center's Youtube channel and wolf logs.  Engaging people to learn facts and form opinions, the root of all educational endeavors.
International Wolf Center	86631		/users/profile/97045	gibsonwolf	Board Member	5	04/21/2011	When global news of wolves appear, it is the International Wolf Center, that leads the charge for science-based information that is critical to the survival of this species. That was the reason I joined the board 25 years ago. A quarter of a century later, the Center has stayed in touch with the world with one of the best websites, high tech long-distance learning, a first-class magazine and conferences. Yes, I am partial to this organization, but even more, I am partial to wilderness and the habitat needed for all of us to survive. 
International Wolf Center	86602		/users/profile/96995	alglemke	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	My first visit to the International Wolf Center was 23 years ago.  We were in Ely on a family vacation and went to see the new deal in town. I remember my children being mesmerized by the wolves and when we joined in the howling and the wolves howled back we were hooked.  To this day a trip to Ely is not complete without stopping by to visit the center.  I joined the Board 6 years ago.  I've learned so much and really appreciate the high quality of wolf education offered by the center. The staff is top rate!  And their programs reach far beyond the walls at Ely.They truly live their mission of educating the world about wolves.
International Wolf Center	86583	1	/users/profile/96975	Neil	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	I am Neil Hutt (short for Cornelia), and I have been a board member for 12 years. I am the chair of the board Education Committee, and I serve on the advisory work team of International Wolf, the Center's quarterly magazine. The Center and I go back over a long road. I discovered its existence just after it became a reality over 25 years ago. I was teaching secondary language arts with an academic team (math, social studies, science and language arts), and the wolf became the cornerstone of our team's curriculum. The Center was one of our primary sources of information. Much has changed in terms of technology since the organization's beginnings, but the mission of the Center still drives the work it does - teaching the world about wolves.  This organization sets the standard for accurate and current facts and information, and in a world where reliable sources seem to becoming more scare, it's important to know the International Wolf Center is there to provide answers and to guide our thinking.
International Wolf Center	86527	1	/users/profile/96897	Tara Johnson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2011	I first visited the International Wolf Center to see a program called, What's For Dinner, where the ambassador wolves are fed their weekly meal.  Wow--it was informative and interesting to watch the wolves eat right outside the big glass windows!  After the program, I was hooked. I enjoyed my experience so much that I applied for a teaching internship  with the organization and now work in their education department.  It is an honor to bring family and friends to visit the Center and the town of Ely.  If you haven't been to see the wolves, exhibits, programs or visit the store, I highly recommend it to people of all ages!
International Wolf Center	86448		/users/profile/96769	Deb Wells	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	Hello, my name is Deb and my involvement with the International Wolf Center has crossed through several roles.  I began as a "general member of the public" by visiting the Center in Ely, MN.  I then found out about the many engaging and educational programs that were offered, which of course led to enrollment!  :)  My enjoyment of all that I learned and experienced by participating in the programs fueled a desire to become even more involved, so I became a donor and volunteer.  The Center's fact based, unbiased approach to forward the mission of "advancing the survival of wolf populations by teaching about wolves, their relationship to wild lands and the human role in their future" is something I fully support.  I am currently showing this support by acting as a member of the board.
International Wolf Center	86439		/users/profile/96760	RayWells	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	I recently joined the board for the International Wolf Center.  What excited me about becoming more involved was the focus on education.  This is an organization which believes in providing facts so people can make up their own mind on issues related to wolves, in wild lands, and the human relationship.  The best people are on staff offering fact based programs in order to fulfill the goal of educating the public.  Combine this with the biggest names in wolf biology supporting the organization and you end up with something outstanding.The best vacation I have ever had was the Arctic tundra learning vacation through the International Wolf Center.  Spending time with the representatives of the organization during this trip really illustrated the focus on answering questions honestly.  If you have a question about wolves they will not judge you and will simply tell you the facts.  How many organizations do that these days?

However, I do think that if you compare the IWC with other wolf advocacy organizations  you will find that our science-based  approach to provide objective information, rather than propaganda, about  wolves will in the long run better help wolf populations survive in more areas.  
College Possible	219472		/users/profile/283082	manderson3	Volunteer	5	10/02/2014	This is my first year with College Possible and it has already been an amazing experience. The staff are truly the most idealistic and supportive people I could have asked for to assist as I work with students at my schools. I know that I can come to them with anything, big or little, and they will do whatever was necessary to answer questions or solve problems. I am so lucky to work with an organization that achieves such amazing results and believes so strongly in their students and AmeriCorps members. I am excited to finish this year even though I know that it will be difficult at times because I know that I have the support from this organization to make a difference with my students. 
College Possible	218858		/users/profile/225715	RocioA	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	This is my second year serving as an AmeriCorps VISTA member at College Possible. There are many reasons why I decided to return to serve with College Possible but the most important to me is that our work reaps great results. The experience I've been gaining working for this organization is very valuable and meaningful to me.  I can only hope that many other people acknowledge how great this organization is and dedicate a year of their lives to keep achieving industry-leading results.
College Possible	170346		/users/profile/225715	RocioA	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	College Possible not only has a great mission but it also has a passionate and talented team. Being involved with this organization has been very satisfying. As a first generation student, I have been through some of the challenges that most low-income students face when trying to go to college. Looking back to my high school experience, it would have been so much more rewarding if I had the opportunity to be a College Possible student. The students that College Possible takes in are amazing people and have great potential as professionals. I'm glad that there are people so invested in the futures of children today. I highly recommend getting involved with this organization. 
College Possible	218184		/users/profile/281738	miss.maeve	Volunteer	5	09/29/2014	This is my first year serving with College Possible as a College Coach and I absolutely love it! Everything they stand for and model themselves after is fantastic. They truly care about their students and want to do everything possible to assist capable low-income students in reaching and achieving their dreams and goals of obtaining a 4-year college degree.  I love being a part of this team and look forward to being involved with the organization in any way, shape, or form for many years to come! They are a great community organization that is truly making a difference in the lives of their students (and the Metro Area community!) by providing support and resources to students in high school and beyond.
College Possible	216345		/users/profile/279834	car123	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	I have been serving with College Possible for over a year, and I am impressed by the commitment to excellence that the organization expects from the every single person involved with the program. Not only does the organization have really well thought out and sincere intentions, but College Possible also demands actual results. College Possible's focus on efficacy means more students from low income backgrounds are going to college. That means more opportunities for generational cycles of poverty to be broken, communities to be strengthened by their college educated sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, cousins, neighbors, teammates. That is unique, and extremely needed in the United States. 
College Possible	216260		/users/profile/279734	AJBurau	Volunteer	4	09/22/2014	This is only my first service-year as an Americorps Member (2014) and thus my first with College Possible. Everything I love about this program comes from my students and coworkers. It's incredible how well my students and I know each other in the few weeks we've been together after school. It's comforting how open they are to sharing and letting us into their lives. The students in this program are a real inspiration. It's also amazing to find coworkers who share my passion for service. They're a whole new class of people for me that I connect with on a level that hadn't been matched before. I feel like a whole different person here. This organization has touched my life, opened my eyes, and will create unbelievable opprtunities that I'll never forget. 
College Possible	216186		/users/profile/279648	Matt71	Volunteer	5	09/21/2014	This organization not only does so much for underrepresented communities, but the organization is so well-run. From their tried-and-true programming to their expansive development to their effervescent culture, they truly keep students in mind at ever step of the way. College Possible has shown me how great organizations are run.
College Possible	215848		/users/profile/279302	KathleenR	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	I've talked to many of the students that have been in the College Possible program and the excitement that comes over their face when talking about their relationship with their coach is inspiring. These students deeply trust and care about their mentors, and College Possible brought them together to achieve the students educational goals. I've seen student who didn't know what the ACT was do well on it all because of College Possible. Students who didn't have a future after high school are applying to and getting into the college of their dreams. The work College Possible does is empowering youth who really need to be empowered. These students are going to go far and make big changes in the world. I am honored and grateful to be a part of such a powerful nonprofit.
College Possible	215793		/users/profile/279242	klillehaug	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	Even though I have only been serving at College Possible for just a month, it is I can say, my favorite position I have ever held. From the incredible work ethic of all who serve to the variety and spice that College Possible encourages on a daily basis, coming to College Possible in the morning is something I am truly excited about. The work that College Possible does is so meaningful and playing apart in the process is such an honor. 
College Possible	215782		/users/profile/279231	Trenice F.	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	Coming to College Possible has been the best thing that could have ever happened to me. Not only does it helps other people like high school and college students succeed in life but it is also helping me become someone that can make an opportunity happen. Being in a newly developed position, I can say that I am taking on the heavy responsibilities as an opening to my development as a young professional. I sincerely love the job that I have and I am grateful that my friend who is in college possible as a student told me about this program. GO COLLEGE POSSIBLE!
College Possible	215774		/users/profile/279223	sanch9601	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	As soon as I learned about College Possible and the work that they do, I knew that I wanted to be a part of this program.  One of my big goals in life is to help more minority students get to college and College Possible is helping me achieve that goal.  Seeing students at the high school I work at just reaffirmed that my role as a Junior Coach is important ant that I am making positive change in the world!
College Possible	215773		/users/profile/226069	MandiPrichard	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	This is my second year serving as an AmeriCorps member with College Possible and I knew almost as soon as I started last that I would want to come back. I really believe in the work we do and the results show it's successful.
College Possible	170641		/users/profile/226069	MandiPrichard	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	College Possible has the unique ability to be both idealistic and realistic at the same time. The leadership team is committed to real results without losing sight of what the organization really strives for - educational equity. I am so happy to be part of an organization that doesn't just get students into school but helps them develop the tool-kit they need to be successful in college. This is what nonprofits should be about.
College Possible	215643		/users/profile/279079	jc14	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	With the short time I've been at college possible I've gotten to meet over forty amazing individuals. My cohort. Each one is bright and strong willed, and motivated. They have rough days but they persevere and know what College can do for their future. College Possible assists these students in getting to and through college, and also gives them the tools to realize their own potential and leadership skills. I'm so fortunate to get to be a part of it all. 
College Possible	215631	1	/users/profile/279067	kyshaymcd	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	College Possible doesn't just help lower income, first generations get to and through college, it fosters the well-being and development of young volunteers across the country. I am ever grateful for the training and support I have received from this nonprofit while working to support an inspirational group of high-school students.  
College Possible	215619		/users/profile/279054	kali.pauling	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I have only been serving with College Possible since the middle of August, but I have already learned so much about what it means to be an AmeriCorps member and a part of College Possible. I am still not really sure how my year is going to go, but I know I'll have a wonderful support system to get me there. I really had no idea what an office setting, "real adult" position was going to be like, but I certainly was not expecting it to be this engaging and impactful. I am excited for all the experiences to come while serving with College Possible Portland. 
College Possible	215615		/users/profile/279050	kjm1991	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	College Possible gives SO much support to their volunteers and really makes them feel important and valued. This makes our work so much easier to do because we know that what we are doing is making a difference and that we have people behind us cheering us on. I have been in non-profits before and this has been the best experience. I truly feel like a valued member of the organization who will "get things done" for America.
College Possible	215614		/users/profile/279049	Tonya10	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	College Possible makes positive change in students lives by helping them achieve their dream - and their families dream of going to college and earning a degree. Working with College Possible is a great opportunity to help others achieve their potential. I hope it continues to grow and expand and help more and more low-income students reach their full potential.
College Possible	215611		/users/profile/279046	willowhombsch29	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I have had lots of experience in non-profits between internships and volunteering, but I have never worked with an organization that is SO organized and therefore effective.  In my position here I've not only received training that has exceeded expectations, but also felt that I've really helped make a difference. Keep up the great work, College Possible!
College Possible	172186		/users/profile/227919	SueN	Board Member	5	09/27/2013	When you hear from the high school students who are involved in College Possible, listening to their hopes and dreams for the future and their willingness to work hard to achieve those goals, you can only marvel at their determination.  College Possible provides a pathway that becomes a journey to success for students who otherwise might remain stuck in a marginalized environment.   Bravo College Possible.  The success rate of College Possible is a stunning achievement, in and of itself.  
College Possible	171884		/users/profile/227535	suzanne1130	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	Great organization! They truly understand that going to college is extremely beneficial in our society and they also recognize that getting to college is not always a clear easy path. College Possible uses resources, great people, and a lot of energy and time to help low income students with high hopes and drive have the resources to understand the process of getting to college, successfully apply (98% of the students are accepted into college!), and also succeed in college. They make sure each student gets the attention they deserve. Additionally, they care about the neighborhood and encourage philanthropy through their organization wide volunteer events. 
College Possible	170744		/users/profile/226166	Jamie47	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2013	This is an amazing organization. They do the good work and help students prepare to succeed in later life. Their rate of graduation is impressive for such a newly formed organization. We need more places like this to show students of every race and socioeconomic level that college is a possibility for those who want to work for it. I have deep respect for every mentor at College Possible for the effort and time they give to these kids. 
College Possible	170735		/users/profile/226159	Lori Schaefer	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	I have been a donor and avid supporter of College Possible since it was first founded by Executive Director Jim McCorkell in the Twin Cities 13 years ago. It is the gold standard bar none!  Not only is the idea behind the organization strategic, brilliant and life-changing for so many low income students who wouldn't otherwise have access to higher education, but it creates lasting and systemic societal change. It is a win for the students and their families, a win for those lucky and talented enough to serve as staff an on the boards, and it is a win for our communities and our economies long term.  I have worked in the public sector, the private sector and now own my own business. In my 25+ years I have not seen another organization - locally or nationally - take measurement and results (providing a serious return on investment and constantly improving that ROI) - as seriously as College Possible. It is the gold standard when it comes to ensuring that it delivers results and is continually evolving and improving.  College Possible is beyond impressive. It should be in every school and every state. And more nonprofit organization's could look to College Possible as the gold standard for how to lead and achieve. 
College Possible	170516		/users/profile/225958	britt12	Volunteer	5	09/19/2013	College Possible has a team that is passionate about making a difference for the children they are trying to help.  I hear stories of students and how sometimes it may be hard to deal with some students because of that students circumstances, but the co-workers that I work with continue to try despite the challenges.  
College Possible	170454		/users/profile/212563	gotsdinerj	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	Great organization. I love that we follow students through college and don't just ship them off on their own.
College Possible	160289		/users/profile/212563	gotsdinerj	Volunteer	5	06/11/2013	I am incredibly proud to report that 31 of my students will be attending college tuition-free this fall.  This amazing outcome would not be possible without my students' hard work and the support of the College Possible program. I have learned so much about the college admission process, scholarship applications, and financial aid this year, and I will use this knowledge in my future career as an educator. Hooray!
College Possible	170379		/users/profile/225742	CPCRV	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	Upon researching positions available on the AmeriCorps website, I happened to come across College Possible.  Within a few hours after reading through College Possible's website, blog, and seeing personal stories from both students and Corps members, I found myself scrambling to get in touch with folks who could vouch for me with recommendation forms, writing personal essays, and submitting application requirements in time for the early application deadline.   Little did I know that the efforts I was making on a cold January day would lead to where I am today.  Serving with College Possible has truly been an eye-opening experience in the worlds of higher education, poverty/low-income, and non-profit organizations.  I never guessed that I would have the opportunity to be doing such meaningful work with a non-profit organization shortly after college.  Each day, I find myself working on projects, taking the lead on tasks, researching data, and supporting students in a way that I only thought was possible by holding a high-level position in the admissions office of a university, for example. I am very excited to see what my remaining service year has in store!  "1-2-3-COLLEGE POSSIBLE!"
College Possible	170371		/users/profile/225734	sgrant05	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	College Possible is amazing. Truly. I have had the opportunity to work with college students from across the nation. Helping students advocate for themselves has been one of my favorite parts of my time with the organization.  Providing that extra reminder or phone call to motivate a student has been so rewarding and I am so grateful for the work that College Possible does! 
College Possible	170361		/users/profile/225727	JCorby	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	College Possible is an organization that succeeds due to its carefully-created system of support, its innovative approach to college access and community involvement, and its incredible team of individuals  who consistently strive for improvement day in and day out. You can tell that those who laid the foundation of this organization spent a serious amount of time and energy in discovering what really works in the field of college access and success. On a personal level, it is truly amazing to serve with people who exhibit such positive and idealistic traits on a daily basis. Additionally, it's equally encouraging to witness an organization that is so in touch with the students of today. 
College Possible	170356		/users/profile/225723	sdooin	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	I've never worked somewhere where I've felt more supported. Not only am I attached to the mission of this organization, but we are actively making a difference in countless lives each day. This is a model that truly works, and is a sure fire way to demolish the achievement gap. 
College Possible	170350		/users/profile/225719	jmangeli	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	Serving with College Possible has been life-changing for me, and I can already see the ways my service will change the lives of my students. College Possible is results-driven, and being able to measure the work we're doing is instrumental in providing the best possible instruction to our students. Because they are so focused on making measurable change, we service members are able to gauge our progress and support each other in a more informed way--which is so wonderful! I'm so honored that I was given the opportunity to serve, and I look forward to the future with College Possible and my students. 
College Possible	170345		/users/profile/225714	Adam J.	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	College Possible is an awesome place.  Just about everybody that works there is super optimistic and idealistic about their goal of helping low-income students graduate from college.  It is really all about the kids, and College Possible shows it by everyone maintaining their focus on helping students directly through the college process from start to finish.  It is all about results.  In the end, College Possible only succeeds if it helps a high school student that wanted to go to college succeed in that dream.  I can't really think of a better organization when it comes to directly impacting people's lives in a meaningful, sustainable way.
College Possible	170343	1	/users/profile/225712	skit_boo	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	I was introduced to College Possible at a career fair. I had no idea what I wanted to pursue post-graduation. I decided to apply to College Possible as a way to give back while I did some soul-searching. I come from a low-income background and was the first in my family to attend/graduate from college so I definitely believed in its mission and the work it was doing. Little did I know that I would also discover something I was extremely passionate about. I am currently in my second year of service and words cannot express what this organization means to me. I see the impact it has on our students and the communities we serve every day. I wish I could have been a part of College Possible as a high school student, but I am really glad I am able to be a part of it now as a service member. If I could do this for life, I would be more than happy to.
College Possible	170338		/users/profile/225709	cpvolunteer2013	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve with College Possible!  I served during the 2012-2013 school year and came back again for a second year.  As a coach working directly with high school students, I am given a tremendous amount of support and always feel like I have the resources to do my job well.  We receive comprehensive trainings, excellent supervision, and transparent feedback.  I have grown personally and professionally because of this.  I also appreciate the freedom and responsibility I am given at College Possible.  As a recent college grad, I was floored by how much responsibility I had, and how I was trusted to make decisions and create programming that was enjoyable for students and helped accomplish organizational goals.  Finally, I love serving with a results based organization, and I have enjoyed tracking my students progress throughout the year in order to make me a more effective coach.
College Possible	170273		/users/profile/225635	Graham Sutherland	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	College Possible is a unique organization in that it is both vision and results driven. Everyone who works here has an unbridled optimism that translates to motivation and hard work towards the organization's goals of college access and success, but at the heart of it all is the realistic, result-oriented goal of helping the students achieve their college-going dreams. At the end of the day, they really care about each and every student and helping them achieve their goals. College Possible is doing great work in sites all over the country, and is definitely an organization on the rise in the world of education equity.
College Possible	162617		/users/profile/215827	Stephen M. Smith	Board Member	5	07/14/2013	I was introduced to College Possible about five years ago and joined the board two years ago. Everyone I've met who is associated with College Possible shares an irrepressible passion for education. That passion is coupled with an intense focus on delivering measurable results for students, for our other direct stakeholders, and for society. The organization and the results it produces are phenomenal.
College Possible	162452		/users/profile/215617	Laura Gillund	Board Member	5	07/11/2013	I've had the opportunity to serve on the College Possible board for three years.  It is a phenomenal organization for three reasons: it has great people, the results are impressive and exceed those of peers, our students lives are forever changed.  Whenever I have the opportunity to talk with students in our program, I am struck by how many of them say, "College Possible changed my life".  Kids today face so much adversity, it isn't easy for them.  Our program really makes a difference, through our people; it impacts lives in a personal and sustainable way.
College Possible	160402		/users/profile/212685	knickodem	Volunteer	5	06/12/2013	I have served as an AmeriCorps member with College Possible for almost two years now and it has been a transformative experience.  I have had the opportunity to guide and learn from 38 wonderful students, all of whom earned acceptance to college.  I am greatful for the opportunity to serve with this organization and see my students grow into responsible young adults.
College Possible	160316		/users/profile/212588	amariew	Client Served	5	06/11/2013	I'm proud to serve with this organization as an AmeriCorps member. I am proud to watch my high school students flourish and grow with the support they are offered from this program. I'm proud to be a part of the very necessary college access work in this country. This organization does amazing work to close the barriers. 
College Possible	131522		/users/profile/177085	Kelse064	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I have only been with College Possible a short time, and I am already convinced that their work is life changing. I have worked with several non profit organizations related to education, and very few have been as well organized and supportive as College Possible. I am constantly surprised by the way that the leadership team supports coaches, and the ability to which coaches are able to support their students. As a Senior Coach I am connected to every one of my students, and feel confident that with the support of College Possible, I will be able to support them in a way that will lead to their acceptance into a four year university. College Possible is an organization that is composed of people who want to make a difference, and are truly dedicating themselves, and all of their time and energy, to making that happen. Education is the future.
College Possible	130634		/users/profile/176111	holdonhope824	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	College Possible is achieving incredible results that have a life-altering impact on low-income students in the Twin Cities, Milwaukee, and Omaha. Students receive the support, guidance, and encouragement they need to not only get accepted to college, but to graduate with their degree. This organization is not only changing lives, it's changing the conversation about higher education and college access. I believe its work is one path to ending the cycle of poverty in America. I am humbled and privileged to have worked with College Possible students and to have been a part of this amazing organization.
College Possible	130561		/users/profile/176035	kevin.finnegan1	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	This is simply an fantastic organization that is doing meaningful work: if you are in this program, you will get into and go to college, period. It has been a pleasure to serve with College Possible, and to work with such exceptional students. Not only are the results fantastic, but the work is easily replicated and needed in every large metropolitan area in the United States. To support College Possible is to support the future of the United States, to pave the path to success in areas where there were no roads before.  
College Possible	129231		/users/profile/174599	cpdevelopmentvista	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I have been serving with College Possible for almost 3 months and I have found every week to be educational and inspirational. Working with students is definitely one of the highlights whether it's proctoring a practice ACT, chaperoning a campus visit, or talking to students one-on-one about their hopes for college. Daily I am reminded of my awesome experiences in college and it makes me want to work even harder for our students to ensure each one of them has the opportunity to find their right college.   
College Possible	128353		/users/profile/173507	CPCorps95	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	College Possible is an exceptionally organized and motivated organization. They are extremely results driven and go above and beyond for their students. I have been serving with College Possible for all of three months and I already consider it the best job I have ever had.  The main focus of this organization are the students. I truly feel that College Possible is changing lives!
College Possible	128317		/users/profile/173468	CPVista	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	I have been serving with College Possible for a year and am extremely impressed by this organization and their commitment to their students. College Possible staff and AmeriCorps members go above and beyond to make sure every student has the opportunity to attend college. Many of these students are the first in their family to attend college, so the support, guidance, and care that students receive is critical. What impresses me most about College Possible is the heart that goes into their work -- yes, this is a job for the staff and AmeriCorps members, but it is also a passion and I know that each person cares deeply about education inequality. I have had a wonderful experience at College Possible and am proud to have served with an organization that is creating positive change and bringing hope to students and families for a brighter future through education.
College Possible	127972		/users/profile/173097	JCO2012	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	Though still in my fledgling months serving with College Possible, I know that this year will be an influential one. Upon graduating from college, I knew that my calling was somewhere within the realm of education - I just didn't know where. Now, I know. Creating a level playing field for low-income students and closing the achievement gap is no easy task, but with the aid of organizations like College Possible, I truly believe the potential for our nation's youth is limitless. The attention to detail, along with the heartfelt care and exemplary motivation that I have seen throughout this organization has been nothing short of inspiring. Attending college should not, and can not, be for a priveleged few. Knowledge is power, and that power should belong to everyone. With College Possible, it can and will. 
College Possible	127930		/users/profile/173050	cp2012	Client Served	5	10/23/2012	I always knew that I would go to college. My parents were refugees and never had formal American education so they always encouraged me and my siblings to pursue our education. I was also very studious and did well in school. So if I didn't have College Possible, I'm sure I would have still made it into a college somewhere. The difference that College Possible made on me is opening my eyes to all the options that were available to me. Though I did well in my classes, the ACT was a different story. I was so disappointed when I saw my score the first time I took the practice ACT. Through ACT prep and practice tests I was able to raise my composite score 6 points and well over the national average. My parents would have never been able to afford ACT prep for me. In terms of college search, without the push of my coaches in College Possible, I would have been content commuting to a public university near home. Instead I graduated from a private selective college where I was far enough that I had to live on campus. College became an experience rather than just a school I attended. College Possible steered me to a direction I never even knew was available. This organization has impacted me so much, I chose to give back by becoming a Corps member serving for College Possible. I now see a different perspective of this organization and I still think it's an amazing non-profit! The more I learn of College Possible, I become more and more proud of it.
College Possible	127913		/users/profile/173033	cc2012	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	I have been serving with College Possible for approximately two months and already I'm impressed with the success achieved by this non-profit. 98% of students who go through this program are admitted to college and that number will only continue to increase, even as they expand. There are countless stories of students who would not have gone to college, even though they are more than capable, if not for this organization. Idealistic people do amazing work here. Enough cannot be said about how great this organization is for our community.

Colelge Possible's numbers are staggering: 98% of students earn college admission after increasing their ACT scoresby an average of 21% through the high school program. 57% of students will graduate from college within six years and will ultimately give back more to society in both tangible and intangible ways. It's this record of excellence and the results-driven approach of College Possible that makes me proud to serve here. College Possible does some noble work, and it does it very well, which shouldn't surprise anyone whose met the quality individuals they select for their corps. I am constantly imrpessed by the idealism and work ethic of my fellow corps members, and they remind me that moving out to Wisconsin was a very good decision indeed.
College Possible	127873		/users/profile/172993	Liz_17	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	I have served with this program fora little over two months now.  I went into it not sure exactly what to expect, and so far have never felt happier about the work that I do.  While my job is challenging in that it is  mainly technology-based, my students are responsive, and greatful for our help every day.  They take the time to tell me just that, and I couldn't ask for more from my job.  Just knowing that I've had enough impact for them to express their gratitude make this one of the most meaningful things I've ever done.    
College Possible	127872		/users/profile/172992	vjasperson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2012	The first time I herd about College Possible, I thought it was a great idea and a great mission. When I interviwed to be a coach at College Possible I found their work even more inspiring. Now that I work with College Possible I can say that their organization is more than just inspiring, it is organized, efficient and results driven. The people who serve for College Possible are the ones who make all this happen and they truly uphold the mission, culture, and success of the organization. 
College Possible	127867		/users/profile/172985	KJPossible	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	As a current AmeriCorps VISTA for College Possible, I've been nothing short of thrilled with my experience. I recently graduated from a 4-year college in May so, aside from a summer internship, this is my first "entry-level" position in the real world. College Possible produces astounding results for our work in assisting low-income students with college access and success, and is an incredible place to serve. College Possible really strives to harbor a comfortable, fast-paced, and fun work environment for both AmeriCorps members and the leadership team. The leadership team invests an incredible amount of trust in each cohort of AmeriCorps members, giving us a high level of responsibility and the chance to develop excellently relevant skills that most entry-level positions don't get to experience. I'm continually working one-on-one with the leadership team to better myself as an AmeriCorps member, a College Possible volunteer, an example to the students we serve, and an individual. 
College Possible	117990		/users/profile/160471	mykellee	Client Served	5	07/10/2012	I am an alum of this program since 2007 from Harding Senior High School.  I joined in 2006, when it was still called "Admission Possible."  It was a wonderful experience for me and my friends that I went to high school and college with.  We still keep in touch with our coach.  She was a wonderful role model to us, and also such a motivator.  She was our second mom, and even throughout our senior year in college she came to visit us, because our college was also the same one that she graduated from.  I definitely recommend this program for all and every single youth, it will help you find your college, scholarships, and improve your ACT scores.  TWO THUMBS UP FOR "College Possible."
College Possible	98835		/users/profile/117508	cvang88	Client Served	5	10/01/2011	I am an alum from Roosevelt High School and have since then gone to college and continued to professional school. Coming from a refugee family with little support in western education, I found Admission Possible to be one of the most beneficial programs I have ever been a part of. They helped tremendously in ACT preparations through personalized sessions where the AP coaches went through each subject with us, hitting the high points and making sure that student knew what they were doing. AP also provided practice exams that gave me a good idea of what to expect on the exam. Then during senior year, it was the college application help that got us going. I have realized through participating on student panels and talking with students that having the program made me a much more knowledgeable person about the whole college application process. My parents and extended family couldn't help me because I'm one of the first ones to go to college. My friends were just as lost as I was, so having AP there to help guide, inform, and encourage me was very inspiring. Now, I am more self aware and take the initiative to control my future. Through AP, I have continued to develop a confidence that is needed. Now I understand what it really means when people tell you that "knowledge is power." Thank you, AP, for your support. Just like you, I will also have a future of helping others. --Charles Vang, Roosevelt High School Class of 2006, Macalester College Class of 2010, University of Minnesota Medical School Class of 2014.

College Possible	98527		/users/profile/117010	REBEKAH.ADAIR	Volunteer	5	09/28/2011	I served at Admission Possible for over 5 years, as an AmeriCorps member and on the Leadership team. I look back at those years as some of the most rewarding and meaningful in my life so far.  The organization is truly driven by passionate, results-driven people.  The culture of Admission Possible is contagious and I believe people genuinely enjoy working there.  Service members are given flexibility, ownership over projects, and are acknowledged for going above and beyond.  It is rare to find a place so driven by a mission.
College Possible	98522		/users/profile/117003	Knights04	Client Served	5	09/28/2011	Like most students growing up in my neighborhood, my family was not in a financial position to provide me the resources to get in to a good college. That was when I found out about Admission Possible. Initially I joined Admission Possible in order to take advantage of the extra ACT practice tests that were given as part of the program (Not test prep, only practice tests). In fact, there were times I grew impatient with ACT test prep sessions being given because I had already read the ACT Test Prep book from cover to cover on my own time. Shortly after significantly improving my ACT score due to these additional practice test, and before I had a chance to leave the program, I realized that Admission Possible was serious about getting me into college. I realized I had established a strong relationship with my mentor, who encouraged me to be my best. With his help, I was able to shape my college and scholarship application to represent who I am, what I've accomplished, and what I plan to do in life. Before I knew it, I was graduating from the Admission Possible program, with college acceptance letters from all five of my college choices.  I walked into Admission Possible hoping to improve my ACT score. What I discovered was a group of friends that shared the same academic goals. I discovered that a winning college essay comes from the heart and soul, and does not always come from an A+ paper written in english class.  Most importantly, I met a mentor that was genuinely interested in my college endeavor. Instead of giggling when I told him about my college choices or telling me how difficult admissions would be, he focused in on my eyes in a moment of silence and then in an understanding tone he said, "okay" and nodded. To me it was important that he lived in the same neighborhood as I did, and knew what it was like to grow up in my community without proper parental or financial support. In short, Admission Possible taught me that I was not alone in my pursuit for a better life. Without them, I can't imagine where I would be right now.     
College Possible	98516		/users/profile/116998	zimme	Volunteer	5	09/28/2011	Admission Possible not only helps the low-income youth it serves, but it also helps the staff and volunteers who serve them. Never in my life have I been surrounded by so many ambitious, caring, smart people as when I served with Admission Possible. Students, staff and volunteers all worked hard - early, late, weekend - so that elusive dream of college would become a reality. And we did it using a curriculum based on experience and success. This program has helped so many youth dream of a future bigger than they had thought possible, and given them the tools to achieve it. 
College Possible	98514		/users/profile/116994	mmolzberger	Volunteer	5	09/28/2011	Admission Possible was a huge influence in my life.  It opened my eyes further to the harsh reality of the education gap between low income students and their higher income peers.  Admission Possible is devoted to decreasing this gap and has a corp of volunteers, leadership team members, and willing students working constantly to realize this goal.  The Admission Possible program provides a cost effective strategy that has, and will continue to, change the lives of thousands.
College Possible	98512		/users/profile/116991	michtorg	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2011	Students who go through the program not only receive skills to get them into college, they gain the soft skills to make them successful, well rounded and productive citizens. They receive mentorship from the coaches and participate in volunteer activities.   I did manythings at Admission Possible, but possibly most significantly, I was a coach of the very first cohort, I am happy to say that, 10 years later, I still keep up with my students, who are now flourishing adults.  Admission Possible is an incredibly well run organization with a highly committed staff, strong and diversified fundraising, and impeccable financial oversight.  Jim McCorkell is a tremendous social entrepreneur, mentor, and advocate for college access and public service. The organizational culture is nurturing of AmeriCorps members and staff and is definitely a training ground for the future's nonprofit  leaders and top educators. Working at Admission Possible was one of the best experiences of my life.

I didn't think it was possible for a low-income, first generation student to go to college. Joining Admission Possible in for my junior and senior years changed my life. They showed my that college is possible for anyone and everyone given the resources they need. Admission Possible prepared me for, and signed me up to take the ACT, apply for financial aid, apply to and actually get in to the college of my choice. As a now sophomore in college, I credit my success to Admission Possible as a whole and the wonderful coaches they employ. I am now a social work major hoping to make a difference in people's lives, like Admission Possible did for me!
College Possible	98245		/users/profile/116661	Douachee	Client Served	5	09/27/2011	I was a high school student with Admission Possible from 2002-2004.  Although I always knew that I would go to college, Admission Possible really help me see all of the college opportunities in front of me.  Not only did they help me apply for college, but they actively advocated for me with college admissions representatives.  My biggest college dream was to get into the Carlson School of Management at the University of MN, and my coaches worked so hard to make that happen.  It really helps to have someone there to support me, no matter what my goals were.  My parents pushed me to go to college, but they had goals set up for me.  Admission Possible made it possible for me to really follow my dreams; and again, they believed in me and my dreams.

I have been consistently impressed with AP's ability to drive up the number of students they serve while also driving down their cost to serve.  They hire amazingly talented young people who do an amazing job helping low income kids get into (and stay in) college.  AP has constantly focused on delivering measurable, verifiable, unambiguous results, something few non-profits are able to do.  In my mind Jim McCorkell is one of those rare leaders who has personal passion, great management skill, and the salesmanship to get people to support him and the rest of the Admission Possible team.  I could not recommend them highly enough.

By providing the supports necessary to access college and then to be successful IN college, Admission Possible provides services to thousands of low income students each year.  Recent independent evaluations have shown that Admission Possible more than doubles the likelihood of their students getting into college and more than triples the likelihood of these students completing college.  Their model is highly efficient, utilizing passionate young people through AmeriCorps, trainging them well, and consistently getting amazing results.

The way that the program is set up shows that they are willing to serve low income students who deserve the chance to make it college of their dreams. This is important because who else does this much intensive work after school, for two years with high school students building them to be better adults who are advocates for service in their community? I love volunteering for Admission Possible and highly believe that this is one of the best decisions that I have made for my life and my future. Who knows where this might take me professionally, emotionally, socially and mentally. I love the journey that I am on and love what Admission Possible is doing!

Education is the future of our state -- and is critical to the success of our nation.  The one bright spot in all of the bad news has been the tremendous work Admission Possible has done to help low income and first-generation Americans get, and stay, in college. The model is low-cost, high results, and the program has grown because it truly works.  It is hard to believe that college graduates would be willing to work for less than a living wage, but whenever I've encountered staff members of Admission Possible, I have been consistenly impressed by their dedication and commitment to the program and to the students.  We need more of this sort of focused work in every region of the country.

One of my friends encouraged me to attend an info session about the program and I accompanied her. After attending I decided to apply and was surprised and excited when I was accepted into the program.  Admission Possible helped me learn more about what college really is, not just fun and games, but a time to learn, grow, and become the person you always wanted to be. Admission possible also helped me in finding the finances to go to a university once I was accepted.  Admission Possible is a great program for students that have to potential, but don't have the means to get where they need to be. I am proud to call myself a graduate of Admission Possible and now a College graduate.

The work of DMAD should be on a national level, and hopefully one day will be.

Dads Make A Difference	224043		/users/profile/287795	mjoberweiser	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/18/2014	I've been a part of the Dads Made a Difference (DMAD) family now for 17 years. During those 17 years I have filled many roles within the organization including teen trainer, adult trainer, staff, and board member. I moved from Minnesota to Oregon in 2009, which meant I was no longer able to fulfill those roles. What has not changed throughout the long history of the organization is the positive, lifelong impact it makes in young people's lives. The positive youth development model empowers young people to take charge of their own decision making. They become informed on life issues that will impact them at some point in the near future, and then they turn around and share that information with younger peers. In other relationships with young people, other positions I've held, I continue to reference the knowledge gained from teaching and training with DMAD.  This program is relevant, necessary and a true investment in young people. I cannot imagine not supporting Dads Make a Difference.

Young people's lives are touched in a way that empowers them to find their voice and make a difference in the lives of others.
Dads Make A Difference	218640		/users/profile/282219	raims004	Volunteer	5	09/30/2014	I have been volunteering for Dads Make A Difference for about 6 years now, and LOVE the program. I myself was a high schooler who attended my DMAD training and absolutely loved going into my local middle schools and teaching the curriculum. So much so that I reached out to Jan about becoming an adult trainer once I began college. She graciously accepted my offer, and I have greatly enjoyed working with Jan and the other trainers ever since. Jan is kind, courteous, and has a deep passion for this cause that is near and dear to her heart. It is my belief that learning the responsibilities of parenting is a key element to a person's overall success and is important to learn at an early age. Not only do children obtain a deeper level of respect for what their parents do for them, but they also begin to develop values that they will carry with them throughout life and into parenting years of their own. The curriculum is diverse, fun, and most importantly; open to all ideas, opinions, and personal stories. I know I do not only speak for myself when I say that Dads Make A Difference is a learning experience that one carries in their heart for a lifetime. 
Dads Make A Difference	167481		/users/profile/190218	MaryKBurnison	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	I recently attended an anniversary celebration for Dads Make a Difference (DMAD) and the testimonials from past participants, trainers, health educators, Minnesota State Department of Human Services, community nonprofit leaders, sexuality education professionals, youth workers, teachers--a range of folks involved in the organization's long history--gave further evidence of the power of this youth development organization and its curriculum to positively enhance the healthy development of Minnesota youth.  It is a peer education program that has effectively educated youth about healthy relationships, sexual decision making and the important role of fathers for many years.  We need to ensure that it continues to evolve in ways that allow it to educate and influence future generations of Minnesota youth. 
Dads Make A Difference	143744		/users/profile/190218	MaryKBurnison	Board Member	5	11/28/2012	I strongly endorse the worth of Dads Make A Difference (DMAD) to our community--its 20-year history of educating young people about the importance of fathers, about relationships and safe sexual decision-making.  The steady and creative stewardship of this organization by Executive Director Jan Hayne (during difficult economic times) and a committed cadre of volunteers have kept it afloat and allowed it to continue to play an active role in educating youth in the twin cities and greater Minnesota.  As a current Board Member and Youth Development Professional, I highly recommend the DMAD organization and encourage you to learn more about it via its website www.dadsmakeadifference.org.  And if you can, I also encourage you to make a donation so it can continue its good work.
Dads Make A Difference	167215		/users/profile/222077	Shirley15	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	Dads Make a Difference meets a definite need and utilizes a proven curriculum model based on research for training and outreach.  Past participants become some of the staff when training is done again.  A great, proven model that makes a difference in the lives of young Dads and ultimately, their child/ren. 
Dads Make A Difference	167195		/users/profile/222056	tdmatti	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	My  daughter took the Dads Makes a Difference training back when she was in high school and she became a participant at Como High School to inform others! DMAD training provided insight for my daughter who had an absent father to give her some hope and understanding around the importance of dads. Being a board member was easy because I have seen the personal value of the vision and mission of this organization's impact on my family! Great work!
Dads Make A Difference	167191		/users/profile/222045	Pbraxton1908	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	Dads Make A Difference - made a difference in my life. I participated in the Dada Make A Difference program in 1996 as a professional in the field. I was professionally impressed and personally touch by the curriculum so much I became a trainer for the program. After training over 800 participants during my tenure, I was blessed to see up close and personal the impact Dads Make A Difference has made in the lives of young women and especially young men. This program continuously makes strategic and intentional efforts to remain relevant. In addition, the capabilty to also be interculturally competent in its language and delivery of sensitive content is no small feat. Please join me in financially supporting Dads Make A Difference so it remains a timeless pillar in our community and beyond.
Dads Make A Difference	167179		/users/profile/190105	miarx003	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	DMAD has been a part of my journey from teenhood to adulthood. I first met the founder of Dads, Jan Hayne, six years ago. I could immediately sense her passion as she told her story, and shared the mission of this amazing non-profit. The curriculum is timeless and yet fresh, traditional and yet innovative, and consistent year after year in core values, life lessons, and practical applications. It is a privilege to work with such amazing people who share Jan's mission of responsible parenting and the importance of relationship building. Students learn it, love it, and share it with their peers, family and friends, and in the digital world we live in, the positive energy Jan brings to her students is shared across the nation. 
Dads Make A Difference	143639		/users/profile/190105	miarx003	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	Being involved in Dads has been an extremely rewarding experience.  I attended training as a high school student, and knew right then that I wanted to stay involved in this program. It is obvious that Jan has a deep passion for the organization and so do her volunteers.  I hope to stay involved in DMAD for a very long time. Great program, great people, great cause! 
Dads Make A Difference	167144		/users/profile/221990	leah s	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	Dads Make a Difference is a program that changes lives. This curriculum not only helps young people make healthy decisions to plan for their futures but it also builds leadership skills and protective factors for young people who are struggling or facing challenges in their own lives. It creates a ripple effect that touches so many people and continues to impact young people in middle school, high school and beyond. It helps create a fuller picture of parenthood particularly for children born to young and/or single parents. It helps build community among trainers, peer educators, their students and staff that weaves a thread of hope and resilience for all young people.

No other nonprofit serves such a diverse group of teens. Without this program, many of our younger adults would be in a much different place personally, professionally and mentally. 
Dads Make A Difference	165819		/users/profile/220325	pnconnally	Board Member	5	08/22/2013	Dads Make a Difference focuses on a market/community that we need to focus on more critically.  Our children need to understand the role of fathers, and their role in their children's lives.  DMAD helps teenagers get a better understanding of the necessity for healthy, continued father/child relationships.  With this increased education, our communities and family structure are enriched - building better better communities.
Dads Make A Difference	165538		/users/profile/220026	Tatanka	Volunteer	5	08/20/2013	Since 1991, I have worked as a clinical social worker in the Twin Cities, and among many other things, have coordinated programs that serve young and older fathers in the lives of children.  I began work with DMAD in 1993 as a curriculum trainer because I was amazed to see such a progressive and creative approach to serving our youth.  Since my first training with the DMAD family, I have been deeply moved by the power of this curriculum, and touched by the warm and personable staff that gather (like groupies to the band they love).   My eldest son, NIcco was very soon to be born in Early February of 2001.   We had a DMAD training, and I clearly remember, standing on a stage (post training) in St. Paul, waiting for our DMAD team picture to be taken.  I had my cell phone on... waiting for a call from my then-wife to say something like: "get your butt home, our baby is on his way!"  The DMAD non-profit is rare, dignified, and extremely progressive.  Our world needs more dedicated and creative efforts put forth toward the underserved youth and family members in our world.  Healthy male involvement is a hall mark of an evolved society.  I heartily salute the Dad's Make A Difference program and all those who have the brilliant conviction and audacious courage to stand with it!   - Jeffry Jeanetta-Wark, MA.

Dads Make A Difference	165534		/users/profile/220023	Robert90	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/20/2013	I have been aware of DMAD for more than 10 years. First as a colleague, then a trainer, and finally as a board member. I was always impressed with the committment and loyalty of those who were involved in the program. This program does make a difference in the lives of those they touch. I support them as a valued community partner.
Dads Make A Difference	164897		/users/profile/219180	amj16	Volunteer	5	08/13/2013	My experience with this program has influenced many life changing events for me. It helped my gain confidence in my teenage years, learn leadership skills and it influenced choices I made. After being a teen trainer teaching middle school students that's what I decided to do for a career. Most importantly it helped me choose an amazing dad for my two children.
Dads Make A Difference	145382		/users/profile/53033	allen027	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2012	How we form families is changing.  The traditions of marriage, children and death till we part no longer represent the experience of many mothers, fathers and children.  But the need for parents who are involved in the lives of their children remains critical.  Dads Make a Difference provides a way for young people  - both male and female - to consider this important need - from their perspective as a young person and also for the future family they will form.  Through a youth teaching youth model, this critical conversation happens in the classroom and through youth serving programs.  DMAD is an excellent example of prevention at it's best.
Dads Make A Difference	52182		/users/profile/53033	allen027	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2010	In my work with families, and with youth, the important conversation about when to have a child and who to have that child with has not been an easy one.  DMAD was developed to help young people and their families consider the very important decision to become a parent.  It was developed to include the young men in the conversation.  It was developed to help young women recognize the importance of a father to their future child.For nearly 20 years, this program has been reaching out to help young people think and communicate about these issues.  It has been evaluated and the results are very positive.  It is a program that has changed lives.  I am very proud to have been a part of this program and know that the work is not done.  We need more opportunity to reach out to the next generation of parents with the information and the conversations provided by DMAD.
Dads Make A Difference	145230		/users/profile/191770	kbroth	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2012	For the teen teachers Dads Make A Difference is the ultimate youth development experience. Not only do they gain personnal insights into the value of involved fathers but they demonstrate skills as effective educators and and leaders for younger students. I continue to be proud of these dynamic and dedicated youth.
Dads Make A Difference	145219		/users/profile/53021	ihearteducation	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	Want to work with a program with a mission purely to serve youth; utlitizing a youth teaching youth model?  You are at the write place.  Dads Make a Difference was a seed in the early 90s but it was rooted itself in the hearts and minds of those lucky to have participated in the program.  It's research-based, interactive, and asks youth to plan for their future.  Absolutely fabulous.
Dads Make A Difference	52171		/users/profile/53021	ihearteducation	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2010	Although I am no longer an active teacher in this program, the experience still resonates in the daily work I experience with my students.  Dads Make a Difference re-framed the way in which I listen to my students' stories.  It also provided a foundation in viewing how peer-to-peer training is a most effective model in reaching adolescents.  And, the message of Dads Make a Difference is universal -- the positive role of fathers in children's lives benefits all children.
Dads Make A Difference	144246		/users/profile/190764	MNDaddy1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/29/2012	I have been an advisor to the development and implementation of the program since its inception. Dads Make a Difference has been a critically important innovation to address the issue of parenting too soon and father involvement in Minnesota. It has played a seminal role in creating dialogue with youth about parenting, mentorship and positive peer advocacy that has contributed to why teen parentage has declined over the last several years thus creating positive futures and eliminating barriers to education and employment for thousands of Minnesota youth..
Dads Make A Difference	144087		/users/profile/190586	Future Educator Advisor	Advisor	4	11/28/2012	Dads Make a Difference is an excellent program.  I have had two groups of my high school Future Educators trained with Dads Make a Difference.  The training is great fun for the students and very valuable.  They were so excited to go out to teach to the junior high!  I am very impressed with the Dads Make a Difference curriculum. 
Dads Make A Difference	143683		/users/profile/190155	green614	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	I was involved with Dads Make a Difference from the beginning as the first staff person and stayed involved for 9 years. Currently I am an annual donor. I witnessed first hand during my involvement the impact learning about responsible fatherhood had on teens and young adults. As a professional still working in the field of teen pregnancy prevention, there is often little focus on males and fathers. I don't know of any other organization and curriculum in Minnesota that educates about Paternity Establishment as DMAD does. I am proud that DMAD has sustained itself for almost 20 years
Dads Make A Difference	143681		/users/profile/190154	Bob Jackson	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/28/2012	I was fortunate enough to see two sets of youth in training sessions.  They were being taught priceless life lessons that you do not get in school.  The questions they asked reflected that they were very attentive and absorbing the concepts taught.  Every child needs to go through this course.  The course provides valuable insight into making good life choices.   Thanks.     Bob Jackson, Hennepin County Child Support
Dads Make A Difference	143635		/users/profile/54393	punky10	Donor	5	11/28/2012	During the 2012 election campaigning, there was a strong focus on women's health, access to birth control and relationships.  I participated in several debates with loved ones, co-workers, friends and community members in regards to these issues and often found myself frustrated by the lack of focus on prevention.  I found myself wishing for more programming like Dads Make a Difference to engage our young people in conversations about what constitutes healthy relationships, what aspects of life emotionally, financially and physically are so important to have in place before bringing a child into the world and how to make informed, planned decisions around beginning families so those children and their communities are stronger and healthier as an end result.  Dads Make a Difference celebrates all families who are raising children in today's society and focuses on personal choice and control in relationships and parenting.  I fully believe if there were more options for Dads Make a Difference to be consistently taught in all high schools and middle schools there would be a reduction in teen parenting, young people accessing or needing welfare and divorces as well as an increase in high school graduation rates, effective co-parenting amongst parents and healthier children.  Dads Make a Difference is a program that has demonstrated effectiveness through evaluation and years of positively impacting anyone who participates and I will continue to support this program as it moves forward.
Dads Make A Difference	53304		/users/profile/54393	punky10	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2010	I first heard about Dads Make a Difference from a peer in college.  She was trainer for the training being held that weekend and from the moment she named the program I wanted to know more.  My dad was the biggest positive influence in my life so I wanted in on this opportunity to create more awareness of the positive impact fathers can have on their children's lives.  I had no idea the impact this program would have on my life.Dads Make a Difference disseminates information about the positive roles of fathers in families, the importance of waiting to parent until a person is emotionally, financially and physically ready, and making healthy choices as an individual to create the future one wants.  From the evidence-based peer teaching model and curriculum, to the Cadillac-version of trainings, down to each member of the DMAD family, this program strives to stay relevant, accurate and engaging for young people in all communities.  The curriculum is updated regularly with current statistics, updated or new activities which match information to real life situations and new information like a focus on healthy relationships, or a new type of family that should be recognized.  The trainers are offered staff development each year which highlights important social issues impacting communities and the young people DMAD serves.  Jan Hayne, working as a staff of one, believes in the mission and the young people she entrusts to carry it forward each year which gives her the energy to push forward alone, always searching for more funders to recognize the wealth embedded in this organization.For the schools and communities who have chosen to use this curriculum year after year since its inception, they have seen the positive impact young people can have when they are given accurate information and encouraged to share it with others.  For the individuals who have chosen to remain engaged throughout the years to volunteer as trainers, interns, board members and teen teachers, they have felt the incredible impact of a shift in mindset to consider the possibilities of a society where fathers are positively invested in their childrens lives.  For me, Ive had young people tell me they are choosing to delay being sexually active until they are ready to parent, several young men I taught went on to establish paternity and become involved in their own childrens lives and I continue to honor my dads role in my life each time I share about my experience with DMAD.  Dads Make a Difference truly is a GREAT non-profit!
Dads Make A Difference	143628		/users/profile/190092	ra_smith2	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	WOW, this is awesome!  I started with DMAD as one of the 1st teen trainees in April of 1994 then became a teen and adult trainer shortly after I trained my first few lessons.  I can truely say that this program helped affirm and direct my life not only personaly but professionaly as well.  Being married and a  father of two wonderfull boys I can look back at the lesson that I learned from DMAD that help shape the husband and father that I wanted to be.  (you have to ask them how I'm doing LOL)  I am now the Director of Recruiting and Training for a large national company where I utilize some of the same teaching techniques I've learned over the years by being a trainer with DMAD.  I can't believe it's been almost 20 years!  Through this program I havr been able to work with exceptional people and have some of the most memorable experiences.  Road trips with Gary and Jan, snoring...I mean dancing competitions with "D", training with Angie in Boston...(Lois hit me up some time LOL).  I even had the pleasure of playing piano and accompany a world class thespian, Mr. T Michael Rambo with Vant on the harmonica!  And with that I must end this review with a quote from the DMAD Theme Song:  "You got to be there, DADS make a difference, show somebody you care!"
Dads Make A Difference	143593		/users/profile/190055	ajkodet	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been involved with Dads Make a Difference since 2000. I coordinated a group of teens who were trained to teach the curriculum to middle schoolers. Many of the teen peer educators had life-changing experiences as a result of participating in this program - one became a teacher, one re-connected with a father who had not been a regular part of his life, and several talked about how what kind of parent they wanted to be. DMAD is a unique program that works to build on the strengths of youth, and truly values their experiences and contributions. 
Dads Make A Difference	143458		/users/profile/189915	Kelly67	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	I have been involved with DMAD since 2002 when I went through the program myself as a teen.  I then began to teach in the community and eventually became a trainer and continue to train today.  I joined the board last year because I am extremely passionate about the work that this program does.  I feel that it shaped my life personally and helped me to become a good role model as a student and now an informal mentor to teens.  I am a social worker by day and really teel that this program has helped me down this career path as well.  I am grateful for my experiences in this program as a teen and beyond and am happy that others have the opportunities to be part of this life-changing program as well!!
Dads Make A Difference	143450		/users/profile/189908	lojebr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/27/2012	As a former teacher and as a member of the staff of the Massachusetts Child Support Enforcement Division, I was so impressed with the Dads Make a Difference program that I replicated it for use with young people in Massachusetts. I had been involved in child support cases with teens who did not realize the financial obligations that they would have once they became parents. The Dads Make a Difference program educates young people about all the responsibilities that parents have and makes a compelling case for why it is better to defer parenthood until they are ready to meet these obligations. The model of older teens presenting the curriculum to middle school youth is very effective, as the younger students look up to the older teens and are more likely to listen to the messages. The Dads Make a Difference program is an excellent source of information that young people need to know and they hear it in a way that is effective. I can't say enough about this wonderful program!
Dads Make A Difference	143366		/users/profile/189819	dkurtzon	Advisor	5	11/27/2012	Dads Make a Difference (DMAD) is a fantastic program that I've had the good fortune of working with over a three year period. I acted as an intermdediary between the high school age teachers, the middle schools, and Dads itself. I attended several top notch trainings and watched the development of the high school facilitators as teachers and role models. It was also a real pleasure to watch the seventh graders and their reaction to and interaction with the curriculum. Dads Make a Difference is an irreplaceable program and a true asset to our kids and communities.
Dads Make A Difference	143333		/users/profile/189783	Dfish	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	 I recommend this program to all high School and Middle schools.  My students have been involved in DMAD over the past 15 years and this program had help them build a better relationship with there father.   Older teens can be effective role models for younger youth becasue they are closer in age and experience. WE NEED THIS PROGRAM

The information I have learned through my experiences with DMAD I use in all the other facets of my life. My relationships with family and friends have improved due to the knowledge gained and taught in DMAD as well as helping me become a better social worker. I have seen hundreds of high schoolers go through this program, enjoy it and learn a lot about themselves and what they want for their future. The information provided by this curriculum is more important than ever before and will assist teenagers in making healthy, positive choices. 
Dads Make A Difference	143222		/users/profile/189660	johnplasch	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I was trained into the program in 1996 as a sophmore in high school.

I had a complicated relationship with my father and this program helped me resolve alot of the issues I had in my own life.

Dads Make A Difference	143199		/users/profile/189631	Ubani001	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I was introduced to DMAD in 2002. I was still a high school student, who had very loose ties to my father. I spent a lot of time in the following years volunteering with DMAD and teaching the progam to middle shcool students. Through seeing the stories of others, I was given the courage to strengthen my relationship with my own father. since 2004, I my relationship with my father has become just as strong as anyone else's. I think DMAD has a great effect on other people like me. It is a 5 Star Organization without question. Those who serve on the board, and those who founded the program have HUGE hearts.

I love that it is peer-taught and the students really respond to the curriculum. Jan Hayne does a nice job of setting up the trainings and the curriculum is kept up to date and relevant to the age group. The communication has been wonderful and professional. The students deserve to have this presented to them.
Dads Make A Difference	142002		/users/profile/52219	lsweet	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	Dads Make a Difference is a unique program in which participants can literally grow up in the program. They start as middle school participants and can become trainers. The team that teaches the curriculum is like a family and provides great roll modeling to high school participants who in turn role model to middle schoolers it should be a required curriculum in the state. 
Dads Make A Difference	51510	2	/users/profile/52219	lsweet	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/01/2010	This program is great in that it not only teaches young people about responsibilities and consequences of too early parenting, it also builds leadership capacity in the teens who are peer educators.  The curriculum addresses peer pressure, responsible choices, family planning, paternity education and more. This unique program offers so much to high school students, middle schoolers and the adult who support it.
Dads Make A Difference	53395		/users/profile/54528	appe0082	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/26/2010	I was introduced to DMAD back in 1997 while working as a Teen Parent Teacher for an ALC in St. Paul.  I felt really good about bringing my students (both parents and others interested) to these trainings!  It was a very thoughtful, researched-based approach to positive youth development and also I felt the excitement of watching my students in their cross-age teaching of Junior high school students! I would highly recommend any schools or organizations interested in helping support the youth to bring teens to a training or have them come teach in your Junior High School.  Students take these topics very seriously and are eager for guidance & direction from all of us caring & encouraging adults in their lives!
Dads Make A Difference	53367		/users/profile/54489	teach1	Volunteer	5	09/26/2010	I got involved in this program as a high school student and then went on to teach middle school students the Dads Make a Difference curriculum. Shortly, after I also became a trainer and continue to train when I can. This is an amazing program that I feel so lucky to be a part of because it has impacted myself and my life in so many ways and so many other people as well. Now a mother of two, I realize even more now how important it is to get out this message to youth about making responsisble choices. It helped me, and every child deserves to have the best their parents can offer.
Dads Make A Difference	52321		/users/profile/53213	oobs26	Volunteer	5	09/13/2010	I started volunteering with DMAD when I was 15 years old back back in November of 2002. I was a you man who had no idea who his father was. After two years of learning/teaching the DMAD curriculum, I was encouraged enough to seek out my own father and ever since, I have had a great relationship with my father. I believe that if it weren't for DMAD, there is no way that I would have such a great relationship with the father's half of my family. nearly 8 years later, I am still very grateful for DMAD. Hopefully it is touching other young people the way that it touched me.
Dads Make A Difference	52160		/users/profile/53010	saramarie1	Board Member	5	09/10/2010	Dads make a Difference is a small but effective not for profit that truly serves a great purpose. They focus not only on the importance of dads but beyond that they focus on the importance of being an active parent. The power of the activities is its focus on education of young adults on the importance of active parents. This helps shape young adults decision making about when to become a parent and all the responsbility it entails.
Dads Make A Difference	52155		/users/profile/53006	angelah	Volunteer	5	09/10/2010	DMAD is a very important part of my life. I was trained in 1994 as a student, after being inspired by the all of the positive aspects of the program I was asked to be a trainer. I have worked with DMAD since 1995 educating hundreds of young people about the imporatance of fater's in children's lives. I have seen the impact that it has made on young people and their choices about becoming a parent to young or being a better parent if they already had children. I have had students come up to me after the traning to let me know what a difference the program made in their lives. I would love to see the program continue and grow so it can reach even more young people who certainly need all the support and direction they can get in this difficult world we currently live in.
Dads Make A Difference	52153		/users/profile/53004	vrinne	Volunteer	5	09/10/2010	I have done the "Dads Make a Difference " Curriculum for many years now and I really think the information is currect, gets the students involved, and the students enjoy it as well.
Dads Make A Difference	52151		/users/profile/53001	jhanson02	Volunteer	5	09/10/2010	I have seen first-hand, many times over the excellent impact that Dads Make a Difference has in the lives of youth in Minnesota. The program brings into discussion difficult topics that can be dismissed in schools and families that are integral to the positive personal growth in young people. The curriculum is not static--it grows and changes with current issues, and the people involved are passionate and committed to its success.
Dads Make A Difference	52148		/users/profile/52998	ck2	Client Served	4	09/10/2010	The students were able to see things in a different perspective and they learned a lot.  I also learned a lot and it has helped me become better at what I do as well.
Dads Make A Difference	52064		/users/profile/52866	dt1	Board Member	4	09/09/2010	I am impressed with Dads make a Difference focus on teaching youth that fathers play an important role in their children lives.  Also teaching the importance of delaying parenting until one is emotionally and financially ready.
Dads Make A Difference	51496	2	/users/profile/52202	kellen2	Former Volunteer	5	09/01/2010	The experience teaching in the classrooms were like no other experience to date. Middle school and highschool students are more receptive to learning from their peers or aspiring peers moreso then learning from teachers. THe message resinates far easier this way.
Cheerful Givers	241890	3	/users/profile/328583	CheerfulMom,	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2015	Cheerful Givers not only makes a difference for those who are the recipients of the "Birthday Bags",  but also those individuals and groups that give of their time and energy in putting together these special bags.  I havebeen impressed with how Cheerful Givers has invited individuals with special-needs to participate in fillingthe Birthday Bags (usually as part of their school program and/or job training).  For many of these individuals, filling the Birthday Bags is their first success in learning important job skills - and life skills as well.  I have watched my young adult son, who has Autism, develop self-confidence and self-determination by taking on the responsibility of organizing and filling the Birthday Bags.  He absolutely loves Cheerful Givers and is so proud of being a part of helping others.  With great enthusiasm my son will say to me "Cheerful Givers is Jordan's job!"   His involvement in Cheerful Givers has given him a real sense of accomplishment and has provided important job skills.  Cheerful Givers touches the lives of both those who receive and those who participate as the Giver.  As my son likes to say, "I love Cheerful Givers!"  And his mom does too...!
Cheerful Givers	279207	1	/users/profile/369269	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/06/2016	Great cause with a great leader (Karen) to facilitate the project. Easy for groups to gather and pack birthday bags for less fortunate children. Not sure about small groups, but for big groups they can bring a packing event to you! Particularly like that this is a dual purpose charity - supports both those with mental disabilities in the charity work and children in poverty as recipients of birthday gifts. Would recommend to all event coordinators.
Cheerful Givers	259123	2	/users/profile/167684	kzieg06	Donor	5	09/23/2015	A great organization that knows how to make a substantial impact in the community serving children.  
Cheerful Givers	242122	1	/users/profile/328878	Luke10	Board Member	5	05/04/2015	This is one of the great grassroots non-profits.  When I think about what it means to roll-up your sleeves and serve a need that moves you, founder Robin provides this inspiration to all.  Cheerful Givers serves one of the many support systems needed to provide families a pathway to growth by experiencing and participating in one of our most basic forms of generosity, gift-giving.  It's easy to explain and involve my whole family including my 4 and 2 year old children.  I'm proud to be a board member for this great organization!
Cheerful Givers	241782	2	/users/profile/328436	Margiebl	Board Member	5	04/27/2015	Cheerful Givers offers birthday gifts from the heart  to the heartAs a Cheerful Givers volunteer and Board member for several years, I have been touched by the generous contributions of children and adults as they share time and treasure to provide birthday bags for children in our community who are less fortunate.  Cheerful Givers is a unique organization that offers each of us the opportunity to bring a smile to the heart of a child.  In fact, Cheerful Givers brought smiles and the joy of being remembered to over 179,000 Minnesota children in 2014 and will meet or exceed that goal this year.  New volunteers are most welcome and donations are essential.  There is a tangible excitement as students, employees, and community groups begin the process of assembling from 50 to 3,000 birthday bags at a single event, with books and toys, knowing that each gift bag will lift the spirits of a child.  Parents who receive the birthday bags through food shelves or shelters often have tears of gratitude for the chance to surprise their child with a real gift.  Children who receive the birthday bags from their family are reminded that they matter.  What an honor it has been to participate in giving a birthday bag from my heart  to the heart of a parent  knowing it will touch the heart of their child.   
Cheerful Givers	241739	1	/users/profile/43729	vlk2094	Volunteer	5	04/27/2015	Cheerful Givers has been a big part my life now for almost 10 years! I have worked at different levels for the non profit. I have been on the Board of directors for 4-5 years. I was on an advisory board for about 3 years since I work for a large corporation. I have made hundreds of birthday bags in my work place. I have done a Volunteer expo on the behalf of Cheerful Givers to round up volunteers for at least 4-5 years. Cheerful givers is an awesome organization to work with as a volunteer you can be very flexible doing as many or little amount of volunteer hours you would like. Not to mention the organization as a whole to make it possible for parents in proverty the ability to celebrate their childs life. a very important thing, as we are all important! Right now there are kids that do not know that, since mom & dad are not able to do do so. is a very sad fact, each kid should know they are important!!   
Cheerful Givers	199974	1	/users/profile/43729	vlk2094	Volunteer	5	05/09/2014	I have been with Cheerful Givers for over 10 years. my experience starts like this. I work at Ecolab & we had one bag making event. I had not heard of anymore so I contacted our community giving folks. They asked if I would like to lead the group to do more events. I said yes. Doing that for six months or so I was asked by Cheerful Givers to participate in an advisory group for corp groups. we discussed how each of us did things, shared ideas on new ways etc. I was with that group for I am not sure how long then was invited to be a board member. I agreed to join the board & was voted in. Was a fun experience I learned alot about being on a board & was able to add my point of view. I was a single mom & had used oportunities like Cheerful Givers for my daughter. I did have to leave the board due to a family event that came up, but I still am involved, some at work & pick up toys monthly to go to the sponsored group CG's has. I also do many volunteer events like the Volunteer Expo each year at the MOA & the yearly MN Birthday party again at the MOA.  I like CG's as it is a flexible organization you can volunteer as much or little you are able to. Cheerful Givers may not save lives, but can change the world "One child at a time!" Take the time & check it out you can not go wrong! There are many kids who do not know they have a birthday, due to their parents not being able to help celebrate that day. Each of us should be acknowledged on our Birthday! It makes us unique & special!  Again  check out Cheerful Givers!!         
Cheerful Givers	111923	1	/users/profile/43729	vlk2094	Volunteer	5	05/12/2012	If you are looking for a very flexible non profit to volunteer for, Cheerful Givers is the one! I have been involved with the organization for roughly 8-9 years.  I have been involved with various aspects of the organization from Board memeber for roughly 3 years, I make bags at my work place, I go to the volunteer Expo at the MOA to promote Cheerful Givers annually.  To mention a few things. Take the time to think of not so fun or bad Birthday or having no party as a kid. Imagine now not beeing even acknowledged on your birthday! that is why I am part of Cheerful Givers.  I know the bags we make go to parents to give their child (plus) Child is acknowledged on his/her Birthday (plus). I know & feel good about making the bag & contributing (plus). there is no way to go wroing!!     
Cheerful Givers	42975	11	/users/profile/43729	vlk2094	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	We started our group at my work place over 7 years ago.  We have continued to make Birthday Bags quarterly, now.  All of my co-workers who participate love to do it!  they feel is a good way to volunteer & help kids & families too!  It does not take much time & we have a great time.  As one of the folks that makes bags said "we can change the world one child at a time!"  I fully agree. Thank you for reading these I hope you will donate or volunteer for Cheerful Givers.
Cheerful Givers	241662	2	/users/profile/229461	Leah R	Board Member	5	04/24/2015	Cheerful Givers is reaching more hearts than ever! With almost 1 million happy birthdays to-date, Cheerful Givers is serving more communities in need. We're pushing harder than ever. Food shelves and homeless shelters continue to seek birthday gifts for children and families. Therefore, we need your help to meet these needs. Thanks to everyone who's reached out to Cheerful Givers! 
Cheerful Givers	199983	2	/users/profile/229461	Leah R	Volunteer	5	05/09/2014	I've enjoyed every minute on the board. Always moving forward and looking for new opportunities and partnerships to spread the message. I've really come to realize that the gift of self-esteem is priceless. Who can deny giving birthday gifts to parents and children in need? 
Cheerful Givers	173318	2	/users/profile/229461	Leah R	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	There are so many reasons to love Cheerful Givers. A birthday gift is simply a vehicle to increase self-esteem in kids AND parents. It's a little boost that makes a big difference in lives. 
Cheerful Givers	241642	2	/users/profile/152198	GailW	Volunteer	5	04/24/2015	Cheerful Givers is a wonderful organization focused on building children's self esteem and strengthening families.  Everyone wants and has a right to feel special!  
Cheerful Givers	111794	2	/users/profile/152198	GailW	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	Even as an adult, I still enjoy my special day!  So, when I read about Cheerful Givers and considered the children who may not feel "special" on their special day, I felt like I had to get involved.  Over the past year and a half I have become involved personally as well as assisting my company in their involvement.  Everyone has a great time filling birthday bags and the more we fill, the more we want to fill!
Cheerful Givers	241627	4	/users/profile/56311	Nirmala I.	Volunteer	5	04/23/2015	I discovered Cheerful Givers in 2009 and there has been no looking back for me since then. I remember as a child in India, from the age of 1 till I was 14, my mother always celebrated my birthday every year by organizing a birthday party, inviting family members and close friends from around the neighborhood, playing games and having fun. I still recollect the joy on my face when I received birthday presents from my friends and family.  In India, I never heard of such an organization like Cheerful Givers since it is is unique and special for kids who don't get to celebrate their birthdays. Cheerful Givers helps parents living in poverty give their child a gift on their birthday and bringing a smile on their innocent little faces. I believe in the cause of Cheerful Givers by lending my support in whatever manner possible and proud to be their Volunteer Manager for almost 6 years. Thank you Cheerful Givers ! You are definitely the BEST!  There are so many virtual opportunities so please get involved with them today, and you will be so glad that you did!
Cheerful Givers	54654	1	/users/profile/56311	Nirmala I.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2010	 first discovered Cheerful Givers 11 months ago on Volunteer Match.  Almost instantly, I was drawn to the unique mission of Cheerful Givers. I jumped on the opportunity to blend technology with altruism to be able to touch the lives of thousands of people. Helping people, even if I may not get to meet them, gives me the mental satisfaction of knowing that I am making a difference in their life, even if in a small way, while working from my home.Since Nov 2009 I have been volunteering in the role of a virtual Volunteer Manager. I was very happy to find something to my satisfaction. The best part was I could work from home where a computer and internet connection were the only requirements. I am mentally happy since I started volunteering with Cheerful Givers because I interact with several volunteers daily & it keeps me occupied since I am a home-maker. So this was a perfect opportunity for me to help Cheerful Givers in a virtual role. The best part of this organization is, even though it is located in Minnesota, anybody can volunteer from any part of the country by being a part of Cheerful Givers. This is a great organization to volunteer with and am sure you will enjoy helping Cheerful Givers just for a day.
Cheerful Givers	241396	3	/users/profile/221039	Esperanza G.	Volunteer	5	04/20/2015	Cheerful Givers is one of the best charities for children and families. As a parent we all know that our children love to get special birthday presents. Yet for many Americans just barely making ends meet, it is sometimes just a plain old luxury to have a gift for your child on their birthday. With this a reality for so many families today, Cheerful Givers is an excellent alternative for a needy child and family. More people should get involved with this awesome charity, they are definitely angels!  Not only do they bring smiles to children but parents as well. They help to draw American families back to wholesomeness and pure love! I really enjoy attending to my volunteer duties with Cheerful Givers, they have made a difference in so many lives including my own! Thank you Cheerful Givers you guys are definitely the BEST! Volunteer opportunities consist of virtual volunteers and so much more! Get involved with them today, you will be so happy that you did! 
Cheerful Givers	199885	1	/users/profile/221039	Esperanza G.	Volunteer	5	05/08/2014	Cheerful Givers is one of the most down to earth charities that I have ever volunteered with. The staff are over and above nice and they are always available to chat or give advice for future promotions. Cheerful Givers is the best place to volunteer for, no matter what the others tell you, they obviously can not compete with Cheerful Givers. Why? Because Cheerful Givers is for children right here in America that are struggling to have a happy birthday. Children that may be living in a domestic violence shelter or children that may be dependent upon a food bank to eat every month. These kids need us more than anything and by giving just a small amount of time weekly or monthly you can help children in poverty have a chance at having a real birthday present on their birthday. Not only that but you can even have your very own birthday blitz and pick out the items that you are interested in donating to children. You can get your place of business involved and each person can do something to help. This is what Cheerful Givers is all about, the Kids! I am so glad that I found them!
Cheerful Givers	166399	1	/users/profile/221039	Esperanza G.

We can help children at the same time giving us a chance to have fun! Cheerful Givers opens the opportunities for our family to personally give our time and become responsible individuals. My children love to help raise money for a birthday blitz as well as have the party and give from their hearts! There is so much that Cheerful Givers makes possible, and we are so thankful for this absolutely awesome charity!!!

They are truly touching the lives of children in need, whose families aren't able to give them gifts on their birthdays. I love that Cheerful Givers supports these families by helping parents give their children happy memories on their special day. This small act of giving means so much to children living in shelters, and it can make such a positive influence on their self-esteem. I'm so happy that I found Cheerful Givers, a nonprofit with an humble mission that touches lives every day.

I remain inspired and humbled by the work they do to enable parents living in poverty to give their children birthday gifts. I have assembled bags with my own children and, through that experience, been able to teach them  about the power of giving. The number of children served grows each year, as does their need for volunteers, donations, and support. I'm proud to continue my support of Cheerful Givers and invite you to do the same.

Cheerful Givers	199866	1	/users/profile/260905	Hands2Help	Volunteer	5	05/07/2014	Paula G. I have volunteered for Cheerful Givers for 2 years, and have the greatest respect for what they do. The mission of this wonderful organization is elegantly simple and enormously influential. Giving children whose families are facing hardship birthday gifts to bring smiles to those faces is an act of love, community, and far-reaching compassion. Cheerful Givers does work that matters and, for these children, builds their self-esteem and confidence. The stress of providing presents for their child on their special day is taken off the shoulders of their parents. What Cheerful Givers does for these families has ripple affects that create positive memories for the rest of their lives. Cheerful Givers lets these families know that though they are struggling, that their children are not forgotten on their birthdays. Hats off to them. They are a blessing to many!

I've never volunteered for a non-profit as long as I have with Cheerful Givers. This is a great place to volunteer. They are organized and I love the fact that you get recognized in a newsletter for your hard work.

Through volunteermatch.org, I found cheerfulgivers.org, and by mid April I was a Inkind Donations Research Assistant. It was the video, Your cheerful givers story video, that I watched, and I had a tear fall down my face. It's been 4 months plus, and I wanted to volunteer my hours and time, to a  worthwhile cause. I love giving back, and am proud to see happy faces on kids, who get these beautiful birthday bags, who otherwise would not receive anything for there birthday.  Thankyou to to everybody who works here, and to all of the volunteers, for all of your hard work, time and good efforts.  Look forward to more researching, and hopefully more donors giving what they can.   Thanks Kristi Bright

This is one nonprofit that truly uses the best that volunteers have to offer, and that uses all the resources donated, be they dollars, services, or materials (toys) to directly serve children. 
Cheerful Givers	173327	1	/users/profile/152195	Betty10	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I have volunteered and supported Cheerful Givers for over 10 years.  It is a wonderful organization who provides Birthday gifts to food shelves and homeless shelters, so that parents in need do not have to tell their child that they are not getting a birtday gift.  I grew up poor, and I had many birtdays without presents.  I know what that feels like, and I work to prevent other kids from having similar experiences.  I ask for anyone who can to help me in this cause.
Cheerful Givers	111791	1	/users/profile/152195	Betty10	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	It has been my great pleasure to volunteer at Cheerful Givers events for over 10 years.  As a child who never recieved birthday gifts, I especially appreciate what a difference this organization has makes in thousands of lives of children every year.  I plan on supporting this organization through donations and my volunteer time for years to come! 
Cheerful Givers	173282	1	/users/profile/229420	claudiacuddyer	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	I am so proud to be involved with an organization that truly is "the real deal." They pride themselves in making sure that every possible penny raised goes in those toy and joy filled bags.  When they meet their goals, they raise their expectations.  And because of that, the number of happy birthdays has increased each year.  That is GETTING IT DONE! I love their motivation and true desire to help!
Cheerful Givers	168582	1	/users/profile/223513	Rita Y.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2013	Cheerful Givers is a wonderful organization.  They make it happen!  Cheerful Givers staff and volunteers are personable and professional - they encourage and motivate companies and individuals to get involved:  pack birthday bags, do a drive to gather crayons or books, provide a space for a packing event, deliver bags to food shelves - and more!   I have been present when a child has opened their birthday gift bag  - it is wonderful.  The child's smile is eclipsed only by the parents', as they are grateful they have a lovely, cheery, fun gift for their child this birthday.
Cheerful Givers	166825		/users/profile/221635	rcpmom	Donor	5	09/03/2013	Cheerful Givers is a heart-warming non-profit that makes such a tremendous difference to the lives of children.  I can't think of any other group that can impact so many kids, and make it so easy to do so!  The concept is simple - put together ten $1 items in a birthday bag and bring to a food shelf for a parent to bring home for their child.  Brilliant!  I have donated to Cheerful Givers for years.   One year my kids elected to have all their birthday gifts from their parties be designated to Cheerful Givers and we filled the birthday bags at their party.  I have also included my colleagues in the efforts and coordinated birthday bag filling events at the office.  Bags are filled with bubbles, markers, coloring books, candy, yo-yo's, stuffed animals etc. and everyone has fun contributing!  Although ultimately the recipients are the kids, I can tell you the personal reward of supporting this organization feels amazing.  
Cheerful Givers	166432		/users/profile/221079	Caz510	Volunteer	5	08/28/2013	I had been looking for a volunteer opportunity that I could do from home, so I researched virtual opportunities involving research on VolunteerMatch.org and found Cheerful Givers. I was touched by Cheerful Giver's purpose of giving each child an opportunity to celebrate their special day under circumstances where their family couldn't. My husband and I have always helped out with our church's food pantry but I had never really thought of helping to provide for needs beyond the basics of food and shelter. As an Inkind Donations Assistant I try to find websites of potential donors of items for the birthday bags.  I'm very happy to have found an opportunity where I can combine my interest in research, volunteer from home (so I can spend more time with my newly-retired husband) and help bring a smile to these children on their birthday!
Cheerful Givers	241890	3	/users/profile/328583	CheerfulMom,	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2015	Cheerful Givers not only makes a difference for those who are the recipients of the "Birthday Bags",  but also those individuals and groups that give of their time and energy in putting together these special bags.  I havebeen impressed with how Cheerful Givers has invited individuals with special-needs to participate in fillingthe Birthday Bags (usually as part of their school program and/or job training).  For many of these individuals, filling the Birthday Bags is their first success in learning important job skills - and life skills as well.  I have watched my young adult son, who has Autism, develop self-confidence and self-determination by taking on the responsibility of organizing and filling the Birthday Bags.  He absolutely loves Cheerful Givers and is so proud of being a part of helping others.  With great enthusiasm my son will say to me "Cheerful Givers is Jordan's job!"   His involvement in Cheerful Givers has given him a real sense of accomplishment and has provided important job skills.  Cheerful Givers touches the lives of both those who receive and those who participate as the Giver.  As my son likes to say, "I love Cheerful Givers!"  And his mom does too...!
Cheerful Givers	113222		/users/profile/38927	nimmi	Volunteer	5	05/29/2012	I have been volunteering with Cheerful Givers since Nov 2009 and after 2 years still continuing as a volunteer manager. I am happy to say that I am glad I found by chance on Volunteer Match and expressed interest. I joined Cheerful Givers at a time when I didn't know what I was doing in my life. Volunteering with Cheerful Givers changed my life and keeps me mentally happy and I feel good that I am helping for a cause. Flexible hours and in a virtual role kept my mind busy and I feel satisfied that I am useful to somebody in need.
Cheerful Givers	38086	11	/users/profile/38927	nimmi	Volunteer	5	05/05/2010	Cheerful Givers has made my life presently. Karen Kitchel, President of Cheerful Givers never fails to thank each and every volunteer that helps Cheerful Givers. She has been a joy to work with through the interaction of emails. Every week, I dedicate around 10 hours of my time to volunteer for Cheerful Givers in the role of a Virtual Volunteer Manager. My role includes a variety of tasks and exchanging several emails  with Karen as well as volunteers. I also gather, maintain, and update information on our volunteers. The information I collect makes its way into the monthly newsletter and annual report. I have volunteered in many organizations over the past 15 months. But my volunteer work at Cheerful Givers is the best so far I have felt and the most fun I have had giving back to the community!  Helping people, even if I may not get to meet them, gives me the mental satisfaction of knowing that I am making a difference in their life, even if in a small way, while working from my home. The best part of Cheerful Givers is that one can volunteer from any part of the country.
Cheerful Givers	112533		/users/profile/153170	LeahR	Volunteer	5	05/21/2012	Wow, Cheerful GIvers has grown so much since I started volunteering in 2008! The mission is simply to give a happy birthday to as many less fortunate children as possible. Simple, yet SO important. Looking forward the future of CG!
Cheerful Givers	112510	1	/users/profile/153141	RobinMSteee	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	I am the Founder and Chairman of the Board for Cheerful Givers. I started Cheerful Givers because I believed we could make a difference in the lives of less fortunate children and their families. When I created this organization, I never dreamed that we would help more than 500,000 children, that we would have so many volunteers and contributors, and that we would provide as much happiness to the givers as we were providing to the receivers.  Cheerful Givers has taught me how to be a better person, how to give anonymously and unconditionally, and that one persons idea can make a difference in the lives of everyone involved.  Thank you to all the cheerful givers and cheerful receivers!!
Cheerful Givers	112093	1	/users/profile/152523	claudiac	Board Member	5	05/15/2012	I began working with Cheerful Givers when my son was about to turn one.  I couldn't imagine him not receiving even one special gift. As a matter of fact, I knew he would be showered with toys, clothes, books and other presents. It really spoke to my heart that there were people out there committed to spreading birthday joy to children whose parents have fallen on hard times.  It's not that they didn't WANT to provide for their child, they just couldn't.  Cheerful Givers is an amazing organization that works tirelessly EVERY day to assemble birthday gifts so that parents can ALSO experience the joy of GIVING a gift to their child. What an amazing ability!!!
Cheerful Givers	111820	1	/users/profile/152222	Tiana R.	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	Being involved in Cheerful Givers has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had.  It is such a worthy cause and the impact is so direct.  I look forward to continue working closely with them in the future.
Cheerful Givers	111759	1	/users/profile/152168	Vonnie S.	Volunteer	5	05/10/2012	Cheerful Givers is an organization that is one of my favorite charitable givers.  My school age child care group connected with Cheerful Givers through a service learning project 6 years ago.  Since then I have chosen to celebrate my birthday with a Birthday Blitz, creating bags for others to celebrate their birthdays.  Nothing brightens my day than seeing the happy faced logo of Cheerful Givers!
Cheerful Givers	111756	1	/users/profile/152164	Mamawo	Donor	5	05/10/2012	It is a great organization that provides birthday bags to low income families with young children so they have a gift for their birthday.  All children should have a special birthday and Cheerful Givers sees that they do.
Cheerful Givers	111745	1	/users/profile/152145	Michelle66	Donor	5	05/10/2012	The Cheerful Givers mission is so simple, yet so powerful -- to provide a child with a birthday gift on their one special day, to make that child feel special and valued no matter their current circumstances. And I love that it allows parents the dignity to choose a gift they can feel proud to give. When I tell people about Cheerful Givers, they get it. It inspires people to get involved. I'll continue to donate, volunteer as I can, and share their mission and story whenever I can.

Donor	5	03/08/2012	I have been working with Karen for a few years now, donating my goods/services for children's gift bags and gifts for their volunteers. They are a wonderful group of people making a difference in children's lives, and so happy to be apart of helping them when I can.  Recognizing children's birthdays when they would otherwise go unnoticed can make such a difference in a child's life. Keep up the good work Cheerful Givers..our children out there need you!
Cheerful Givers	81422		/users/profile/89126	Diana M.	Volunteer	5	03/08/2011	I've been working with Karen & Cheerful givers for a few years now. Althoughmy time is limited with what I can do, i normally donate goods for some bday bags and donate gifts to recognize their volunteers. This is such a wonderful, caring, hardworking organization that I am proud to help out. Many children these days do not have it easy and cheerful givers is often the bright spot in their lives.

I keep track of the mailing list for Cheerful Givers and I can tell you that people from all over the country support this organization in big and small ways through hours of volunteer work, financial contributions and in-kind donations. I feel great about being a part of this organization.

Cheerful Givers	81644	1	/users/profile/66447	Cynthia B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/09/2011	Cheerful Givers is a charity that everyone needs to support. President Karen Kitchel manages the organization with vision, compassion, and energetic involvement. For many years, the charity I founded, Be the Star You Are! has donated books to the birthday bags. When we see the delight on the children's faces when they receive their gifts, we only wish we could help out with much more.  Cheerful Giver's deserves to be recognized for the support and empowerment they give to the moms, caregivers, and of course, the children.

I have been consistently impressed by the leaders' responsiveness, resourcefulness, dedication, and innovation.  I have no doubt this organization brings smiles and lasting memories to parents and their children at a time when they need them most.
Cheerful Givers	38504	9	/users/profile/39383	diana5	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	I started working with Cheerful givers after i read about them in people magazine.

Im always happy to help them in any way I can.
Cheerful Givers	38491	7	/users/profile/39377	srlukes	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	I began volunteering my time with Cheerful Givers in October of 2009, and continued to work with the charity until the the annual Birthday Party took place in March of 2010. As a recent college graduate, it was a joy to be able to volunteer for a organization with a great mission as well as connect with new people and a new community. I plan on continuing to volunteer with Cheerful Givers well into the future.

Cheerful Givers	38333	10	/users/profile/39218	jck332	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	I've been volunteering with Cheerful Givers for a few years now, and it's been one of the funnest and most rewarding experiences I've had.Their mission is unique, and it's something that drew me to them in the first place. I always loved my birthday, so why not try and help other people love theirs as well?Creating birthday bags for underprivileged children has been an experience that has been both fun and unifying. It's helped (and continues to) bring people together for a fun time, all while doing something great for the community.A lot of organizations' focus revolves around Christmas and making sure children have present on that one day of the year. And while that's terrific, children also have birthdays everyday, and it's something that is overlooked by many charity organizations. But for children, it's that one day of the year that's all about them; it's their day. And Cheerful Givers strives to make their day a special one, to bring a smile to every child on his or her birthday.

Some people may over look our organization because of its size, but Cheerful Givers is changing lives and helping children understand that they ARE special and loved! What I am most amazed at with CG is the determination of our president, Karen Kitchel, and the rest of the staff which is 99% volunteers!

I have donated to raise money for presents in these birthday bags.  I have collected books from the Volunteers of America and transported them to the school for the disabled.  This school assembles birthday bags as a means of teching the disabled what it is like to do assembly work.  I have spoken before companies who migh want to sponsor a projct of birthday bag assembley.  I believe in this project, and I have chosen it as my primary charity becuse of all the good work that I have observed.

The food shelf is set up to try to meet special requests the families may have.  Very recently, a young mother indicated that in two days she was celebrating her little daughter's birthday and wished she had something to give.  It was because of Cheerful Givers, I was able to let her know that a birthday bag was indeed available.  She was so filled with joy!  She left the food shelf grinning from ear to ear.  I am grateful I was able to be a part of her joy - thank you Cheerful Givers!C. Hahn
Cheerful Givers	37993	7	/users/profile/38788	diane10	Volunteer	5	05/05/2010	Each Month the Seniors look forward to seeing what toys we have.  There is a lot of conversation about the toys, and the joy they will bring to children within their community.  I feel this activity benefits the Seniors nearly as much as the children who receive the gifts.  It's rewarding to see the looks of happiness and witness the feelings accomplishment these residents display when the last ribbon is tied and the last bag is placed in the box for the children.

Cheerful Givers	37945	9	/users/profile/38723	lchristine	Volunteer	5	05/04/2010	Ive recently become involved with an organization that makes me smile!  Cheerful Givers!  They provide toy-filled birthday gift bags to shelters and food shelves so that parents living in poverty can give their child a birthday gift. The idea is that this simple gesture boosts self-esteem, enhances self-worth, and strengthens bonds in families. Volunteering is something we do in addition to our busy work and family livesits something that should be fun and make you feel good! The activities we do and the people I have met through Cheerful Givers does just thatI leave meeting and events smiling! Karen Kitchel has been a joy to work with. I co-chaired this year's Great Minnesota Birthday Party with Ali, what a fun and amazing event! We had a great turnout. We coordinated the entertainment and activities including a cheer-off, coloring contest, musicians, celebrities  AND, we raised money and received donations to give birthday gifts to children!  I have volunteered in many organizations over the years. My volunteer work at Cheerful Givers is the most welcome Ive felt with a new group and the most fun Ive had giving back to the community! Im looking forward to our next event, next meeting, and an opportunity to meet more of the volunteers!
Cheerful Givers	37943	7	/users/profile/38720	pogo78	Volunteer	4	05/04/2010	In 2008 I was new to my company and was looking for ways to connect with other employees.  The e-mail I received to join the Cheerful Givers was the perfect opportunity to allow me to give back to the community and meet others at my new company.  My first event was stationed in the lobby of our corporate headquarters. The tables were loaded with small gifts that were then assembled to provide birthday bags to kids that wouldn't otherwise receive them. The volunteers were happy and excited to pull the items together and we all shared stories over the bags as we circulated through the stacks of toys.  Once we gathered the bags together and counted them -- we had almost 100 bags!  For less than a half hours work we had provided 100 kids with a smile on their birthday.  The books, toys and other items were simple and will bring lots of joy to these kids on their special day.  What a simple way to give back to the community....thanks to all the volunteers who organize these efforts!

The FPIES Foundation	256849	2	/users/profile/345248	cla81	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2015	My second child was a sweetheart from birth, but I knew something was wrong.  She always screamed out in pain and rarely slept.  At 6 months she had a few "episodes" that were dismissed by doctors, family, and friends.  From 6-9 months, she rapidly fell to the 3rd percentile for weight and height (she had previously been 95%th).   When I started googling and finally found a site that described what I had been going through, I cried with relief. I had honestly wondered if I had been over-analyzing, making things up, etc.  To read this factual information, to hear from other parents, and to have people that understood what I was going through made a world of difference to me and helped my child to the treatment she needed to thrive again.   THANK YOU for these resources from the bottom of my heart!

The FPIES Foundation	232484	2	/users/profile/296022	Stephanie177	Volunteer	5	11/01/2014	After giving my grandson a taste of oatmeal at the age of 4 months he went into a severe reaction. Vomiting until he went into shock. At the ER we were told that he had a case of the flu. Fast forward a few weeks, we again tried the oatmel and Stephen had the same reaction.  My daughter knew that this was no ordinary flu that was going on with him. She pour herself into researching his symptoms and came across the FPIES Foundation. When we took him to the hospital we came armed with information about FPIES. The doctors and staff had no clue about FPIES, they did after that visit. Stephen is now 2 1/2 years old and has only a few trigger foods that give him minor reactions. We are so grateful that the FPIES Foundation with all of their valuable resources and termendous support has helped us through this.

With such a rare condition, many families are left to find information on their own as they try to understand how to manage this form of allergy. The FPIES Foundation has brought together a wonderful combination of support from others going through the same struggles, as well as expertise from the medical field to provide insight as the knowledge and information grows on how to diagnose and treat children with FPIES. They have put together so many resources to help families in one central place. This foundation has also been so instrumental in furthering research on FPIES and spreading awareness to the medical field and the general public. The sooner a child can be diagnosed, the sooner their families can start on the path to healing and finding safe food choices. We are so thankful for the FPIES Foundation and all of their hard work to provide all of the support that they do!

The FPIES Foundation	228308	4	/users/profile/292001	Jaime N.	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	Having a child is challenging enough.  Having a child with FPIES can be overwhelming.  Your infant can't tell you what's wrong and trial and error is excruciating.  I had never even heard of the condition until my friend's son was diagnosed with it.  The diagnosis, as hard as it was, was a silver lining.  Support is critical.  The FPIES foundation has been invaluable to my friend and her entire family.  It provides emotional and intellectual support, and I have seen first hand how it has buoyed my friend's spirit and resolve.  While her family and friends never left her side, the FPIES foundation did for her, her husband and her children what we couldn't, give hope and understanding.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Now even though our new baby also has FPIES, we are able to see her thrive and enjoy her first year because we knew what it was right away and how to deal with it. We are very thankful for the FPIES Foundation getting information out there about this rare condition so people like us can find answers when nobody seems to have any.

The FPIES Foundation	209933	3	/users/profile/272676	Jessie R.	General Member of the Public	5	08/10/2014	I first discovered The FPIES Foundation through a google search of my sons symptoms. He was 2 years old, failing to thrive, and was constantly in the hospital and doctors offices.  He was very sick, and no one could figure out why.  Once I found the Foundations website, and learned about FPIES, I was able to help the doctors find the resources that they needed to learn about FPIES, and help my son.  Our journey with FPIES has been long, but I am so grateful for the Foundation every step of the way.  In April, my son got very ill from a reaction to his only safe food, a formula, and was hospitalized most of the month.  Our doctors were able to connect to The FPIES Foundations Medical Advisory Board, and talk to the front runners in FPIES knowledge and research, so that they would best know how to help my son.  I will forever grateful to The FPIES Foundation. All of their hard work in research, education, support, and outreach literally saved my sons life.  The support system they have created in this world of rare disease is unprecedented, and makes me feel like I am not fighting a losing battle anymore.  The board of directors are amazing, and never stop advocating for FPIES, and helping parents learn how to effectively advocate for their children so that they can receive the help and proper care that they need.   Through their tireless efforts, I feel confident that FPIES will be better understood, and better known in the medical community and beyond, and that other children will be able to receive proper medical care down the road, and not have to go through what my son had to go through to receive his diagnosis. 
The FPIES Foundation	208827	2	/users/profile/271579	BostonDad	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2014	Can't say enough positive things about the FPIES Foundation.  They've got a solid mission and are a great resource for those of us who have a child suffering from FPIES.  Our son was diagnosed as an infant, more than two years ago, and it's been a long journey.  The FPIES Foundation has provided support, education, encouragement and friendship. Also, I have to disagree with the reviewer who said he didn't know where his donations were going.  Whenever there's a fundraiser the foundation makes it very clear to donors in how they plan to use that money... and it's many of the same things he mentioned.  It's not easy running a successful volunteer non-profit organization... the Board of Directors and all the volunteers at the FPIES Foundation do a superb job.
The FPIES Foundation	208819	2	/users/profile/245999	FPIESMommy	Volunteer	5	08/06/2014	Our son was diagnosed with FPIES at 7 months old. We were lost, scared and confused.

The FPIES Foundation	169642	6	/users/profile/224829	KJCAULEY	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2013	I like everything about this foundation.  There are other foundations that tend to have tunnel vision and don't educate the people on the fact that FPIES is very much a spectrum syndrome.  Some of the other organizations tend to focus on their own personal experience with FPIES and don't seem to accept that children may exhibit slightly different symptoms.  I also like how this foundation is like a family support system.  I love that they don't claim to be the FIRST and ONLY foundation because their number one goal is to help spread awareness.  They willingly share all information they have and don't charge outrageous fees to learn from educational seminars they hold.  I feel completely comfortable donating to this organization and I feel that every penny truly helps the cause.  They are a great support system and a wonderful educational organization.
The FPIES Foundation	169225	2	/users/profile/224268	fpiesmom	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	My family first became aware of the FPIES Foundation through our pediatric nutritionist at CHOP. After many years of misdiagnosis we were happy to have a diagnosis, but were completely overwhelmed with questions we had no answers for.  Through the foundation I have learned how to care for my daughter, how to cook for her, how to support her and how to get support for myself. I'm glad to have the opportunity to volunteer for the foundation that helped us through the hard times and even happier to be volunteering with an awesome team of other parents who give so much of their time to help newly diagnosed kids and their families.  FPIES is a complex disease that takes up much of a parents time and money, so it is especially touching that the foundation is completely ran by other parent volunteers who give up some of their free time to extend their hand to another family.
The FPIES Foundation	169216	2	/users/profile/224256	AmandaL	Board Member	5	09/11/2013	Working with The FPIES Foundation has been an incredibly empowering and intense experience--- we hear from families, medical professionals, and members of their communities about the impact our organization and resources have made for them daily. We hear stories from struggling families that make me want to cry alongside them and success stories that make me want to jump for joy with them. Everyday I am reminded why we do the work that we do--- we will always strive to provide that network of caring, providing the support families and medical professionals need to care for the smallest of patients, those children affect by FPIES. Personally and professionally, I have been forever changed by all of these families and professionals that I am so fortunate to be able to serve and by the amazing parents I work with making up this organization.

Doctors kept telling me that nothing was wrong with my son.  I knew something was very wrong.  I was able to find a doctor through the FPIES database who was knowledgeable about FPIES and diagnosed my son at a year old.  As a result he was finally able to get the help that he needed.

Everyday we hear from families in how much this information is helping them thrive.  The Foundation was started by families with families in mind.  We are working to ensure that all parents of children living with FPIES can spend their time caring for their child, instead of struggling for information, diagnosis, resources and support. No family should journey alone
The FPIES Foundation	168860	1	/users/profile/223831	Erica32	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	I was referred to the FPIES Foundation nearly one year ago.  Both of my children have FPIES ...not just the acute vomit to shock symptoms, but the more "gray area" reactions.  Severe intolerance to just about every food protein.  We have been fighting this battle alone for 5 years.  Eighteen medical specialists, nutritionists, pediatricians, lactation consultants, etc. have all been stumped by the day to day struggle we endure as a family finding safe ways to nourish our children.   Even giving our infants  a bath was enough to trigger a reaction.  With no understanding and no help, it has been a very isolating road.Being referred to the FPIES Foundation was a lifesaver for our children.  Reading other parent's stories and relating to their journey ...for the first time ever I was not alone!  Having the "toolbox" of letters to schools, physicians, medical articles, and guides to day to day survival of FPIES has made a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.  We have finally connected with a medical team to help us navigate this crazy journey of life with older FPIES children.   We also have joined the foundation to organize FAMILY MEETUPS ... our journey with FPIES  can be so isolating ...it is wonderful to connect with others who truly "get it".   The FPIES Foundation is providing much needed information and awareness of this rare disorder.   Knowledge is power, and with the FPIES FOUNDATION ...AWARENESS IS ACTION!

The FPIES Foundation	167894		/users/profile/222779	CPADad	General Member of the Public	3	09/06/2013	Helpful, but.... The FPIES Foundation has some helpful information that got us started after my daughter was diagnosed with FPIES last year. It really helped my wife to read all the stories of other families struggling with this. They ask for contributions in a lot of different ways and sell merchandise -- I just want to know specifically what it funds other than overhead. They had a big fundraiser last week but never said how much they raised or what particular projects its going to. The other FPIES organization is funding research, conferences, materials that go to all doctors, getting the medical code passed, etc. I hesitated to write this review because I want to put my full support behind this group, but I think people should know exactly how their donations are spent.
The FPIES Foundation	167885	1	/users/profile/222764	Jan_33	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2013	We have a grand son with FPIES.  This organization has been a blessing to him, Chase, and his family.  FPIES is difficult to diagnose and many doctors have not even heard of this health issue.  It is severe reaction to almost all foods and there is no way to find out which food will set off a reaction except to try the food and see.  This makes life so difficult on both the child and his/her family.  The FPIES foundation provides information, support, and inspirational stories which all help the family.  Please support this important foundation!

The FPIES Foundation	165489	1	/users/profile/219966	NEMomma	General Member of the Public	5	08/20/2013	The FPIES Foundation was the best place for me to find information that helped us get our son diagnosed with FPIES.  Our first doctor never even heard of it, but after reading parent testimonials we knew what questions to start asking.  They also helped guide us through the management of our sons disease while we were waiting for the official word from the doctors.  We would have been lost a year ago without the FPIES Foundation.  Thank you!
The FPIES Foundation	158329	2	/users/profile/210055	offload_thebabygear	Volunteer	5	05/20/2013	The FPIES Foundation is a fantastic organization.  They aim to arm families with unbiased information so as to empower the parents to find the path that best helps their child.  FPIES families volunteer their time to run the foundation. And a panel of well respected physicians lend their expertise to ensure information gleaned from the site is based on sound medical ideas.    I feel it is also important to note that the FPIES foundation runs solely on fundraisers and donations;  they are not sponsored by any corporate entity.  Such sponsorship would easily allow information to be skewed and send business the way of said company rather than give the best information,  regardless of it helping/not helping a corporation.   Their goal is to help FPIES families navigate the winding road with this disease and I believe they are doing just that. 
Can Do Canines	187080	1	/users/profile/244080	May419,	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	My sister received her hearing assistance dog Autumn last year and it has changed her life.   Autumn lets her know when someone is at the door, when the timer on the oven goes off, and can alert her during the night when her hearing aides are out that the smoke alarm is going off.  Autumn has greatly reduced the worries our parents and I had about her living on her own.  We were always afraid that there would be a fire and she would just sleep through it.  Can Do Canines is amazing and really helps so many people have  wonderful independent lives!  
Can Do Canines	283575		/users/profile/373578	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/24/2016	I've volunteered for Can Do Canines over several years. The mission is extraordinary and staff and volunteers are excellent. I've seen other assistance animal training organizations who do not use the same sensible and cost-effective methods of sourcing and training dogs. I respect their methodology and keen attention to high quality outcomes for both the client and the dog.
Can Do Canines	282807	2	/users/profile/372974	Dee_32	Donor	5	03/18/2016	I am greatly inspired by Can Do Canines and support them whenever possible. Their mission is a simple one - to help those with challenges/disabilities by providing them with an assistance dog - but it's very effective and life-changing. I am always gratified when I read their newsletter "The Howler", and see the difference they are making with people that might be your neighbor. I know when I give, I'm giving to a greater cause; that they are doing excellent work, and that the recipients of these beautiful dogs are breathing a little easier because Can Do Canines exists; there's nothing better really, is there?
Can Do Canines	282712		/users/profile/372875	Writer	Donor	5	03/17/2016	i became a fan of Can Do Canines through my son and his wife from down in the Cities. What a wonderful organization that truly changes lives of not only the courageous recipients but also the precious loving animals.  Keep up the great work!  Mary F.  Northern Mn
Can Do Canines	282591	1	/users/profile/372747	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/17/2016	My daughter and I attended on of the Sat. introduction sessions and you introduced a few of the current recipients with their new assistant dogs and it brought tears to my eyes.   We were going to become volunteers but my daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer so we have to put those plans on hold for the time being.   I think Can Do Canines is a wonderful joyful experience and the volunteers are so giving and caring.  
Can Do Canines	282585	1	/users/profile/372741	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/16/2016	I have volunteered for Can Do Canines for the past few years.  I am so impressed with the staff dedication and expertise in training these dogs and matching them with people, free of charge, who can benefit so greatly from them.  Kudos to my favorite charity!!!
Can Do Canines	282557		/users/profile/372718	Writer	Donor	5	03/16/2016	I have contributed to this wonderful organization for many years.   It has a dual purpose in helping people achieve independence as well as helping dogs acquire the training they need and find good homes.   I feel my donations are well spent on the people and the animals in need and Can Do Canines does such a great job at keeping their administrative costs to a minimum.  BRAVO
Can Do Canines	282503		/users/profile/372663	Writer	Volunteer	4	03/16/2016	Can Do Canines Assistance Dogs is one of the premier assistance dog organizations I have ever encountered.  As a nonprofit, they have excelled in training and placing assistance dogs for a variety of needs to clients whose lives are forever changed by having an assistance dog that offers them independence that would have never been possible,  even training to assist clients with more than one disability.  They are always accessible for assistance to their clients' needs.  Over the years, CDCAD has responsibly and slowly moved forward to achieve a training center that is state of the art to expand the number of clients receiving assistance dogs and a welcoming beacon of hope to everyone who comes through their door.  I was especially drawn to CDCAD with their program of rescuing potential service dogs from animal control and humane shelters whose owners had seen no value in, allowing them to become loved and priceless to the clients they are placed with.  
Can Do Canines	282498		/users/profile/372657	Kyle33	Volunteer	5	03/16/2016	Two points:1) Volunteering with Can Do Canines is like Chicken Soup for the Soul....I have volunteered with Can Do Canines over the past year as a puppy raiser, long term foster and short term foster. People always say, "Giving back the dog would break my heart - how do you do it?!"No doubt, it is hard. Tears are shed. Home doesn't feel like home. Things are suddenly quiet....But the sad tears are far outnumbered by the tears of joy and pride. Seeing your former family member profoundly change a life is like no other feeling. Opening your home and pouring your heart, sweat and tears into a puppy - to better the life of someone you've never met - is the gold standard of selflessness.  2) Can Do Canines is a fantastic organization for young people to get involved with and make a significant impact!As a younger person, volunteering with Can Do Canines has far exceeded my wildest expectations. I have never felt like a cog in the wheel - but a meaningful player in an important game. Additionally, my discretionary spending is not great enough to make a financial impact, so using my time to directly change lives is quite an amazing feeling. Over the past year of volunteering with Can Do Canines, I have nothing but fantastic things to say about the organization, their mission, the facilities, the staff and other volunteers. 
Can Do Canines	282492	1	/users/profile/372649	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/16/2016	I have been a supporter of Can Do Canine for years.  their work with dogs and clients alike is exemplary.  I feel that my money goes towards training and placement of fabulous dogs who can change people's lives. My husband and I like them so much they are in our will!Pat and Paul in Bloomington MN
Can Do Canines	282487		/users/profile/372644	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/16/2016	I begin volunteering with Can Do Canines over two years ago and in that time I learned so much about what a great organization they truly are. The staff and volunteers are dedicated to their cause and this is shown as they continue to grow and are able to provide more and more assistance dogs to those in need. I can't say enough about how much Can Do Canines is able to change people's lives and provide them with a new way to live their lives and a new best friend. Thank you, Can Do Canines, for everything you do!!
Can Do Canines	187080	1	/users/profile/244080	May419,	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	My sister received her hearing assistance dog Autumn last year and it has changed her life.   Autumn lets her know when someone is at the door, when the timer on the oven goes off, and can alert her during the night when her hearing aides are out that the smoke alarm is going off.  Autumn has greatly reduced the worries our parents and I had about her living on her own.  We were always afraid that there would be a fire and she would just sleep through it.  Can Do Canines is amazing and really helps so many people have  wonderful independent lives!  
Can Do Canines	282481		/users/profile/372638	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/16/2016	This is the most amazing program. Not only do they provide life changing dogs to those in need of assistance, they use the prison system to help in training. My son unfortunately met the wrong person when he was 18 and landed himself in prison. This program was a life changer for him and many others in the system. 
Can Do Canines	282465		/users/profile/372620	Writer	Client Served	5	03/15/2016	Where do I even start with this amazing nonprofit that completely changed my daughter's day-to-day living? Can Do Canines literally GAVE Samantha's life back to her.There are so many amazing ways they've done this. Samantha's mobility assist service dog, Obie, is by her side every minute of every day. He picks things up off of the floor so that she doesn't have to bend down, risking a severe and immediate drop in her blood pressure which causes her to pass out without warning. Before Obie, she knocked out her front teeth and has sustained several concussions. He helps her up or down the stairs, braces himself to assist her when she needs to get up from sitting on the floor, opens doors (he's a real gentleman), brings things to her from another family member, brings her credit card up to the counter to pay a bill, and even delivers laundry downstairs to the laundry room. Now if we could just train him to fold it and put it away. ;0)Obie can go get help if Samantha needs him to.  He can retrieve her phone if asked. He also carries her medical information in his vest pocket in case of an emergency.  As a parent, those are three of the most comforting things I could've ever hoped for. I used to worry about her non-stop, to the point that I couldn't focus on anything else. Now I know that Obie has her back, whether that's at college (which she's been able to go back to) or at the grocery store-wherever. They've become an inseparable team!Can Do Canines not only provided Obie free of charge, but also food and supplies to get started, amazing trainers so that the two of them learned how to work together, lots of client education, and a lifetime of support. If Samantha needs Obie to do a task that he wasn't originally trained for, she can contact Can Do at anytime and they with assist her with training him to perform the new skill. Last, but far from least, Obie has vastly improved Samantha's emotional health. She feels safe again, able to trust (and even push) her body a bit more knowing that Obie will be there to help when needed. This has resulted in fewer doctor visits and days spent in bed not feeling well.  He even motivated her to be active again and go for a walk or to the dog park because she knows he enjoys them so much.  She wants to take care of him as well as he takes care of her. Thank you Can Do Canines for not only changing my daughter's life, but ours as well. You've FAR exceeded any expectations we could've even imagined.  I would have never dreamed that a four-legged angel could enter our lives and make such an incredible difference.  May you always have the funding to bless others' lives as you've blessed ours!  
Can Do Canines	282455		/users/profile/372612	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/15/2016	I didn't know Can Do Canines existed until 3 years ago when a friend of mine took me to their luncheon.  It was there that I listened to and met a man who hot an assistance dog and his live had improved so much.  Then I learned that no one pays for their assistance dog.........that is amazing.  That day I also met many pups who were on the road to being assistance dogs and heard the remarkable tale of the training it takes to get a pup ready for someone in need.  I don't at this time live near enough to Can Do Canines to be of any help, but if I did I would certainly volunteer there.  It is a most deserving organization.
Can Do Canines	282443		/users/profile/372598	Tiffany62	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	I have been a volunteer on multiple capacities for this organization and I can't say enough positive things about this organization! The people involved from the top down passionately care about getting these life changing and life saving service dogs into the hands of those who desperately need them free of charge. It takes a village to do great things and Can Do Canines has one of the most compassionate, generous, and caring village I have ever been a part of.
Can Do Canines	282441		/users/profile/372596	Writer	Client Served	5	03/15/2016	As a child, we have dreams that cannot conceive boundaries. As an adult, we often find that those very dreams are not the reality that we may live. Try as we may, life has its own plan for each of us; moments that can define who we may become. At the time, I was in my early thirties, boundaries began to shape my life. Limitations that had become a daily struggle that ultimately became the diagnosis of Parkinsons disease. Those boundaries that I could not even conceive as a child had, indeed, become my reality.A defining moment occurred when I learned about Can Do Canines.  I had not even thought of the possibility of a mobility assistance dog, let alone how a four-legged angel could, and would, change my life.  The list of skills that Justeen does daily for me has given me the gift of reengaging in life. The challenges are still there, and always will be, but Justeen makes accomplishing the everyday tasks possible and with less pain. She opens drawers and doors, picks up and retrieves all of the items that my rigid hands drop constantly, carries bags in and out of stores for me, empties my grocery bags, and tugs my laundry basket to where I need it to be. She has given me peace of mind by being able to get the emergency phone when I have needed it. Justeen has become my ambassador in stores; just having her at my side verifies that I do need extra assistance and I no longer have to search for help. This angel has truly given me my life back,  simplified my life with her extensive skills, and returned my independence. Justeen has also given my husband peace of mind for when he is not at my side.   This sweet, kind, gentle angel has literally become my life-line, partner, and ambassador.Without an extremely dedicated staff and volunteers none of this could be possible.  There are now over 500 partnerships that Can Do Canines has willingly and freely given.  I am grateful that I was one of those "furever " teams.   
Can Do Canines	282428		/users/profile/372585	Writer	Client Served	5	03/15/2016	Losing  Sandy, my first hearing dog of ten years, was not only heartbreaking, but with her went many  normal securities of life that many take for granted. Knowing when the alarm clock is going off, when the phone is ringing, or someone is at the door....knowing when the oven timer is beeping, the teapot is boiling, or if my husband needs me in another room....and being alert to the fire alarm or carbon monoxide alarms blaring, or an intruder are all things I miss. I'm severely hearing impaired, about 80% deaf. Without my hearing aids I can't hear a dog bark.It took about two years of missing these things before I was ready to give my heart to another "Sandy". My second hearing dog was a gift. An American Eskimo, which I began training when she was 14 weeks old. I am so very thankful that CanDoCanine accepted her to complete her training and be certified through their nonprofit organization. CanDoCanine provided my first hearing dog, so I was fully confident that they would send me off with the needed security and the  best obedience for public access.If you are interested, our story along with a photo is in the fall of 2015 newsletter on CanDoCanine's website. My new hearing dog's name is Shiya. It means "Snow at Dawn". Her white fluffy body gently lays across my chest (with an added lick or two) as she awakes me each morning when she hears the alarm clock. She loves working. I've caught her sitting on the end of my bed just waiting for the alarm to go off! Through the support of individuals and organizations, CanDoCanine has provided the restored confidence and peace of mind to live daily life at home or elsewhere. Shiya and I are a team now....just like Sandy and I were for all those years. Thank you CanDoCanine, and Dora our trainer. What a blessing these dogs have been.
Can Do Canines	282425		/users/profile/372582	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/15/2016	We have been volunteers for Can-Do-Canines for over 15 years.  We have seen so many cute puppies grow up to be assistance dogs and new members to countless families that have a special need. They are not just pets, they become lifelines for those that need help. We admire Can-Do-Canines, for all they do to help so many people (children and adults). We will continue to support this great organization and hope others will too.
Can Do Canines	282422		/users/profile/372579	Writer	Client Served	5	03/15/2016	They are the best!!!  I can't imagine my life without my service dog.  
Can Do Canines	241469		/users/profile/328023	MamaP	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2015	I became familiar with Can Do Canines about three years ago. I have personally witnessed the benefits that a service dog from this organization has provided for two individuals that I know, a man with a degenerative disease and a woman with cerebral palsy.The amazing dogs so professionally trained by Can Do Canines have increased independence in their knew owners and have also provided companionship which is priceless. The thoroughness of the training for the dog as well as for the client (new owner) is remarkable. I see the woman with cerebral palsy on a regular basis and have been impressed by the change in self confidence and independence and love that has grown since she has had the opportunity to have a service dog from Can Do Canines . 
Can Do Canines	240604		/users/profile/326828	Val.T	Volunteer	5	04/06/2015	My family has been a Can Do Canines volunteer since 2010 and over the years, we have had the pleasure of sharing our home with 16 puppies.  We have done both short and long term fostering as well as puppy raising two of them.  One of the puppies was donated from a breeder the other one came from a shelter, but all of them have a special place in our hearts.  The staff is always professional, supportive, patient and very knowledgeable.  It is apparent that this is so much more than a job for them.  The health and safety of the dogs is a top priority at Can Do Canines, however, they are just as concerned about the people they place the dogs with.  It's a bond like no other so it's important that it's a perfect match.  We are so proud to be a part of this amazing organization and would highly recommend it to volunteers and prospective recipients alike.  Three cheers (and barks) for Can Do Canines!

Can Do Canines	240595	1	/users/profile/326815	Kelly168	Volunteer	5	04/06/2015	Can Do Canines has opened a whole new world for our family.  Raising two teenagers can be challenging but when our two mentioned interest in having another dog, we encouraged them to check out what we would need to be volunteers and raise a puppy for someone else.  Can Do Canines answered our call.  Our kids have been 100% involved in raising puppies and are eager to share with others about the impact these puppies have on individuals who haven't been as fortunate as we have been.  They truly have become more selfless, compassionate young adults.  They go to classes, outings and even run errands because the pups need to be socialized.  WE ALL know the impact the dogs have on individuals who need the service of these dogs, but the impact they have had on our family, coworkers and friends has been just as valuable.  We love being ambassadors for Can Do Canine and have committed to continued support for an organization that  POSITIVELY impacts, every individual who comes in to contact with one of the dogs.  Our only regret is that we didn't begin sooner! Can Do Canines makes a difference! 
Can Do Canines	240571	1	/users/profile/326779	KMTR_B	Volunteer	5	04/06/2015	Contrary to another review, I can say that Con Do Canines DOES use rescue animals in their program.  I am a volunteer who has trained rescues animals to be service dogs and want to continue to do so as it is double duty in helping Can Do's clients as well as dogs who may not have another opportunity for a life such as they have with their clients.  I was introduced to Can Do  in a presentation at my place of work.  I was looking for a volunteer opportunity after retirement helping people and dogs, and there it was!  I couldn't wait until retirement so am juggling it all now and have never been more satisfied.  Wonderful organization, wonderful people who truly love these animals and  work hard to produce the best service dogs at not cost to the client.
Can Do Canines	240063	2	/users/profile/326093	qwrtd	Volunteer	1	03/27/2015	Can Do Canines does NOT use rescue animals and relies on breeding programs for their dogs...tells the volunteers that volunteering is not enough, they expect financial donations too.  Too much focus on autism-not enough focus on service/hearing dogs etc.  Shady organization that I have washed my hands  of.

Can Do Canines	229677		/users/profile/293322	Deb_41	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	Being a veterinarian and dog lover I was able to give back to the community by raising 2 eager to please puppies for Can-Do-Canines, an assistance dog organization in New Hope, MN.  The staff devotion and knowledge, the volunteer dedication and compassion and the great needs being met make this Nonprofit one of the most awesome that I have ever been involved with. Seeing and hearing the struggles with everyday living that the dog recipients have and how one dog can give them independence and comfort makes giving up the puppies I have raised and loved worth it.  I take for granted being able to bend over to pick up something I've dropped or  ( when my children were that age) for my toddler not to run off in a panicked meltdown at the mall. Seeing the puppies I raised perform a simple task to help a person in need is more heartwarming than I can explain. Being a part of something bigger and bringing peace of mind to the families who have the dogs now has blessed me as much as it has them.  although it has been over a year since the second puppy went to his new owner people ask me about him all the time, where he is and how he is doing. I learned so much through the experience too.
Can Do Canines	229427	1	/users/profile/293079	snowypaws	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	10 dogs ago we received our first service dog in training. Not knowing squat about dogs we were a little nervous. But Can Do Canines, actually Hearing and Service Dogs of Minnesota at the time, gave us direction and training to help us do what was needed. Jordan went on to certify as a seizure assist dog. What a rewarding experience! We were hooked. Can Do Canines has come a long way in there puppy raiser program and have done amazing things for the clients that have come to them for an assistance dog. All free of charge to them. We have now raised 7 dogs that have gone on to certify as service dogs, and are training our tenth. I still get a tear to my eyes when I think of the great opportunity I have provided to others with life challenging issues. Can Do Canines is TRUELY an AMAZING non-profit organization!

I even refused to see my own family and spoke to them only on holidays. Then along came my assistance dog Camille. I wasnt too sure at first about trusting her but after being awaken from a fire starting in my home I had little doubt I could trust her. With Camilles help we are truly a team and she makes sure I get out of the house everyday and visit with people and she LOVES to see my nephews and even cries in the car as we get closer to seeing them. :) THANK YOU Can Do Canines and all those involved in bringing Camille into my life she really had saved my life!
Can Do Canines	228906		/users/profile/292583	Glassman	Client Served	5	10/28/2014	My wife received Diabetic Assist dog Hailey several years ago.   My wife was at a very critical point in her life because she has had diabetes for nearly 50 years.  We were house bound and I could not turn my back on her  as she would just pass out in a matter of moments.   Sleeping all night without a very low and dangerous blood sugar episode was impossible.  Hailey has changed everything.  She catches the low blood sugars before they become a problem and has certainly saved my wife's life dozens of times.   Please take the time to go to Can-D0-Canines website and check them out.  Try and make it to one of their events.  I promise it will change your life.  
Can Do Canines	228427		/users/profile/292119	ranger1cat	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	It's been remarkable to observe the growth of this organization over the years.  The basic idea of training canines to assist folks who need help due to hearing loss, and physical limitations has grown to include assistance for those with diabetes, autism and PTSD.  Part of the appeal of volunteering with Can Do Canines was their ability to train dogs from rescue places such as the pound and the Humane Society.  They continue to train and match homeless dogs with people who needed assistance - talk about a win-win mission! Years ago I started volunteering at the office and then began to provide a temporary home for dogs that were being considered for the program.  Trainers wanted to know if the dog was compatible with my cats, since some clients already had a cat in their home. Other temperament/behavior issues were carefully considered also and only those dogs with the appropriate personalities were accepted for training.   This wonderful organization continues to professionally train and place exceptional "can-do" canines  with deserving clients at no cost to the recipient.  Can Do Canines is truly a great non-profit!

Bubba is a Schipperke that alerts me to dangerously low blood sugars before they become to low to correct on my own or cause me to have a seizure or pass out.  He does this all for love and treats.  He keeps me safe everyday at work, at home, at hockey games, and everywhere else we go.  He had the best training, I hear quite often "I didn't even see your dog".  When we are at home is a typical Schipperke, but when we are at work or out in the public he is all business.  Can-Do-Canines has been there for me every step of the way, they have made Bubba and I a great team!  I can never thank them enough.  Can -Do-Canines has done all of this for me for free.

Can Do Canines	227985		/users/profile/291694	luvmydogs	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have had the profoundly humbling experience of helping Can Do Canines as a field trainer several times. I say humbling because both the staff and the clients are amazingly committed, and the dogs are such a gift to a person struggling in ways most of us cannot imagine. To be able to help a deaf woman find a sense of security in her home with the help of her hearing dog and a young man with CP continue his work, gain independence and become an outspoken advocate for CDC and people with disabilities in general made me more aware of the small things I could do to change my little corner of the world. Everyone at CDC, from the Director to the Receptionists are knowledgeable and passionate about the program, and have the best interest of the clients and dogs in mind at all times. This organization has always used it's funds wisely and is committed to providing service dogs to it's clients free of charge. I too "envision a future in which every person who needs and wants an assistance dog can have one".Sarah G.

Can Do Canines	227843		/users/profile/291561	PamHaar	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I was volunteering at the Pet Gate at the Renaissance Festival to raise money for Can Do Canines. I met an autistic 4 year old and his service Dog along with the boy's mother. I was impressed with how well the dog waited for the boy to stand up and how calm the dog was around this 4 year old. What dog waits for a 4 year old? This dog did. Now mom starts heading for the gate, the boy veered off in another direction and the dog stopped so the boy had to stop as they were tied together--tethered more like it--for the safety of the boy so he did not wander off. I am so impressed by the time taken by another volunteer to train this dog to be able to do what he did today and take care of this boy. I foster dogs for a rescue organization and my dogs are not taught this well. Hats off to the volunteer that accomplished this training in order that this special needs child can now be safe and his parents do not have to worry so much about him running off and getting hurt or worse, getting lost. This nonprofit gets an A+++ in my book for the time and training they put into these special dogs. Thank you for what you do...

Their employees are some of the most kind and generous people that I have come in contact with and to know that their employees are all members of Lions Clubs International takes them one step further than anyone else when it comes to the Lions motto "We Serve".
Can Do Canines	227752		/users/profile/291478	Stein2	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	When I retired in 2007 I tried several volunteer opportunities before finding Can Do Canines. This organization is wonderful. They show heartfelt appreciation for volunteers. Just knowing that what I do for them helps in some small way makes all of the time I spend well worth it. The staff shows total dedication in everything they do. The entire cycle from the time puppies first come to them, placement with puppy raisers and prison programs, then back to Can Do for final training, matching the dog with its person is what it's all about. It is heartwarming to see the final result. So many people benefit from this organization. It's top notch.
Can Do Canines	227707		/users/profile/244021	Bklingelhofer	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	Can Do Canines is a fabulous organization!  I was blessed and accepted into their program, and received a diabetes assistance dog that has changed my life.  I have regained my independence, and am so grateful for their mission.  The entire process was so smooth- they are very professional.  I especially love the sense of family that the organization fosters for past graduates.
Can Do Canines	187018		/users/profile/244021	Bklingelhofer	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	The work this organization does has changed my life.  I was blessed with an assistance dog in January and I have already been able to improve my sugar control and my life.  They are professional, so helpful, and they make such a significant difference in their client's lives.
Can Do Canines	227596		/users/profile/291321	Kristen47	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I am a Can Do Canines donor, and my daughter hopes to one day have a diabetic alert dog. Can Do Canines does an excellent job thanking donors, telling their clients' stories and promoting volunteer and event opportunities for the public to participate. Their storytelling, in particular, is incredibly inspirational and of a very high quality. I appreciate the fact that they put their clients first (humans and canines!) and that is evident in everything they do.
Can Do Canines	227499		/users/profile/291230	Rosalyn N.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	As a recently retired physical therapist I knew I wanted to become a volunteer for Can Do Canines. I recently attended one of their "graduation" ceremonies.  If you ever are able to attend I would highly recommend bringing along a few tissues. It is so heart-warming to see what these dogs are able to do for people with physical and psychological challenges. 
Can Do Canines	187080	1	/users/profile/244080	May419,	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	My sister received her hearing assistance dog Autumn last year and it has changed her life.   Autumn lets her know when someone is at the door, when the timer on the oven goes off, and can alert her during the night when her hearing aides are out that the smoke alarm is going off.  Autumn has greatly reduced the worries our parents and I had about her living on her own.  We were always afraid that there would be a fire and she would just sleep through it.  Can Do Canines is amazing and really helps so many people have  wonderful independent lives!  
Can Do Canines	203353		/users/profile/265247	SaraVL	Volunteer	5	06/20/2014	Our family became puppy program volunteers in April (2014) when we welcomed a black lab puppy into our home.   Since we were going to put so much time, effort and financial resources into Can Do Canines, I did some research before volunteering. I read their annual reports and financial statements, talked to a former board member, and found them to be a very sound, financially responsibly organization.  Since becoming involved I've been very impressed with the support they offer to their volunteers.  Even more impressive are the amazing life-changing things their trained service dogs do for (and with) their human partners. I'm proud to be associated with this organization!
Can Do Canines	203336		/users/profile/244186	cmartinez767	Volunteer	5	06/19/2014	I have been a volunteer, donor, puppy raiser, and foster for a number of years.  I started volunteering with the organization after hearing about their work with the prisons and continue to volunteer to support their mission.  Can Do Canines does a great job of training and supporting their puppy raisers and fosters through a variety of ways - electronic, phone and in-person support.  I truly feel like they have the dog's best interest in mind throughout the entire training, placement, and beyond.  Their trainers are very experienced and work well with both the dogs and puppy raisers.  I have always felt appreciated and believe that my time and money is well spent.  There aren't many organizations where you can say your efforts drastically changed lives for the better - both a human's and a dog's.  
Can Do Canines	187189		/users/profile/244186	cmartinez767	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I love that this organization impacts both people in a positive way.  The staff really cares about their volunteers and I feel like I make an impact.
Can Do Canines	203301		/users/profile/265175	livinlife	Volunteer	5	06/19/2014	My husband and I have been volunteer puppy raisers and fosters for over 2 years and have had a variety of dogs placed in our care.  I continue to be amazed by the professionalism of the trainers, the staff and the organization as a whole.  One of our service dogs in training had to be career changed at 9 months old due to becoming anxious in public and their only concern was the best interests of the dog and whether this dog could be happy as a service dog.  When the answer was determined to be no and that he would thrive in a one owner family, they immediately found a loving home for him as a pet.  I see him often and he is doing wonderfully.  I appreciate the fact that Can Do Canines looks at the needs of the clients AND the needs of the dogs in order to make great connections, safe interactions, and happy volunteers.  They are always looking for ways to increase their outreach, help their volunteers, and serve the community.  I consider my time to be very valuable, and I would not still be a volunteer with Can Do Canines if I didn't feel that they were an incredible organization with an incredible goal of making a difference in the lives of others.  I've seen the success stories, and what these dogs do for their clients is awe inspiring.  I don't hesitate to recommend them as a place to donate, a place to volunteer or a place to visit.
Can Do Canines	201327		/users/profile/262792	areece0223	General Member of the Public	1	05/29/2014	My Mom and I are in Rochester, MN at the mayo clinic for appointments and today (5/29/2014) her service dog, Bella, was attacked inside the hospital by one of "Can Do Canines" standard poodle service dogs. It's terrible they place such an aggressive dog with anyone, let alone someone in a wheelchair.. I honestly fear for this disabled persons safety (as well as others in public such as people and animals) A police report had to be made and the dog had to be banned from the hospital. Thankfully my Mom's service dog is ok from the attack but the handler was very shaken up from the behavior of their dog..
Can Do Canines	188016	1	/users/profile/245243	Mamavee	Volunteer	5	11/07/2013	My husband and I learned about Can-Do-Canines in Sept. 2012 through a spot at the end of a news program.   Approximately a year and a half ago we needed to have our wonderful, loving dog euthanized due to an untreatable medical problem.  I vowed at that time to never have another dog as a pet; I felt that I couldn't go through that trauma again.  Learning about Dan-Do-Canines and the work these amazing dogs do for their recipients completely grabbed my heart and we both became volunteers.  The staff is as supporting to humans as it is to the animals. Since Sept. 2012, we have fostered several beautiful and truly amazing dogs.  Knowing that these wonderful animals will make such a difference to people who need their help allows us to return them to C.D.C. for their final training.  We are very grateful that we are able to play a part in helping others.  I have had the joy of witnessing the love of a recipient greeting her dog as they met for a training session.  If you have any doubt that dog and person share a very loving relationship, just visit a Graduation. 
Can Do Canines	187427		/users/profile/244432	Kizmet	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I could not believe the one star review written here.  Granted it is one person's opinion but it does say things are very misleading and downright untrue.  I have volunteered with Can Do Canine's and have found completely the opposite of that review to be the case.  The dogs are well cared for and cared about from what I see.  I've met with puppy raisers at parties and can tell how very much the dogs are loved and socialized when in their care.  I believe the same to be true when they leave the puppy raisers and go into training.  The relationship the dogs will share with their human partners is dependent on those very things...love and socialization.  There would be no purpose served in any training methods other than positive reward.  The staff and volunteers I have worked with are dedicated to both the animals and the clients they serve.  These dogs have enhanced so many people's lives ~ it isn't even possible to explain the value here in words.  Go see the facility, meet the staff, meet the dogs, go to a graduation ceremony and see for yourself the life changing outcome this program has for some very special people or better yet...volunteer and get right into the nitty gritty so you can make your own assessment!

Even though  we have not received the dog for our son with autism yet, so far we have only great things to say about Can do canines. Our questions are answered right away  and besides the long wait, almost 3 years on the waiting list, so far no complains, just hope that our son will match with a dog from this wonderful organization soon

I heard stories and met people who have benefited from the dogs they've received and it was truly moving. The organization is so dedicated to helping people but also to make sure that the dogs are well cared for. I also attended the woof a roo had a wonderful time. I plan on volunteering with this organization in the future.

Can Do Canines	187005	1	/users/profile/244010	Addie M.	Donor	5	10/31/2013	I am so impressed with the work of Can Do Canines.  Through enormous efforts of volunteers, donors and community support, CDC provides assistance dogs for people with hearing or mobility problems, seizure or diabetes, or for children with autism, at no cost to the recipient.   Some of the dogs in this programs are part of their breeding program, but some are rescued from local shelters/humane societies.  Volunteers help raise/train puppies.  One thing that really impressed me about how CDC is that they also have a program with two local prisons where prisoners work with the dogs to refine their skills before they are placed with their human partners.  But of course the huge impact is that made by the assistance dog in each person's life.  One has only to attend a CDC graduation ceremony and listen to each person's story to recognize that.  And seeing the capabilities of these dogs is amazing. 
Can Do Canines	186852		/users/profile/243859	Debra53	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I've support Can Do Canines because they not only help people but also give shelter dogs a second chance at life by training them as service dogs

They have an awesome, experienced and very helpful  staff and many great volunteers.  I wish everyone could listen to their clients and hear how very, very much their lives have changed because of Can Do Canines and their dogs.

We are raising a black lab puppy that someday is going to go to her "forever human" as a gift of independence, freedom, love and companionship.

Can Do Canines	186571		/users/profile/243580	Gunnhild A.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	Hi! I got involved as a volunteer with Can-Do-Canines two years ago. Prior to that, our family had gone through some rough patches, but I knew I wanted us to volunteer and give back since focusing on others when life is hard, is very life giving. A friend of mine had heard about CDC and since our own dog had died the year before, we wanted to check out what volunteering for CDC would look like. We decided that we would become puppy raisers, meaning, we would have a puppy be a part of our family for about 1 1/2 years and we would be trained to train the puppy!We are currently puppy raising our second puppy and we just had the privilege of seeing our first puppy be certified/graduate as an diabetes assist dog and that was incredible. We got to meet the client that now has this dog and she could share stories about how her life has changed after she got her diabetes assist dog. She knows her dog will alert her 24/7 and that is an incredible gift. Also, she loves the temperament of her dog; he likes to stay active and so does the client, so now she has a companion for when she runs, bikes and swims. I am so proud of them, and I am so proud of being involved with such an amazing organization. It is life giving to be a volunteer for them!

The first puppy we raised was so much fun and the people we met had such an impact on our lives that we keep coming back for more! We've worked with several dogs from puppy to adult, done short term fosters, and have whelped four litters. It's a lot of work, but so worth it when you get to see what a difference these dogs make in their client's lives!
Can Do Canines	186494		/users/profile/243504	Wanda8	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	When I first applied over 5 years ago, even through today, if I have a question about my mobility assist dog, someone at this agency is helpful in answer it or helping me to find the answer.  I've been very happy with this agency from the time they came to my home to do the interview, the information they gave me, letting me know what they expect of me, the training with my dog match, even finding a match with the breed I prerferred.  The day of our graduation as a service dog team was so new to me, but very exciting, and a person really needs to attend a gradutation to understand the importance of these dogs to the presonal lives of the individuals who receive them.  I've been back for someone else';s graduation, and have the same feelings I had at my graduation.  The dog placed with me, Redford, was an excellent match.  He continues to demonstrate how smart he is and has changed my world in so many positive ways!

Can Do Canines	186464		/users/profile/243472	marysand	Donor	5	10/31/2013	Our son received his Diabetic Assistance dog in March 2013. She is the best help and friend! Prior to the two of them being matched, our son had unfortunate experiences medically because of Hypoglycemic Unawareness. That's a lack of awareness of low blood sugar symptoms. All the medical/technical kinds of assistance by way of  CGM and an insulin pump could not protect him as well as his diabetic assistance dog does. As a family member, we are so very grateful for all the contributions of time, talent and financial assets given by Can Do Canines staff, volunteers and everyone who worked together to build our son and his dog as a team.  We feel so much safer knowing that his dog is on duty to  alert him when his blood sugar is low or high and persist so that he takes measures to correct either before serious experiences happen. His dog is  a very treasured friend to our son. 
Can Do Canines	186458		/users/profile/243466	Deb_28	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	This organization helped to change my life - I should not say helped but was the key to the change in the form of Cyrus, my mobility assist dog.  Before Cyrus I was very house bound - afraid of going out in public, falling, and not being able to do those little tasks others take for granted.  Since Cyrus my world has again opened up and the fear that kept me in the house is gone.  The training he received by the puppy-raisers, trainers, volunteers and staff at the Can Do Canines organization was the reason I have the freedom I have today.  There is no way I can ever thank them enough

The staff at Can Do Canines is dedicated to making sure the dogs that are given to a client are the best trained dog as possible. Our first dog graduated in October and we were so proud of the accomplishment of our family and the dog we raised.  We couldn't have done our job without the support of the trainers and other staff at Can Do Canines.

Can Do Canines	179578	1	/users/profile/236222	Kathy137	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	I've worked with dogs, professionally, all my working life.  It came to the point, because of my MS, that I could no longer do the work I had done for so many years.  I was urged to apply with Can Do Canines.  By a miracle of God, they accepted me into the program.  It took some time but eventually they showed up at my doorstep with a beautiful, fully trained female black lab.  I fell in love with her instantly and the love has only grown with each day.  The trainers are AWESOME as are the puppy raisers!   "Karma' helps to balance me when I walk and gets me things I drop.  She also will get a phone for me when I fall in the house.  She's always with me wherever I go.  Before Karma, I rarely went out because I was afraid of falling.  Now, with the brace she wears I can hold onto her and I no longer fear falling in public.   She's my best buddy and watches me continuously.  She loves to curl up with me to watch TV and snuggles with me in bed on cold nights.  She also barks very loud and scares off anyone who comes to our door.  Unless she knows them!  They get a toy picked out and carried to them by Karma:)  She loves everyone but I'm okay with her loud ferocious bark!     Karma has opened my world again.  She goes to all my medical appointments which are many!  They love her there and she makes the appointments more fun while sitting in the waiting room.  She's special and makes me feel special.  I love her so much!  And, she was given to me by Can Do Canines who do not charge for these awesome dogs!    Kathy Schroeder and Karma.

Someone is obviously angry at us, to write a review like that.  I would be happy to address any problem directly and look for a solution. I would invite anyone to visit us, go on a tour, or talk to one of the hundreds of volunteers who work so diligently to help us provide our assistance dogs, free of charge, to people with disabilities. Then judge for yourself. Thanks. Al Peters

Don't care about the animals at all, it is all about the money.  Once saw a trainer twist a puppies ear when she thought no one was looking because it was behaving badly.  Their kennels are disgusting and the dogs are not cared for properly.  Just disappointing.
Can Do Canines	47871	2	/users/profile/47944	michael39	Volunteer	5	07/07/2010	This Outstanding organization is my personal charity of choice and I support many. We have had the privilege to puppy raise and/or foster 18 dogs over the past 6 years.  We also have helped out at graduation--always an emotional moving experience seeing the dogs with their clients.  In addition, we have represented the organization at various events as booth representatives--telling their story.  They use dogs of many breeds and include rescue dogs from shelters as part of the their exceptional program.  Not all the dogs make it but they make every effort to have them be successful.  They are very professional in their work that provide dogs trained  helping individuals with disabilities, hearing loss or deafness, alerting to medical conditions, and serving autistic children and their families.  I am proud to volunteer for this organization---Can Do Canines--home of Hearing and Service Dogs.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	230880	9	/users/profile/294495	Angel1982,	Client Served	5	10/30/2014	My husband is a wounded warrior...he lost a leg in Afghanistan and struggled with a lot before we got in touch with PawPADs a couple years ago. We were eventually partnered with Barkley just over six months later. Barkley is a dog who was rescued from a shelter and trained in a prison by PawPADs. Barkley changed our lives. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does for my husband. Barkley has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his struggles and hard times but his successes too. PawPADs has given us something we hadn't had in a few years and that's encouragement. Barkley can turn on the lights and pick things up but the best thing he does is watch out for and take care of my husband.  The support we have received from PawPADs is beyond anything we have ever known. This is a nonprofit that is not only changing lives but changing the world while helping wounded warriors like my husband.  I would give them  more stars if I could.

They do it the right way. Everyone there - the staff and volunteers - work tirelessly every day to find, train, love and prepare dogs for a life of changing lives! They take the time to make sure every dog in physically and mentally prepared to go out to a loving home so they can make a difference in the life of a disabled person. I've been donating to them for several years now and have attended their "graduations" and have seen first hand the results.    A fantastic organization full of compassionate, caring people. Id give them 5 Stars but I want them to work even harder! ;o)
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	281940	1	/users/profile/372037	jgaines	Board Member	5	03/08/2016	I have been a volunteer with this organization for the past 5 years and on the board for the past 3 months.   I have seen many lives changed with the placement of dogs with people with physical disabilities to diabetic alert dogs and school resources dogs.    I think what impresses me the most is enriching lives with the training is just as important as the placement of the dog and the willingness to train rescue dogs.   This is truly a wonderful organization with a Director that knows everyone by name and your not treated as just another volunteer.  
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	281363	1	/users/profile/159669	Alan T.	Board Member	5	03/01/2016	After more than 5 years as a volunteer and a board member for 2 of those years; PawPADs has never ceased to fill me with pride and gratitude.  Over those years I have gotten to see the lives that have been changed by the amazing works done by PawPADs.  The wounded warriors that have regained self-esteem and been brought back into a more normal life, diabetics that have a fuller and more care-free life, children who are able to be children, peoples with disabilities having greater access to the world around them. and to the people who train and have trained their dogs; life-long changes and benefits far reaching beyond just training assistance dogs.  PawPADs changes lives. Here's just one example of the life that's been changed:
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	222358	6	/users/profile/159669	Alan T.	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	As a volunteer for nearly four years and now a board member.  I have seen firsthand the great work that PawPADs has done for not only its clients, but also the many participants in their ongoing programs that help troubled youth, veterans and inmates.   I can not begin to describe the amount of good that has come from this organization.  It's truly touched many lives and made them better due to the efforts of everyone involved. I strongly encourage anyone to donate, whether it's time, money or just referring someone who could be helped by our services.  PawPADs is a worthy organization that changes the lives of those that they serve and those that take it upon themselves to help PawPADs achieve its Mission, Strategy and Vision. To find out more about PawPADs:  http://pawpads.org/page20aboutus.htmlTo Donate:  http://pawpads.org/page40donate.htmlTo become a Volunteer: http://pawpads.org/page41getinvolved.html

With a combination of his alertness to my blood sugar changes and the technology of my continuous glucose monitoring system, my low blood sugars are caught before it becomes necessary to get medical help.  We're a great team!  People always say what a good dog he is, how mild mannered he is, and how beautiful he is, so he's a wonderful help to me by just hearing all the positive things people say about Milo.  All the smiles he brings my way wherever I go are just another way he makes my life  awesome!!

We were eventually partnered with Barkley just over six months later. Barkley is a dog who was rescued from a shelter and trained in a prison by PawPADs. Barkley changed our lives. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does for my husband. Barkley has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his struggles and hard times but his successes too. PawPADs has given us something we hadn't had in a few years and that's encouragement. Barkley can turn on the lights and pick things up but the best thing he does is watch out for and take care of my husband.

Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	266723	2	/users/profile/228783	LindaBall	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2015	PawPADs is so much bigger than the individual humans who run it!  The dogs change lives through their training -- from the youth at-risk and inmate trainers who have learned valuable lifeskills such as emotional regulation, self-control, giving back to the community and communicating effectively to the individuals whose lives are made better through the partnering with a service dog or a diabetic alert dog!  PawPADs is not a numbers-focused organization, it's not all about how many assistance dogs can get placed -- it's about what's best for each individual dog, what's best for the program participants and, in the end, is the person they are being matched with the best possible match!  The future looks exciting as PawPADs facilitates the magic of the human-canine bond in innovative and special ways!
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	172793		/users/profile/228783	LindaBall	Board Member	5	10/02/2013	PawPADs is a labor of love!  I know because, as the founder, it became my dream while working overseas in 2005.  After attending the Assistance Dog Institute (now Bergin University of Canine Studies) for an AS degree in Assistance Dog Training I began the long journey of building an organization that I am extremely proud of!   I believe that the PROCESS of training these amazing dogs holds incredible therapeutic and educational value and it has been a joy to see those results time and time and time again whether it be with: -  the emotionally damaged Vietnam Veteran rolling around on the floor with a dog and joy in his heart -  the child unknowingly completing his physical therapy by walking and grooming a dog -  the adolescent on the verge of getting kicked out of school for the day due to repeated temper tantrums sitting calmly reading to a dog and, again unknowingly, releasing oxytocin (a calming hormone) through their system as they pet the dog-  the inmates who are became not only more humane, but more human, through the process of training their dogs, giving back to society and making a positive difference! All of these populations are learning life lessons through the magic of working with our dogs -- they are learning emotional regulation, self-control, empathy, parenting skills and a myriad of other lessons. And, after the worry and joy, the challenges and triumphs, the highs and the lows, to hear from the partners of the dogs we've placed sharing what an impact the dogs have made .... well, it continues to make my heart sing!   I'm EXTREMELY proud of PawPADs .... I take great pride in our ethics, our ethos and all of the hard work that EVERYONE involved with creating this organization has undertaken!

I have only had him a few weeks, but already he has helped me so much with so many little things that are so hard to do on my own.  He has made my life so much easier.   Pawpads also offers support whenever we need it.  
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	231223	10	/users/profile/294824	PatrickandJessica	Client Served	5	10/31/2014	My husband is a severely disabled veteran and a client of PawPADs. He sustained significant brain damage that has left him paralyzed on his left side, unable to care for himself, and with a seizure disorder. Because of these issues, my husband requires full-time care and supervision.  There is no way to sugar-coat the losses he and our family have suffered. It's hard, draining, and, at times, very ugly. The realities of war live with us every day and no aspect of our lives goea unaffected.  PawPADs came into our lives at a time when I was feeling extreme fatigue and doubt as a caregiver. Our local veteran community referred us to PawPADs and our lives haven't been the same since. Despite years long waits for a service dog at other organizations, PawPADs was able to get my husband into their training camp within just weeks of us starting the application process. The staff IMMEDIATELY made us feel like part of the PawPADs family and of something very special. Since Ranger was placed with my husband, our family has changed in ways I never imagined possible. Because of the supervision and assistance Ranger can provide, my role has been scaled back. For the first time since his injury, I've been able to leave my husband home alone and know that he's safe. I've been able to let him go out into the community on his own and know that Ranger is beside him to help him. I've seen Ranger in action and know that if my husband falls, Ranger can either help him up or he can go get help (both of which he's done on multiple occasions). I don't think we've ever gone somewhere (and we go a lot of places) without getting comments on Ranger's remarkable demeanor, his impressive obedience, his obvious intelligence, and his instantly loveable personality. He's truly a remarkable dog but PawPADs turned him into an invaluable companion.  Without Ranger, my husband wouldn't have the independence he has today. Neither would I. Ranger adds a level of safety and security to our lives that I am immensely grateful for. He is my husband's safety net and my peace of mind. I cannot imagine our family without him or where we would be if he didn't come into our lives. Thanks to PawPADs and to Ranger, I get to spend more time being a wife instead of being a caregiver. There are no sufficient words to thank PawPADs for giving back to us some of what war took.

It has been highly rewarding expanding my role and helping PawPADs meet the needs of our clients, dogs, staff and donors.  For dog lovers, I can suggest no more important  volunteer opportunity.  For potential donors, your money will be wisely used to raise and train wonderful canine partners for our clients.  We, dogs and staff, are a big, happy family (I know it is a cliche....but true).  It has been the best volunteer gig of my life.

I am on the Saturday morning canine care team where we feed, groom,train, exercise and play with the dogs and puppies.  The Directors, Board Members and Volunteers are a close-knit family.  We are all asked for input in many levels of PawPads operations including dog-training, event planning, cost-control, fund-raising,  volunteer recruitment and others.  I have met and worked with incredible people, and the interaction with the dogs is life-changing.  I would highly recommend PawPads as a wonderful place to volunteer.

My first opportunity as a Board member was to coordinate an appreciation dinner for the backbone of the organization: the volunteers. At the event, I was able to meet many of the volunteers and I was amazed at their dedication to the mission of PawPADs  to train service dogs for people with a variety of disabilities. Under the guidance of the Executive Director, Linda Ball, the volunteers keep the dogs fed, groomed and socialized every day of the year. In addition to meeting the volunteers, I have also had the pleasure of meeting clients who now have a service dog and the benefits the dog has brought to their lives. For example, the diabetic alert dogs are able to tell the person when their blood sugar is low, giving the person the chance to check their blood sugar and treat it without having to resort to emergency measures. The dogs accompany the clients everywhere: home, school, work, etc. It is truly amazing what these dogs are capable of, and I am so proud to be a part of this organization!

Recently, General Counsels Legal Services Engagement Committee ran a campaign to raise donations from its employees to engage with and support Xcel Energys commitment to helping our armed services veterans. The campaign started with an in-house presentation of the Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADS) program on Aug. 11, 2014, with the campaign ending on Sept. 11, 2014, commemorative of this significant date in U.S. history. Co-founders Linda Ball and Randy Patrick, along with two of their dogs in training, Breezy and Coco, came to Xcel Energy to give a presentation of their nonprofit organization through videos, demonstrations from the dogs, and by providing information of all of their programs and taking questions from the employees who attended the presentation.   The Legal Services Engagement Committees goal was to reach $1,000 of donations, as well as to use Xcel Energys Matching Gifts program. The Legal Services committee not only reached its goal, but went over it. With the generous donations of $1,095 and $800.00 in matching gifts, a total of $1,895 was raised for this worthwhile organization. As the initiator of this campaign, I would love to encourage other corporations, companies, families etc. to organize a fund raiser as we did in our Legal Services Department at Xcel Energy, Inc. in Minneapolis, MN.  Linda Ball, Randy Patrick, Patrick Ziegler and their dogs are a wonderful visual for potential voluntary donors to educate themselves of this amazing organiziation through visuals, listening, education and an open forum for questions.  PawPADS and their founders (and dogs) are amazing and I highly recommend supporting our armed services veterans and these beautiful, intelligent and amazing dogs who provide such the help and companionship needed. Chris Barncard
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	194912	6	/users/profile/254702	bradcole	Client Served	5	02/27/2014	There is nothing worse than finding someone you love in a state in which you are so helpless. Having been a diabetic for nearly 40 years, and over the last few years having episodes of extremely low blood glucose levels to the point of being found unresponsive. My wife and I finally decided it was time to look into a Diabetic Alert Dog for her. Because most of our research had to be done on-line we had to sort out which reviews where honest reviews from people and which were put up on websites because it's just good marketing. During our long 6 months of searching we found plenty of operations that had what we thought we wanted, but discovered that they didn't really have what we needed. We found plenty that will give you their next available puppy no matter how far away you are, and with books and a general lessen send you on your way to complete the training and a couple times a year they might check on you to see if the dogs training is going ok. Then there were those that will give you a dog that is older and has more training. But again distance was no big deal for them. After speaking with a couple of these places we felt more like a number not people. Others even had pretty big egos and wanted us to know how good they were and how many dogs they place every year. Either may have gotten us a D.A.D. which is not what we needed. We finally found PawPads.  From our first contact we knew they were the right choice. There was no feeling like a number, there was no ego, just a love and passion for what they do. Finally we had found what we needed not just what we wanted. From the application process to finally visiting their facility, we could feel the passion behind the voice and in the smile on the face. Linda and Randy have surrounded themselves with loving, compassionate volunteers who share the same passion and goal, to make a difference in some ones life. The love shows in the way the dogs are loved and cared for as if they were everyone's child.  And it continues with the time and energy spent on the training the dogs receive. Andre was partnered with D.A.D. Sage after an intense "Partner Training Camp". We learned that we weren't just given the next dog available, we had options, just in case a dog just doesn't take to their potential new partner. Because after all this is for life, the dog has to equally like the person. We found out that Sage was named after a local young boy whom was taken much too young. Of course this makes Sage even more special and is just another example of how PawPads shows their love and is there to a part of the community.  After training camp was complete we didn't feel like we were just sent on our way home. Instead we felt as if we had become a part of something much larger....we were now part of the PawPads family and we couldnt be happier. We left knowing that no matter what kind of question we may have, someone would be there to answer. Even if its just to call and say Hi. We've been home with Sage now for about a month and his skills and training have far exceeded our expectations at this point. He has on multiple occasions alerted to both high and low blood glucose levels, often well before the meter can tell. We have no doubt that he will continue to educate us with his intelligence and just get better with time. His unconditional love even brings a calming to what is normally a hectic day. It's hard to describe in words the happiness, the joy, the thankfulness we have for what PawPads has given us. But because of their efforts we rest a little easier knowing we have a new family member in our home to keep a watchful "nose" on Andres wellbeing. Thank You so much Linda, Randy and all your volunteers, because what you do Makes a difference.

My son Kyler was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes 3 years ago. It has been an uphill battle of constant care and sleepless nights. Low blood sugars have controlled every aspect of our lives since the day he was diagnosed. The constant fear that your child is going to have a severe low blood sugar episode and having to check to make sure he is still breathing in his sleep is overwhelming to say the least. You never stop worrying. With jobs suffering and a marriage feeling the strain we were desperate for relief. It was then we found PawPads! We were Placed with a Diabetic Alert Dog just over six months ago. This dog has transformed our lives. Recon was the missing link in Kyler's care! He has given us what we never thought possible...Piece of mind! We still eat, sleep and breathe diabetes but we are no longer struggling for relief. Recon let's us know if kyler is low and most times he alerts before the low actually happens. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does and that's only part of what Recon does. for a 10 year old Boy who is feeling different and is beyond sick of missing out on life because he lives with a chronic illness. Recon has given him reason to embrace this horrific disease that will follow him for life. This dog has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his trials and tribulations but his triumphs. Kyler has a new outlook on life because of his Diabetic Alert Dog and I have piece of mind knowing that Recon is there to look out for him. PawPads has given us something we haven't had in 3 years and that's hope! The support we have received  from them is beyond anything I have ever known. The selflessness of Those who run PawPads is the most inspiring thing I have ever had the opportunity to be witness to in all my life. This is a nonprofit that is not only changing lives but changing the world with their positive outlook and devotion to others.

This is what they do 7 days a week.  I love seeing the puppies grow & it's amazing all that they are trained to do.  Randy & Linda treat everyone like family & the dogs are treated like royalty.  Placing the dog with the right person is most important to them.  They love each & every dog & want to make sure they do what is absolutely the best for that particular dog.  I wouldn't continue volunteering 3 mornings a week if I didn't absolutely believe in them!!     
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	139774	3	/users/profile/185904	thunderbird	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Almost 3 years ago I was looking to volunteer some of my time somewhere.  It was then that I saw an article about PawPADs in our local paper.  Since I have a love of dogs, I found it to be very interesting & they were looking for volunteers!!  I contacted them, went to a volunteer meeting, & that's where it all started.  Randy & Linda's enthusiasm is contagious!!  You can see/feel it in the dogs, the other volunteers.  Randy & Linda give 1000%.  They have devoted themselves to train dogs to help other people, & this is what they do 7 days a week ... no days off.  I know my life has been enriched.  I'm typically at PawPADs 3 mornings a week.  We have so much fun getting the dogs ready for their day.  I also feel like I have an extended family, & that Randy or Linda would do anything to help me if I should ever need it.  I feel that way with the other volunteers as well.  I can't say enough good things about PawPADs & what Randy & Linda are doing!!  Of course it's fun to be around the dogs, but volunteering for Randy & Linda is really fulfilling as well.  They really appreciate everything everyone does & it shows!!  I just couldn't have found  a better place to volunteer!!

Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	186848	3	/users/profile/243856	Slsergent	Donor	5	10/31/2013	I'm a special education teacher in the south metro and our program at school has had PawPADs come into our classroom to work with our students for the last 3 years.  PawPADS volunteers haul the dogs to our school where they instruct our students with mental health conditions and behavior disorders on training these beauties to some day assist others with disabilities.  We have assisted in training dogs that have been placed with Veterans, children with diabetes, and others with physical impairments.   As you can imagine, "dog day" is one of the favorite days of the week in our building.  I could tell stories of how students have had terrible days, until the dog enters the room.  The unconditional love of these pooches and how they change attitudes, demeanors and feelings is indescribable.   The lessons our students have learned about training, has been transfered to how to treat people, learn patience, persistance, increase self-esteem, and self-control.  I hope we can continue to keep this organization around for a very long time, so we can sustain our training in helping others in our communities....SS- Lakeville
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	230880	9	/users/profile/294495	Angel1982,	Client Served	5	10/30/2014	My husband is a wounded warrior...he lost a leg in Afghanistan and struggled with a lot before we got in touch with PawPADs a couple years ago. We were eventually partnered with Barkley just over six months later. Barkley is a dog who was rescued from a shelter and trained in a prison by PawPADs. Barkley changed our lives. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does for my husband. Barkley has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his struggles and hard times but his successes too. PawPADs has given us something we hadn't had in a few years and that's encouragement. Barkley can turn on the lights and pick things up but the best thing he does is watch out for and take care of my husband.  The support we have received from PawPADs is beyond anything we have ever known. This is a nonprofit that is not only changing lives but changing the world while helping wounded warriors like my husband.  I would give them  more stars if I could.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	186736	1	/users/profile/243743	June D.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I was looking for an organization where I could volunteer on a regular basis but hadn't found anything I was enthusiastic about until our UPS driver mentioned that he volunteered with service dogs every Saturday. He told me more about it and I contacted PawPads through their website and got an email back right away. I went to the training and have been volunteering weekly since April 2012. I'm impressed with the dedication of the founders and the volunteers and with the wonderful, brilliant service dogs they train.  I love being part of an organization that does something positive for animals and for humans at the same time. I can't say enough good things about PawPads. 
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	186707		/users/profile/160395	Debbie41	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I began volunteering with PawPADs 3 1/2 years ago. I knew immediately it was an organization that I wanted to be part of. I saw the passion and commitment that Linda and Randy had for this labor of love and felt an instant connection with them and the dogs. Seeing puppies come and trained dogs	 go can be hard at times......we grow to love them so!!........but we know what the objective/goal is - to provide well-trained dogs that will help change a life for someone. I do feel that I GET more than I can GIVE. I agree totally with others that said the PawPADs volunteers and staff are like family. I love going to "work" 3 mornings a week to be with the dogs and be with my second family! Linda and Randy always listen to our thoughts, ideas, and concerns. Together, we do hope to make a difference in lives that need hope, help and lots of love (doggie kisses!). I plan to be a volunteer with PawPADs for many years to come!!
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	186630		/users/profile/243640	smit1684	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I can't say enough about what PawPADS has meant to me and my students! While we have had an animal-assisted intervention program at Kenwood Trail Middle School for quite a few years, last year was our first working with the Project YES staff, and it was clearly our best year yet. The staff is dedicated to helping others, and  their hard work has resulted in smiles, enthusiasm, and motivation on the faces of our students.   The PawPADS and Project YES team is clearly a class act, and I look forward to working with them for many years to come!

Our son was matched with a wonderful lab and they are absolute best buds.  It has been amazing to watch them grow together.  Pawpads helps so many families and I wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone to them.  They train amazing pups!
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	186587		/users/profile/243599	ryan1750	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I am writing to express my sincere thanks and appreciation for all of the work and dedication of the Project YES staff. The 2013-2014 school year, marked our 9th year of running an Animal Assisted Intervention program at Kenwood Trail Middle School. While it was our first year working with the	 Project YES team, it was by far our best!  Our program is made up of male and female students in 6th, 7th and 8th grade who have social-emotional and/or behavioral disabilities. They have more obstacles than their peers and we have always felt they were in need of out of the box support and programming to meet their individual goals in life. Our students quickly became fans of the service animals in training that came weekly to our school. I lost count of how many times during the week students would ask is it a dog day, are the dogs coming Thursday?  While most of our students had been exposed to dogs from our former programs we saw quickly the students increased motivation and interest in working with dogs that would eventually be placed with to help someone with a disability. Our students seemed more invested in training the dogs correctly and showed ownership in their work. I have numerous anecdotal stories of students growth as a result in working with our four legged friends. Students improved their frustration tolerance, communication, and team work as a result of training the dogs for a higher purpose.  Our programs success would not have been possible without the professionalism, expertise, and flexibility of the amazing volunteers and staff working with Project YES.   Our partnership with PawPADs for the past three year has added so much to our program.   The entire staff is top notch and doing great work.   I look forward to continuing our partnership with PawPADs and the Project Yes team at Kenwood. It has been a phenomenal year and I am grateful to all of the staff that made this possible. Photos
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	173324		/users/profile/160188	marcin411	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	As a board member and volunteer for several years now I have witnessed firsthand the difference PawPADs is making in the lives of clients, students and volunteers.  PawPADs diabetic alert dogs work each day and night alerting their partners to drastic changes in their blood sugar levels giving them and their loved ones one more layer of security and confidence.  Other PawPADs service dogs aid their partners with everyday tasks from picking up dropped items to steadying them while they walk.  In the past few years Im happy to say PawPADs has also grown and expanded to include two prison programs in Sandstone and Duluth, MN.  Inmates in both these facilities train service dogs with a dedication and enthusiasm they would never have an opportunity to express without the PawPADs prison program. This is why I think PawPADs changes lives each and every day.   It is my hope that after reading this and other reviews on this site that you feel inspired to help PawPADs grow by supporting us with your tax-deductible donation.  Your donation will support these and future efforts at PawPADs and help change the lives of those in our community.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	117811	1	/users/profile/160188	marcin411	Board Member	5	07/06/2012	My first experience with PawPADs was as a volunteer more than two years ago.  From that first day as a volunteer to today as a volunteer and board member I cannot say enough great things about this organization. The commitment of Linda and the other staff is unrivaled in their drive and dedication to better the lives of people with physical disabilities and other medical conditions with the help of K9 partners. In the past few years PawPADs has grown from one litter of rescue dogs to an organization with two prison training programs, several school programs and a variety of other community outreach initiatives. Their work has touched the lives of veterans, school children, prisoners and volunteers alike with the help of the human K9 bond.  The easiest part about volunteering at PawPADs is meeting new puppies and knowing what a huge difference they will one day make to someone who just needs some four legged assistance in their lives. The hardest part is saying good bye to those once puppies as they start their new lives with their human partners.  Getting started at PawPADs is easy attend an information session and experience for yourself what a difference a few hours of your time can make.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	172789		/users/profile/228777	amolis	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I have been assisting the PawPads organization for several years now and have witnessed first hand the important impact these wonderful dogs have on the lives of their trainers and the folks that they are placed with upon completion of their training. The results and the impacts of the process are priceless for those they touch.

Linda and Randy are awesome and will drop everything to help the dogs and volunteers. I have volunteered ever since I had the training class in 2012 and I enjoy every min of it, I would never have imagined I would give so much of my time to this great organization but this is an awesome program, And I will continue to donate my time to PawPADS as long as they allow me to.  Thank you Linda & Randy for allowing me and my fellow puppy parole officers the opportunity to participate in this program.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	167435		/users/profile/159727	Beth A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	PawPADs is a small organization, making a big, positive impact on the lives of many.  One of the differences that sets PawPADs apart from other service dog organizations are the programs we offer.  One of my favorites is a Social Integration Therapy (SIT) program where we have been working with an elementary school for the past two years.  I worked with special education students and with students who did some on-on-one reading with dogs.  The dogs helped to motivate students to work on tasks that might otherwise feel daunting: such as the child that had many tantrums when it was time to work on range of motion tasks from his wheelchair, but would happily push a block off his tray in exchange for a dog kiss from Recon after he retrieved the block and brought it back to the tray and the student who was not confident reading aloud and who, by mid-year was reading loudly and with great expression to Hero, Ranger, Iko and others.  The students faces would light up when they saw the dogs and actually, so did the faces of the staff members!  There were times when teachers would stop by just to get their puppy fix and they commented that, they really needed that, and that it would help them get through the rest of the day.  The dogs are positively impacting many lives before they are even placed with their partners.   I feel very lucky to be part of the PawPADs family, to be able to work with the dogs  and reap the benefits of the human-canine bond and to be a part of a wonderful organization that enriches the lives of many people.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	117482	1	/users/profile/159727	Beth A.	Volunteer	5	07/01/2012	PawPADs, not only enriches the lives of those with whom the dogs are placed.  The benefits of the canine-human bond extend to everyone who participates in the programs offered, as well as to those of us who volunteer.   Volunteering at PawPADs has been very therapeutic to me; I enjoy working with the dogs, the directors and the other volunteers. When I first started at PawPADs, my shifts were two days a week for about a couple of hours each.  Working with Linda and Randy and seeing their devotion to the dogs and their mission to not only train and place service dogs but also to develop programs that enable others in the community to work with the dogs and reap the associated rewards, has inspired me to come to the training center more and more and it has become a place I want and need to be.  I see and feel the passion and it is contagious.  When I initially inquired about volunteering, one of my first questions was whether or not there would be other volunteers on my shift because I had just come from a situation where I was volunteering alone and it was an uncomfortable experience.  Linda responded that I would definitely not be alone and that some of the other volunteers even stuck around after their shift to visit and enjoy coffee.  Its true, some of the other volunteers and I have become friends, and we socialize after getting our work done and even when were not at the training center.  I have come to think of PawPADs as a second family.   Going to the training center, training the dogs on my own and working with students in the school programs has been very rewarding.  I cannot help but get excited when the dogs respond to a command and seeing a student light up when the dog works for them feels even better.  I am extremely fortunate to be a part of this organization and the great things we do! 
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	140138		/users/profile/160209	Randy P.	Advisor	5	11/15/2012	I am the Director of Operations/Development here at PawPADs. I want to share a little about our Volunteers, Donors, and Supporters, and Clients: the people that really make PawPADs successful and make a difference in so many lives.As we all know from our own experiences with people, personal relationships can go a long way. These relationships increase our understanding of the people we work with, give us insight as to their motivations and capabilities, and develops mutual trust. Our family has gone far of their way to develop personal relationships with PawPADs, and we all share a joint vision of what we are and where we are headed. I hope youll share the vision too after reading our reviews.Volunteers: many of our volunteers have been with us for months or years. Some came looking for a one off opportunity or a short term commitment and have become a family. Their can-do, will-do spirit is a valued attribute of Americans and sets a great example to all our neighbors. They have  devoted thousands of hourstime off from work, weekends, mornings, evenings, holidays, day timeto caring for our service dogs, training them, and representing PawPADs in the public. They build and clean and laugh with each other and the dogs. Their commitment, teamwork, and enthusiasm energizes us! Donors:  The average cost of raising and training a service dog is between $20,000 and $25,000. Because of generous supporters like them, we're able to partner our service dogs with those who need them at minimal cost or for free. Their financial support provides the resources needed to team with our prison and school partners, veterans, and those with developmental and physical challenges. From individuals to foundations, families, organizations, and companies, their contributions in any amount plays a crucial role in getting the dogs from puppy to partner. It demonstrates yet another American quality: the spirit of generosity. Your generosity and good will inspires us!Clients: Our clients lives are enriched and empowered by their partnership with skilled assistance dogs and diabetic alert dogs. Inmates, teachers, students, and veterans utilize the power of the human-canine bond as a therapeutic, educational, healing tool. We create powerful, life-enhancing experiences through working with dogs - as the very act of working with, being around and training these dogs can be therapeutic and life-altering in profound ways. Their confidence in PawPADs encourages us! If not for all of the above, there would be no PawPADs. I sincerely hope that you, as a review reader, find what you are looking for in a nonprofit in PawPADs and want to become part of our family of Volunteers, Donors, Clients. Thanks, and Dog Bless You!

Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	133124	1	/users/profile/178825	Lynn35	Board Member	5	11/03/2012	My initial contact with PawPADS began from just a love of dogs. I wasn't in a place where my life allowed me to have a dog so I thought being a PawPADS volunteer would give me a perfect "dog fix".  Little did I know how much more this organization had to give. The passion that Linda, Randy and the rest of the staff and volunteers show is amazing! As a board member I have been able to watch from behind the scenes as PawPads has grown and touched lives not only in the local community but throught Minnesota and beyond. Watching the dogs work in their roles be it alerting to a blood sugar or opening a door always gives me to know what an amazing partner they will be for someone someday.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	132346	3	/users/profile/177979	ANN LW	Client Served	5	11/01/2012	I have been touched by PawPADs personally and professionally.  The impact I see these dogs have on the lives of those around me amazes me on a daily basis.  Folks that come in to contact with these dogs are able to learn/strengthen skills of caring, compassion, humanity, patience, and many other variables that tend to erode over time with this specific subset of the population.  Interactions with these dogs in training are soothing to the mind, body and soul.  They inspire joy, warmth  and growth for their handlers and everyone involved with the development of a serve dog to be.

My intention was to volunteer for roughly 3-6 months. But when I started getting to know Linda, Randy, and also the service dogs I realize that this is something I want to do for a very long time. I've been volunteering for over 2 years and will continue to do so for many more years.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	126816	1	/users/profile/171832	reneejuliette	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	I cannot find words to adequately express how amazing PawPADS is as an organization.  The various programs touch so many people's lives.  I have diabetes and have experienced the dogs-in-training, working, receiving 'alerts' 20 minutes before my low blood sugar registers  on my glucometer.  This is EXCITING.  Linda and Randy are welcoming, appreciative and really care about people and the puppies/dogs (all creatures).  Their positive approach to life, their organization and training is contagious.

The dogs are so wonderful, but even more wonderful are Randy and Linda who run the day-to-day operations.    The positive attitude, encouragement, and fabulous pups that we get by interacting with this organization has really enriched my life and that of my family.  We are super lucky to get to contribute to shaping the lives of the dogs and those of future people in need through this organization.  I'm also noticing that I say "yes!  thank you!" a lot more!  :)

It has been a wonderful partnership that means so much to my students, their families and the entire school.  My students are given time to interact with the dogs and their trainers in a positive and supportive situation that makes them feel special and successful.  Many times the dogs are a comforting and calming presence in our classroom in a way that cannot be fully described.  The kids and dog just melt into one another!  It has been a very rewarding experience and I feel very fortunate to have such a great group of volunteers willing to come and be a part of our classroom each week.

Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	118764	2	/users/profile/161489	amy_30	Advisor	5	07/18/2012	As a marketing communications consultant, I developed a marketing plan  and provided direction to help PawPADs achieve its goals of raising its awareness in the community, with potential clients and prospective donors. Through the process, I've been impressed with the organization's ability to do so much with an enthusiastic group of volunteers and limited financial resources. Donors' contributions are certainly used wisely and volunteers' time respected. The best outcome, however, is the positive impact on the lives of the prison inmates, school children, veterans and volunteers who work with the dogs, and then ultimately, the clients who get a dog. I'm happy to have provided pro-bono services to PawPADs, and to become a donor and volunteer in other capacities.

I was immediately inspired by the passion of Linda and Randy. I found out it was more than training service dogs for people with disabilities. School programs, the prison program and other community interests fill their days. Their positive approach to the dogs and the volunteers keep me coming back and I have learned a lot about how therapeutic a dog can be. I truly look forward to my volunteer days at PawPADS. The volunteers are highly valued and our input and ideas are always welcome and encouraged. I also feel fortunate to volunteer with an amazing group of people (& dogs!)I do get attached to the dogs, but the positive feedback puts me at ease when I hear about their new lives.

The people that run it are absolutely wonderful teachers (and just plain wonderful!).  I have volunteered for many years at different places and PawPADs is by far the very best because of the   people (incl. other volunteers) and atmosphere of the place- there is so much fun to be had and anyone that wants to volunteer can settle into whatever position they feel comfortable in.  I highly recommend this organization to anyone looking to support a nonprofit in any way.  They're real people with real values helping people in need by training great assistance dogs that really do change lives.
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	117854	4	/users/profile/160266	JillandKachina	Client Served	5	07/07/2012	My son, Nicholas, was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when he was 3 years old.  He can do anything any other child can do but it is very scary to put your diabetic child to bed.  Your child can go into a coma and never wake up if blood sugars are too high or too low. When I learned about Diabetic Alert Dogs, I contacted Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs.  We met with Linda Ball and a couple dogs later, we met Kachina.  Kachina is the most wonderful dog ever.  She came to our home February 25th, 2012.  We truly believe she was meant to be with our family.  When she was placed with us, we found out our neighbor volunteers at PawPads.  Our UPS delivery man knew of Kachina via John that volunteers at PawPads.  At soccer, our YMCA referee had volunteered with PawPads.  They all knew Kachina and told us that we were very lucky to have her.  She has alerted us many times now and in many different ways.  She nudges with her nose, she paws, she whines, and she sniffs like crazy.  At the time of Nick's diagnosis, I thought that Nick would never be able to go to college or live on his own.   We are so reassured that he can leave the house now.  She is such a blessing and she just puts a smile on our faces every single day.  What a gift!
Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADs)	117485	3	/users/profile/159731	takin	Client Served	5	07/01/2012	Sioux Trail Elementary School participated in the PawPADs Social Interaction Therapy program.  Personal relationships go along way and these relationships increase our understanding of the individuals we are working with, give us insight as to what works, and develops long lasting connections.  At Sioux Trail, our mission is increasing student achievement and developing strong personal relationships with children and their families is key part of this work.  This year we added the PawPADs Social Interaction Therapy (SIT) program to our toolbox and it has been instrumental in assisting in increasing student achievement through the development of relationships and identifying the needs of each individual child.  The success of the PawPADS SIT program at Sioux Trail is best characterized by a couple of stories. Sioux Trail Elementary School is home to two classrooms specifically structured around the needs of students with severe cognitive or physical disabilities.  This is where the SIT Program got its start at Sioux Trail.  The SIT program at Sioux Trail is designed to benefit both the dogs and the students.  While I lack the qualifications to evaluate the benefit of the program on service dogs, I am a keen observer of the amazing benefits we see on our students. Many of the students in these classrooms lack the ability to communicate using words in the way that you and I do, but it is easy  to read the excitement on their faces when your talented volunteer arrives with one of the PawPADs service dogs.   When the students work together with the trainer and the dog we observe an increase in their motivation to work on skills such a developing gross motor skills by tossing items, which the dog then practices the commands get it, "bring it here" and "give," as well as others. Teachers have observed students who are reluctant to leave their wheelchairs or other adaptive equipment to go for a short walk change their attitude.  When they get to walk Rio or other dogs around our school, they will go for a 45 minute walk, which for the students in this program is physically challenging experience.  A final example is what the simple, yet indescribable joy of petting and sitting with a dog does for a student who is blind or has limited mobility.  The connection that the dogs are making with our students are unlike any that we can make. After the successful implementation of the SIT program with students in our Special Education classrooms, a teacher asked a  devoted PawPADs volunteer if the program could be expanded to allow students to sit and read with a PawPADs service dog.  The teacher and PaPADs volunteer identified a similar personal passion, researched the idea and developed a program that will have long lasting impact on students and their ability to fluently read grade level appropriate text. We are now fortunate enough to have at least two service dogs in our school once a week, who are read to by students who are reading below their grade level.  After working with students in the special education classrooms, the PawPADs trainer and a dog move to our intervention classroom where they are joined by an additional trainer and dog team who pick cozy locations to read with students.  The word of mouth about this opportunity spread like wildfire and we have great numbers of students requesting time to read with a PawPADs dog.  Students now get a ticket in the morning if they are going to read with Ranger, Hero or another service dog and the smile that lights up their face is a clear indication of their excitement.  Recently, a student was walking down the hallway and a staff member asking how his day was going Two days until the dog comes he replied. In addition to the joy that the students express about this opportunity, we are seeing measurable outcomes as well, such as in increase in performance on standardized reading assessments, selection of reading materials close to grade level, a newfound passion for sitting still and reading for more than 15 minutes and an increased desire to find book they like. A final story is one from the entire student body.  Each year our student council selects one charity to raise money for and they had completed this fundraiser earlier in the year.  After seeing the impact of the PawPADs service dogs at Sioux Trail, our student council representatives asked about organizing a second fundraiser to benefit the PawPADs organization and the work Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs is doing.  What is significant about this to me is that a small portion of Sioux Trail students have the opportunity to connect with Bravo or another service dog during the day, yet all students see the benefit an want to support the work that is happening at Sioux Trail. This says good things about our students, but it says great things about the work you are doing and the connections that the dogs are making in a wide-variety of ways.  In closing, I am grateful for the partnership with Sioux Trail and the positive impact that the PawPADs organization, volunteers and dogs are having on Sioux Trail students, families and staff.

Camp Odayin	319016		/users/profile/410359	momitsu5	Client Served	5	11/17/2016	Our Son has a serious heart defect that makes our lives allot "different" from the normal family..daily medication, monthly (or more) doctor visits, extra precautions, disrupted events, and additional stress is just a little bit of what we deal with out of the love for him. No one "gets this" like other heart families, Camp Odayin is where we can all feel "normal" in the big group, we are not the minority here! We laugh, cry and share and learn from each other and come home with life long friendships that will support  us all year long. Our family becomes closer as we learn we are not the only ones "dealing with this" we can de-stress and talk about ways to do make life better/easier. The camp staff always has great activities planned that takes us out of our "comfort zone" and lets us be silly in a way that makes lasting memories. We love Camp Odayin!

Family Camp Odayin is a time for us as a whole family (not just the kids) to spend time connecting with eachother and connecting with other families who also have a child with a heart defect.  We share similar experiences, hopes, and fears.  Attending Family Camp Odayin makes us feel less alone and more "normal".  The staff are outstanding; the facilities are outstanding; the cost is negligible.  Five stars.  Highly recommend.  
Camp Odayin	307179		/users/profile/398501	Monica89	Client Served	5	09/30/2016	My daughter started attending Camp Odayin at age 8 and "graduated" this past summer at age 17. Camp Odayin has always been the high light of the year for her. It gave her something to look forward to when things were tough. She has made some great friends through camp that truly understand what it's like to face the reality of having a chronic heart condition and the limitations that come with it. The staff is absolutely amazing at making these kiddo's feel good about their heart conditions and boosting their self-esteem. We are so thankful to be part of the Camp Odayin family!
Camp Odayin	307167		/users/profile/398488	enoksen	Client Served	5	09/29/2016	     Our daughter was born with 3 heart defects; Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection, ASD, VSD.  She also suffered from frequent respiratory issues and could not handle heat and humidity well.  As she began to get older, she wanted to do things other kids did and she longed for a little bit of independence.  We heard about a new camp for heart kids.  Because there was a cardiologist present 24/7, and nurses, and air conditioning in the cabins, we decided to let her try going to camp.  She was 9 years old and part of the very first group at Camp Odayin in 2002.       To say it was a wonderful experience for her is really quite inadequate.  She made life-long friends at Odayin.  She gained independence and confidence.  She didn't feel like she was the only one with a scar who had to be careful about what she did.  The highlight of EVERY summer from then on was Camp Odayin.  The beautiful thing for us as parents was that we honestly never worried about her safety and health.  We knew she was in good hands and that she was having a great time. For kids like our daughter, Camp Odayin is the only option for experiencing camp because no other camp can take care of the health problems and emotional insecurities that accompany heart kids.      Our daughter is now all grown-up.  She graduated from college, has an excellent job, and is living on her own.  We thought that her days of Camp Odayin were sadly over- but no!  She went back as a camp counselor in 2015 and plans to do so again in 2017!   Thank you, Camp Odayin for being there for our daughter.  She wouldn't be the confident, independent young woman she is today without you!

This camp does more than just give kids with heart disease an opportunity to attend summer camp. It is a place where those kids can meet others, share their story, and realize they are not alone in their experiences. It is a place where those kids are able to act silly while growing confident in themselves. A place where scars are the norm and a family is made from the memories. The staff is amazing and the life lessons  just as valued. A place where I learned that "all of our hearts are deeper than you can see, you can be happy if you let yourself be!"

I've never felt more safe or unafraid of who I am or what has happened to me, because at Camp Odayin I know that I am not alone, and that my condition makes me special but does not hold me back from living my life.

Camp Odayin	163099	1	/users/profile/216508	LiveStrong4Peter	Donor	5	07/19/2013	This is the best camp in the State of Minnesota. I work in the Academic Health Center at the University of Minnesota and recruit medical, nursing, pharmacy, and other health professional students to volunteer at Camp Odayin. These students are in the midst of intensely rigorous academic programs yet care enough to volunteer their experience and skills to make a difference in the lives of the kids at camp in the very limited break they have from classes and rotations. They are also young enough (most in their early to mid-twenties) to be able to relate to the camper population, engage with them, and have fun with them. Perhaps best of all, because the camp is run on an almost entirely volunteer population, the only cost to campers and their families is a $25 registration fee which includes the entire week of camp experiences and activities! The families are so lucky to have the opportunity to attend a camp which focuses on kids with heart issues. I'm a huge fan of Camp Odayin.

Camp Odayin	162920	1	/users/profile/216268	MnMom	Client Served	1	07/18/2013	Disappointed in the Training of the counselors/staff - as they take volunteers-it's very transient. Kids with heart disease are affected emotionally more than just limited activities. All the fun camp stuff is great but these kids have things going on and they admit they aren't prepared to deal with them - though they advertise they give emotional guidance and direction and support.The volunteer staff don't realize that as its short term good intention for them and they are following the leadership who doesn't want any disagreements. any disruptions just need to just go away until they are done at the end of the week. They could teach in that moment instead their leadership finds someone to take the blame, and any challenge and it comes down harder and harder.  I was asked to take my review down - but I said I wouldn't as I think if unread this I would've realized it wasn't a fit for my son. It might be for some - but he just isn't happy and felt the opposite of accepted seeing how things were run with him and others. My kid was recently diagnosed 2 years ago and had 2 heart surgeries, where a lot of kids who attend were born with issues, the personal outlooks are different. Levels of limitations through life and understanding and acceptance differ. This camp is very very structured in activity, but not counseling or emotional needs which we believed were going to be the key component we were looking for. My kid hasn't been restricted before and wasn't now, so the activity level was less challenging then other camps so wasn't as impressed as other kids are, and the emotional value we hoped to get wasn't there. My kid felt like an outsider. So I guess when filling out the application and the mention the "right fit" this is what they are talking about and for the right camper it is.The wrong fit can be harmful.
Camp Odayin	158441		/users/profile/210215	MicheRn	Volunteer	5	05/21/2013	This summer will be my sixth summer as a camp nurse at Odayin. When I signed up six years ago, I was expecting to enjoy a week away at camp, on a lake, with some fun kids. What I ended up with was a life-changing week and a second "family." The kids weren't just fun, they were amazing. I was with the oldest kids (ages 14-17) and was blown away by the respect and concern they showed for others. Everyone was included, no matter their looks or level of ability. As someone who has worked with kids for years, this was nothing short of amazing (especially for teens!). At camp there are no bullies or hurt feelings; only friends, encouragement, and smiles.  The kids make life-long friends and it is pretty cool to see. Camp itself is also like nothing I ever experienced in my days at camp as a kid. The cabins are clean and comfortable, the food tastes great, and the activities for the kids are ridiculously awesome. The summer staff up at Camp K are super qualified and always have fun things planned. Lastly, the Odayin staff and volunteers are great. The staff are organized and enthusiastic. They treat the volunteers and kids with the utmost appreciation and respect. The volunteers are awesome people with huge hearts. I have made some of my closest friends with fellow staff and volunteers at camp. Camp really is just one of the most fun, amazing, life-changing places in the world. It is not an understatement to call Odayin a "family." I hope to still be volunteering there as a nurse in thirty years when I am old and gray!

The only place she had slept without me was at my parents house. But she was excited to go and be part of the residential camp experience. I agreed to let her go because I knew this would probably be the only Camp suitable for her needs. She came back home a different girl, with more passion for life than she already had, she came back independent, strong, powerful. Last year my youngest decided to take the risk and experiment residential camp. On their return date she cried because she wished camp was longer, because she didn't want to let go of her cabin sisters and all the wonderful people at Camp. Throughout the whole year we deal with the anxiety at least once or twice a month of her stating she just can't wait until Camp, the wait is too long. This year we have our 11 year old going for her third time and our 10 year old going for her second time and even though other plans might have to be cancelled, family gatherings missed we are all happy to do it just for the smiles and memories that are made at Camp Odayin.

Before Odayin, I had attended other summer camps, but never had an enjoyable experience due to misunderstandings about my heart condition. At Odayin, I was never made fun of for my scars or not being able to "keep up," and best of all, I got to meet other kids just like me! I had never met anyone else with a heart condition that was my age, and having that opportunity was truly life-changing.

They went and came home and had an awesome time.  This year they asked mom when do we get to go back.  I said this summer.  Thanks Camp Odayin for having a place my two girls can be themselves!!!!
Camp Odayin	2460	20	/users/profile/3943	dr chip	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/12/2009	Camp Odayin is the best! It is a place where kids who have been "special" their whole lives because of congenital or acquired heart disease can just be regular kids at camp. They can ride horses, shoot bows and arrows, eat s'mores at a bonfire and just have a fun time. Everyone has a scar on his/her chest so no one has to feel "special" about that. The number of returning kids every year tells you how terrific Camp Odayin is. As one of the volunteer doctors who goes there, I can tell you that I will keep going back every year. It is always the best 3 weeks of my summer!!
Camp Odayin	2427	21	/users/profile/3912	KaitiCamper	General Member of the Public	5	01/09/2009	I love going to camp. I look forward to it all year, starting right when i get on the plane to go home. Everyone tries to talk all year but nothing is the same as that first second you see all your friends again after 365 days. It's amazing to be around kids that know exactly what you went through and exactly how you felt; it's a lot easier than constantly having to explain every detail. I've been going to camp for 6 years now, and this year will sadly be my last, but I'll never forget my camp days and all the amazing people I met. I'm so glad I got the chance to go there! =D

Camp Odayin	2385	19	/users/profile/3831	heart mom	Client Served	5	01/05/2009	Camp Odayin is wonderful.  It provides many excellent opportunities for my son with congenital heart disease to feel normal.  After attending heart camp, he is much more outgoing and he doesn't feel as different from other kids.  It has also been great for my whole family to meet other families living with CHD while doing normal family and recreational activities sponsored by Camp Odayin.  My children with normal hearts have had the opportunity to meet other siblings who understand what it is like to be part of a family living with CHD.  Sara, Alison, and Matt are organized, outgoing, and fabulous at what they do.  Before moving to Minnesota, my son went to another heart camp that was very good.  Camp Odayin, however, is the best!  The camps are very well organized and fun, they provide families with a wide variety of recreational and service activities, and they connect families with new information related to CHD.  Keep us the great work!
Camp Odayin	2368	11	/users/profile/3798	vanliewp	Client Served	5	01/03/2009	Our son Nicholas, 15 yrs, has attended Camp Odayin the past three years.  We were very lucky that his 6th grade teacher, Laura Prekker, was a summer camp counselor and gave us the application so Nick could attend camp. We were so excited and relieved that Nick could attend and we wouldn't have to worry if we could afford to send him.  It was free! If you ask Nick what the highlight of his summer was, he will say with a smile on his face "Heart Camp"! He made friends, tried new experiences, and now realizes that he isn't the only one with chest scars and a pacemaker. This was an enormous help this year because Nick knew that he would be having another open heart surgery in Dec. to replace his homograph pulmonary valve.  Nick has chosen not to share is heart disease with classmates and you really can't tell he has a disability if he doesn't take his shirt off. Spending a week each summer with kids with similiar disablilities and kids that are healing from recent surgeries has given Nick courage and confidence.  While he is away at camp, we do not worry.  He is under excellent cardiac care.  The Doctors, Nurses, Counselors and Volunteers are professional, knowlegeable, and caring. We feel truly blessed that Nick can attend Camp Odayin each year without bringing finacial hardship on our family because of non-profit donations.  Please consider donating to this wonderful organization.Sincerely,Shawn and Patty VanLiew
Camp Odayin	2366	16	/users/profile/3794	Firechief	General Member of the Public	5	01/02/2009	Camp Odayin Where do I start. My daughter Gina has been lucky enough to go to Camp Odayin the last four years. She was born with a heart condition called Heart Bock. Through the early years we were pretty alone on how this would affect her life and what changes she might have to go through. We were told By her great cardilogist that there was a 5 day summer camp that kids with varying heart issues were able to go and be able to see that there are kids out there with heart issues and they are thriving . She was able to go and at first was hesitant, not sure what to expect. When I dropped her off right away I knew thatthe camp would be great for her. The camp personnel were great! They were understanding and treated my daughter as an old family friend. When I picked here up  the following week I practically had to drag her to the car and all she talked about the two and half hour trip back home was all the experiences she had and she could wait to go the following year. In closing Gina has become more accepting of her condition and more at ease that she can live a normal life. The camp personnel are to be commended and they have my thanks.steve trenhailemoose lake , mn

He loves all the staff & activities. They do an exceptional job at Campodayin making it a great experience for each camper!!
Camp Odayin	2354	16	/users/profile/3779	scott orf	Client Served	5	01/01/2009	My son was born with a complex congenital heart defect that through a series of surgeries was able to live a very normal life.  But where ever you look there never seemed to be anyone else that had to deal with the Doctor visits or the need to take medications everyday. When he was about 13 years old we were discussing the fact that so many other kids had camps that would offer a time to get a way.  They had camps for asthma,cancer etc. I think when we sent him to boy scout camp we made the counselors nervous.  The first year my husband was able to go along, but in his second year he went solo with the other boys.  I can't tell you after dropping him off at this remote camp site how nervous I was and continued to be for the entire week that he was gone.  So the next time we went to the cardiologist we asked if they had heard of any camp that was out there for kids with congenital heart defects. The were able to offer us a brochure on Camp Odayin.  It showed a brochure with kids just having fun.  Of course for us the comforting fact was that they also told of the volunteer medical staff and facility that they have on hand and how close the Brainerd hospital would be if needed.  We talked it over and signed him up.  The first year we made sure that we drove him up to the Camp Odayin site.  What a beautiful location. You could see the trees and lake and the huge lodge they use for a meeting site.  We dropped our son off and checked in with the counseling staff to drop off all of our sons medications.  Then we were dropped like a hot potato as he was welcomed in that year for a large lunch spread.  Before we left they did let us peek in at the medical facility, it really assured us that he would be fine if anything came up.  That was the first of five years that our son went to camp.   The kids are able to do everything that any other camp kid can do .. and probably more. They have horseback riding, banana boats, swimming, archery, crafts, games, campfires, and every year they have a themed party.  The ones I can remember are prom, toga party, back to the 70's, and the all-american day.  Over the years he has met a lot of good friends, in fact he is dating a young lady he met at camp three years ago. The staff is awesome.  They are so giving and caring.  We are really thrilled with their medical director they have currently, he is one of our doctors that we have had. And we know how wonderful and caring he is.  Last year sadly is the last that he can go as a camper due to his age.  They have now opened a mentoring counselor program that these young adults can come back and offer there wisdom to the group. If you can't tell Camp Odayin is one of my Hot Spots and I can't tell you how much the camp and all their people really are special to our hearts.  We continue to do whatever we can to help support the camp with walk/runs - give back to the community meetings and they benefit dinners in the cold month of Feb.  If you have a chance to go or work at this camp I would say you are a very lucky person

We've also had the pleasure to attend their family camp as well as several other Camp Odayin activities.  The Camp Odayin staff are extremely professional and are just over all great people.

Camp Odayin is a welcoming, magical place for kids like him. He can go swimming without being self-conscious about the scar that runs the length of his chest.  He doesn't need to worry about if he'll get too tired to take part in the activities.  He can talk to other kids about what it is like to have heart problems.  But mostly, he can have fun without being different.   The camp is committed to supporting these kids and to making camp affordable for all kids.

He thought he was the only kid with a heart defect and when he got there, he was one of many.  When he got home, his attitude was better, he stopped talking about when he was going to die and at camp, he actually had conversations with other sick kids who really understood him, not just his well intentioned parents and doctors!!!  The staff at Camp Odayin are absolutely incredible - they are well educated, concerned and really cared about the kids and they also showed the kids how to have a really great time!  This was the first time I had actually been away from my son without any contact(aaarrggghh!!) and looking at the photos posted online each day eased my nerves and showed me that my angel was definately not missing me!!!

Children from all over the world have come to this camp to share fun with others like them that have had to deal with various heart complications. Some of these kids have had dozens of operations from birth on. These families have been through very stressful times, over and over again. At Camp Odayin, each of these young people really feel a sense of belonging, and fitting in. No longer are they the only "one" with a big scar to hide. My son returns home from camp each year with a huge smile on his face, new friends to keep track of and many stories to share about all the crazy and fun things they did at camp.

We saw a camp flyer in the dr's office and looked into camp odayin.  What a Godsend this organization has been for our san and our entire family.  The staff at Camp Odayin are angles on Earth.  It is truely amazing what they have done for our son and the confindence and 'normalcy' that they gave back to him - it's really a gift that they so willingly share with all the kids.  Our son, Andrew, looks forward to his week at camp mor than anything else.  That is his time to be 'free' and not have worries about his heart.  At camp, he can relax and just be a normal kid and have fun.  It's almost impossible to put into words all the amazing and gifted people who participate at camp and make a HUGE difference for all these kids.  I know it's only five (5) days out of the week, but what they give to Andrew will last him a lifetime and beyond.  Thank you to all the people who make Camp Odayin possible and God Bless you all.

Our daughter has made some very close friends at camp and when they see each other it is squeals and giggles all around. Honestly, Camp Odayin is the highlight of each summer!  As parents, we can't ask for a safer or more fun camp experience for our heart child.  On the first day of camp, it is a joy to say "goodbye" because we know that she will come home with many stories to tell of a really fabulous week. When the camp says "no worries", they mean it.  There is nothing to worry about- only tales of your child's adventure to look forward to.  If you're on the fence about sending your heart child to Camp Odayin, get brave and allow them to discover some independence at Camp Odayin!  You'll be so glad you did- and so will they!

My mom is a nurse at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and had gone the previous year. She came home after that week and couldn't stop talking about how much fun she had. I know the camp is for the kids, but all of us volunteers have just as much fun. While the camp may be for children with heart disease, you would never know it. The camp is no different than any other summer camp except for the trained nurses and doctors on hand. The kids do everything from crafts to boating to horseback riding and none of them act like they are sick. They make every moment of that week count because this is something they look forward to all year.I plan to attend next year. And maybe I'll volunteer for more than one week. That's how much fun I had and that's how much I want to help these kids enjoy the week away from home and with other kids just like them.

The organization sponsors events in addition to camp throughout the year for children with heart disease and their families.  Many of the kids at camp attend year after year and are certainly considered a part of the "Camp Odayin family".  I had an amazing experience at camp as a volunteer because of the wonderful kids and Camp Odayin staff.  The camp experience is made possible through donations from individuals and organizations throughout the year.  One of the activities at camp that the kids participate in is creating cards for all of the donors.  This activity provides the kids with the opportunity to reflect and put into words exactly how much the experience means to them.  The kids take this activity very seriously and a lot of the cards created by the girls in my cabin were very touching.  All in all the Camp Odayin team includes some of the nicest and most generous people that I know and because of this I will always have a place in my heart for this organization.

We were lucky to find Star Legacy where we raised awareness in Omaha, NE and started a walk to honor all babies gone too soon.  We were amazed at the amount of people that also wanted to form a community and support system in Omaha.   We continue to bring awareness to the community and many other communities in the US.  Star Legacy is a great organization that truly wants to end stillbirth through research and guidance.   I'm honored to be a part of this organization.

They have a great influence on helping those through difficult times.  The members of this foundation are very dedicated and provide tremendous support through their understanding and compassion.  In Nebraska, I attended an event called the Stillborn Awareness Walk.  They shared their stories of hardship and break throughs and their belief in finding a way to prevent stillborns. This type of dediction is what this communicty needs.

Often times, families are left feeling confused, vulnerable, and lost.  Star Legacy has been a wonderful resource and inspiring organization.  In Omaha. NE, Star Legacy hosts  walk each year that brings families together that have experienced or been impacted by a stillbirth.  The organization brought many together and allowed everyone to gain support and share their stories.  It has been remarkable and something that my family and I personally look forward to attending each year! The support and friendships that are made through the annual walk is truly remarkable.  It is fun for all ages and they manage to choose beautiful locations! It is always ran very smoothly and I hope to be able to get involved more in the future!

After we lost our son Dylan at 33 weeks gestation, we found a community of support through this organization.  I have recently started to volunteer with Star Legacy in an effort to get tax credit legislation passed in New York just as the organization had helped influence in Minnesota.  I am confident that the research and programs that Star Legacy supports will help prevent some causes of stillbirth in the future.

With their help we've learned so much and have felt included in a community. We are grateful that there's an organization out there to help us put our grief to work.

Star Legacy Foundation	323365		/users/profile/117436	CDC2128	Volunteer	5	02/17/2017	Star Legacy Foundation provides so many resources to the families its serves and it fills a gaping hole that very few other nonprofits in the U.S. serve - research on stillbirth, pregnancy loss, and neonatal deaths. As a mom to a stillborn daughter, I wanted to help others who are also navigating this unexpected journey and shine some light on this under-researched topic. Star Legacy allows me to do both. Furthermore, the staff and other volunteers are so welcoming and focused on working together for other babies and families.

Star Legacy Foundation	280978	2	/users/profile/370978	Writer	Client Served	5	02/26/2016	My hospital nurseI referred me to the Star Legacy Foundation after my son was stillborn in 2014.  I called the number on their brochure and immediately knew this was an orgaqnization that truly understood my heartache.  I was asked if I would like to visit with another mom with a loss similar to mine.  I eagerly said yes.  Less than two hours later, Lindsey - the Executive Director of the Foundation called me herself.  I was amazed that someone as busy as she was still had time to talk to me - just another of the many grieving moms that they must hear from.  We talked for over an hour and she reassured me that everything I was experiencing was completely normal and I was not 'crazy' for feeling the way I did and that I was not responsible for my baby's death.  I learned that she is a nurse practitioner so she was extremely helpful in helping me to understand why some of the things happened the way they did, what the current research says about cord accidents, and helped me sort out some of the things the doctors and nurses and even my friends and family said that didn't make sense or were hurtful. After that first conversation, I felt like a ton of bricks had been lifted off my chest and I could actually breathe again.  And - then she called me back a few days later - just to check in and see how I was doing.  We still keep in touch by email on a regular basis and by phone when I just need to talk or have a particular question.  She also offered to have another Dad talk to my husband.  He was resistant but when this Dad called him they talked for a short time and then met up to have a beer.  I saw an entirely new man emerge - he too benefitted so much from just talking to someone who has lived our nightmare.  My parents now attend a group for other grandparents and they really enjoy it.  I can't say enough for what this organization and Lindsey in particular has done to help us move forward.  We attended their run/walk event and were amazed at the volumes of people that came who know the sorrow of losing a child. We are now volunteering as we can and one day hope to be in a place where we too can be there for other families in their darkest hours.

The nurses at the hospital asked us if we would like to have someone who had experienced a loss come and talk to us - we we hesitant at first but decided to say yes.  Two lovely women arrived and from that moment on we felt supported in numerous ways.  They helped us understand what to expect and what decisions we would be asked to make and what the options were to us. They called another of their team who was a loss grandmother to come and talk to our parents which was so wonderful.  They gave us a phone number to call at any time to ask questions or to just vent.  Since then we have become actively involved in their work and support their efforts to advocate for awareness, research, education & family support.  This organization was truly a saving grace for us at a very vulnerable time in our lives.

Star Legacy Foundation	276211	4	/users/profile/365920	Roberta22	Board Member	5	01/10/2016	In 1974 and 1975 I experienced two miscarriages/pregnancy losses in one year. There was absolutely no support for me through this terrible loss. In fact, one of my friends had a still birth  of a full term baby the same year and she wanted a funeral for the baby. She was not allowed to do so.  Shortly after I began working as a postpartum nurse where I, too frequently, observed nurses and doctors unable or unwilling to comfort woman who experienced various types of losses.  I observed this lack of awareness, policies, and services in the medical community for over three decades despite many efforts and initiatives by many.  Sadly, there continues to be insufficient public awareness, education, advocacy, and research related to the needs of a bereaved parent  and grandparent of a child lost to miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity or neonatal death. Star Legacy Foundation is doing important work in  attempting to address this important need. I have known Lindsey Wimmer, the Executive Director for over 17 years. She is a very capable educator, nurse practitioner,  manager, and creative leader. 
Star Legacy Foundation	241516	1	/users/profile/328090	MindyMM	Client Served	5	04/22/2015	I lost my daughter to stillbirth 6 years ago. At the time, I didn't even know stillbirth still happened, let alone at such a high frequency. I do know that nobody talked about it, warned me about it, or wanted to talk about it after the fact. I searched online after losing my daughter and didn't find much support. I noticed there were quite a few small groups trying to do something. They were all started by families, not medical professionals, and most of them had a mission related to post stillbirth support. I believe that is important, however, i am a person who wants something substantive. I want data. I want answers. I want education. I want change. When I came across the Star Legacy Foundation website i found what i was looking for. Not only do they have the personal connection to stillbirth, but they also have the medical tie. Not only do they support grieving families after a loss, but they are focused on education and prevention. I reached out and had a long phone call with the founder, and the rest is history. We are friends and I am now on their board of directors and we are growing quickly. We have held two summits, had multiple research and findings published, conducted a research study of our own when data wasn't available, and are actively working to impact change going forward. We are a passionate group that knows we can make a difference. They clearly feel urgency to do it now. The fact that this isn't even their main 'job' is remarkable to me. Thank you Star Legacy Foundation. You have truly changed my life. Because of Star Legacy Foundation, i am able to use my tragedy to help others. Which in turn, helps me. I know we have saved babies! What could be more important than that?
Star Legacy Foundation	238826	2	/users/profile/324287	Megan2177	Donor	5	03/04/2015	I had not heard of the Star Legacy Foundation until they reached out to us after we lost our son, Jack, when I was 37.5 weeks pregnant.  The loss of our son was completely overwhelming - from not understanding what went wrong, to being asked about performing an autopsy, to being told I'd be planning a funeral and asked if i want to hold our son or have pictures taken. to being induced and delivering our son. The Star Legacy Foundation's mission is to increase awareness, support research, promote education and encourage family advocacy. I wish I had the information regarding still birth, warning signs, etc prior to my last pregnancy.  I am currently pregnant, and the Star Legacy Foundation provided articles regarding pregnancy monitoring and a Dr Collins - who focused on reducing loss due to Umbilical Cord Accidents (UCA).  This information has helped me with knowledge to more efficiently advocate for myself, my child and our care.  I can't thank the Star Legacy Foundation for all their support in the loss of our son and the opportunities to get involved, help spread awareness and recognize our children who were lost too soon! Megan - Minnesota, MN

As grandparents, we wanted to learn more how this could happen and how it could be prevented going forward.  We   found Star Legacy one of the few stillbirth organizations that deal with education and research.  We called them several times to ask questions to better understand some medical terms.  They were supportive and responsive.  It also helps that the director is a nurse, as well as a mother of a baby born still.  They also have many well written articles on their website to give families and parents information.  we are glad they were there when we needed them and will continue to support them in the hope that along with their help there will be greater research and discussion about stillbirths and there will be less and less families having to have a stillborn baby.

I was recruited to volunteer.  It was an instant connection.  I knew I had found my niche. Having worked as perinatal loss and bereavement support, I finally had that one, phenomenal resource to share with families.  I've heard it said way too many times, "Oh, these things just happen."  No is a reason, and it's not always obvious.  What empowerment to be able to give a reason and allow mothers to be proactive in future pregnancies.  I appreciate SLF funding researchers who are giving families answers and hope for future generations. One of the other great things SLF does is providing resource for family members and friends about caring for those experiencing loss.  Whether it be helpful reading or a list of what not to say.  It's covered.

Star Legacy Foundation	201032	1	/users/profile/262480	Nancy157	General Member of the Public	5	05/28/2014	Grief is life. Life is fulfilling.  When a baby dies within the mother's womb it never leaves the mother.  We feel the baby forever.  It must be this way as we have no other way to feel our baby after death.  We remember every kick, every hiccup, every feeling.   The joy and tears.  Star Legacy Foundation is sincere in every aspect of what they are...a caring, responsible group who knows and shares and loves.  What would our lives be without people like them?  Very alone.  Blessings to them in all they do for others. 
Star Legacy Foundation	167818		/users/profile/203136	dhv1229	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2013	Our daughter was stillborn in July 2011. I met Shauna and Lindsey at the International Conference on Stillbirth, SIDS, and Infant Survival in Oct 2012. From that moment on I knew that they were two very special women who had a built a very special organization. The Star Legacy Foundation is devoted to helping others who are suffering due to their losses while doing what they can to reduce the risk of future losses. Thank you Star Legacy Foundation for all your hard work!
Star Legacy Foundation	152067		/users/profile/203136	dhv1229	Client Served	5	04/04/2013	Star Legacy Foundation is a wonderful organization.. I only wish I found them sooner. They are responsive, committed, and more than anything, they really do care. Thank you Shauna and Lindsey for your commitment and hard work, I hope it pays off!!
Star Legacy Foundation	167739		/users/profile/222604	lmo70	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	My first contact with Star Legacy was when I was invited to speak at their Stillbirth Summit in 2011. This summit was the most productive meeting I have been to; the focus on bringing together parents and researchers to speak candidly was a real achievement. These conversations led to several areas of new work which I look forward to hearing about in 2014. Lindsey and Shauna are exceptionally dedicated and driven to stillbirth awareness, education, and research. They are also extremely personable and caring. I am grateful for the wonderful work that they do.
Star Legacy Foundation	167732		/users/profile/222597	soren_twins	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	My husband and I lost one of my twin sons on Oct 18, 2008 to extreme prematurity born at 23 weeks. During and after  the experience of his death in the hospital we realized we didn't have a lot of support or resources to make good decisions about this death and memory making etc. After this experience I met a group of women, whom  had  also experienced the loss of a baby,  that would go into the hospitals and offer guidance to families also going through loss, we have now formed a group of 11 Angels which is dedicated to supporting families with loss. 11 Angels services are offered free to families in need and is a project of, and supported by, Star Legacy Foundation. 
Star Legacy Foundation	167689		/users/profile/222555	Marian3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	After months of pregnancy and dreams about baby's name and decorating the nursery, few parents ever even imagine empty arms and a funeral for a stillborn infant. Yet, this is the sad scenario for 1 in every 160 births.  Star Legacy has emerged as a  highly responsive and reputable national leader in this arena. They have "walked the walk" and understand the depth of sorrow.  Lindsey Wimmer and Shauna Libsack have demonstrated through Star Legacy Foundation that a baby's legacy can inspire research and comfort other families experiencing this devastating outcome of a much wanted pregnancy.

Star Legacy Foundation	167665		/users/profile/222529	vanderwoodd	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I found the star legacy foundation after I lost my daughter from a stillbirth.   They helped me find an outlet for my grief by helping me plan and organize a 5k in honor of my daughter Addyson.  This non profit does so much to help educate people about Stillbirths. 
Star Legacy Foundation	167625		/users/profile/222490	warlanj	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	I first heard of Star Legacy Foundation when I was invited to present at their first Stillbirth Summit. There I met people who are very comitted (as I am) to making a differnce to stillbirth rates and care following a stillbirth. They are currently planning another summit in June 2014, I encourage anyone who is intersted in this area to go to theoir website to find out more about this wonderful foundation. 
Star Legacy Foundation	167423		/users/profile/222291	aliloe	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I came across the Star Legacy Foundation after the stillbirth of my first child. There are many support groups out there, but I was looking for a place that took action, and that is exactly what the Star Legacy Foundation does. Lindsey and Shauna are working tirelessly for the cause of stillbirth research, awareness and prevention. I can only echo what others have said: The Star Legacy Foundation is professional, dedicated, responsive and caring. I have since become a volunteer with the organization which gives me an even better appreciation for all that they do. Keep up the great work! 
Star Legacy Foundation	167401		/users/profile/222266	Carrie Pascual	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	As a parent who knows the pain and life changing effects of stillbirth, I was so happy to learn about the Star Legacy Foundation.  The organization does really important work in pushing for research, awareness and pursuing the changes that need to be made in the medical community to decrease the number of babies that die.  As an advocate and film maker, I've been fortunate to work with Star Legacy and get to know the real people who make up this incredible group.  They are who they say they are, and they work hard for what they believe in. 
Star Legacy Foundation	167237		/users/profile/222096	AngelMommy	Donor	5	09/05/2013	After losing my first child to stillbirth without any warning, I wanted to know that something was being done to stop this from happening.  Star Legacy Foundation was exactly what I was hoping to find.  
Star Legacy Foundation	167025		/users/profile/221869	OlderMom	Client Served	5	09/04/2013	I never dreamed I'd ever look for this organization but it has been a life-saver for me.  I lost my only child to stillbirth in 2011 and I will likely never have another chance to be a mother.  As an older mother I knew I was a high risk pregnancy but no one ever told me that it could end in stillbirth. Lindsey at the Star Legacy Foundation immediately returned my call and has been there for me since that time.  She is a nurse practitioner as well as a stillbirth mom and she helped me understand the medical issues that I had no way of understanding and none of my providers explained.  She totally 'gets it' from both the medical and personal side of the issue.  
Star Legacy Foundation	166873	1	/users/profile/221718	wf9396	Donor	5	09/04/2013	We lost our first grandchild to still birth at 41 weeks.  Our daughter-in-law went in to the hospital that morning to be induced and was told there was no heartbeat.  There were no warning signs, no risk factors, no answers.  There were many organizations that provided support.  There were many grief groups available (although not many that were specific to grandparents).  But the Star Legacy was one of the few that focused on research and finding answers.  This is so important!  The number of SIDS deaths has been greatly reduced in recent years due to research and education.  With the same focus and funding, I believe that someday the same can be said for stillbirth rates!
Star Legacy Foundation	166850	1	/users/profile/221669	SGRMommy	Board Member	5	09/03/2013	After losing our daughter in 2009, I spent hours online looking for answers. After coming across Star Legacy, I was relieved to find others who were working to prevent stillbirth from happening to others. I learned more and was eventually asked to join the Board of Directors based on mt experiences and expertise. I felt I could contribute my time and efforts to help others while honoring my daughter. Because of Star Legacy, I was able to go on to have 2 subsequent safe deliveries and I know my children are here because of the knowledge and support I have gained from Star Legacy. Their work is far from over, but lives are being saved.
Star Legacy Foundation	165037		/users/profile/219368	nanato6	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	Star Legacy Foundation is the largest non-profit in the United States solely dedicated to stillbirth research and finding answers that will reduce the numbers of families that endure the pain of stillbirth.  This outstanding organization, comprised entirely of volunteers, is focused, dedicated and committed to stillbirth prevention.  
Star Legacy Foundation	152171	2	/users/profile/203273	Kristi6	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	Star Legacy Foundation has recently partnered with our newly formed group 11 Angels.  They have backed us 100% and have offered assistance to us as we get off the ground.  They are a wealth of knowledge in the area of loss and prevention and we are so glad to have them on our team and supporting us along the way.
Star Legacy Foundation	152074		/users/profile/203144	Grandpa of Tyler	Donor	5	04/04/2013	Star Legacy Foundation is an extremely professional and well-run organization.  Lindsey and Shauna are dedicated to raising awareness of the impact of Stillbirth on the families that experience it, and researching ways to reduce the very high stillbirth rate around the world.  The grief of the parents that suffer the tragedy of stillbirth is marginalized by most of society that simply doesn't understand it.  Lindsey and Shauna are leading the fight to change that.  I believe it is truly a wonderful cause to support.
Star Legacy Foundation	93977	1	/users/profile/108456	Stacy C.	Volunteer	5	07/17/2011	I lost my second child when I was 8 months pregnant.  My daughter, Carly Elizabeth was so very wanted and we had much anticipated her arrival.  We lost her due to an umbilical cord accident and little did I know how attached a Mom really is to a late term unborn child.  All our hopes and dreams shattered in a moment and the rock hard grief hit immediately.  During the days, weeks, and months following, I had to find something to occupy my time and my brain that would allow me to feel close to Carly.  In a sense, I felt the need to still parent her the best way I could while we were apart.  I had been told by several others about The Star Legacy Foundation.  I contacted them and immediately felt a part of their team.  Now after about a year, I have realized the great benefits of working with this foundation.  They have helped me in being comfortable with my story, allowed me to help in various ways of stillbirth education and prevention, I have learned a ton, and most importantly I feel as though I add value in the way of saving future babies.  I thank them for giving me a charitable home and allowing me to honor my baby girl in everything I do with them.  They are there for me, they are there for you, and their most important goal is to prevent more broken homes and to bring more babies home alive.  Thank you to the team of Star Legacy!!!

Mission Haiti Inc	284293	2	/users/profile/374326	shwhitessj	General Member of the Public	5	04/01/2016	I visited with Mission Haiti Inc in February,2016. The events of the  trip has been sealed in my heart.Our leaders were tireless in making sure that we saw the roses, the thorns  and I have come home with a bud in my heart more determined than ever to spread the word that our nieghbors in Haiti are desperate for our mercy to provide the means to help  lift them out of poverty. The focus on education and sustainability is right on target. I know first hand  that any donation sent to Mission Haiti Inc will provide boundless opportunities for the ultimate recipients in Haiti.

Mission Haiti Inc	284264	1	/users/profile/374298	1435healyj	Volunteer	5	03/31/2016	I am lucky enough to say I experienced what an incredible nonprofit Mission Haiti Inc is and witnessed what outstanding work that is being done by this group. I travelled with the president Jimmy Dunn, a few board members, and a couple other volunteers who wanted to see what was truly being done in Haiti by our nonprofit. I got to play and talk with kids from three different schools that Mission Haiti donates to and learn more about what they learn in school and how much they enjoy it. I was able to see and learn what more can be done for these kids, and being a college student myself, I was able to see what ideas that Mission Haiti has that can help the kids develop. We were able to see what the farm system project that we are funding looks like, and what improvements are needed to make this a better functioning and useful tool for the Haitians. The president showed us how much improvement has already been made so far and I really could not imagine what they would have to do for food without the improvements that Mission Haiti has funded and helped build. The last big project that I was fortunate enough to experience was the elderly homes that Mission Haiti strives to make as comfortable and helpful as possible. We spent a day giving the elderly women a "spa day" by massaging them, motioning their dry hands and feet, and painting their finger nails. I was able to learn first-hand how important it is to take care of these women who otherwise would be alone and dying on the streets, whereas they are given a much better life here at the home that Mission Haiti supports. Overall, seeing all that Mission Haiti Inc does and pushes to do in the future makes me realize that this is a nonprofit that I want to be involved with for the rest of my life. 
Mission Haiti Inc	284237		/users/profile/374271	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/31/2016	Mission Haiti Inc is an organization that incorporates it's community in a truly magical way. The opportunities it allows its volunteers to have is one that allows each volunteer to connect with the charity on a personal level. The trips it organizes, in addition to the stories and passion it brings back to Minnesota has ignited a community to truly give itself to this cause. The relationship this organization allows its volunteers to forge with the Haitians they encounter makes the connections to it even stronger and because of this it is allowing multiple generations to be involved in a worthy cause.

Most recently had the opportunity to take a trip to Haiti and personally witness the good works of Mission Haiti.  last month with my parents, son, family members and friends.  I witnessed the resources of Mission Haiti put to work building a sustainable model through education, health and wellness, nutrition and agriculture. But most of all, I had the benefit of seeing firsthand the devotion, commitment, love  and resources of Mission Haiti and the life changing effect this mission has on the lives of so many.
Mission Haiti Inc	284014	1	/users/profile/374038	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/29/2016	Mission Haiti Inc. granted me the opportunity to witness, learn about, and experience Haiti in an entirely novel way.  On my trip I was I able to see the both the sorrows, and overwhelming joys of the resilient and determined Haitian people, and to participated in meaningful dialogue about the struggles they face.  Furthermore, I was inspired to see the incredible work Mission Haiti has been doing in Haiti for over ten years and was left with a sense of promise and a desire to continue working with Mission Haiti to bring about sustained change.  
Mission Haiti Inc	283890	1	/users/profile/373892	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/28/2016	Mission Haiti is a fantastic organization, it is absolutely the best non-profit that I have worked with.  I have known about Mission Haiti since I was in kindergarten. My elementary school, Annunciation, supports a sister school down in Haiti. Through Mission Haiti, I have been able to learn about the children down there as well as the Adults and Culture. My senior year in high school I traveled with Mission Haiti to Haiti. I was able to see the children we have supported, ages kindergarten to University. Being able to travel to Haiti and see what I have supported and cared about was an amazing experience.

Mission Haiti Inc	266394	1	/users/profile/355168	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2015	I grew up hearing a lot about Haiti. It was something else to go there myself.

Mission Haiti pushed me out of my comfort zone by taking care of babies and interacting with people of a different culture. I hope to volunteer again ASAP.

After going on this trip I know that every dollar being donated to MH is being put to good use to help ensure a better future for the people in Haiti. MH is dedicated to providing a better life of sustainability and quality for the people down there. Not only is Mission Haiti extending a helping hand to the people in Haiti, it also allows people within it's own community to be changed as well through their experiences. I was so happy to give a little bit of my time down in Haiti and know that someday I will be back.

Haitians are incredibly hopeful and value every interaction they have. Working with the children who crave interaction with their whole being was the most rewarding experience I had. I fell in love with so many kids at the hospital down there, and I hope I made some smidge of a difference in their lives, because they changed mine. Mission Haiti is an incredible non profit that gives so many people the opportunity to serve Haitians and have some understanding of the struggles in Haiti. Mission Haiti does make a difference.

Mission Haiti Inc	263574	2	/users/profile/168028	sjb12	Board Member	5	10/13/2015	Mission Haiti Inc. is changing lives--from kindergarten kids to university students, elderly women, a farming community, and the Americans touched by the Haitians we serve. Mission Haiti Inc. proves that a little, by American standards, can go a long way in Haiti to help Haitians help Haitians. How do I know? I've seen it first-hand. I have volunteered for this organization since 2007 and have made three trips in the past three years to visit our partners and projects in Haiti as a board member.  We are an all-volunteer organization--0% of donations goes to paying American staff or renting offices in Minneapolis. We rely on in-kind donations as well as monetary donations to get the job done. But we also rely on our great supporters spreading the word of our life-giving work. Thank you!
Mission Haiti Inc	170585	2	/users/profile/168028	sjb12	Board Member	5	09/19/2013	I traveled to Haiti for this first time this year with Mission Haiti Inc. and it was an amazing experience. It was obvious to me that Mission Haiti has been working and networking in Haiti  for many years as evidenced by the strong and good relationships between the board members and our partners in Haiti. I visited the students at the primary and secondary schools, the ladies at the home for elderly and abandoned women, and the sustainable farm project, all of which are making great progress. The ladies sang to us in greeting which was so special. My commitment to support this organization was only made stronger by this experience and I cannot wait to go back! 
Mission Haiti Inc	123391	2	/users/profile/168028	sjb12	Board Member	5	09/26/2012	It is a privilege to be a part of Mission Haiti Inc. I first got involved though the passion of Anita, one of the executive board members. Since 2008, I have volunteered to write and help with craft sales.  In 2012, it was my honor to be elected to the Board. To me, Mission Haiti Inc. is an example of the best of the best organizations: low administrative costs means as much money as possible goes to our programs in Haiti, and we are committed to long-term, effective and sustainable support of all our projects. We are making a difference through this lifegiving work.  
Mission Haiti Inc	229972	3	/users/profile/293627	NatalieA	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I was fortunate enough to travel with Mission Haiti in June 2014, something I had been looking forward to for 4 years. I learned so much about myself through our service, but even more importantly I learned about the reality of what is going on in Haiti and how much more there is still left to do. The people we met really could not have been more hospitable and I am so grateful I had this opportunity. My favorite thing about Mission Haiti is that those in leadership positions make very careful decisions regarding funding and other services to give as much benefit as possible to those who need it. They also showed us that you don't have to be rich or powerful to make a difference; anyone can do something as long as it's done with great love! 
Mission Haiti Inc	227555	3	/users/profile/291287	cidr54	Donor	5	10/27/2014	Mission Haiti doesn't filter money -- it goes directly to Haitians in need for medical services, training, education, farming, schools, and elder care. The board members I know are exceptionally caring people and highly dedicated to the organizational goals. This is a truly exceptional organization.

When the opportunity arose to go I grabbed that chance and went in June. Every moment was valuable from the people I traveled with, the babies we cared for, the elderly women that we met, our time spent with the students of Annunciation and exploring the farm. Mission Haiti, Inc. is striving for sustainability and dignity for the people of Haiti.

It was an amazing experience to see the love and compassion of the director and those who support this organization.  They are doing things not just to benefit the people there "today" but also in to the future.  They support the schools with quality education and are now providing college scholarships.  That is the only way things will change is to give hope to the children.  Caring for the elderly and supporting agriculture is also a part of this organization.  All of it is done with a devotion to the people of Haiti.

We have all traveled to Haiti on humanitarian missions several times. Working to care for sick children and spending time with the elderly "ladies". Singing, dancing and loving every minute of it. Mission Haiti has an amazing spirit and is on the ground, making a difference in the lives of the sick and poor. MHI is also working to educate young Haitians to build a vital and renewable human resource to help sustain continuous development and improvements for all Haitians. The MHI board and volunteers have dedicated themselves with energy, hard work, love and compassion. I would highly recommend MHI to everyone who wants to make the world a better place!

So many plants being put into the ground to supply food. Comfort and shelter to elderly women. The tireless work of the Sisters.  An amazing experience I am so grateful to have been part of.

Mission Haiti Inc	216080	2	/users/profile/279523	Delmont	Board Member	5	09/20/2014	I started as a rather distant observer and slowly but surely became familiar and then more actively involved in Mission Haiti Inc.  From there things just continued on an unplanned path.  My daughter and I took our first trip to Haiti in January 2014 and fell head over heels in love with both the country and the people. Mission Haiti is small enough to feel like an extended family and allow anyone who wants to to roll up your sleeves and make a difference  and large enough to truly collaborate with the Hatian people in a promising partnership on a global level.   Susie S.

Mission Haiti Inc	172837	1	/users/profile/174951	Mary116	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	Mission Haiti and the people of Haiti have captured by heart. Our time in Haiti was spent in Leogane and Port-au-Prince.  One can read a lot of reports about the good works of a lot of people there, but nothing substitutes for walking the streets, being with the children, ministering to the elderly women, experiencing the great beauty as well as the dire poverty. The people of Haiti live the reality of all of this with such hope.  Mission Haiti makes it possible for this experience with such care and support.
Mission Haiti Inc	129579	1	/users/profile/174951	Mary116	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	My first visit to Haiti was in 2011.  Mission Haiti was the best group that I could have gone with for an unforgettable experience.  Mission Haiti has established wonderful contacts both for the incredible work that it does as well as for introducing new people to the reality of Haiti.  The Farm is a success story beyond words with potential for further growth.  Annunciation School and the Village speak of the dedication of many people to support the children, families, and women of Leogane.  The visit provided the background and impetus for the Federation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the US and Canada to also become involved in the ongoing work of MH.   It is a gift to be associated with the group.  During our visit we visited a number of initiatives in Leogane and Port-au-Prince that opened my eyes to the resilience and dedication of the Haitian people in the face of insurmountable odds.

Mission Haiti Inc	170682	2	/users/profile/226111	craighco	Board Member	5	09/19/2013	My husband and I have been a part of Mission Haiti since it was founded in 2006.  We began going to Haiti in 2005 to visit  our sister school of Annunciation and home for elderly women. It was a life changing experience that has brought us many blessings during our retirement years.  We both have been back every year, and often more frequently.  Each visit increases our dedication and love of all the Haitian people, especially the Sisters of the Companions of Jesus, the children at the school and the women who live in the Village of Jesus.  We have experienced the devastation caused 2010 earthquake and several hurricanes and watched as our Haiti friends have worked with determination and certitude to repair and rebuild over the years. We have been encouraged by the growth of the sustainable farm project which the sisters manage and we help to support. Our immersion trips have provided the opportunity for some 56  friends, relatives and parishioners to experience and support our vision and work in Leogane.  Connie

Mission Haiti Inc	161897		/users/profile/173250	AWitta	Volunteer	5	07/01/2013	I recently traveled to Haiti in June. As a member of the board for MHI, I am truly blessed to be involved with this organization. Leogane, Haiti has become my home away from home. The children at both the primary and secondary school, ladies at the Village of Jesus, the Sister of the Companion of Jesus, and all those living at Bethleem Farm have touched my heart and impacted my life beyond words. I am sincerely grateful for our donors/partners and all they have done in impacting the lives of those whom we serve. Working hand in hand with those in Haiti, we are making a difference. I am fortunate to be able to travel to Haiti and witness this first hand. We have made a lot of progress over the past year due to our partners and donors. The dormitories in the Village are near completion. It has taken years to rebuild from the earthquake. The women in the Village of Jesus are receiving good health care, daily visits from a nurse and monthly visits from a doctor. Children have the opportunity to attend school, receive a daily meal and teachers are continuing in their education to reach a higher level of certification. MHI is sincerely grateful to all those who sponsor a student. Bethleem Farm has just received a tractor and visions of a plentiful harvest are in the future. We are a dedicated group of volunteers that works hands on in Haiti. The Sisters guide us in our steps to help provide what is the best for their community. Thank you once again to all those who support us in our mission, and for all those who pray for us.- Anita
Mission Haiti Inc	128115	4	/users/profile/173250	AWitta	Board Member	5	10/23/2012	My first trip to Haiti was in 2006. Upon returning, I knew that my heart belonged to Haiti and to all those that I had met. I was truly blessed when I met the staff and children at Annunciation School, the beautiful women that live at the Village of Jesus, and those I met at Bethleem farm. These people are now my family and I am welcomed "home" each time I return. My relationship with all of them has enriched my life. We walk together in our struggles, we celebrate progress, our accomplishments, and embrace our blessings with gratitude. We laugh, cry, and pray as one. It is truly an honor to serve on the board of Mission Haiti Inc. (MHI) and have the opportunity to work side by side with the Haitians whom we serve. I have seen many non-profits in Haiti begin projects and then leave. Mission Haiti supports education, elder care, and sustainable farming in Leogane, Haiti. We are committed to our projects and look forward to the future with hope. MHI is making a difference in the lives of those whom we serve.  - Anita 
Mission Haiti Inc	137049	1	/users/profile/183006	dan21739	Volunteer	4	11/11/2012	I have been involved with Mission Haiti for a number of years and visited there in January, 2009 as part of the mission group. I have always been very impressed with the Mission Haiti board and all they are able to do for the development of this country just from the U.S. Visiting as part of a mission trip was even more enlightning. To see the love of the members for the Haitians whether the nuns doing incredible work, the children at the schools in the small towns and villages, the babies at the orphanges or the senior citizens in need of attention and help was incredible as was the way the love was returned to our group. No matter where we went everyone was very happy to greet us and accept our help and assistance.  Despite the language differences in most areas, things were done in a very efficient and even exciting manner. I know that Mission Haiti, with their dedicated people and the plans they have for further aid and development of the schools and agriculture etc. will continue to be very successful in the growth and success of the people of Haiti.

We, Sisters of St. Joseph have funded this extraordinary group for the past 3 years.  I had the wonderful opportunity this year to be on site and experience the great work that is being accomplished by MH, empowering the Haitians themselves to making system changes especially in the area of education.  The children were so full of life, so happy, and so wanted to be in these schools both elementary and secondary.  MH is giving them the opportunity for learning by providing for good teachers and a stable environment run by the Haitian Sisters, the Companions of Jesus. 
Mission Haiti Inc	127967	2	/users/profile/173093	Eli P	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	Over the past couple of years I've been blessed to work with this wonderful organization.  I have had the opportunity to personally witness the sustainable and life-giving work that they do in Haiti.  Their programs help educate, employ, and care for the people of Haiti in a manner that is sustainable and dignified.  Their support goes beyond the physical needs to the spiritual.  This is evident when you look upon the faces of the people they help care for, all the while doing their work with great courage, humbleness, and joy.

Mission Haiti Inc	124826	1	/users/profile/169872	Nikki H.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2012	I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of non-profits, in a variety of settings.  Sometimes, I leave such experiences with a sense of powerlessness and defeat... as if what little was accomplished will never sustain itself.. will never mature or blossom into something more.  This is the opposite of the feeling I have received while volunteering over the past few years with Mission Haiti, Inc.  MH inspires hope in me because it strives not merely to do for others, but to empower others to do for themselves... MH trusts in the unique giftedness of individuals and helps Haitians to use their own strengths, values, and ideas, to create that which is meaningful to them.  MH serves others with an admirable sense of humility, generosity, and compassion.  I feel truly blessed to know and work with these people and this organization.
Mission Haiti Inc	124338	1	/users/profile/169176	Judd J.	Donor	5	10/03/2012	I live in Haiti and work with another organization in Leogane.  I have worked on projects right next to MH  in Leogane.  I have been witnessing the good work there and am proud to have had a part by being a donor.  The work is down to earth and worth it.  I actually looked for this organization for some time--just didn't have the name or contact info.  When I finally found out where they were I couldn't believe it--really close to where I live.  They are not austentatious and from my conversations with folks who are a part of this I know that this organization is out to serve.  One of the pioneers of this organization once gave me a small card which I had pinned to the cork board beside my desk.  It read "You haven't lived today unless you have done something for someone who can never repay you. "   I have worked in this community for more than a year and know how needy the people are.  There is about 80-85% unemployment here.  Many of the homes were destroyed by the earthquake.  I have been helping with overseas projects on site for the last 26 years. In Latin America and the Carribean and the work in this rea is very challenging but very fulfilling, too.  MH is one of the good ones!

I traveled to Haiti with Mission Haiti, Inc.  and witnessed first hand the incredible relationship that has transpired through the years between the people of Leogane, and this non-profit group of compassionate, dedicated, loving people.   I'll never forget how the group was received by the children of Annunciation School in Leogane, with outstretched arms and cheers of welcome.   The amazing education these children are receiving is allowing them to climb out of the culture of poverty they live with daily and is enhancing their development as they grow into the hope for Haiti's future.   Mission Haiti, Inc. is responsible for this  empowerment and so much more.   God speed to all those involved.

I've recommended it to many people and put a link to it on my website. I don't know of any organization that does a better job of linking artistic expression with an ecological sensibility. We humans won't be motivated to change our planet-wasting ways until we learn to love and appreciate the natural world we inhabit, and John's work is all about fostering that learning.
Morning Earth	28928	1	/users/profile/29973	janet21	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	I was raised on Kootenay Lake in British Columbia. The Mountains drop down into the lake, often mirroring themselves to the tune of the cal of grebe and loon. As a young naturalist, my mission was to reveal the beauty of nature to the casual on looker. So, many years later, when I met John Caddy, I found a kindred spirit. He spoke the same language of nature like no other. His insightful, or in-sight-full words bring the beauty and wonder of nature full circle so people see deeper into the depths of this magnificence.Now I live in the city. I am doing caregiving for 24 hours, 5 days a week. John takes me out into nature with every email, bringing me needed respite. His web site offers even more. My 3 & 1/2 year old grandson is learning the names of the birds from his emails. (They stay still enough on the screen to see them, and return to them for a second look!) If I was back in the classroom teaching, I would be using his web even more. He offers a rich variety of ways to interact with nature. John Caddy is one of a kind. His unique way of seeing shape and pattern, micro & maximum sizes, fascinates me as much as his sense of humor. World wide he shares his love of nature so all can see through his eyes, and hear his words through his mind: thank you, John! My gratitude is beyond description!

I feel a profound connection to his mission and will be forever grateful for his insights, knowledge, creativity, vision and generosity.  I find the site to be informative (my daughter has referred to it many times for school assignments), welcoming (there are opportunities for anyone to contribute), and spiritually uplifting ("an antidote for environmental despair").  An invaluable resource.  Thank you, John.

He has an eye for the beauty of natural forms, while teaching the connections between all living beings.  Through his eyes we can all have a richer experience.  If you dont have time to smell the roses, you do have time for Morning Earth.
Morning Earth	28844	3	/users/profile/29900	denbob	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	Everyday the photos and poems connect me to nature.  I have learned about birds, plants, insects, mushrooms, grasses, landscapes, trees and human nature and much, much more.   Though I have been a nature lover all of my adult life I have learned to see and understand the world around me in different ways as a result of the Morning Earth photos and poems.   Why life has been greatly enriched and I often share the daily inspiration with a friend.
Morning Earth	28840	5	/users/profile/29899	kathyb	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	Every morning I am greeted with a stunning photo and energizing poem. I wonder how will John show me the wondrous world today?   I have shared many of John's wisdoms with my friends and family. My life is richer because of Morning Earth! And that is the truth.
Morning Earth	28824	4	/users/profile/29884	jhoward	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	John marries the two things that give my life meaning....poetry and nature.  His stunning photos and awesome images, plus his delightful sense of humor and sensitivity  have delighted and inspired me for many years. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that considers John a special friend!  He just plain makes the world a better place. This site deserves support because it's only purpose is to save us all!
Morning Earth	28767	4	/users/profile/29825	rez	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	John Caddy has been working toward this venture for decades, shaping his poetic skills, thinking about the environment, evaluating nature-friendly ways of appreciating and behaving toward the world, and in recent years, polishing his photographic sense. Morning Earth is a daily wake-up call, watchfully presenting science and lore, alerting us to beauty, making connections, developing wisdom, creating community.In short, it epitomizes the role of art in the world.
Morning Earth	28741	10	/users/profile/29795	sapphirine13	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	Morning Earth offers an endless supply of beauty, whimsy, art and poetry. A fair offering to really "see" the innate essence of all things natural. Think you have seen bluechiffon-like ice melting in a pond.....the found brilliance of a honey-colored chanterelle....the coy smile of a sea otter....or the breathtaking sapphirine sky? Morning Earth takes you there like gold at the end of the rainbow.  Eduction and appreciation CAN be an awesome experience.
Morning Earth	28719	4	/users/profile/29766	moniquer	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	I read the morning earth poems every day and use the site for personal research often.  I work with children and keep referring others to this amazing site.  While all other environmental sites seem to be accomplishing nothing, John Caddy's marriage of image and word support my own connection to the earth - thus accomplishing the greatest feat of all.  Just think what would happen if all humans could re-connect to our life-giving planet!
Morning Earth	28717	10	/users/profile/29772	linda6	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	I no longer remember how John Caddy's photos and poems reached me - but am glad they did.  My poetry writing has been enriched by reading his and my days begin with a Caddy "original" healing photo and verse.  I have shared Morning Earth with fellow lovers of good verse, photos and lovers of the Earth. His intuitive sense and deep appreciation of Nature is reflected in his photography that is well partnered with verse. The humor and lessons available by just opening the eyes and heart to the outdoor wonders are the kind of classroom material that this life-long student appreciates.
Morning Earth	28708	7	/users/profile/29754	wallace	Donor	5	02/17/2010	Opening Morning Earth each day has become an essential part of my life. John Caddy sees meaning in every image he photographs, and he voices those meanings in clear, revealing poetry. The intimacy to the natural world in Caddy's photos brings me surprising connections to my earthy relatives. I wish teachers everywhere could bring Morning Earth to their students for joy and  enlightenment.
Morning Earth	28702	7	/users/profile/29748	shawn48	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	Morning Earth is one of the best educational and personal sites I have found.  John Caddy's daily poem is something I read every morning.  It helps me to realize that I am a small part of an amazingly large circle of being.  It makes me a better person.I also use the daily poems and other teaching resources with my fourth grade students.  I have never seen such enthusiasm for writing and love of the earth with any students before I started the "earth" theme with my students.Morning Earth has touched all of us in very important and personal ways.
Morning Earth	28700	3	/users/profile/29745	bioteacher	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	I teach biology to high school students.  The curriculum is based on state standards and is very broad and dense.  When the opportunity presents itself, I feel it is important to add to the life science learning outcomes and work a bit toward attitude outcomes.  When we take a minute or three to look at a picture and poem projected on the screen, many times these inner city students find a calm place in nature that they have never known before.  Sometimes I can see a shift in a students perspective and in the way they interact.  We can also use it as a jumping off place for writing assignments, or as an introduction to a unit.  Morning Earth is a wonderful resource for teaching biology.  For myself, I use it as a chance to take a break from grading and prepping lessons.  When I click on Morning Earth, occasionally it provides a brief period of relaxation and reflection.  I dont have any neurobiological data to prove it, but I truly feel that for an instant, my brain works in a different way.
Morning Earth	28699	3	/users/profile/29744	tsmithmyott	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	The pictures and poetry of John Caddy help me see more deeply into the natural world around us, greatly increasing my appreciation of its diversity and beauty.  This is a consistently excellent source for daily meditation.
Morning Earth	28698	3	/users/profile/29743	heidi3	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	I work in a public library in a small town in NE Iowa.  I have, through my own enjoyment of the daily Morning Earth posts, inspired at least 6 others to subscribe.  But even more fun than that is sharing the posts and photos with library patrons.  I regularly print them off and mount them on colorful background paper and display them in different parts of the library, so people will enjoy them as they are looking for a book or browsing. They are part of my larger mission to bring the outside in, to give equal attention to both the left brain mind and the right side, sensual intelligence we all have but don't consciously nurture.  I enjoy seeing people pause to read the captions and enjoy the photos.
Morning Earth	28696	3	/users/profile/29742	jimfest4	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	In all the busy business of the web, the one daily meditation I ALWAYS open and love to view and read is John Caddy's "Morning Earth."  The photos are striking, the daily poem wise and clear, the facts appended about the natural scene always solid and illuminating.  Of ALL the messages I receive daily, "Morning Earth" is the one I often forward to family and friends, who find it as stunning as I do, like a blessing.James P. Lenfestey
Morning Earth	28689	6	/users/profile/29741	bp104	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	Each day when I open my e-mail, Morning Earth is the first message I read. The photos and poems are inspirational. I've added some of the photos to my screen saver. Each day I forward the message to a colleague in my office. When I discover a particular poem that resonates, I often forward it to our daughters. We are John Caddy fans; his books of poetry line our home bookshelves. Often, John's sharp, imaginative photos and poems are the best part of my day! I'm also friend on John's facebook page. When I was teaching, I often shared the poems with my students and developed creative writing lessons around them. Morning Earth is the best!
Morning Earth	28685	1	/users/profile/29731	jarihb	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	Morning Earth is a reminder that we all are connected and dependent on on the Mother.  It reflects who we are and we see our images in the land and sea.  The images are as we should be and serve as a reminder that, as guardians, the fate of the Mother is in our hands.
Morning Earth	28680		/users/profile/29726	hdorrer	Donor	5	02/17/2010	Beautiful to wake up to; it connects me to nature and I learn something everyday from the delightful poems.  I frequently forward it to friends.
Morning Earth	28679	10	/users/profile/29725	jillrenee	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	Morning Earth communications are like a mini meditation time for me.  The photos that are shared along with the poems are fabulous.  I view the photo and think of what I might write about it.  Then I read the poem from Mr. Caddy and find that I nearly always have to look the photo over again because the poet usually notices things that I have not.  I love Morning Earth!
Morning Earth	28678	3	/users/profile/29724	superiorgem	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	I consider the day I found Morning Earth a truly profound beginning of meeting with those who love and cherish the earth.  The website and each day of Morning Earth photography and verse engenders a reverence for even the smallest and overlooked forms of life.  John Caddy's photography is sensitive and beautiful accompanied with words that convey his deep knowledge and appreciation of the natural world.  I consider him the modern day Aldo Leopold.  Many days I am moved to forward Morning Earth to friends in hopes of giving them just a moment of pause to reflect on some gem of nature we forget exists.  It would be fantastic if the school systems had a way of incorporating the daily Morning Earth into each day as a touchstone for students.
Morning Earth	28675	4	/users/profile/29720	bigcedarlake	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	Ever since a friend sent me a link to the website of Morning Earth, it has lifted my heart every morning with striking images in both words and photographs, taking me places I could not otherwise have visited, showing me aspects of familiar sights that I hadn't noticed, renewing my gratitude for a world of such beauty.  Then I go for a walk in the park, looking for insights of my own.  Food shelves feed the hungry in body.  Morning Earth feeds the soul.  It encourages respect for nature, an appreciation that makes people who come to be fed more likely to serve the world as well as inhabit it.  Nobody could measure the general lift in spirits that John Caddy's free service, a photograph and a poem every week day, contributes to the world, but I know the benefit is substantial. The value  of joy should not be underestimated. Mr. Caddy runs Morning Earth on his own, supported by donations.  He could surely use further financial support.
Morning Earth	28672	7	/users/profile/29715	willr01	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	Reading a poem every day brings out the honesty and passion and goodness in us. Reading a poem about our natural world every day helps us plant our feet and demand that some natural areas be left for our grandchildren. Caddy's poems are of interest to even those who normally wouldn't read poetry, because they speak in terms of relationships we can see through his lens. The photographs are stunning. The poems even more so. If I were a Biology teacher, every class would start with MorningEarth.

The amount of quality content in his website is nothing short of staggering - from resources for educators, to detailed information about ecology, great writing and photography, to nature -focused art.  John's contribution to the world should not be underestimated, nor overlooked.  He deserves a vast audience to appreciate all that he does.Yes, I am one of then featured artist/naturalists on the site, but would have written the same review, if that were not the case.

Morning Earth	28654	6	/users/profile/29697	eric3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2010	Morning Earth expresses one of the most profound truths rediscovered in the post Newtonian era we are now entering and that is that we exist within  interconnected systems and nested subsystems that are all animated by a universal energy  we are on the verge of discovering. Such a world view leads to an understanding of the oneness of nature; no longer nature apart, now to be human is to understand and act with the intention of interdependence and commonality with all manifestations of form and substance. ~EBWuersten~

For his subscribers, each morning opens to a new and  unexpected camera-glimpse of Nature's "back 40" and a poem the scene inspired. His amazing knowledge of the intricacies of life's circling and his gift for connecting outer to inner worlds is a jolt of joy reminding us to really see the Natural world; think about it! It's a feast!
Morning Earth	28652	6	/users/profile/29693	aforbes	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	I count on Morning Earth to start my day. I gaze at the photograph.

I look forward to the daily reminder to pay attention to and be inspired by the world around us. I have used Morning Earth in my college classes and I often forward them to friends and family.

He finds   unique and common images, both and  opens my eyes to really seeing what is around me.  I have had John add friends to his list out of my wish to allow others to enjoy morning earth.  One other thing:  because his work is mostly done in northern areas, he encourages us to see a special beauty in ice and snow -- neither of which, alone, we see as beautiful during a hard winter.

Having been a part of other non-profits in the past, the dedication, energy, and drive the ETI team brings each and every day has far exceeded anything I have ever seen. This non-profit is seeking to achieve a final outcome that is both critical to Tanzania and the region as well as extremely difficult. All of their energies are moving in the right direction, and they are making great strides at seeing their vision through.

ETI does things that matter. Some can hardly believe what ETI, its donors and partners have accomplished together. It is a privilege to have co-founded and now lead an organization that collaborates with others globally who help developing communities in Tanzania and enjoy such rich relationships along the way.

Educate Tanzania	178483	2	/users/profile/235115	Quattro	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	Educate Tanzania is a fantastic organization which is run only by volunteers. 100% of their time is donated, meaning all donations we receive go towards our goal of building an agricultural university in Tanzania. In spite of the volunteer-only organization, the Educate Tanzania team is able to earn accreditation by both Guidestar and the Charities Council Review. It is a well-run organization which is motivated to meet the goals Tanzanians put forth.  Educate Tanzania's goal is the epitome of the old maxim "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, but if you teach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." It is an organization born out of the needs the community of Karagwe, Tanzania which were communicated to Educate Tanzania volunteers on a water resources assessment trip in 2008. 
Educate Tanzania	287379	2	/users/profile/275989	IMJonesCW	Board Member	5	04/27/2016	ETI is an incredible example of vision , dedication, and hard work. I have know about and worked with this organization for 4+ years and am continually amazed at their perserverance and focus bringing water, nutrition, health and education to those regions of the world that need it, specifically Tanzania. Having accomplished these goals in their initial project at Karagwe University College (KARUCO), ETI is now looking to the future and their next mission. Their critical thinking with a focus on the future and how to improve, develop meaningful efficiencies, and grow their impact is inspirational to any non-profit and most for-profit organisations!

Educate Tanzania	212891	4	/users/profile/275989	IMJonesCW	Donor	5	08/31/2014	When I first learned of ETI knew it was destined for success - Jan Hansen was involved! A year or so later I was in a position of gifting funds on behalf of my mother who's specific instructions were that any gift must be a 'game changer'. When she heard about what Jan, Steve and others were doing with KARUCO her decision didn't take long; "let's do it", she said.Knowing what I do about how ETI has been faithful to their mission, and how much energy, enthusiasm, and perseverance they all put into the success of the venture gives me great confidence my mother's gifts have, indeed, been game changers. To create a quality educational institution by overcoming innumerable obstacles, cultural differences, and to do so from thousands of miles away is both inspirational and miraculous. The ability of Jan, Steve and many others to draw upon current relationships and to forge new ones to make things happen and get things done is worthy of a grad school course! It's easy to see how a passion for education, compassion for human beings, and a focused dedication to purpose has unquestionably made a positive impact in Karagwe.

It was neat to pay a personal visit to the region and see first-hand the exemplary work being done at the construction site and the passion and belief of the people of the region who give of their limited resources to build an education dream for their children.

My most compelling vision is to help the Tanzanians help themselves by introducing a university curriculum that teaches not only how to grow crops but how to develop supply chain and hence business by growing the crops that are needed to build a vibrant agricultural economy. One of the best features of ETI is that we access professionals who are competent in their specific field and then leverage that expertise to on-the-ground assistance.

Educate Tanzania	226250	1	/users/profile/289988	rmv7	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Having interned for ETI, I've found that the people involved in this nonprofit are passionate and tireless. I've been consistently blown away by the time and care put into every endeavor and have witnessed firsthand the speed at which ETI is able to accomplish its goals--which is impressive considering how young it is. I can confidently say that any donated funds or time are put to good use, and I've loved seeing the tangible results of people's generosity.
Educate Tanzania	253897	1	/users/profile/342159	Johnstone	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/24/2015	I came to know the folks at Educate Tanzania about a year ago through connections with my colleagues. I have been consistently impressed with their dedication and sensitivity to learning and improving livelihoods. While non-profits can sometimes be overly focused on their public image, Educate Tanzania has led a very quiet campaign to build, staff, and support a university in an under-served area of Tanzania. They have taken every step carefully, and moved forward with local guidance and support. Kudos to Educate Tanzania!
Educate Tanzania	225822	5	/users/profile/289574	sarahcohn,	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I have been working with Educate Tanzania for the past two years, and I am continually shocked by how much they achieve with such a small budget and a small staff. Having been a part of other non-profits in the past, the dedication, energy, and drive the ETI team brings each and every day has far exceeded anything I have ever seen. This non-profit is seeking to achieve a final outcome that is both critical to Tanzania and the region as well as extremely difficult. All of their energies are moving in the right direction, and they are making great strides at seeing their vision through. The leadership, thoughtfulness, and detailed plan are all working to make the Karagwe University College a reality.
Educate Tanzania	253506	1	/users/profile/341714	Char S.	Volunteer	5	08/20/2015	I am so proud to be a volunteer for Educate Tanzania. I am a math teacher in northern Minnesota so I am well aware of the effect a good education has on the lives of young people. We are so privileged to have this opportunity to help the youth of Tanzania have higher education in their own back yard. I love to hear the stories of the people in these communities who long for more education opportunities and then hear the progress of this university which will be opening October, 2016. To be a part of ETI is an amazing  feeling!
Educate Tanzania	234117	2	/users/profile/298221	JungleJody	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/20/2014	A truly grounded, thoughtful, intelligent group seeking to better the lives of so many in Tanzania. I have had the honor and privilege of "working" with Jan and some of the esteemed associates with logistical projects. Everyone has such a giving and humble heart -- the core foundation asset to any charity. Look for big things from all of the work ETI is doing!!
Educate Tanzania	232348	2	/users/profile/295882	BAHMN	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	I couldn't be more proud and honored to be associated with Educate Tanzania. We are a grassroots organization, working hand in hand with the local community in Tanzania, to help increase educational opportunities that will transform lives.  I hope you are inspired by our mission to help the people of Karagwe help themselves. 
Educate Tanzania	232238	1	/users/profile/295783	GBRH	Board Member	4	10/31/2014	I was drawn to the mission of this organization and the opportunity to share my experience from working with other non-profits. The leadership of this organization is vested in providing service and support to partners in Tanzania, including the infrastructure that will be required to support Karagwe University and the greater community that will support it. Educate Tanzania is doing remarkable things, through efficient use of limited funding, with partners in Tanzania. It is a non-profit that has tremendous growth opportunity, and strategic focus to help fully realize that growth and subsequent impact on its ability to deliver against its mission. 
Educate Tanzania	225037	2	/users/profile/288809	JohnWade	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2014	After visiting the construction sites at KARUCO and meeting with the Tanzanian partners, I am excited to see the progress and transformation that is taking place in Karagwe! Living in Tanzania this past year as the in-country representative for MSAADA Architects (a partner with Educate Tanzania) I've been involved with design and construction projects in varying capacities with different partners. It is refreshing to see how ETI approaches the challenge of constructing a university in the relatively remote area of Karagwe. ETI seems to have struck the right balance between foreign and local involvement. With input from ETI and their Tanzanian partners, MSAADA was able to offer designs for KARUCO which have been used for construction by local contractors, using local labor, and readily available materials. It is clear that the people involved with the actual construction of the buildings take great pride in their work. I imagine this is because someday their neighbors, friends, and family might receive their education in these buildings. This approach to construction that ETI is fostering at KARUCO is a model worth replicating.  With the support of Educate Tanzania, KARUCO is making a lasting and positive impact on the community and region! - John Wade
Educate Tanzania	224269	2	/users/profile/288012	melbreed	Donor	5	10/19/2014	When we first went to Karagwe Tanzania in 2003 on a mission trip, we were totally inspired by the people and their dedication to the education of their youth, to help lift them from poverty and create a better life for people in the region.  Then along came Jan and Steve Hansen from Chaska, MN, who shared a vision with Bishop Benson Bagonza of the Lutheran Church in Karagwe, Tanzania, to build a college.  A university for this remote rural region of the country, to offer a curriculum of agriculture, business, health care, and much more.  We know for a fact that the funds raised by Educate Tanzania go directly to the KARUCO college for classrooms, dormitories, student assistance and for faculty support and training.  Educate Tanzania is instrumental in bringing collaboration with the University of St. Thomas and the University of Minnesota to provide excellent resources for the faculty of KARUCO.  We are totally impressed with the Educate Tanzania organization, their mission, goals, and integrity.  We have the greatest confidence that our charitable donations to Educate Tanzania are having a most successful direct impact on the education and economic development in Karagwe, TZ.

Educate Tanzania	223327	2	/users/profile/287078	Lynn86	Donor	5	10/16/2014	Educate Tanzania is everything it needs to be.   Educate Tanzania involves local Tanzanian partners and global partners who work along side non-profit leadership to enhance the vision, expertise and resources for building KARUCO.  Educate Tanzania prioritizes involving  farmers and women (who are often left out of the picture) to help make valid cultural decisions for Agri-business in their communities. Progress seems almost miraculous as they offer Education and Agri-business to a people they have an undying passion for. Educate Tanzania has very impressive, committed leadership in Steve and Dr. Jan Hansen who work tirelessly to not only promote their vision, but are actually on the ground involved and committed to seeing vision become reality.   
Educate Tanzania	222739	2	/users/profile/286480	curtlarson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	I am technically not a professional because I am retired and donate my time.  However, I organized an ecumenical group of churches in River Falls, WI and have, since 2002, led the building of homes and a school in Haiti, so I am very familiar with this kind of project..  I and our church, Ezekiel Lutheran, have been donors to Educate Tanzania since its inception and are very familiar with their work.  Because I lead a similar project and have attended several  of Educate Tanzania's annual fund raising banquets, I feel very qualified to evaluate their organization and progress.  Their people are of the highest integrity, they have a fabulous rapport with the Tanzanians whom they serve, and their project is moving along efficiently and solidly.  They have my highest respect and recommendation without reserve.

EVS is an civil and energy engineering firm in Minnesota.I believe that ETI will make a huge differenc to many people in Tanzania by educating local people there. Only Education will have any lasting impact to the people. I expereinced the benefits of education in South Korea where I was able to get a good education thru help from US Universities after the Korean War. I owe my success as a CEO of EVS to my early education in Korea. ETI will help many young people to learn and contribute to the next generation.

Educate Tanzania	215299	3	/users/profile/278693	Vision_Bagonza	Volunteer	5	09/16/2014	My name is Vision Bagonza, and I'm 20 years old. I was born in the land of the heart of this project-Karagwe, Tanzania, so I am a first hand witness of all that's been going on there. The work that Educate Tanzania does has already brought hope to people. While I was a teacher/volunteer in Karagwe, parents would ask about what will soon be their very own university. Education is indeed the key to liberation, and I am touched that Educate Tanzania not only is concerned about what they bring to Karagwe, but all that Karagwe can share with the world. I love volunteering with this organisation because of how dedicated and committed they are. There is indeed great success here!
Educate Tanzania	212406		/users/profile/275405	stlay	Donor	5	08/27/2014	Educate Tanzania is a great organization. I have seen it grow from a vision of one person into an organization that is positively impacting many people. It has been a pleasure to see it continue to gain momentum and further serve those in need to provide educational opportunities to those that would not be able to otherwise realize their dream. -Steve Lay 
Educate Tanzania	212354	1	/users/profile/275356	welmer	Volunteer	5	08/26/2014	Educate Tanzania has a vision for building something very meaningful and long lasting in Tanzania.  I am impressed with this vision, and with the dedication that Jan and Steve Hansen have shown in articulating this vision and bringing others onto the team to help.  It seems clear to me that this is a "real world" project, built not only on good intentions but also on a sound base of a well thought out financial and cultural understanding that I believe will work.  This is absolutely an organization that will be successful and will produce the expected results in improving health and education in the neediest part of the world.  
Educate Tanzania	211795	1	/users/profile/274737	BrentB	Donor	5	08/22/2014	Dr. Jan Hansen and her husband Steve have what every nonprofit should aspire to have:  dedicated leadership, long-term vision, hands-on interaction, realistic goals and an innate ability to direct their infectious passion not just to the community they're helping grow, but with the entire support network that is necessary to see Educate Tanzania realize all of it's goals.  I am a proud supporter!
Educate Tanzania	186150	1	/users/profile/243131	hardlyneutral	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	I was introduced to Educate Tanzania several years ago during a non-profit event. I was immediately struck by both the passion and expertise harnessed by ETI. They have assembled a group of individuals who not only care deeply for their cause, but who also bring a vast array of skills to their efforts. Dr. Jan Hansen is the type of leader who has an eye for talent and a personal commitment to excellence in all endeavors. I have very much enjoyed ETI's growing success and the positive impact they are having in the lives of some very wonderful people.
Educate Tanzania	185837	1	/users/profile/242809	sellcrew4	Advisor	5	10/30/2013	Now and then you find a non-for-profit organization that has taken time to gather all the collective wisdom available before stepping out to tackle a problem and the result is special indeed.  Educate Tanzania, with Dr. Jan Hansen at the helm, is an example of such thoughtful and deliberate strategy and the people of Karagwe, Tanzania, as well as all of us who stand on the sidelines and cheer, are amazingly blessed to see what is unfolding. ETI exists because one person saw a need and felt a strong call to respond and use her gifts to create a solution.  The university being built is "owned" by the people of Karagwe, by the Tanzania government, by African church organizations and local specialists in agriculture and education.  Expert agriculturists from the University of MN as well as EARTH University in Costa Rica partner to advise and develop systems and curriculum that fully take into account the unique environmental conditions of Tanzania .   From top to bottom, ETI targets every penny to achieve successful outcomes.  This is the type of NGO we all love to give to - with a BARE (very bare) minimum of administrative and marketing  expenses, the full impact of our gifts go to make positive change for the women of Tanzania and ultimately the entire country.

Educate Tanzania	185327	1	/users/profile/242286	raelsospeter	Client Served	5	10/30/2013	I first met Dr. Jan Hansen, the President of Education Tanzania on 2003 at Karagwe Secondary School where I teach. Her keen listening to people impressed me. Through listening she understood the basic needs of the people and build the vision of Educate Tanzania. This vision which leads to community development became more clear to me on 2007 when I joined the committee for establishing the Karagwe University College. I realized that Educate Tanzania is doing a great job  for the Tanzanian community particularly Karagwe which is located at the rural areas and facing various challenges including lack of skilled personnel,  education, health care, and many others. With Educate Tanzania and its vision we have a great hope that there is future for women liberation and for community development. 
Educate Tanzania	185057	1	/users/profile/241998	kakulima	Client Served	5	10/30/2013	I was born and raised in rural areas of Karagwe in Tanzania. I come from a big family but among of the few children to pursue further education. My brothers and sisters are among of the unprivileged children who missed the opportunity of education.  With ETI in Karagwe, I believe God has heard the cry of the people of Karagwe. I have a great hope with ETI. Long live ETI. Welcome to Karagwe. 
Educate Tanzania	184080	1	/users/profile/241020	hjustme92	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I have been on the Board of Directors since this project began. We are a small organization but so very well connected with partners that really bring our funds to action at the site in Karagwe. We have engaged and committed folk on-site that manage the funds and supervise/direct the construction of buildings and have a skilled and effective team that has developed the curriculum for the courses to be taught. The local government has also endorsed the University which is to say all the right people are supporting this effort. It has been a privilege to be a part and see our plan come to fruition. It is gratifying to get the feed back from the people of Karagew who are so very excited as they see the progress which for them builds hope. Hope that they will be able to have resources to improve their lives.

The people of the region have been working towards this goal for some time now and it has been exciting to watch Educate Tanzania come along side the people of Karagwe, Tanzania and assist in making their vision a reality.  There has been money raised but even more than that, the organization has leveraged many talented people and organizations to donate their expertise that  has a value beyond words or money.  I plan to stay connected to this organization for a long time to come and look forward to seeing all that is achieved through the hard work and dedication of the board, officers, volunteers, partners and donors of this one of a kind, world class non-profit organization.
Educate Tanzania	183784	1	/users/profile/240686	jfenske	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I recently found out that the people of the Karagwe region, where their world class University (KARUCO) will be located raised over $50,000 (USD) for this University. When representatives from ETI went to Karagwe the Tanzanians themselves had a business plan for KARUCO. Tanzanians then asked ETI how they can help make KARUCO a reality. This dedication really shows that the Tanzanians value and WANT this University. Working in the Education field, I understand and value education and am thrilled to see the region on Karagwe have the same opportunity.

Educate Tanzania	183253	2	/users/profile/240164	chaskaherm	Board Member	5	10/28/2013	Educate Tanzania has laser focus on the end game for the people of Karagwe, Tanzania -- an agricultural college that moves the people from subsistence farming (hand to mouth) to the development of an expanding agricultural economy which will raise the living standards of millions of impoverished people.  If you want to make a difference, you can make a HUGE difference by working with and helping this organization.  Best of all, the work of ETI is driven and directed by the people of Karagwe.  ETI provides money and expertise in our role as a benefactor to that community.  This vision is Tanzania's vision and we are helping to make it happen.

More than anyone, I can relate to the people of Karagwe because their story is also mine.The story of young people in the quest of knowledge and a better future.Educate Tanzania enables this young generation to dream again and also to make their dream come true through education.Jan is an experienced educator who spent her rich career in the amphitheaters of a handful of well renowned universities in America.I have been serving in the board of ETI for a little while and I couldn't be more fulfilled because I really feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself.
Educate Tanzania	180842	1	/users/profile/237551	Jessjohn	Donor	5	10/22/2013	I became aware of Educate Tanzania's work through my boyfriend who met Jan at the University of Saint Thomas. The organization's dedication to serving those without access to life-changing educational opportunities is inspiring. During the annual fundraising event this year, I learned about some of the various obstacles and barriers that stand in the way of providing education to those who need it most.   Despite these challenges, EDI continues to prosper and grow, in turn, helping thousands of people.   The founders are devoted disciples who work both in country and state-side to build the infrastructure necessary to implement EDI's mission.   The dedication and ambition of this organization is one of a kind! 
Educate Tanzania	151804	1	/users/profile/202700	bridgetwall	Donor	5	03/28/2013	I found out about Educate Tanzania through my mom, who knows one of the founders, Jan Hansen.  She speaks passionately about the work they do and the impact that is possible with the resources they have acquired through fundraising and other partnerships.  While I haven't been able to attend any of the sponsored events, I always hear how things are going, and things seem to moving quickly!  As someone with many friends who have gone through various Peace Corps programs in Africa, I've heard a good deal about the difficulty in getting things done efficiently and quickly - and what impresses me most about Educate Tanzania is their partnerships with the local community.  I have faith that these relationships will sustain this project long into the future.

Great work is being done with after school programs that help families succeed. Large complexes often have a variety of safety needs that require flexibility with and knowledge of multi-cultural issues on site.  Opportunity Neighborhood has developed a one of a kind program to address many of these issues call "Courtesy" which daily places a caring adult where difficult circumstances exist. I have been continually impressed with the staff's ability to adapt and implement effective solutions on these large properties.
Opportunity Neighborhood	130855		/users/profile/176360	tjschirber	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	I got involved at the genesis of Opportunity Neighborhood about 10 years ago. I watched as Perry Lofquist came aboard and assembled a collaborative community effort. There are a variety of great community organizations that are committed to families and kids and each sees great value in working directly with Opportunity Neighborhood. I know very few organizations that are as innovative as this one is. And very few organizations can effectively build a network of safeguards and programs along with other organizations who care about families in large housing communities. In my view Opportunity Neighborhood has been able to step back and let other succeed for the sake of families. While doing that the great staff and board has become effective and successful in fostering its mission.

It was an amazing learning experience for me. The staff are very supportive of each other, especially my supervisor Kacee Moua. I was also using my work hours at ON for hours in my internship as  a Recreation, Parks and Leisure Studies major. Although, it wasn't structured to be an internship, Kacee offered to help me as much as possible. The overall program was great for teens and kids. As the programmer, I had to meet certain requirements such as covering certain learning and beneficial topics each month.  We also followed the YPQA so that we had a quality-program. Each child and teen was offered a full meal so that they wouldn't go home hungry. This made Opportunity Neighborhood a home for a lot of teens and kids. I am happy to say I was once part of this organization.

Children and the adults in their lives love to gather in the mornings to read, work, play and prepare food to share with each other.Much of our success is thanks to the great people that run the center, specially Kacee Moua, Resident Services Coordinator. The staff is always kind and welcoming, the facilities are clean and beautiful and Kacee is amazingly helpful with planning, setting up, assisting the families and cleaning after the event.Families around the neighborhood come together and strengthen their bonds as they learn about early childhood and find support in this program sponsored by the Montessori Center of Minnesota.Thanks Opportunity Neighborhood!

Opportunity Neighborhood	252574		/users/profile/340655	jontae.koonkaew	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/11/2015	I had the opportunity to work with this group at our anti-bullying summit and it was phenomenal.  Their staff and students were huge in the success of the summit.  They helped with transitions as well as facilitation of the activities that the summit had to offer.  They were energetic and out-going which really laid the foundation for the summit and the expectations for the participants.  I think they were very important on what we wanted from the summit and to be more specific raised my expectations of what this could be in the future.  The kids were open and honest and I think they allowed it to be a more intimate space for all.  I would like to say that Kacee was also very important to the summit.  She was like and extra arm with all the help she provided.  I would have to say that she was very genuine about her intentions and what makes that so great is that we (as staff) fed off her energy.

He planned to host a meal 2 times per month at each site.  I was thrilled to have our Nutrition Education program be invited to partner with Opportunity Neighborhood on this project.  The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program has been  working with limited income families for over 40 years teaching how to make healthy, home cooked  meals that are tasty, easy and low cost.  The staff at both sites have been extremely  helpful and supportive in working with our staff.  We now have several adult learners at each site that are participating in a series of nutrition classes.

I know that they are really good with responding to complaints from residents that are having issues and they make sure they are walking our property so that there is no junk going on in the parking lots or our buildings. I feel so much at ease with courtesy on our property.

Even though I am just coming to understand to this essential work and the ON team, it is apparent that the good people dedicated to this nonprofit are working hard to create a safe environment for low-income families and vulnerable youth to live and learn. The work of Opportunity Neighborhood and their partners is clearly an asset to the community and families served in their homes.
Opportunity Neighborhood	168398		/users/profile/223290	vernrice2000	Volunteer	4	09/08/2013	The part of Opportunity Neighborhood that I have experienced is Garden View Apartments in New Brighton. I have been to their Neighborhood Night Out the last two years and have found it to be well organized and very effective  at reaching out to its residents, people of all cultures and ages.  I am a member of Christ the King Lutheran Church just up the street from Garden View. We have invited their residents to our Block Party for the past several years. The office has been very responsive to allowing our invitation to be shared with their residents. Our Block party is not a heavily religious but more a "Thank You For Being Our Neighbor" event. We have free food and lots of activities, multicultural music and dancing., etc. In the last two years the event has attracted more than fourteen hundred  people. A good part of response has come from the neighborhood including Garden View apartments. We also welcome to our church and after-school program called Community Partners in Youth. Many Garden View youth come to this program. We have found Garden View a great partner in serving our community.
Opportunity Neighborhood	161266		/users/profile/213834	mmstevens7	Donor	5	06/23/2013	Three or four years ago I decided that in addition to making donations to my church I wanted to start donating to a nonprofit organization.  When I found out about the many services Opportunity Neighborhood has to offer, I knew this was the organization I wanted my money to go to.  I'm so pleased with the many services they offer to adults and children.  I'm grateful for the monthly newsletter which keeps me up-to-date on the events and services for the residents.  The pictures of the children at their events are especially fun to see.

She helps keep kids away from the dangers of gangs and drugs and helps guide kids to strive to do well at school, athletics, or any other postive activities.  It has been wonderful to see the work Lisa does with a part of the St.Paul community.
Opportunity Neighborhood	159761		/users/profile/211942	KReynolds1220	Donor	5	06/06/2013	Opportunity Neighborhood has developed into an incredible neighborhood asset by providing a safe place to live for low-income families in addition to offering much needed services, support and stability.  Our foundation has been a supporter since 2005, and each year we see great additions to programming and better than expected results for tenant stability, adult success stories and activities and achievements for children.  The Ames Lake Neighborhood, at one time, was a very tough area in Saint Paul, one that was full of crime, drugs  and violence.  Since Opportunity Neighborhood moved in, the apartments and neighborhood have been transformed into a success story of its own.   Perry Loftquist has led a great team of dedicated professionals that  work with local schools, police departments, agencies and organiztions to provide residents with resources that help them lead productive and stable lives and provide their children with a stable environment full of opportunities for enrichment, learning and fun--all with a sense of community and pride.  I am always impressed with the connections ON has made and the results they achieve.  The Ames Lake Neighborhood is a great example of what stability and the right opportunities can do for families, and we are pleased to be among Opportunity Neighorhood's supporters.

They provide youth intervention services (mentoring, counseling, education, school help, etc.) with youth and families in low income housing situations. This is a great way to reach our most at-risk youth...keeping them at home, in school and out of the costly juvenile justice system. We need more youth intervention programs like this one!

Opportunity Neighborhood	132533		/users/profile/178179	Suew	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	Several years back, I was looking to get involved in supporting a nonprofit.  When presented with the opportunity to work with Opportunity Neighborhood, I took it because I liked it's focus on foundational elements of safety, education and community building.  All things that any of us want, regardless of where we live.  I like how Opportunity Neighborhood brings these programs directly to the tenants and helps them learn what resources are available to bring stability and happiness to individuals, children and families.  Perry, Kris, the program coordinators and courtesy officers work tirelessly with the building managers, local law enforcement, school districts and community resources to bring programs and services to the tenants.  I am confident that these services increase resident's satisfaction.
Opportunity Neighborhood	131035		/users/profile/176568	sloe19	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	Ames Lake Opportunity Neighborhood is truly an inspiring organization. PAL (The St. Paul Police Department Police Activities League) has partnered and worked with the youth, and staff members from Ames Lake for about two years now and Ames Lake Opportunity Neighborhood has shown nothing but commitment, dedication, and compassion for the youth and residents who reside there. The youth programs offered to the at-risk youth living in this development has had an enormous impact on the children's lives. I have personally seen the transformation in kids who enroll in the programs, never coming to program before, from a delinquent, rough around the edges child, to developing into a mature, responsible, caring and empathetic young adult. Ames Lake knows how to touch these youth with the core values it takes to encourage them to becoming successful, productive members of society. Without Ames Lake Opportunity Neighborhood, a lot of these youth members would get lost to the street life of violence, gangs and crime.

Opportunity Neighborhood	125477		/users/profile/170678	RJ235	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2012	Who says crime and poverty have to go hand in hand! I have been a police officer in the city of St Paul for many years working in the Ames Lake area. For years and years, the Ames Lake Neighborhood was one of the worst places to live or in my case, to work. Drugs being sold on school bus stops and gang violence were all too common. Crime ran ramped and as kids had no safe environment to live or play, fell prey to that crime infested neighborhood as victims and, in too many cases, crime suspects. A few years ago, Opportunity Neighborhood began working with the owners and management of the property at Ames Lake and have literally transformed that neighborhood into one where you see almost no crime or problems seen in years past. They have done this by providing quality after school programming such as home work help, boy scouts, girl scouts, teen leadership groups and several others. The also provide adult services such as computer labs for job skill building. Opportunity Neighborhoods work in this community has been priceless

Writers of all ages (kids to seniors), experience (new comers to published authors), and interests (children's lit, memoir, sci-fi, non-fiction) find a home at The Loft.  Twelve years ago, I signed up for my first Loft class.  I learned about craft and met other aspiring authors - one of whom has become a best friend. And now, I have two books being published. Couldn't have done it without The Loft.
Loft, Inc.	253781		/users/profile/342024	Kassandra	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/23/2015	There is nothing quite like the experience of stepping into The Loft. Whether you have arrived to take advantage of the charming writing studio spaces, to take a class or simply to chat with other writers in the cafe, you are immediately greeted with a welcoming and inspiring environment. In addition, the capable and friendly staff gives you the impression that they truly want you to succeed at whatever tasks your passions have inspired you to take on. The number of classes, writer groups, conferences, small groups and other opportunities that this organization offers is unparalleled in this area of the country. I only take precious time out of my life to write reviews that are worthy of that time... I am proud to take the time to speak to the heart of this particular organization and to urge others to give it their support.

One resulted in grant funding from the local arts council, and the other helped me place a poem for publication in a journal. Because of my income level, I've also received scholarships to help pay for classes.

Loft, Inc.	218142		/users/profile/177519	dtrump	Client Served	5	09/29/2014	I owe my later-in-life writing career to the Loft. I was a person with a dream: a dream to write and publish fiction. The Loft provided superb instruction (from a host of talented and generous writers), programming, mentorships and grant opportunities. I've seen other beginning writers struggle in many settings and many ways, and I am certain I could not have developed and advanced my writing career the way I have without the help of the Loft. This is the sequence of events, all Loft-mediated, which has brought me to a Spring 2014 short story publication in the literary magazine "Ploughshares," and collaboration on two novels-in-progress with a New York literary agency:1. 2005 to present: Took classes offered at the Loft, from "Writing for the Absolute Beginner" (Fall, 2005) to a workshop with the esteemed Janet Burroway (Summer, 2014);2. 2007-2008: Awarded Loft Emerging Writer Mentorship in Fiction; absolutely jump-started my fledgling fiction-writing career; 3. 2009 to present: Proposed and taught classes in beginning fiction writing at the Loft;4. Awarded 2012-2013 Loft MN Emerging Writer Grant; used money for an online mentorship though the Loft;5. Spring, 2014: Developed a website with the help of former Loft fellow-students and instructors, and started writing a blog. Please see one of my earliest posts, "Postcards From the Margins: Why I Love the Loft," April 21, 2014, http://www.donnatrump.org/page/5/ (scroll down to 4/21 entry). I am grateful, every day, for the resources provided and the opportunities made possible by the Loft.
Loft, Inc.	131919	1	/users/profile/177519	dtrump	Client Served	5	10/31/2012	When I was 48 years old I decided it was "now or never" to try my hand at fiction writing.  I took my first class at the Loft in September 2005--"Writing for Absolute Beginners," taught by Jorie Miller.  Jorie said many encouraging things to all of her students, but it was her comment that my story-writing was "strong" that motivated me to keep going.  In 2007-2008, I was awarded a Loft Emerging Writer Mentorship, during which time I had the unmatched pleasure of working with Sandy Benitez and Peter Ho Davies on an idea for a novel.  Since that mentorship, I've published stories, essays and poems in a variety of journals.  Now I'm working with Patricia Weaver Francisco in an online Loft mentorship, paid for by another Loft contest, the MN Emerging Writer grant, which I won this year.  And that novel?  Well, these things take time, but I've got an agent and 2013 sounds like a great year for a debut.  None of any of this would have happened without the excellent teaching and remarkable guidance of many fine and talented people at the Loft Writing Center in Minneapolis.

It is constantly building and supporting the literary community in the Twin Cities. From their blog to their classes they do good work, offer quality products, and bring joy to the world.

Loft, Inc.	162007		/users/profile/214928	hschwitzer	Donor	5	07/03/2013	I have been a member of The Loft Literary Center for over two years. I currently work in communications and have also worked in PR and advertising. The resources, networking opportunities, classes, and venue itself consistently impress me. I have truly enjoyed being able to support such an organization.  I have also just loved the fact that the classes ACTUALLY help my writing!! It's hard to find good writing classes for people who work in communications and have studied writing in school. I've taken some other writing classes at other places, and they helped a little, but not even close to what The Loft has provided me. I really appreciate the expertise held by the class instructors. It is impressive. I have also greatly appreciated that the instructors have pursued writing professionally so I felt their advice and lessons were credible (at least the instructors I've had were writers) and also made themselves available to the students during and after the class. The classes have also provided wonderful networking opportunities with other writers.  Lastly, I have found The Loft to be just a great community of writers. It's hard to find such a large community of talented writers, and I believe The Loft makes that available.  So, needless to say, I am a fan of The Loft...and yes, I proudly sport my tote bag. :)

When I looked at creative writing programs for my undergraduate and graduate degrees,   I just could not financially justify pursuing the programs because I realized creative writing is very competitive and rarely pays well.   So I made sure to pursue degree programs  that lead to steady employment  and  I developed the philosophy that you really do not need any kind of class to be a writer.  You just need to make the regular habit of reading and writing.    I still hold this philosophy that these are the habits that make someone a writer,  but I also realized to be a great writer that I needed to have a teacher to guide me into directions I may not have thought about and that I needed a community that provided me with constructive criticism and support.   I have been a writer my whole life,  but taking classes at the Literary Loft make me a better writer.   My teachers there have provided me with literature that expands my horizons and feedback on my writing that I really value! While I have found that the classes  that meet my needs best are not cheap,  the Literary Loft has options to make this affordable.   I took one class on a scholarship.  I qualified for low income pricing when I started taking classes at the Literary Loft.    The regular habit of taking classes at the Literary Loft are priceless because there are many other things that capture my attention around the Twin Cities. The space and the community that the Literary Loft provides me gives me a chance to make my writing a priority and to continue a life long journey into growth as a writer.
Loft, Inc.	162000		/users/profile/214921	Judy Kirk	Client Served	5	07/03/2013	I retired from a career in advertising as a writer and Creative Director. I was use to a busy and demanding schedule and wondered what I would do with myself in retirement. I volunteered, I did some free lance .... and then I remembered the Loft. I had taken a few classes at the Loft over the many years I lived in the Twin Cities and I decided this might be the key to my sanity! And it was. For the past seven years, I've been a student ... of all things ... in poetry. But the real challenge and beginning of another passion came after a class with Linda Back McKay called  "Writing your own chapbook." It was the first class of its kind at the Loft and in 2007 I self-published "Eclipsing the Gray." It was the best thing I have ever done for  myself. Since that time, I continued to take classes and with Linda's expert eye to help with editing and placement, I have self published two more books and also published a book called, "The Poetry of Prayer" for my church, with poems written by the congregation. It was sold as a fund raising project. I've had poems published in various periodicals and sold dozens of my books. And this past school year, in a 5th grade class where I volunteer, I helped the children put together a chapbook as a memory of their last year in grade school. What fun! At 75, I'm proud of myself and the work I do. The teachers at the Loft are outstanding. The Loft is outstanding! And I could not have survived retirement without them. They keep my brain stimulated and my self-esteem strong.  What an organization!
Loft, Inc.	161765		/users/profile/214560	Ali23	Client Served	5	06/29/2013	I attended a beginning writers' session that was conducted as a joint effort between The Loft and Hennepin County Library. Through this partnership, The Loft brings talented instructors to small community libraries. There, they teach classes in places people might not otherwise have access to such opportunities. The session I attended was free, and it was really beneficial. The instructor led us in a series of writing and brainstorming exercises in manner that felt safe and nonthreatening. For the first time in a long time, I read aloud to strangers words I had written. That was a pretty big step for me. I left feeling empowered and motivated to pursue my dreams of fiction writing. 
Loft, Inc.	161685		/users/profile/214471	Kris14	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2013	The Loft Literary Center has been a cornerstone of the vibrant literary community in the Twin Cities for many years.  They offer classes on a sliding fee scale that serve writers of every age and experience level, they sponsor readings and events that feature local, national, and international writers of all genres, aesthetics, and backgrounds.  They also sponsor grants for writers, and their groundbreaking Mentor Series, which pairs emerging writers with established writers for intensive study.  I have attended and presented at conferences sponsored by the Loft, readings held at the Loft, and meetings of literary community leaders hosted at The Loft.  Its mission, staff, and space are unrivaled anywhere in the Midwest.
Loft, Inc.	161037		/users/profile/213502	Sandra E.	General Member of the Public	5	06/19/2013	Minnesota is not flyover land in the publishing world thanks in part to The Loft. To walk into the Open Book, where the Loft is housed along with the Minnesota Center for the Book Arts and Milkweed Press, is to enter the real world of writing--at least as real as it gets. Taking classes is easy with sliding scale fees and member prices, great instructors and fellow students who want to take a part of their day, a part of their lives and discover ways to be better writers of poetry and of prose, of plays and of mysteries, of children's books and young adult novels. If you would rather just support writers, amazing readings are going on constantly both from local authors and from nationally known authors and of course often those two are the same. The Loft has an amazing library of literary journals, they have office space to rent and finish that novel, they have the Loft Mentor Series to foster emerging talent.  
Loft, Inc.	161030		/users/profile/213492	ewrMN	Client Served	5	06/19/2013	I can't believe more people don't know about this organization!! I only recently realized (five years out of college) that I really love creative writing, so when I decided I wanted to take continuing education courses in it, I ended up doing so through a variety of institutions, including notable universities. So I have more than my fair share of places with which to compare it. Not only does the Loft offer high-quality writing classes, but it does so at a remarkably (or should I say ridiculously?) low rate and with an astounding array of subjects. You could take a course that lasts several months or you could come in for a one-time class on the one weekend you have available. You could take classes online or you could take them in-person. There's also the fact that the Loft then offers all kinds of other opportunities for writers, like contests and awards, free readings, publicity, networking events...seriously, the list goes on. Sometimes it feels like everyone (and their mom) is a wannabe-writer, but writers are still part of an underserved community. So, truthfully, I cannot say enough good things about this place. They help writers. As simple as that.

I've tucked myself into quiet corners to write.  I've sat through readings by local and nationally known writers.  This year I've been chosen as a mentee for an emerging writers competition.  (Jarod Santek is the logistical genius that handles the support on many levels.) Through the mentor program I'll work with local and national writing mentors, receive reading and conference information, grant writing advice, and more.  Not only do I feel validated to continue to work with words, I'm filled with a gratitude that makes me want to return the generosity.    The Loft doesn't just train and empower writers, it must certainly create mentors. I don't think it's overstating to say The Loft is the reason Minnesota has such thriving and giving literary community.  If you believe James Baldwin that, You write in order to change the world ... than it's fair to say the Loft is changing my life and countless others.

Personally, each time I participate at the Loft, I leave feeling more competent, more confident, and more courageous.  I encourage all who like to read and those who are driven to write or even just curious about doing so to visit the Loft; to participate in activities there; to open up to the community that it nurtures; and to share it with others.

I wanted to be a writer from the time I was five, but once I graduated from college, I abandoned that because I thought I could never make it financially.  When I had my first child and decided to stay home, I realized that that was the moment to try my hand at writing.  I took a few classes at the Loft and continued to work on my writing. When my child was old enough to go school, I was reviewing law school applications when the phone rang. It was like something from a movie -- I was told by a Loft administrator that I had won an award that allowed me to study for one year with 6 nationally-renowned authors (The Loft Mentor Series).  During that year, I wrote my first novel, SPLIT. I revised it the following year and it sold at auction in three weeks and has received a number of honors and awards.  My career path really started at the Loft.  The Loft was also the first place that provided me the opportunity to teach creative writing and I am now a professor of creative writing. It is an exceptional organization and I consider it one of the most important factor in why Minneapolis is a center for the literary arts and why I am a writer.

Now, having moved to Pennsylvania, Im lucky to still be tied to the Loft through teaching online classes. Kurtis Scalettas terrific work to develop this program means I have students from across the nation. Just as my Loft teachers have inspired me, my students now inspire me. At a time when the arts have been the first programs to be cut, The Loft community fosters and fuels a love of writing and expands an ever-growing support for the written word.

Loft, Inc.	132573		/users/profile/178220	Molly16	Client Served	5	11/02/2012	After I graduated with a BA in English, I began to panic:  What on earth do I do post-undergrad?  This flailing about led me to acquire an M.Ed and teach high school for a number of years, forgetting my original, long held life goal of going for an MFA and writing.  Soon, I was sucked into the duties of a high school teacher, with five co-curriculars and some of the most emotionally and energy draining preps, as one is wont to receive as a first-year teacher.  My husband gave me a gift certificate to take courses at the Loft in 2007, and that changed everything for me.  It went from an institution where I'd attended readings and admired from a distance to a place that helped re-energize me and remind me of my original and deepest passions.  Now, five or so years later, and I've taught in the youth program, and am currently a mentee in the program the connects emerging writers with local and national writers.  It's a heady feeling, and I have had nothing but excellent support from the staff and instructors.  Minneapolis is a startlingly lucky city to have such a thriving community in its midst.

Four years ago, I decided it was time to pursue my dream of being a writer. I began taking classes at The Loft and my first fiction teacher, Donna Trump, became my first mentor. This was not an official mentorship. Donna took me under her wing, because, she said, I saw something in your writing." There was no compensation, but this is the sort of experience people tend to have with folks affiliated with The Loft. Not only is The Loft an amazing literary center, the writers and artists associated with it help to create and build a supportive literary community. Writing is a difficult and solitary endeavor. In a world where books and technology and the publishing world are forever in flux, I doubt I would be where I am today without The Loft and a teaching artist like Donna. I went on to take classes from other talented writers such as Robert Voedisch, Kate St. Vincent Vogel, and Dale Gregory Anderson and began publishing my work. After three years, I applied for The Lofts Mentor Series Award and was accepted. Under the tutelage of the programs outstanding writers and teachers such as Lan Samantha Chang, Marlon James, Leslie Adrienne Miller, and John Hildebrand, I took my writing and my projects to the next level. With the help of my fellow program participants and The Lofts extremely talented Program Director, Jerod Santek, I applied for and was awarded a Minnesota State Arts Board Grant as well as a Jerome Foundation Travel and Study Grant. Without The Loft, these opportunities would not have been possible for me. My experience with The Loft Literary Center set me on a trajectory toward attainable goals, a new and exciting career path, and MFA in Creative Writing, and a place within an outstanding literary community.

It just defies hyperbole.  Imagine an aspiring guitar player whose freshman roommate turned out to be Jimi Hendrix, a painter who found that she went to same laundromat as Picasso, or a paper-folding enthusiast who lived upstairs from the World Champion of Competitive Origami.  The Loft is like that.  It's so vital.  I've taken classes there, attended readings, entered contests, gone to conferences, and tucked myself into a corner when I needed a quiet place to write.

Education is the only way there is to progress as a society, and the education shared by the Wildlife Research Institute is eye opening to say the very least.

Their findings challenge the decades old dogma we all learned in school and in outdoor circles.  As a biologist, everything I "knew" about black bears was challenged.  As a biologist with several decades of professional experience under my belt, I felt like my career might have been wasted.  The dynamic duo of Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield, WRI supporting cast, and WRI volunteers are now some of my favorite people on the planet.  They truly deserve healthy funding as they deliver value for every dollar.  Kudos to them and if you were on the fence, don't be.  They are a GREAT place for your dollars to make a real difference.  To a person, everyone I have spoken with who has first hand knowledge of WRI simply can't say enough good about them.  Count me in that camp now.  Please help put them on sustainable footing.  They return your good will with fantastic work.

Volunteer	5	05/23/2012	There are not enough words to describe the dedication and commitment Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield are making in their endeavor to research, educate and understand the life of the black bear.  I have been following their efforts since 2010 and have learned more about black bears than I ever would have anticipated.  Kudos to them for their tireless efforts and integrity!
Wildlife Research Institute	106461	29	/users/profile/143849	Kerry M.	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	From the very first time I clicked on the WRI and learned about Black Bears, I have been a daily observer and follower of Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield's research. It has been one of the most interesting, informative and exciting journeys I have ever been on ~ a worthy and invaluable labor of love and research - one filled with integrity, intelligence and humanity.  The educational value is invaluable to children and adults alike, and has changed the hearts and minds of thousands who are learning about black bears and how they live.  Study boxes are now available to teachers everywhere and with continued support, more and more can be done to educate the world.  Kudos to the WRI!               
Wildlife Research Institute	111978	4	/users/profile/152357	Princessthekitty	General Member of the Public	5	05/13/2012	I have followed the NABC and WRI since Jan 2011, watching the den cam hen Hope was born. Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield have and are doing a great job researching the lives of Shadow's clan and educating us on the truths about black bears and dismissing the myths. Their research is known worldwide and highly respected. I plan to visit Ely in July and visit the NABC. I have learned so much from this research. Both the NABC and WRI are doing a great job educating about black bears
Wildlife Research Institute	111954	5	/users/profile/152294	dazzle	Volunteer	5	05/12/2012	This non-profit ranks among the unique. The leaders, researchers, work 7 da/wk and easily 12-14 hrs./da. so that others will understand the important niche the American Black Bear holds in the world of wildlife and how humans can learn to co-exist with them. There are no big salaries or performance vehicles, only hours of forest trekking, data compiling and communication. The WRI is among the finest of non-profits-a gem of integrity. It is a privilege to support this Research and benefit from it. 
Wildlife Research Institute	111804	8	/users/profile/152212	Allison K.	Volunteer	5	05/11/2012	The WRI has been a part of my daily life for the last few years. I have learnt so much about Black Bears, and  the surrounding Northwoods. I was able to volunteer my services, by doing shifts on the dencam, collecting data for the research. Which gave me great satsfaction, in the hope that these beautiful  animals will be understood a lot more. My dream is to visit the Bear Centre and the Ely area.
Wildlife Research Institute	106653	22	/users/profile/144181	rsonnino2000	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2012	I have been following the work of Dr. Rogers and Ms. Mansfield for several years, and finally had the opportunity to take the Bear Study Course last summer. I am a physician, educator and a researcher, and very familiar with scientific methodology. Their research is sound, impeccably done and likely to yield important findings on bear behavior. Management of the finances is likewise beyond reproach.  They personally never benefit from any of it, live very simple and modest lives, and are truly dedicated to their research, but even more so to education about black bears. Countless elementary school children are learning more than they could ever imagine from these animals, including science, math, civics and the ups and downs of life. These are lessons that cannot be duplicated  in other ways. I will continue to support Dr. Rogers and Ms Mansfield in any way I can, including contributing my knowledge towards interpretation of their findings whenever they feel appropriate. 
Wildlife Research Institute	106544	23	/users/profile/144001	cubbiesRcute	Donor	5	02/16/2012	When a friend said,"Did you see that stuff on the internet about a bear up in Ely that's going to have cubs and it's going to be on webcam?", little did i know what effect that would have on my life. The bears on camera, in the videos available on the website and in Updates, the photos of their life activities, all the factual scientific research that is shared on the webpages has totally changed my understanding of the black bear. I used to be afraid of being in the woods at night. In our 35 years of Boundary Water trips we would quote all the misinformation offered by sporting magazines, hunters, the DNR, etc about how aggressive and dangerous black bears are. Now i know better. They are wild animals and deserve respect but i am no longer afraid. i have yet to see a black bear on any BWCAW trips. but i really want to know that i understand their behavior. All this from two totally dedicated researchers who quietly present facts to the public and their peers in an effort to have people open their eyes and minds to what the MN black bear really is about. Thank you Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield!
Wildlife Research Institute	106513	29	/users/profile/143942	Sue_11	Donor	5	02/15/2012	This organizaton headed by Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield, biologists has changed my thinking about the behaviors of black bears. There expertise in this field and their willingness to share the years of knowledge has brought together so many people with the same interests, and has increased education about black bears in many school systems. Reading others comments, who say that the donations aren't being used as they said they is not true. The biologists share how the donations are being used with the public. It's unfortunate that even after years and years on study, Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield are still questioned about how they do their research. I will stand by this organization through thick and thin. I cannot believe that there are naysayers that speak about this organization. 
Wildlife Research Institute	106509	26	/users/profile/143936	Mike K.	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	Dr Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield are teaching the world about how the Black Bear lives, what they eat, how they grow, mating, giving birth, raising , protecting and teaching cubs, territory, scent marking, so much information that was never known or documented before. The education that is being taught in the class rooms through the use of the den cams is teaching children that the Black Bear is a beautiful animal and not at all ferocious as we all once believed. Dr Rogers and Sue are showing the world that Humans & Black Bears can co -exist in peace..  I have and will continue to support this important research. Thank You Dr Rogers and Sue Mansfield for all you do!    
Wildlife Research Institute	106506	27	/users/profile/143925	Julie42	Volunteer	5	02/15/2012	I have nothing but respect for Dr Rogers and Sue Mansfield! They have taught me so much about the North American Black Bear!, Their website Bear.Org is the most comprehensive website i have come across where the Black Bear is concerned. They are both kind and generous with their time, always ready to answer questions! All i can do is thank them from the bottom of my heart !
Wildlife Research Institute	106504	34	/users/profile/143924	Linda61	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	I've taken the time to read all these reviews with some laughing at the lengths a few disgruntled people will go to discredit something that they were once totally involved in and sang the praises of, only to get their toes "stepped on" because of the unfair treatment said people gave the general public fan as moderators and fundraiser heads for the NABC and WRI.     I just LOVE the Law of REAPING what we plant. Some people call it karma....same principle.  We are promised by God that whatever we "sow, we will also reap."  Sow goodness and kindness and it will come back to you 10 fold or more.  Sow hatefulness and lies and THAT too is promised by God to come back to the sower.   Dr. Lynn Rogers and Biologist Sue Mansfield are two of the kindest people I have ever met.  It is Dr. Rogers' life goal to teach the world about the American Black Bear and how they relate to one another and to humans.   Thousands and thousands of people agree with him. So why should we even listen to the few who are pissed off because they lost in the "power struggle" that they created themselves.   Yay for goodness and Kindness.  Good will always overcome evil.......................EVERY TIME.
Wildlife Research Institute	106501	29	/users/profile/143918	Olatz A.M.

Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield on behalf of WRI conduct the most detailed long-term study of black bears behaviour based on trust. It has been a life devoted to the study of these animals. Day by day, year by year... A labor of love... Thank you WRI for your tireless efforts to educate the world!

Donor	5	02/15/2012	Nowhere has there been a truly comprehensive study of wild mammals native to the United States as the research of black bears in MN. Nowhere in the United States has the plight of those research animals been so electrifying to bring hundreds of thousands of people within and outside of MN together to support their cause with their voices and their dollars as the radio collared research bears of the North American Bear Center.
Wildlife Research Institute	106491	5	/users/profile/143906	fanofbears	Donor	1	02/15/2012	After being mesmerized by my admiration for these beautiful creatures. I became entranced with this organization only to find them in my opinion to be guileful, capricious, and mephitic. And in pursuing other non-profit organizations I found other non-profits to be the complete opposite and respectful of the general public and its members. Cavete !
Wildlife Research Institute	106485	27	/users/profile/143891	Beary B.	Donor	5	02/15/2012	Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield are highly educated and knowledgeable in the field of black bears. To be able to follow their research has been a joy. I am especially excited that their other organization the NABC has the education outreach program which enables classrooms worlwide also share this experience. The WRI is a great organization.
Wildlife Research Institute	106482	26	/users/profile/143886	figaro	Client Served	5	02/15/2012	As someone who has had personal experience with the work of Dr Rogers, Biologist Sue Mansfield, and others who work at both the WRI and the NABC, I can attest to both the high quality of their work and also to their commitment to increase knowledge of the American Black Bear.  As a participant in their Black Bear Field Study course, I saw first hand the time and effort they put into learning about bears, and dispelling the myths about black bear behavior.  These are very committed people who work long hours at what is their life's work. 
Wildlife Research Institute	106477	30	/users/profile/143877	Bearfan	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	The work of the WRI speaks for itself.  This information is invaluable and has made an enormous contribution to the understanding of black bears.  The more we know about these animals, the better we can coexist.  It stands to reason that a bear is far better off being observed in its natural environment without being subjected to physical harm or sedation.  Many sedated bears have gone into respiratory distress and died as a result.  Rogers and Mansfield take a very neutral, benign approach to learning about these animals.   The people who perpetuate their smear campaign against Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield do so out of personal agendas and not at all because they care about the welfare of these bears.  Most of them were fervent supporters of the WRI/NABC at one point, and absolutely nothing has changed in terms of the research.  I will continue to support the WRI/NABC and am grateful for the opportunity to learn from their experience.    
Wildlife Research Institute	106475	30	/users/profile/143875	Deb_5	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	I have been following Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield and the Bears since 2010 when I first read in the local paper that a black bear was about to give birth and there was a den cam .  Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield  have since helped to educate the world about black bears.  These beautiful creatures are not the ferocious animals we have all feared. The TRUST between Dr Rogers, Sue and the bears is amazing and is the main focus in gaining the knowledge we are all learning from these bears . Children are learning the truths about black bears in the classrooms with the use of den cams, over 500 schools nation wide follow these bears daily in their classrooms. Education is the best way for future generations to learn how to co-exist peacefully with these beautiful creatures. Thank you Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield for sharing your life's work and dreams. We are all learning  !
Wildlife Research Institute	106474	31	/users/profile/143873	dbialek	Donor	5	02/15/2012	I found the Wildlife Research Institute quite by accident in January 2010 and have been a firm and loyal supporter ever since.  The education I have received has been monumental in helping me coexist with the bears and other wildlife in the rural area where I live. Dr. Lynn Rogers' research is comparable to that of Dr. Jane Goodall ~ him with black bears, hers with chimpanzees. Matter of fact, Dr. Goodall is on the International Advisory Board of the North American Bear Center which is the sister-organization of the WRI!!!  Dr. Rogers is a world-class biologist as is Sue Mansfield. Together, they are forces that unite the world, and every age group, in debunking myths about black bears and other maligned wildlife.  His work on black bear mother-daughter kinship prompted Harvard University sociobiologist E.O. Wilson to rank the research as one of the world's "four major pioneering studies of large mammals." Rogers was also the first bear researcher to take blood samples from winter-dormant wild bears--a procedure that has led to greater understanding of such human ailments as gallstones and circulatory problems."  I am proud to say I have met both Dr. Rogers and Ms. Mansfield, and understand their characters which are above reproach, despite what one might read in other comments on this site, made by individuals who thought they would be able to control the research AND researchers by donating their time or money.  I have donated many, many times and will again. I have been to the NABC and will go again. I am impressed by the strength of character and the knowledge each of these two fine individuals posses, as well as the many others who contribute their expertise and efforts to this worthy organization. If you have any doubt about the integrity of this research, you need only ask any one of THOUSANDS of people, from first grade students who have taken it upon themselves to write legislation to make the black bear the MN state mammal, to Edward Osborne Wilson; an American biologist, researcher (sociobiology, biodiversity), theorist (consilience, biophilia), naturalist (conservationist) and author. Wilson is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. He is known for his scientific career, his role as "the father of sociobiology" and his environmental advocacy, among other things.  
Wildlife Research Institute	106468	28	/users/profile/143861	DianeM381	Donor	5	02/15/2012	"The educational values being received by thousands in fifty (50) states and fifty seven (57) countries as well as in classrooms all over the world is undeniably the best education ever presented about the behaviors of these magnificent creatures. Children are learning the truths about wild North American black bears and about all of nature with this experience. Protecting them for future benefit to humanity is necessary. The dozen radio-collared bears around Ely are part of the biggest classroom bear education program ever done. Over 500 schools follow these bears daily in their classrooms. Teachers and students watch the live Den Cam and read the daily research updates on bear.org . Individual radio-collared bears are part of their science, reading, and math classes along with the lesson plans. Minnesotas radio-collared bears have become too valuable to science, education, tourism, and regional economics to be killed like any other bears The township of Ely, MN has taken a major step toward supporting the protection of these bears. They have signed a resolution recognizing the importance of these bears and that the need for the legalization of their protection. Regional benefits from the research bears are just beginning. Continued success depends entirely upon the radio-collared bears that hundreds of thousands are following worldwide. We all must do whatever we can to gain legal protection for the radio-collared bears that are the foundation for it all.  March 6, 2011 at 10:45 am" The above comment was left after a newspaper article, concerning the fact that radio-collared bears would continue to be fair game to hunters, was written.  It says so much about what the Wildlife Research Institute (WRI) and North American Bear Center (NABC) are about.  I couldn't have said it better. Therefore, I'm shocked to see that some people have posted negative comments, here, about the WRI.  The fact is, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Division of Fish and Wildlife (MN DNR) has issued them a permit.  The permit states, "Permission is granted to conduct a pilot research study of black bears and black bear public education on the Mud Creek study area."  The permit allows them to do the following with the black bears they are studying, "Capture, handle, radio-collar, and monitor for research purposes and public education."   All permits have conditions...there wouldn't be a need for a permit, if they didn't.  Having received a permit from the MN DNR, is enough for me to acknowledge the work the WRI is doing. I donate because I want to, and believe in what they are doing. Some of the negative comments mention that the bears are in danger of harm, by hunters, because of the research.  Protection has been sought for these study bears, and has continually been denied.  The fact is, they're wild bears.  Hunting is a big part of Minnesota history, and unless the bear is a cub, it is legal to be hunted.   
Wildlife Research Institute	106464	26	/users/profile/143845	Laurie6241	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2012	I started following Dr. Roger's and Sue Mansfield's bear research in Jan. 2010 when the webcam was first placed in Lily's den.  I found it so intriguing that I went to 'bearstudy.com' and found the previous publications; they, too, were intriguing.  I'd taken a trip into the BWCAW for nearly 30 summers, and 'thought' I knew bears.  That concept has been 'blown out of the water'!!  I've since come to know and understand them far more intimately, thanks to the den cams, and have an immensely greater respect for bears than I would ever have without this new information.   I've always loved to learn, and am so grateful that Dr. Rogers and Sue Mansfield have afforded this continued learning opportunity by their research!!  And the 'learning' is something NEW almost daily!  Their gentle method of working with the 12 - 16 research bears fits with the way I believe it should be done.  And when I watch Jewel with her cubs and then realize there are probably another 8,000 -10,000 mother bears in dens with cubs out of the 22,000 bears in the state of Minnesota doing the exact same thing...pretty humbling... especially since I never gave it a thought  before the dencam.  There is far more learning to be had in this field, and the new information will be found as a result of this research!  Thank you Doc & Sue!
Wildlife Research Institute	106459	28	/users/profile/143847	Emily22	General Member of the Public	4	02/15/2012	I have followed Dr Lynn Rogers' research and adventures with the black bears of Ely's Northwoods since 2010 when Hope was born to Lily. I see nothing in Doc's manner which would suggest any type of mismanagement. I believe he has brought awareness of black bears to many people all over the world, and has created a community of wonderful caring people who love the bears, and care for each other. Every one has their own opinions about...anything ... and may donate to ... anything ... they feel strongly about. I feel strongly that the research done by Dr Lynn and his assistant Sue Mansfield is important and well-documented by them, and by a legion of cam-watchers collecting minute-by-minute data about life in a bear's den.
Wildlife Research Institute	106453	25	/users/profile/143838	Paula12	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2012	 Have been following this Research since Feb.2010 and find the presentations geared to my level of understanding and straightforward, allowing me , and others, to learn directly from the bears. Some entered into following with the concept that they would get something other than what is offerred and feel offended-we are given the opportunity to really learn about this species in a very special way and it is always about the bears. The funds have been used to further the Research appropriately and I rejoice that we have been able to be a part of this tremendous undertaking. My dtr. is a biologist and was delighted with all the discoveries of bear behavior that WRI has shown to the world.

Evans	Volunteer	5	02/14/2012	Having spent a large portion of my 33 year career involved in research processes,  I am well acquainted with the requirements.  I have looked into the WRI (bearstudy.org and have spoken directly with Dr. Lynn Rogers and Sue Mansfield, MS) and their research and find them achieving the high standards of correctly implemented research.  The study design and methodology are very appropriate to studying the socio-biologic behavior of bears.  The funds are NOT mis-appropriated as has been fraudulently alledged by several of the posts here.   One of prime focuses of the WRI is educating people about bears, and they are achieving that goal world-wide, thanks to web (den) cam technology and use of the internet.  The research they do and the increased understanding of bear behavior will truly benefit both humans and bears.
Wildlife Research Institute	106435	9	/users/profile/143796	bearsbeware	Volunteer	1	02/14/2012	I've seen this organization go from what appeared to be all about the bears to one that now is all about the money.  The bears are fed on a regular basis which habituates them to humans, affects their hibernation patterns, and makes them more desirable to hunters due to their larger size and tameness.  Their "research" is supposed to be based on wild bears, but due to all of the interactions, their instincts don't reflect those of  truely wild bears.  If their methods are questioned, you can expect to be bullied by their fans who fail to see what's really happening.  The bears lives are at risk due to Rogers, Mansifield and their so called research practices.  Comparing this organization to the work of Jane Goodall is shameful.   Why the DNR continues to issue a permit to them remains a mystery.
Wildlife Research Institute	106425	27	/users/profile/143780	slomoe	Volunteer	5	02/14/2012	I have followed the wild research bears in the Ely area for over two years.  I've found out that the research and how it's sharred is always honest, straight forward, and very educational...It's not by chance that Doctor Rogers has been compared to Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, some pretty hefty company to be sure in the way of mammal research.  Doctor Rogers with the help of Sue Mansfield has taught the WORLD more about this species than anyone in the history and more than likely more than anyone ever will !!  Education and how we can better understand this animal is what Doctor Rogers is trying to teach us and I can only say that I'm very thankful that he's invited me along on this incredible journey !!!

Through their work they have been able to walk with the bears and gain valuable insight into eating, breeding, reproductive and family socialization habits of the black bear, and to then share this information with the world.  They have provided tools for education in classrooms and opportunities for filming documentaries by the BBC.  They have given me a changed perception of the black bear, from an animal to be simply feared, to an animal to be respected, remembering that it is a wild animal.

Wildlife Research Institute	106398	10	/users/profile/143689	Kara J.	Donor	1	02/13/2012	The Wildlife Research Institute operates under the guise of "education" and "research" They exploit the bears that they study for money and notoriety. Not only are their research methods are not up to standard and their research permit is currently restricted by the Minnesota DNR, but they continually habituate these bears to humans other than themselves. This has been going on for years. These bears have been petted and fed by humans for years and this endangers their lives in the wild. I would not recommend this organization to any educator or student of wildlife studies. The WRI plays on the emotions and psychological needs of their fans and they cause great harm to the bears in the process.

Wingspan Life Resources	214737	1	/users/profile/4076	annc009	Donor	5	09/11/2014	My sister has lived in one of the 24 homes that Wingspan runs in Minneapolis since 2002.  I cannot say enough great things about how they care for my sister.  She is so happy in her home, and the staff is absolutely the best.  They are all so dedicated and caring.  Wingspan is a wonderful non profit, dedicated to helping everyone they serve live their lives to the fullest.  I have also been a board member and have seen the dedication that runs through the whole company!  Kudos to Wingspan for being such a well run, caring organization!
Wingspan Life Resources	2561	18	/users/profile/4076	annc009	Volunteer	5	01/20/2009	I am the sister of one of the residents of a Wingspan home.  Liz has been in her home since 2002.  I moved her to Minneapolis so that she could be close to me, since I am her guardian.  I can't tell you how many homes I looked at, not finding anything I was willing to have Liz move into.  After months of looking, the social worker called and said she had another home for me to look at. I wasn't too hopeful, but I didn't want to leave any stone unturned.  From the moment I walked into this home (run by Wingspan), I felt a sense of calm and happines... the home was clean and neat, and all of the ladies seemed very content, but the best part was the staff...they were all so kind and loving toward the ladies, and it truly felt like a home, with people who loved and cared for the people they served. I knew right then that I had found the perfect home for Liz!  She came to visit and stayed for dinner...they made her favorite meal, lasagne, and that sealed the deal...she loved it!  I am so happy to have found Wingpsan for Liz.  I see her every week, and she spends all of the holidays with us.  There are also many wonderful activities provided by Wingspan that Liz loves to take part in...the picnic in the summer, karaoke parties, art activities, summer camp, the Made in the Shade walk in the fall....but her FAVORITE is the Magnolia Ball in the spring.  She and all of the Wingspan residents get dressed up, and are treated to a wonderful dance with food and pop, and the staff serving as DJ... what could be better? Liz loves to dance, so she dances the night away with a big smile on her face!! It is so great to have Liz so close!  She always loves it when I pick her up to go out with me, but the BEST part for me is to see how happy she is to return to her home!  Wingspan is the outstanding company it is because of the wonderful people who work there and dedicate their lives to helping all of the people they serve live their lives to the fullest. All of these caring people are a special blessing in Liz's life, and in turn in mine.  I will always be thankful for Wingspan and the wonderful care the give to my sister, Liz!

Wingspan Life Resources	213898	1	/users/profile/160775	Judith V.	Board Member	5	09/07/2014	Wingspan Life Resources operates 24 residential facilities that care for developmentally disabled adults.  The Wingspan staff takes "caring" well beyond providing food, shelter and medical assistance.  Wingspan's commitment is to empower the abilities and to nurture the spirits of its residents so that they may recognize their God-given abilities and develop their maximum human potential.  Once admitted to a Wingspan home, residents can be assured of loving and supportive care up to and including end of live support if needed.  I am proud to be associated with this organization for the good it accomplished day in and day out.
Wingspan Life Resources	181846		/users/profile/160775	Judith V.	Board Member	5	10/23/2013	This organization goes above and beyond the call of duty routinely to provide the people in its care with exceptional care as well as encouragement to use their skills and capabilities to their fullest.  One of my favorite stories is the extra effort staff members made to assure that one of the residents could walk his daughter down the aisle to be married.  This demanded special medical and physical therapy efforts and an out of state trip.  Thanks to all the advance planning and special efforts, the trip and the day came off without a hitch.

Formerly known as St. Anns, Wingspan marks its 40th year of service this year.  The Winspan staff demonstrates its commitment to residents everyday in so many ways.  In fact, employees recently rated the organization as one of the Top 100 Places To Work (in the Twin Cities area) in an annual poll conducted by the Star-Tribune newspaper.  Staff gave management high ratings for understanding what's going on in the organization and for supporting staff members in their jobs.

I'm consistently amazed at the devotion and committment the Wingspan staff has for the people they care for in the 24 Wingsapn homes.

Wingspan demonstrates good stewardship of donations and funding. Wingspan does indeed "... help people who are challenged by age, abilty or health to realize their unique gifts, talents and dreams".

I have worked at many group homes and have never seen the support that Wingspan shows there staff and the consumers that we serve. Wingspan is so different, the love that the staff shows the consumers and how each home is different on how the approach the consumers we serve. I have never worked at a place where I had the chief of operations personal cell phone and could call her day or night. Ive never had a direct supervisor who would ask me about my family, and was concerned that my daughter worked overnight a gas station. The strong family connection I have here at Wingspan I have never had. That is why I choose Wingspan Life Resources as the best place I have worked in a long time.

They understand so many of the individual needs of each one and they know the greater issues facing individuals who require such care including health, finances, social interaction, well being and more.  I have been very impressed by the personal contact everyone receives from staff, volunteers and the executive staff.  It is truly a nurturing community and if one had a loved one facing these challenges, they could only hope there would be a Wingspan Life Resources there for them.

I previously worked for another non-profit company.  The staff people at Wingspan care really care about those that they serve, and  the people who live and work at the group homes become a family. The people on the management team (executives, program directors, and board members) work and make decisions for the best for all employees and consumers.  They are very dedicated, hard workers.  One of the awards Wingspan has won in recent years, in a Star Tribune poll, was "Clued-in Management."They listen to the people involved, know what's going on in the homes, and act to solve problems or show compassion to those in need.

Wingspan Life Resources	118801		/users/profile/161531	HowardL	General Member of the Public	5	07/18/2012	I have been a friend of Wingspan Life Resources since I moved to Minnesota over 20 years ago.  In all fairness, part of my involvement stems from the fact that I am married to Wingspan's Executive Director.  But that fact is only a part of the story.  For many years I have been a board member of another nonprofit, but don't feel compelled to give that organization a 5 Star review.  So what is it about Wingspan that compels me to write?  Stated as briefly as possible, it is the care and love given to the residents/participants in Wingspans programs that moves me.  Unlike some nonprofits, Wingspan exist to serve.  Period.  The Wingspan professionals, many of whom I have known since we were all much younger, are the most devoted group of caregivers  I have ever had the good fortune to know.  Persons with developmental disabilities are too often treated callously by the world around them, and in this era of cuts to social services, I fear things will get worse before they get better.  Thank God for the dedicated professionals at Wingspan Life Resources.  Wingspan is truly a GREAT nonprofit.

Wingspan Life Resources	118415		/users/profile/161057	Quinn	Board Member	5	07/14/2012	I am a relatively new board member of Wingspan Life Resources and I also have a cousin Mary who is a resident in one of Wingspan's 24 group homes in Minneapolis and St. Paul. I am very impressed with the leadership and the dedication of the entire staff. Their goal is to see that each and every resident not only lives in a healthy and safe enviroment but also that each one thrives. I recently attended the annual Magnolia Ball that Wingspan holds for the more than 100 residents. It was held at a downtown hotel and each of the residents was dressed up in a gown or tux and was having the time of their life. Each participated to the best of their ability on and off the dance floor and I could tell this is a highly anticpated evening out for each of them. I later went home thinking how lucky I am to have become a board member of this organization that has done so much for my cousin Mary and for all of the residents that are served by Wingspan. Two Thumbs Up !!!

I have nothing but praise for the people who care for the consumers at Wingspan. The people at the headquarters from the CEO on down have been above reproach and extremely caring. After talking with and knowing many Hennepin County social workers I know that they agree that Wingspan is the superior organization of group homes in the greater twin cities area.It is a pleasure to know and work with these employees and the caregivers who are wonderful.
Wingspan Life Resources	2491	22	/users/profile/3992	elderjulie	Board Member	5	01/14/2009	I am a member of the Board of Directors at Winspan.  This is now my second year on the board.  Perhaps my most memorable experience to date has been a visit that I made to a group home in Roseville.  What I observed during that visit, was not only a house full of really happy, self confident residents, but something that I also found particularly touching.  I was very impressed with the staff on site, the personal stories they told me about each of the residents as we toured the home and their obvious compassion for the Wingspan residents there.  I saw some of the resident's personal living space and was happy to see posters on the walls, pictures, video games being played and music coming out of one resident's room as I walked by.  The residence in Roseville felt like "home" - like a place where anyone would feel comfortable living and would feel pride associated with the surroundings there.  I was really proud to be affiliated with this organization that day and to know that the residents were happy and the staff caring for them were really committed to their work.

The staff here are constantly working hard for the rights of all people in the community and hoping to educate everyone they meet. They are always welcoming and passionately committed to helping all those in our community.
CAIR-Minnesota	238954		/users/profile/324480	afecmankato	Volunteer	5	03/07/2015	As a community leader in Mankato Minnesota, I call on CAIR every time there is a Civil Rights discrimination case in my community and I have never been disappointed, either CAIR provided consultation on how to approach the issue, or they provide free legal representation to right the social wrongs of our community. We definitely need a CAIR branch office in Mankato to access the service locally. Keep up the good work.
CAIR-Minnesota	238889		/users/profile/324385	Lujainah	Volunteer	5	03/05/2015	When I first worked with CAIR-MN, I thought it would be just another job. I did not realize how very active CAIR-MN is active in the community, the Twin Cities, and even all around the state. Plus, I felt like I was home. Great staff, terrific leadership, and I hope much success to come under the new Executive Director.

CAIR-Minnesota	233168		/users/profile/296859	im_qure	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2014	CAIR MN has done an amazing job educating people from all walks of life about their rights as a citizen of this community and country.  They work tirelessly to bridge the gap between people of various backgrounds and faiths by providing assistance wherever and whenever needed.  One of their core principles is "CAIR is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, regardless of faith" and that pretty much captures the essence of this organization.
CAIR-Minnesota	232619		/users/profile/296169	sarah_d	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2014	CAIR-MN works tirelessly to advocate for communities facing illegal discrimination and marginalization from what should be democratic decision-making processes.
CAIR-Minnesota	232092		/users/profile/166891	Fedwa	Advisor	5	10/31/2014	CAIR MN has done very beneficial work for the community.  They have helped to organize many events that teach and train the Muslim community to work with the system and be an citizen that works to build and nurture the greater community.  The board is a very professional board and the employees are very skilled and qualified group.  I am extremely impressed by their work and their team.
CAIR-Minnesota	122540	1	/users/profile/166891	Fedwa	Advisor	5	09/19/2012	The people who run CAIR MN are upcoming leaders who work very hard to lead Muslims in Minnesota to work with the system to deal with civil rights issues and discrimination. Many good-hearted people bemoan the deterioration of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims since 9/11, but CAIR MN is actually doing the hard work of repairing the relationship. Through their work on various projects and organizations, their leadership reached out to mainstream institutions and donated their time and money toconstructively enhance Muslims and people of other faiths to work together. Through their leadership, I have seen many Muslim youth now lead in opening other organizations as well as leadingprojects to contribute to a better Minnesota. I was invited to many such forums and was impressed by the level oforganization, hard work and professionalism within the meetings. We recently had a forum with Law Enforcement and it was amazing to see many Muslim and Somali leaders address their concerns to Law Enforcement officials to understand how to secure our country as well as protect our civil rights. Such meetings in the political climate are very hard to arrange and facilitate. 
CAIR-Minnesota	232048		/users/profile/295600	Glenna M.	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2014	CAIR-MN works hard to educate the community while also serving the Muslim population.

They are a group of dedicated individuals working hard to make Muslims a better understood community.

CAIR-Minnesota	122433		/users/profile/166749	mekh	Volunteer	5	09/17/2012	I have been working with CAIR-MN as a Designer for three months now. In my time here, I have come to learn that they are so many things to the community: an affordable legal service so everyone has access to a lawyer; a source of valuable information that everyone (really, everyone!) can benefit from and utilize; an advocate and supporter to people who felt like they had no one on their side; and a huge help to the community itself, by providing positions and internships for young people to get involved in civil advocacy in a meaningful way. I personally feel very close to my work for CAIR-MN. I've had the opportunity to watch true civil advocates in action, while creating work that I'm proud of.
CAIR-Minnesota	231659		/users/profile/295230	mqamari	Donor	5	10/31/2014	CAIR-MN provides the most needed service of representation to Muslims and others who need help when they are being discriminated because of religion or because being member of a Minority Group.

CAIR-Minnesota	194048		/users/profile/253498	jl412035	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2014	This is the most professionally run Muslim organization in Minnesota. They do tremendous work and the only people who raise issues with that are the Islamophobes. No one opposes a civil rights organization unless they are a bigot.
CAIR-Minnesota	194046		/users/profile/253496	maryamfan2818	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2014	Best organization in Minnesota! Thank you for all the great work you do for the community!
CAIR-Minnesota	194045		/users/profile/253495	Asma S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2014	There has been a tremendous growth of CAIR-MNs name and reputation in the community since its founding. Each year, CAIR-MN appears over 115 times in local newsmedia. CAIR-MN was named a 2010 Difference Maker by the St. Cloud Times, received the 2011 Nonprofit Mission and Excellence Anti-Racism Award from the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits and MAP for Nonprofits, named the 2012 CAIR Chapter of the Year, selected for Minnesota Philanthropy Partners 2013 "Nonprofits to Know," and featured in the Rochester Diversity Council What Works. Recently, CAIR-MN received the 2013 Difference Makers Award from the American Bar Associations Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division for making a difference through pro bono work.
CAIR-Minnesota	194017		/users/profile/253459	MiaAli.Ise	Donor	3	02/09/2014	CAIR has been wonderful in their fund raising however, CAIR never seems to address the women discrimination that is inherent in Sharia law. Until CAIR publically denounces Sharia, MN Muslims will never bee taken seriously for social change. We can not applaud CAIR when they refuse to speak out on the atrocities of women in other Islamic countries. Stoning gays, female genital mutilation, child brides pre-arranged and even worse, the ignoring of  the numerous Honor Killings we have seen in the USA_ these are topics that CAIR has not, or will not address in MN.  MN Muslims expect more.  MN Muslims can not be respected  by their infidel neighbors when these Sharia Law sanctioned atrocities are ignored in the press by MN CAIR. 
CAIR-Minnesota	171131		/users/profile/226668	joemitchell3	Volunteer	5	09/23/2013	During my brief volunteer stint with CAIR-MN, I watched them do great social justice and anti-discrimination work. They were tireless, and they achieved amazing things with very limited resources. If you are opposed to discrimination of any sort, this is an organization worth supporting.
CAIR-Minnesota	165171		/users/profile/219560	Tiffany X.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/16/2013	CAIR is a spectacular nonprofit organization with staff, interns and volunteers that are truly passionate and dedicated to what they do.  CAIR as a whole is a "community connecter" that works tirelessly to give voice to people, bridge cultural differences, protect and strengthen civil liberties for all Americans. 
CAIR-Minnesota	157876		/users/profile/209374	KnowledgeISPowerr	Volunteer	5	05/14/2013	Year in and year out CAIR is recognized for its efforts to help protect civil liberties here in Minnesota.  This can only be attributed to the tireless efforts of those that volunteer and work at CAIR.  They work to protect and defend the constitutional rights of American Muslims, thereby supporting the rights of all Americans.
CAIR-Minnesota	157797		/users/profile/209258	Hera Ahmad	Volunteer	5	05/13/2013	I have been working with CAIR MN as an events coordinator intern for three months now. The ground that CAIR MN has covered in such a short time is really amazing. The best thing is that it allows everyone a platform to have a voice, helps in bridging cultural differences and stand up for the rights of those who are unable to do themselves.  The success stories of CAIR MN really speaks for itself and I feel very fortunate to be a part of CAIR MN.
CAIR-Minnesota	157513		/users/profile/208892	TheHuntIsOn	Volunteer	5	05/09/2013	This is a fantastic organization that does important work in our community to protect and strengthen civil rights! Sincerely, A non-Muslim in his right mind.
CAIR-Minnesota	156501	1	/users/profile/207586	Quanita	Volunteer	5	04/27/2013	There are many negative feedback entered here. All the bad reviews were entered by right wing extremists coming to this page from a hate website called Bare Naked Islam.  This website is hosted in Israel to promote hatred of muslims and Islam so that the Western world can be duped to engage in a war with the islamic world.  These people promote genocide of muslims so that Jews can reclaim all land mentioned in Bible and rebuild the Temple Mount by destroying the dome of the Rock.  Yet they call themselves as followers of the most peacefull religion in the world: Christianity. Kudos to CAIR for all the good work they do.  Please continue to support CAIR and if you wish to learn more about those right wing fanatics, check the following page: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6VpMYAVms
CAIR-Minnesota	156325		/users/profile/207362	einekleinerob	General Member of the Public	5	04/25/2013	As a lifelong campaigner against fascism and racism in Britain I have frequently found myself crossing swords with the vicious professional Islamophobes working in the USA to spread their message of hatred, not only of Muslims but of Christians like myself and of Jews.  Among the worst of these is the BareNakedIslam site run by Bonni Benstock-Intall, a New York-based Holocaust denier who has called for the return of the Nazis to Germany to sort out their "Muslim problem". BNI not only encourages the mass murder of Muslims (for example in Burma and Occupied Palestine) but calls for the genital mutilation and/or public execution of "leftists". Without the work of CAIR the views of such neo-Nazi scum would be effectively unopposed within the USA. These filth like to smear CAIR as "unindicted co-conspirators" in a terrorism trial (meaning, no evidence found so not guilty) while cheerfully supporting the actual terror campaigns of the Jewish Defense League (banned by the FBI) . They call themselves "patriots" while calling for the violent overthrow of their President (elected twice by a majority of Americans) and demanding legal sanctions against Muslims and Jews because of their religion.  CAIR are guardians of what is best in America against the hatred of losers jealous of the success (through hard work) of America's Muslims and Jews. They are true American patriots, and as long as CAIR are still fighting America's corner it will remain a country worth visiting. God Bless America, and God bless CAIR.

CAIR-Minnesota	122552		/users/profile/166920	Kathy63	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/19/2012	I am the Executive Director of another non profit in Mpls. with similar goals as CAIR-MN.  We have found the current Director and Development person ready to cooperate and work together with those outside of their immediate community.  Their education to employers and support/advocacy of individuals about their rights is invaluable to our community.  In the past staff from CAIR-MN offered training to local families who were about to host civilian visitors from Iraq. She taught us about prayer times, dietetic issues, cats and dogs and other things that helped us feel more relaxed hosting out guests. We look forward to ongoing cooperation working to improve living conditions and community health here in MN.

CAIR-Minnesota	122499		/users/profile/166838	Nahid K.	Client Served	5	09/18/2012	CAIR-MN assisted me in challenging discriminatory behavior on the part of customs and immigration officials at MSP upon returning home to Minnesota from an international trip. CAIR may focus on protecting the civil rights and liberties of American Muslims, but such work protects the civil rights and liberties of all citizens and residents of our nation, regardless of religious affiliation. As a supporter and board member of CAIR-MN, I appreciate its work in partnership with numerous like-minded organizations working to protect the civil rights and liberties of all Americans and residents of the country.
CAIR-Minnesota	122493		/users/profile/166827	sameers7	Donor	5	09/18/2012	CAIR MN is the only organization that fights hard to protect the civil liberties of Muslim Americans. They are in the forefront as well in building bridges and coalitions  between the non-Muslim and Muslim members of our community.
CAIR-Minnesota	122441		/users/profile/166755	saly.abdalla	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2012	As a civil rights advocate, it has been the most amazing and rewording experience working with CAIR-MN.  The cases I work on make a difference in people's lives and the trainings I conduct help create and foster tolerance and understanding among members in the community.  It is empowering to stand up and defend the rights of those whose rights have been violated because of hate, discrimination, or out of pure ignorance of the law or religious beliefs of others.    
CAIR-Minnesota	122438		/users/profile/166753	longbuech	Advisor	5	09/17/2012	CAIR-Minnesota is a dynamic non-profit organization that works on ensuring the civil rights of Muslims throughout the state.  It provides a voice to so many people that don't know what to do when they experience discrimination.  It also provides excellent training so employers and others can better understand the Islamic religion and how it relates to employment.
CAIR-Minnesota	122434		/users/profile/166750	KateKhaled	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/17/2012	CAIR Minnesota is a highly efficient and growing advocacy organization with a mission to support the legal rights of Minnesota's growing Muslim population.

CAIR-Minnesota	122301	1	/users/profile/166545	Michael_Bischoff	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2012	It is amazing how much CAIR-MN is able to accomplish with just a small amount of resources. The impact they have around the state in the media, in trainings, and in protecting civil rights is amazing. They are tireless, passionate, and skillful advocates for fair and respectful treatment for everyone.  I have watched their work from a distance and I'm also helping with some of their long-term planning. The value and impact of CAIR-MN is amazing now, but I also think they will have an even more transformative role in the future.
CAIR-Minnesota	122297	1	/users/profile/166537	lsaroya	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/14/2012	CAIR-MN functions on a basic premise: that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. The individual stories and accomplishments that come from our office are extremely fulfilling  the 300 employees who were granted their legal rights in the workplace after CAIR-MN intervened on their behalf; the student who was allowed to make up a college exam she missed for a religious holiday; the high school students who were able to put an end to daily harassment; the woman who was hired after initially being told to remove her religious headscarf in order to continue with her job interview; or the warehouse employees who were allowed to speak their native language during their breaks. Right now American Muslims are going through challenging times. In our nations history, we have seen other minority groups treated the same way  and it could be a new group in the future. So were not just advocating for Minnesota Muslims, were protecting the rights that many Americans have sacrificed their lives for. There has been tremendous growth of CAIR-MNs name and reputation in the community since it was created in 2007. In 2010, CAIR-MN appeared over 115 times in local and national newsmedia. Also in 2010, CAIR-MN was named a Difference Maker by the St. Cloud Times. Last year, CAIR-MN was awarded the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits Mission & Excellence Anti-Racism Award.  
CAIR-Minnesota	120311	1	/users/profile/163633	Kathleen21	Volunteer	5	08/09/2012	I have worked with CAIR-MN for almost a year now. One of my projects was to interview staff, board members, clients and other supporters to see what CAIR-MN means to them. I was truly inspired by the stories of these remarkable people who all have a personal tie to CAIR-MN and an immense passion for the work that CAIR-MN does. To hear each personal story, and each unique way that these lives have been effected by CAIR-MN proved to me even more the importance, depth, and validity of this work.  I got to hear, time and time again how CAIR-MN is making a difference, not only in individual lives but in communities.  Furthermore, what makes me such a strong supporter of CAIR-MN is their strategy of empowerment and education and their passion for justice and equality for all people.
CAIR-Minnesota	120109	2	/users/profile/163324	ramlabile	Board Member	5	08/07/2012	CAIR-MN is one of the most effective and bold civil rights organizations in the Midwest. The organization addresses a range of issues from bias/harassment at schools to workplace discrimination and media representation to combating Islamophobia. CAIR-MN is widely recognized for its work, and most recently, was named a 2011 Anti-Racism Initiative Recipient by the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. Since its inception, CAIR-MN has successfully advocated for policies that ensure that kids aren't harassed because of their religion in schools, mosques aren't being targeted unfairly, individuals can work in an environment that doesn't violate their religious rights, and many other fundamental components of our civil rights. The work and impact of this organization is truly remarkable.

Longonot Education Initiative	313105		/users/profile/404478	Writer	Donor	5	10/21/2016	We found LEI from a friend on facebook who had recently posted about sponsoring a student.  My husband and I had decided just a few days prior that we wanted to contribute to a charity with the money we were saving from getting rid of cable.  After reading my friend's post about LEI and the student she was sponsoring, we knew it was the perfect opportunity to make a difference in a child's life.  By maintaining a connection with our student over the years of their education, we are seeing firsthand the impact of our contribution.  Receiving their letters and updates brings us such joy, as they truly value their opportunity to learn.  We hope to share these letters with our children in years to come as an inspiring example of work ethic and the importance of education.   Overall we are extremely happy with our decision to contribute to LEI.  
Longonot Education Initiative	311091		/users/profile/402429	Pawel C.	Donor	5	10/16/2016	I found LEI some years ago and instantly liked what they are doing. So I started to donate from time to time.

I love all the updates and pictures they post as you really get a sense of the good they qre doing. I also love how easy it is to contribute even if it is in the smallest of ways. I myself and a single mom with not alot of extra funds. I do however always try and give back as much as i can in life and LEI makes it simple and you can see where your donations are going and who they qre helping. I have helped purchase soccer shorts for the students and i have sponsored a student as well. I hope to someday go myself and help in any capacity that i am able. This is a great foundation and they work really hard with open hearts to help others who are less fortunate. LEI derserves all the support they can get!!

Longonot Education Initiative	223508	1	/users/profile/287256	Melissa226	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	While volunteering in Ngong, I had the pleasure of meeting Sedona, Zach and Tom, volunteers at LEI. They introduced me to their organization, AHADI education centre and the boys from The Boys Centre in Ngong who they have helped rehabilitate and send back to school. Each of these individuals, along with the education centre itself are improving not only the boys lives but also the entire Ngong Town. It doesn't take long to see the impact this organization has had on the boys lives. It's inspiring to see how passionate the volunteers are and the lengths they will go through to help these boys.  
Longonot Education Initiative	222013	3	/users/profile/285704	nelldj	General Member of the Public	5	10/11/2014	The work that this group does for at risk/ orphaned youth in impoverished communities in Kenya  reflects the most selfless, dedicated and heroic essence of its volunteers and their mission. The good-doing and beauty of our world is brought to life by groups of talented, inspirational individuals like those of LEI. My best friend/mentor/big sister Sedona Keenan is one of these incredible volunteers. Sedona is wildly intelligent and wise beyond her years. She is kind and helpful to anyone and everyone, never passing up an opportunity to do good or help someone despite any lack of recognition. I have been following her journey in Kenya for 3 yrs., and 2yrs. at LEI, through countless stories, pictures and videos. I have always been extremely interested and drawn to Sedona's work and the kids' lifes she touches. Her work with the Ngong hills street boys has been so successful and moving. These boys' realities have been transformed by the innovative work of LEI. They now have a safe place (a classroom built by LEI), supportive mentors who have earned the boys' complete trust, and the opportunity to eat regular meals whilst being drug free. Most of these orphaned or neglected boys of the slums of Kenya have been addicted to huffing glue as a numbing high but also a appetite suppressant. With the support and guidance of LEI the majority of these boys are sober, growing healthier and receiving an education. Sedona let me speak to these boys on video chat with her, I was so taken by how social and ecstatic they were contrary to their spirit when Sedona and LEI first came into contact with them. It was evident the respect, gratitude and genuine affection the boys felt for Sedona. I have also met Portia Duke and Zach Lazarus in person, also LEI volunteers who traveled very far to visit Sedona here in California. They are both inspiring examples of the organization and its work. Their long, grueling trips to California to see Sedona are further embodiment of the love and connection that makes up the back bone of this game changing organization. Any support that can be offered to LEI is a contribution to a life changing cause. The values and ethics executed by these volunteers should serve as an example to all. 
Longonot Education Initiative	221559	2	/users/profile/285247	karenlebrun	Donor	5	10/10/2014	This group is doing amazing things for the children of Kenya. Getting many of them off the streets and into school. Building a school, and playground. Providing materials needed for each student to succeed in school. Providing the children with daily meals. They are accomplishing so much! Keep up the unbelievably great job you are all doing! Those children are the future of Kenya and you are helping them in a huge way on their path to becoming educated, involved adults and leaders in their community.
Longonot Education Initiative	221405	1	/users/profile/285101	shannonleblanc	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I became aware of LEI when my cousin, Sedona Keenan, became heavily involved with the organization and the children.  She is currently in the middle of her third trip to Kenya to be a part of this amazing organization.  Not only has Sedona and her team helped get kids off of the street and help them become drug free, they have given them education and sustenance.  This combination is life altering and these kids will be forever changed.  Their futures will be forever changed.  In fact, they now have futures.   LEI has not only changed those children who attend the school, it has in fact changed my cousin significantly as well.  Kenya, these children, and LEI have become her life and passion.  I am so inspired by her and the work she does there.  I always look forward to seeing photos of the kids, the progress, the land and Sedona, right where she should be, changing the world.  LEI is a phenomenal organization and I can't say enough wonderful things about it.

There are friends and partners as we strive to improve the lives of the wonderful children who live in the Mathare slums. Ben and Portia understand that these children need love and encourage to propel them to their destiny. It always amazes me that although they have their hands full with the LEI's work and mandate, that they have time to spare for the children at Living Positive Kenya. Their love and financial support have been so instrumental as we finish building the first permanent toilet and classroom filled with brand new furniture. Thank you LEI, Ben and Portia! A friend in Need is a friend inDeed. WE LOVE YOU, THANK YOU

Ben's initiative is awesome, focused on the students and boys who's lives he changes. He has amazing  results with the funds that have been raised. I've known Ben for 10 years and we share Christmas dinner whenever he's in Ithaca. I'm so proud of his development into adulthood; his concern for the school is genuine and constant.

Longonot Education Initiative	213426		/users/profile/276608	Jean_H	Donor	5	09/04/2014	I have been supporting LEI since its inception.  I have been awestruck by how much this highly motivated group of people has accomplished in a very short time.  They have taken on what appeared to be insurmountable projects and completed them with incredible success!  They built a new school in Longonot, took the Faraja Children's Home from the brink of failure to incredible success, and most recently, invested in a group of boys that everyone else had given up on and literally saved them.  So many of these boys, who had no hope, are now back in school with a future.  All of this is done on a tight  budget, where every penny counts.  My donations are not immense, but I know that every bit of that money goes towards their projects and truly makes a difference.   I did have the chance to visit Ben in Kenya in 2012.  It was clear that the Kenyans all hold him in high esteem.  He is humble, yet driven.  Since that time, the team has grown (from the original three of Lianna, Kyle and Ben), to add more dedicated young people who want to make a difference in this world.  Ben and Portia work tirelessly, putting the Kenyan children above their own lives, to make their life better.  I wish all non-profits were run like this.
Longonot Education Initiative	191677		/users/profile/250174	Abbie H.	Volunteer	5	12/27/2013	Ben Hardwick and the Longonot Education Initiative came into my life in 2012 while volunteering at the Fajara orphanage in Ngong, Kenya.  At that time I had no idea how much Ben would change my life and the lives of the children at the Fajara orphanage.  When my friend Stacie and I first got to the orphanage we were at a lose as to where to begin helping. The orphanage had nothing, not even the basics such as running water, food, diapers, medication etc.  Anything that the orphanage did have was taken by robbers in the night.  Frustrated and exhausted we asked Ben for his help.  With no hesitation Ben came to the rescue.  After that first visit Ben and the Longonot Education Initiative took the Fajara Orphanage on as one of their projects.  Now Ben lives and Ngong, Kenya and has been able to transform the orphanage physically and has given the children hope.  The children are all able to go to school, they have cows for milk, a garden to eat from, beds to sleep in, medical treatment...the list goes on.  Ben has dedicated his life to helping others.  This world would be a better place if we were all like him. 
Longonot Education Initiative	190401		/users/profile/248595	Stacie P.	Volunteer	5	12/11/2013	I had the pleasure of meeting Ben while volunteering at Fajara orphanage in Gnong, Kenya. I was traveling with a dear friend and it was our first volunteer experience of this kind. First few days at the orphanage we were overwhelmed by the need and how to carry out help in a proper manner... Luckily we met Ben through a mutual friend! Wow.... What a blessing he was to come into all our lives at this time. He truly blessed all of us with his knowledge, spirit, determination and heart. This was back in January of 2012 and he is continuing to work with this orphanage to this day. I can write a novel about Ben and all that he has helped do.... The Fajara family/facility literally took 180 degree turn thanks to Ben's presence! We all can't thank you enough. What a great human you are.... We need more people like you in this world :)

Longonot Education Initiative	190003	1	/users/profile/248066	Joe_41	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/05/2013	I recently had the pleasure of working with Ben and Portia of the Longonot Education Initiative from April 2013 until now and we are continuing our relationship. They work tirelessly on their education projects, raising money and directly giving it to registered organizations on the ground. I got to know them after they'd already built their first school, the namesake of the organization, at the base of Longonot Mountain in Kenya. Their second big project was raising money for Living Positive Kenya, the organization I'm currently working with. Partnering with them, we were successful in raising money to build a new classroom, 4 toilets, and a urinal. And we'll also be piping water into our pre-school compound. They killed themselves to meet the fundraising deadline so we were eligible for a matching grant and all of the donations to the project were doubled! Ben is also now acting as project manager of the project for us, handling all the building approvals and working with the architect and builder.  I don't know what we'd do without him and Portia.  But their latest project is really something very awesome. I have a passion and background for the education of teenagers that have been given up on or left out by society. Ben and Portia and the rest of the LEI staff supporting them, decided to start the Ahadi Education Center in the slums of Ngong, supporting a local man whose dream it was to have a place for the street boys to come, learn, and transition back to school. Not only did Ben and Portia raise money for the center, they also spend a few hours there every day making sure the boys get a meal, teaching the boys directly, and becoming role models for them. I was lucky enough to meet the boys one day and give a math lesson and it was an amazing experience. It was easy to see the rapport the LEI team has with the boys and how it's transforming them. They are all getting excited about learning and getting back to school.

We had been looking online for just a short while before we came across Oliver's picture and the TCPR site.  He couldn't have been cuter if he tried!  His foster parents (they are amazing) met us near our home at Chuck and Don's for our first introduction with Oliver.  They were so patient while we took our time getting to know him!  We were so impressed with how much Oliver already knew.  Come, sit, down, leave it and he would even whine at the door to go potty!

Then we came to wanting to adopt a second dog, once again TCPR was key in guiding us to find a dog who's personality was conducive to the current dynamic of our furry friends.  Another perfect fit!  They are professional and very tuned into assisting people to help guide the best personality and level of energy fit.  They have all the best intentions for the dog/cat and for the adopting family to have a successful adoption experience. Their love for the animals is clearly of the highest priority.

I fell in love with Bear from his picture, kept going back to it after looking at hundreds of cats on Petfinder. I was able to meet him at an adoption event near my house. Soon after, I started to foster for them, and now I volunteer at events. I love TCPR because they will take all kinds of animals, all breeds of dogs, and animals that need work behaviorally or need expensive/time consuming medical care. They are a very dedicated group of people. I know exactly where my donations go. It may seem like the long application and/or home visit is a little much, but TCPR wants to make absolutely sure that the new home is the right fit for the animal. The animal is the #1 priority.

I continue to be impressed with the level of care provided to each and every animal rescued. TCPR has worked hard to develop strong relationships with several local veterinary clinics to ensure that each animal is provided with an excellent level of care, despite the complexity. Beyond that, every TCPR foster is extremely dedicated to his/her foster animal and provides endless love and support throughout the animal's rehabilitation. I highly recommend TCPR to anyone and everyone looking to adopt, foster, or volunteer.
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	228575	1	/users/profile/292262	mmalecek	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have volunteered with animal rescue organizations for over 10 years. I have to say that Twin Cities Pet Rescue far exceeds my expectations and is one of the best animal rescue organizations with which I've been involved. TCPR is unique in that it rescues animals that many organizations overlook because they are too old, too sick, or would cost too much money. TCPR is known for pulling animals that need expensive specialty surgeries or emergency veterinary care. The executive director provides nothing but the best care for all of its animals no matter the cost; yet, she is still determined to keep adoption fees low to ensure that these animals can find forever homes. One of my favorite things about TCPR is that its main goal is to find the right home for the animal instead of striving to place as many animals as possible. This is why TCPR has a less than 1% return rate on its adopted animals. During my time with TCPR I have fostered countless animals, volunteered at many events, and adopted two dogs and one cat. I've had nothing but great experiences. I would recommend this organization to anyone.
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	318473	2	/users/profile/409656	Kaitlyn2	Volunteer	5	11/07/2016	Twin Cities Pet Rescue is my favorite rescue out there. They are so unique and so willing to help. Every single person who volunteers with this rescue are so amazing and so readily willing to help. I found my cat and my dog at this rescue. Every single foster animal has a story and their stories are all so different and their foster parents are still willing to help them no matter what. My kitty was a fighter, one of the sick kittens they rescued and they fought for him. They were told to euthanize and his foster mom refused-stayed up with him through the night and bottle fed him and gave him so much love and affection. I owe her my biggest thank you because he is my best friend and has been for the last 5 years. This rescue is very organized and they are so ready to help every single person find their best friend and for every animal to have a second chance at an amazing life and a chance to find their FURever home.

Twin Cities Pet Rescue	317023	2	/users/profile/408214	Jessica_M	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	I am a volunteer for TCPR as a long-time dog foster. We have been lucky enough to have a mix of foster dogs over the years in terms of behavior and temperament. Even when we had dogs who were difficult behaviorally, TCPR worked with us and had behavioralist volunteers who took the time to come to our house and do training. TCPR is an outstanding organization. They provide superb medical care as far as rescues go, and they also exclusively feed their animals high-quality food. They really do go above and beyond in caring for animals, and they don't just take the "easy" or "adoptable" animals. They are willing to put in the time, money, and work to save even those animals that will take time to place in homes.
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	274275	3	/users/profile/363651	Chabotjo	Client Served	5	12/11/2015	I was looking for a cat.  It had been more than a year since my 23 year old rescue cat passed and the retriever I share with my daughter is generally at her house. I was ready for a new furry companion.  After doing a few searches, up popped the 4 year old sweetie I ended up adopting from TCPR. What I thoroughly like about TCPR was how careful they were. At the time, though, I admit I was a little taken aback at the detailed application needed to adopt a 4 year old cat.  Now, after thinking more about it, and after receiving excellent follow up care, I am 100% pleased with their approach.  My Kitty spent the first few days sneezing constantly. TCPR had thorough Vet and vaccination records from their analysis  of the cat I adopted, and those records had been sent to me, so the odds were that all the sneezing was stress.  Still, TCPR did a great job responding to my worry and was willing to have me take her to my Vet to be sure all was OK.  I decided not to put Kitty through more stress by taking her to the Vet yet again (sorry, Vets, but cats don't like visiting you much).  Instead, I waited it out for another few days, and presto!  No more sneezing and happy Kitty - and happy new owner.  It's great to give a home to a pet that needs a rescue home. It's also great to feel confident about the organization that did the initial rescuing. The follow up care was perfect. Highly recommend!

They're an extraordinarily  dedicated and vibrant group of people who carve out time in their already busy lives to find homes for animals that are, in many cases, very challenging to place. Why? Because they recognize that it's about helping some of the most defenseless, innocent, and kind animals in the region. They should be applauded for the incredible undertaking that they have committed to one pet at a time.

I've worked with several other rescues in the past as a foster, adopter and/or volunteer. TCPR far exceeds the norm when it comes to matching pets with their adoptive homes and ensuring it's a good fit for both the animal and the family. They also make a point to take in animals that are otherwise left behind including senior pets, pets with special needs and/or special medical cases.

Twin Cities Pet Rescue	238112	1	/users/profile/323173	happy123	Client Served	5	02/17/2015	I was surprised to read the negative review that was recently posted about Twin Cities Pet Rescue. I adopted a dog from them and they were fantastic. I was treated very well and they responded to my questions promptly. I think people forget that this is a volunteer run non-profit organization. They don't have paid employees like a lot of animal rescues in town. Most of the volunteers have full time jobs, families, and go to school. Volunteering with the rescue is their way of giving back. It'd be nice if people were a little more understanding.

There are numerous pet rescue groups that are fabulous.  This is not one of them.  Kate and her staff is downright rude and nasty to their fosters, clientele and volunteers. Give your time and money elsewhere.

I picked her up from a foster mom who also worked for Pet Rescue. She was very helpful and informative about every question I had. She is the sweetest cat I've ever had and is now a very comfortable member of the family and has brought true happiness and joy to our lives.
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	229396		/users/profile/293047	LindsayS	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I've been a volunteer with Twin Cities Pet Rescue since their inception 5 years ago. I've fostered, helped with home visits and adoptions, and participated in fundraising events. TCPR is different than a lot of other local rescue groups in that they are more focused on quality versus quantity. They don't try to rescue and place the MOST animals, but take the time to select those animals that other rescue groups overlook because they are sick or elderly. They take their time screening applications and completing thorough home visits to make sure the placement is the best fit for both the animal and the adoptive family. This means that less animals are given up and put back in the cycle. The rescue will do everything in their power to help the animal become healthy and successful with the second chance they've been given. This often means very expensive medical care. I'm proud to be a part of this organization and commit to supporting them for the foreseeable future. I'd highly recommend TCPR to anyone looking for a deserving organization to donate to.

Having adopted a cat before, I was impressed by how smooth and thorough their adoption process is. I first inquired about the cat via email and I received a response in the matter of a couple of hours. I completed an online application, scheduled a time to meet my cat and completed the adoption the same day. Thank you TCPR for rescuing my kitty and helping me to adopt! 
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	227050	2	/users/profile/290778	Betsy26	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2014	As a certified vet tech and someone that has volunteered with and worked as administration in rescue for over 10 years, I believe that Twin Cities Pet Rescue is among the best rescues in the US.  They provide nothing but the best veterinary care for their fosters, many rescues go the cheapest route, versus what is in the best interest of the animal.   Every animal that is rescued by TCPR recieves top notch veterinary care.  They have a very talented and knowledgeable dog trainer on staff!  They rescue the pets that other rescue overlook - whether because of age, illness, history, or temperment.  They work within their means, they don't pull animals they don't have space or funds for.  They are one of the few rescues in MN that have community outreach programs, helping to keep local pets in their homes, and to get them the vaccinations and spay/neuter surgeries that they need.  They work hard to focus their rescue work on local pets, pulling from local impounds, puppy mills, and reservations.  It is a small rescue where you get to intimately know one another and the director is a part of every aspect of the rescue.  Administration gets back to you promptly and efficiently.   I could not be happier to be a part of Twin Cities Pet Rescue and those are just a few of the reasons .  I am proud to represent such a wonderful organization with such loving, passionate people. 
Twin Cities Pet Rescue	227025		/users/profile/290752	k987644	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have been a volunteer with Twin Cities Pet Rescue for several years now. TCPR is different from many other rescue organizations, because much of their efforts are focused on the animals that need help most and are at highest risk of euthanasia. These are often animals that are overlooked by potential adopters and even other rescue organizations because they might be older (5+ years), special needs, or sick (while at city impounds). These animals are often harder to find homes for, but TCPR strongly believes they deserve a chance at finding their homes nonetheless.  TCPR is run by a small group of volunteers who work tirelessly to help animals whose lives are on the line, provide them with veterinary care (often providing them with specialty surgeries, dermatology treatments, etc) and find them furever homes. It is truly amazing what this group is able to accomplish with such limited resources.

Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	227884		/users/profile/291561	PamHaar	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have been fostering for MARS for just under 3 years  now. I will never forget the first foster we had--Pookie--she came to us on a transport from Indiana. She was a 9 month old Pomeranian mix. We had her for two weeks and adopted her--they call it "foster fail"--but it is a good thing to fail when they get you to adopt them. Now we paid for Pookie on Sunday. On Monday, I came home and there were cotton balls all over my living room. It looked like it had snowed. Pookie had broken out of her kennel, got a hold of a bag of cotton balls and tossed them all over... this on the day AFTER we paid for her. well, that was 3 years ago and we still have her and still love her--we just do not leave anything out that she can destroy. She is sweet. Now, since then, I cannot tell you how many times we have been asked to take other fosters and sometimes there are special needs dogs that need a little TLC. I have one now that is a skeleton with fur--she is a Pomeranian that was malnourished and also has diabetes. without MARS--where would this cute little girl go? She would have gotten put down for sure. but she has the sweetest personality. Once we get her to put some weight on and get her diabetes under control, she will get adopted by a special person that will love her. MARS makes sure that the right people get the right dog. This place is SPECIAL!! both for dogs and for the people that foster and also adopt. I will continue to foster for this organization because they truly care and do their best for all involved. 
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188599	1	/users/profile/246125	mattbrooks11	Client Served	5	11/14/2013	We had a great experience with MARS. We contacted them when we were searching for a dog. We told them the breed we were looking at, as well as a couple dogs on their website that we liked. After they performed a home visit, they let us know they had a dog that we might be interested in. We went to their office, and that's when we met Deuce! We instantly knew that he was a perfect fit for us, and shortly after we took him home! He has been a great dog and we couldn't be happier. We highly recommend MARS, their awesome staff,and volunteers!
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188587		/users/profile/246110	LBELL	Client Served	5	11/14/2013	In February 2012 my family adopted out lab mix, named Mack, from MARS.  In July of 2011 we had to have our black lab, Dexter, put down because of many health issues related to his old age.  In February we finally felt like we were ready to open our hearts to a new dog.  After doing some research we found MARS, and we decided to adopt through them.  They are located right in our neighborhood, and we love supporting local establishments.  After our adoption application went through, we were invited to attend an open house with dogs that MARS felt might be suited to what we were looking for.  We said that we were just going to look that day, but when I walked into the room where all of the dogs were being held I locked eyes with Mack and knew that I wasn't leaving without him.  Mack was under weight, had many scars on his body, and had open sores on his back from constant chewing.  He was found as a stray in a suburb of Atlanta, and MARS went and rescued him.  The day that we found him he seemed very relaxed, and he didn't mind that there were other dogs in the room with him.  That afternoon we brought him home.  Just two months before adopting Mack, I had lost my dream job and was extremely depressed.  Since I wasn't working, I was the one who spent the most time with Mack in his first few months of his new life.  Mack was very confused when we brought him home, and it became clear very quickly that he didn't trust humans (we suspect that he was abused).  I worked with Mack daily for months, and he has turned into the most social, loving dog that I have ever seen.  He loves his human family as well as his furry kitty sister.  He loves meeting new people and dogs, and, more than anything, wants to just sit in your lap getting hugs.  Mack is truly a wonderful dog who, I feel, saved me as much as I saved him.  We are so grateful to MARS for saving our boys life, and we truly appreciate the work that they do!  Adopting a rescue dog can come with many challenges, but as long as you're willing to put the time in to nurturing your rescue it's all going to be worth it in the end.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188581	3	/users/profile/246102	2dognight	Volunteer	5	11/14/2013	Earlier this year I needed to euthanize my 13 year old chocolate lab, leaving myself and my 2 year old lab alone.  I believe both of us were missing another dog around the house to love and play with so I decided that I wanted to help out fostering rescue dogs.  I had all intentions of just fostering and wanted to foster senior Labradors!  As I looked at the lists of dogs that needed a foster I came upon a very pretty 1 year old Rottweiler/Shepherd mix named Kassidy; could not get any further from a senior lab, which I decided to foster.  Kassidy came to me on a very hot Sunday afternoon in August after a very long transport to Minnesota.  When Kassidy arrived at MARS she needed to be seen by GVS as it seemed there was something going on with her fresh spay wound.  During the first week she was at my house we had to make a couple trips back to GVS to have her wound drained and then finally surgery to take care of the issue.  Throughout all of this she was the most cooperative sweet girl; I just fell in love but kept telling myself you are not going to be a foster failure.  Well about a month later she was adopted and I was heartbroken, until 3 days later I received a call asking if I could take her back as a foster.  Needless to say as of October she is now a permanent part of my family and Im officially a foster failure!  I would like to give kudos to MARS staff for making sure that dogs like Kassidy receive the medical care they need and finding homes for dogs and cats in need.

I had created this super dog friendly environment and I was not certain how to fill the space left by her loss.  I ended up joining the MARS team as a foster, volunteering with event and helping welcome new animals into the rescue.  Through MARS I have learned many things and helped many animals. I also ended up adopting my new pup who loves having new fosters in the house. I am currently on foster #19 and will continue to work with MARS so long as they will have me. My experiences have given me so much and I owe that to the team at Midwest Animal Rescue & Services. Thanks for an incredibly fulfilling opportunity :)

One of the fosters was a perfect fit for my home and we ended up adopting her. We have continued to foster animals that are waiting to be matched with that perfect home.   I think this organization is doing a great service for the community by finding homes for dogs and cats from the local and out of state areas.   
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188481	1	/users/profile/245954	VW5510	Client Served	5	11/13/2013	When I found online a dog that I was very interested in adopting I called the adoption center # and the person gave me as much information as they could on that particular dog (and also what the adoption fee includes).  They also told me to fill out the application that is right at the bottom of the dogs page if I was interested and someone would get back to me after they review my application. MARS I know  then contacted my vet and my references and also had a volunteer come out to my house to do a Home Visit and the volunteer answered any questions that I had.   Once that process was done (this is all done for the safety of the pet) I was able to meet with the dog I was interested in adopting.  One look at him and I adopted him on the spot.  I have seen him go from a shy/scared 1 year old dog grow into a happy, outgoing, loving dog who I love more than I could have ever imagined.  I am so happy that MARS pulled this guy from possibly a high kill shelter and gave him a second chance of life.  Without these rescue groups, these animals may not make it out alive.   Vicki
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188452	3	/users/profile/245914	say54880	Client Served	5	11/13/2013	We had a wonderful experience with MARS as we adopted our sweet boy, Oki.  Our application was handled quickly and we received an email within a day or two after sending the app.  We spoke on the phone within the week and set up a home visit.  The woman who did our home visit was wonderful and we felt very encouraged after her visit.  Boom...we were in and Oki was on his way to being ours.  We set up a meeting time and we went to collect our new family member.  Danielle, Oki's foster mom, went out of her way to get him to us and met us half way so we could avoid many hours in the car.  We needed extra time to introduce our Akita female to Oki who is a white German Shepard. Danielle was great...she knew exactly what to do to help the meeting of the two dogs go smoothly.  They were instant friends.  Danielle went above and beyond what was necessary to assure Oki would be safe and loved...she even gave us one of her shirts so he could sleep with it if he was missing her.  We have stayed in touch via Facebook and this past summer Dannielle and her two children came to visit us at our home.  Oki remembered them all instantly and the reunion was delightful!  It speaks so highly to the care and love he was given while in Danielle's care.  We found MARS to be very thourough and careful as to where Oki would be placed.  I have great respect for the work they do and our experience very rewarding, especially since we got our boy and love him so very much.  MARS is run by a complete staff of volunteers and these people give selflessly of their time and talent, not to mention their finances when needed.  We offered to help in any way possible but unfortunately we live 3 hours north of the Twin Cities so are unable to do much.  We did do a home visit for MARS for a couple who wanted to adopt a GSD pup.  This also went smoothly and was done in a very timely manner.  These people were great, their home was perfect for this pup and within a week they had their sweet boy at home where he was meant to be.  We will always be grateful to MARS for helping Oki get home to us and we will always be willing to volunteer our time to this great organization.  When the time comes, and we are looking for another addition to our family, we won't hesitate to work with MARS again!

Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188411	2	/users/profile/245830	nlysdahl	Volunteer	5	11/12/2013	My fianc and I were looking to expand our family and add another furry baby to our home. We were not 100% sure that we wanted to take on the extra responsibility so decided that becoming a foster would be a great way to start, test the waters. So we contacted MARS after a family member told us about their wonderful experience. We filled out the paperwork and were contacted a few days later and started the process of becoming a foster family. When it was time to take a pup home we felt very supported by everyone at MARS. The email and phone calls were returned promptly and any questions we had were answered. In the end we decided that Princess (now Samwiches or Sammy for short) was the right fit and made it official and turned in the adoption papers. After we are married in April our home search will start. My fianc jokes that the only reason I want to buy a home is to become foster parents again. MARS is a wonderful organization and if you can, please save a life; become a foster parent.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188384	2	/users/profile/245797	kayjay71	Volunteer	5	11/12/2013	Well we started fostering for MARS a few years ago...our first foster was a little pup who ended up staying with us much longer than expected but guessing he was just waiting for the right person to step up for him. We went through alot with that little guy-he was 6-8 weeks when we got him-he was exposed to parvo and ended up contracting. But thanks to our watchful eye and the quick medical care he survived and grew up strong. We had him for 8 months but it was 8 months I wouldn't trade! We took on another foster (this time a little girl) and again it seemed like no one wanted her...which was fine...we loved her a little too much and she's ours now :) We just took on another foster last weekend...we're keeping him too! I can't say that the goal is to keep all the dogs but it's great to know that there is a huge network out there that's helping keep the pets out of the wrong hands! 
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188353	5	/users/profile/245731	jessib	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	My husband and I started looking for a dog in the spring of 2012 after purchasing our house.  We came across MARS through Petfinder, and found the sweetest little face we'd ever seen.  I filled out an application, and had a response back within 2 days.   The adoption process felt like forever, but was really only about 2 weeks.  As someone who had never worked with an animal rescue, I didn't really understand the process, but figured they must do things for a reason.  The placement coordinator I worked with was very kind, caring, and prompt with email responses.  If I was feeling like the process was never going to end, she would reassure me that there were only a few steps left between me and my new puppy.   When I finally met that sweet little face, she was instantly family.  She has brought so much joy, laughter, and warmth to our home...I can't even remember what life was like before my little Daisy Mae.   Those words are written from the standpoint of a MARS adopter.  After falling madly in love with my MARS puppy, I couldn't get MARS out of my head.  I kept thinking that if they hadn't pulled her from the shelter, if someone hadn't fostered her, she wouldn't be with me.  She was the sole inspiration for my desire to volunteer, and help save some puppy lives so that other families could be as happy as mine. Fostering isn't always as glamorous as it may seem (as other reviewers have pointed out).  It can be challenging.  Despite the occasional frustrations, fostering has been the most rewarding thing I've ever done.  My house can't be foster-free for more than 48 hours before I start shopping the "foster needed" section of the MARS webpage.    It's important to keep in mind that fostering is not a ME thing.  If you go into it looking for your perfect dog, you might be disappointed.  It's a selfless offering of ones home to a dog that could otherwise be euthanized.  It's impossible for MARS to know everything (or anything, really) about a dog coming in other than what has been told to them by the shelter.  If you go into it with an open mind and are easy to work with, you will get the help you need to successfully help the dog in your home.   MARS has a huge network of very informed people from all aspects of animal care, and most people are more than willing to share their knowledge for the better good of the pups.  There are opportunities to network through facebook and email to learn as much as you'd ever care to learn about dogs.  MARS has been extremely supportive to me, and is the main reason that I continue to invite their dogs into my home.   So, from the prospective of an adopter, and dedicated volunteer, I ask that you give MARS a chance if you looking for a new family member, wishing to foster dogs in need, or eager to volunteer for an organization that does amazing things every single day.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188350	4	/users/profile/245726	Charliebear	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	I am proud to be a long time Mars foster home.  I have fostered for several other organizations and Mars is one of the best.  They offer lots of training and support to their volunteers and adopters.  Whenever I have a question or concern I can get expert advice almost immediately.  I love the convenience of having Green Vet Clinic affiliated with Mars.  I don't have to pay for vet care for my foster dogs and wait for reimbursement, it's covered up front.  I also love that Mars offers training classes and shot clinics at very affordable prices.  While this rescue is foster based they do have an adoption center where I can schedule meetings with potential adopters and when my foster dog gets adopted all the paperwork is taken care of.  Mars makes volunteering easy.  Please consider volunteering for Mars.  It's so rewarding to know that you are helping save lives.  It's all about the animals.

He was a little naughty and so we immediately  enrolled in an obedience class, then another and another...I realized that he was very gentle with my disabled sister and so we signed up for a Therapy Dog class and he passed with flying colors. He has such a great temp. that he is also a Blood Donor. Our hard work has for sure paid off he is a wonderful dog. I fostered a few more dogs since adopting him but then I fell in love with another foster last yr. and she is one of the sweetest dogs I've ever had, I now have 3 and my home is complete.I would totally recommend adopting from Mars. Are they all perfect? Maybe not...but with time and patience they can be a great family member if you give them a chance.

As I read the reviews I see people taking about how hard it is for MARS to get back to them. People need to remember that we are all volunteers that have a full and or a few part time jobs so we are not available 24/7.  Dogs act differently in most homes due to we don't know their whole story of their up bringing.  It really makes me sad that some people think that fostering these dogs we rescue is cut and dry and because it's not.  You should be doing research on the breed you are going to be fostering and its behaviors before you bring a dog into youre home.  Before you start fostering you should always make a list of questions you want to ask.  There is always going to be something forgotten in any situation, nobody is perfect.  
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188322	6	/users/profile/245684	my4boys	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	We had to put our dog to sleep in 2009 due to medical reasons.  We decided that we wanted to help out the breed and offer a home to the poor unfortunate souls who ended up in need.  We stumbled upon MARS and sent in our application to foster.  My family has been fostering for MARS for over 3 years now and I can't not even count how many dogs we have had come into our lives through this organization.  The people who I have worked with are so devoted and compassionate and truly love every single animal that comes through the door.  So many of the coordinators are spending their own money to be sure all these animals have everything they need, and some fun stuff too.      We have been foster failures twice now and ended up adopting 2 of our fosters, and we are so very thankful to them for bringing our babies into our lives.  We love MARS and I know that my children are learning a very valuable lesson on compassion and caring with each animal that graces our home.  Thank you all for what you do!!!
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188316	5	/users/profile/245675	Heidi and Mike	Client Served	5	11/11/2013	My husband and I found MARS earlier this year when we decided that the time was right to reach out and help dogs find new homes.   We found a dog on the MARS web site that had an urgent need for a foster family.  I quickly sent in our application and received a response several days later.  After providing personal reference information, we received our home visit.  I guess our past pet owner experience, combined with positive reference responses and the ability to provide a safe and inviting home, led to us being approved to foster Benson, a 7 year old Sheltie that came from Joplin, Missouri. As is usually the case, little was known about Bensons past history.  What was apparent was that he had a serious limp.  After allowing him to settle in for several weeks we began noticing that Benson seemed to be in serious pain.  He loved his long walks but I guess that much activity aggravated his condition. We spoke with Bensons volunteer placement coordinator and a visit to their vet was quickly arranged.  Pain medications were prescribed and an appointment for an x-ray was set up.  What that x-ray found was nearly heartbreaking.  Benson had suffered significant trauma which had resulted a broken leg, broken pelvis, dislocated hip, and evidence that both of his front ankles had been broken. All of these had gone untreated for years. As a result of its dislocation, his hip bone was trying to form a new socket but instead was digging into his pelvis bone and causing intense pain.    MARS quickly set Benson up for surgery which involved removing the head of his hip bone and resetting it more in its correct position.  Over time the muscles will create a sort of new socket and the pain has been relieved.   While we nursed Benson through surgery and months of physical therapy, MARS provided and paid for all of the costs involved.  This was truly a dog saved from euthanasia that would otherwise have resulted due to his medical condition. And of course, after all of that we became a "foster failure" and adopted him.  We hadnt intended on adding a new member to our family when we started this, but we fell in love and found there was no way we could let him go.   Throughout our entire experience we found MARS and all of their volunteers to be professional, caring, and totally involved.  We feel that their processes and procedures help provide the best experience for the animals they serve.  As volunteers, we are just thankful to be a part of it.  Benson is doing well but will always have a limp. At least, thanks to MARS, he will no longer be in pain.  
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188311	6	/users/profile/245670	danniogirl	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	I have volunteered with MARS for over 2 years and have enjoyed the experience tremendously.  I have worked with another rescue in the past and MARS level of commitment to not only the animals but the volunteers is exemplary.  I have become involved with almost every aspect of the rescue because I was give the autonomy to carve my own path and be involved at whatever level suits me best.  The people of MARS are highly committed to helping as many dogs and cats as they can and they do it with the best care possible.  I praise them for aiming high and staying dedicated to the welfare of animals all over the midwest.  Without them thousands would have never seen the love a family can give.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	188212	7	/users/profile/245518	Bergie	Volunteer	5	11/09/2013	First off, to WORK as a VOLUNTEER in animal rescue, you must have compassion, as well as a passionate commitment to help animals in need of rescue.   Not all of the animals CAN be saved.   There are just too damn many needing rescue.  And some may be physically too far gone, or they have been so abused, neglected, or unsocialized,  that there is almost no possibility of them ever surviving and thriving in a typical family home setting.   Which frequently does not keep rescues from trying---if the dog or cat ultimately does not make it, it will at least have known some measure of care and love in its lifetime, and it will NOT die alone, never having felt a comforting word or loving touch. Most  people not involved with Rescue, have no idea how it actually works.   I know that I didn't 8 years ago when I had to euthanize my beloved companion.   I couldn't tolerate the empty house, so I spent weeks looking at dogs on PetFinder.  I didn't realize that I couldn't just walk into a "store" and pick out the dog I wanted to adopt.   Rescue animals are not sitting in kennels or cages in a pet store or humane society, just waiting for someone to plop down some money and take them home right then and there.   Rescue animals are being cared for in the homes of volunteers.   After the animals' initial intake (which includes basic vetting and vaccinations), they go to the homes of VOLUNTEERS, to be trained, housebroken, socialized... to learn what grass feels like under their feet.   To learn that they don't have to scrounge or fight for their next meal.   To learn to trust humans again.   To gain some sense of security from learning that they won't just be dumped somewhere when their human tires of them, gets a new job, or has a baby.  Sometimes the dogs come from as far away as  Missouri, or Georgia, or Iowa.   Sometimes the dogs come from nearby Reservations.   Sometimes the dogs come from neglectful, abusive hoarders or even breeders, right here in Minnesota. What does not change, is that the dogs and cats are taken into homes and cared for by VOLUNTEERS.   Volunteers who usually have another full-time job; a job that actually pays the bills.  And the volunteers have families, and commitments. . . just like "normal" people :) And Rescues usually tend to do ALOT of due diligence before allowing someone to adopt an animal.  There are home visits to be made to ensure that the animal is going to a safe home, not one involved in dogfighting, or meth labs.   There are background checks and references required...   All of these take time, and all of these are done by volunteers.   Volunteers who do have other jobs.    I volunteer with the German Shepherd department of MARS.   I have fostered over 30 dogs in the last 2 1/2 years.    I will continue to volunteer with MARS BECAUSE of Heather and Tracy.   Heather puts "her people's" welfare first, followed closely by that of the animals.  Heather knows dogs, and she knows people.  When I want to foster a certain dog that will not fit in well with my two GSD's, Heather lets me know and steers me toward a more suitable match.   When I am having training or medical issues with my foster dog, Heather has the answers or puts me in contact with the resources who do.  Heather is the glue that holds the department together, and we are an extremely committed group of volunteers....committed to the animals, and to supporting each other.  Tracy can be too blunt for some people.  She is not always the most diplomatic because she is ALL ABOUT THE ANIMALS.   She takes in the most extreme cases, those that would not stand a chance anywhere else.   Dogs that are dog aggressive, dogs that are people aggressive or food aggressive, dogs that have been so abused that they have no idea how to behave in order to fit into "the pack."   And she takes in a LOT of them at once.   So, YES, it is very noisy.   And she works her butt off to rehab them so that someday, they MIGHT get a chance to live with a normal family.   And if that is never gonna happen for them, she keeps them and cares for them until it's time for their walk across the Rainbow Bridge.  And they don't walk it alone.   She is there, speaking comforting words, and caressing them with possibly the only kind hand that they have ever known.   She is a warrior for animal rights.   She has no time to speak softly to people who just don't get it.   But she is definitely a warrior that I want on MY side, and that of my animals'. To sum it up, I trust Heather and Tracy implicitly, to do what is best for the Rescue's animals.   If they don't trust a person to care for an animal, I would not trust that person either.   "If My Dog Doesn't Like You, Neither Will I."   Well, MY dogs LOVE Heather and Tracy.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	156916	5	/users/profile/208115	karmaspin	Volunteer	1	05/01/2013	I fostered a dog from this rescue. The dog did not like children and bit both of my kids. My son is left with a scar on his cheek tghat is pretty prominent. I reported to MARS that the dog did not like children and was a biter. I was told that it must be a problem with my kids. My children know how to treat a dog. I didn't want to see anyone else get bit. They weren't willing to listen to my concerns on the biting. I wouldn't foster or adopt from them. 
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	151454	6	/users/profile/202206	Virginia12	Client Served	1	03/21/2013	WE had a horrible experience with MARS.  We adopted a puppy that had Parvo and she died within 4 days of our adoption and we spent in total about $3000.  Broke our hearts.  They are refusing to refund our adoption fee.  They are refusing to reply.  The bigger issue is that we were allowed to adopt a puppy off of transport and we had no clue she would potentially be contagious.  They don't have a quarantine policy or at least they don't enforce it.  Never disclosed possible health risks.  Told us the vet had looked at her so we would assume that there were no immediate issues.  Have read about many good experiences but if you have problems, they are difficult to get resolved.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	149204	10	/users/profile/198777	Angel 20	General Member of the Public	1	02/10/2013	I would like to share with you my experience with MARS: I applied to foster a dog - German Shepherd, in what I thought was, and was impressed upon me, as urgent foster care needed. The first 2 dogs I was told were placed with fosters unless "I wanted to interrupt their new environment" and adopt. Of course not, my intent was to help rehabilitate and help out a dog in need.We recently lost our Beautiful and Beloved German Shepherd to cancer and hip dysplasia after having her 12.5 years. We wanted to open our home to help out another dog since we had the room, patience, experience and need. So my intent was to foster and get the dog 100% ready to go to the right home and at my cost. I mentioned 2 dogs at first (it didnt matter to me  they just both looked like they might have a hard time being adopted so I picked challenges). I was redirected to another which is fine. We started the process and I was told by Heather that she loved my application and that I would be a great foster. Unbeknownst to me, they were shipping this dog from MO. Which again is fine, I assumed they knew what they were doing and would be professional. I had asked early on when I could meet this dog (with every intent to bring it home, but wanted to acclimate it to me and my family before it was abruptly relocated  at the time I did not know it was in MO). I was then asked if I was even serious about bringing this dog in and then in a rude manner asked if I was serious about adopting or fostering. This took me aback as it did not even seem a rational statement. I was just trying to approach the process in a reasonable manner. I said I had every intent to foster and work with the dog, but would like to be able to adopt if I changed my mind (which I thought would be ok). Just a question.She then started to pressure me and talk in circles about adopting dogs. I dismissed her ignorance and just wanted to move forward  no need to meet the dog ahead of time I guess. Then I get an email from another woman called Tracy who said that she will take over my case from here because she is closer to the Twin Cities and Heather is busy. I was received a voicemail later that day left by Tracy asking me to call her back. I am certain that she had not intended for the entire message to be recorded as I had 4.5 minutes of her yelling and swearing at her dogs - (no wonder they bark at her so much  my dogs never did that). I had a bad feeling after talking with her because she sounded unstable and ignorant, but thought I likely wouldnt have to deal with her too much.She called me two days later and very abruptly and pointedly told me that she called our vet and that our pets were not up to date and hadnt been seen in years, and that we needed to give her the name and number of a vet with updated records. Well I did give her the name of the vet and have the records to prove that our pets are up to date. She had twisted so many words and statements around that I was panicking trying to think of solutions and where else I might have taken the dog and cats to for vet services. I told her that I would have to call her back after contacting the vet and looking for additional information. Why would I give her the name of our vet if I was trying to be deceptive? By the way I did later find their records and my dog wasnt even due for a visit until 11/13 and up to date on everything. The vet didn't even have the right paperwork, dates or names.Tracy then tells me that she is pulling my application because the last 2 years of my dogs life was unaccounted for. My dog was current (I have found all of the records) and very healthy (she deteriorated quite quickly towards the end). She was 12.5 years and even last year people asked me if she was a puppy yet as she looked so healthy and young. She was in phenomenal shape and very pampered. My husband called her to talk to her because the family was shocked that they cancelled the home visit 20 minutes before it was scheduled via email. Tracy then proceeded to tell him that we made our dog suffer and did not try to get her medical help and that is why she died and probably suffered without medication. THIS IS NOT TRUE and she didnt even know what she was talking about. HOW DARE HER! Our dog was not to the point where she was in pain or needed pain management. She was medically supervised and this person  Tracy had no idea as to what she was even talking about. She spoke out of complete ignorance of the situation and tried to lead a scenario in a derogative direction. I can't believe that someone would even go there. We simply could not find hard records of the diagnosis upon her demand- this was a difficult time for us. Yet she had no problem shipping a dog from another state before checking this.Tracy is clearly deprived of integrity, character and social skills. I find it very odd that they would ship a dog all of that way and change their mind at the very last minute - this seems very unprofessional and self serving - I am concerned by their lack of professionalism and tact. After digging a little deeper it appears as this woman as a special fondness for the type of dog that we were going to adopt - and likely wanted to bring the dog into her home - but why is it necessary to drag us through hell in the process - we didn't care what this dog looked like. In conclusion, I see that this program manipulates rules and processes to suit and benefit the needs of people within, not the dogs. If an "organization" such as this, rather put a dog in the care of someone that yells and swears at their pets that way and encourages crating then I clearly understand that this is not an organization for me. It is a tragedy that someone like that is in a position to make judgment calls period.  I am disgusted with the entire process that we went through. This place is a horrible example of dog rescue and in no way, shape or form should be pretending to do so. I don't want to discourage people from trying to rescue dogs in need. I think it goes deeper than that and starts with the people that are corruptly running this organization. They are the ones that need to be let go. They should get the right people running it and what they have now is just crazy. 
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	130821	6	/users/profile/176327	lsilhouette	Volunteer	1	10/29/2012	Be very careful when you foster a dog from MARS!! I'm military and i've fostered dogs all lover the world but I've never experienced anything like this. I completed the foster care application online Wednesday and subsequently I was instructed to pick up the dog at another foster's home on Saturday. However, there were several red flags, first there was never any home visit, the details I was given were not based on any qualified person that had conducted any form of  temperament testing. I was told this dog was 3-6 months old, sweet, shy and submissive puppy that was "great" with other dogs but had been a shelter with his equally adorable sister (who was being fostered by the lady I picked him up from), no one could give me any basic information (if he was neutered, able to be boarded, etc). I picked the dog up alone and he was a lot bigger than described and seemed to be some type of pit bull mixed puppy, the kennel was huge and was being held together with zip ties and a defective door. The other foster and I noticed several issues with the paperwork-her puppy was listed as 6 months old and mine, her brother was listed as 3 months old, huh? This gave me concern because I have five children (one away at college) ages 21-9 and  I have a one year old Jack Russell Terrier Shorty that is neutered (weighing 10 pounds). On the ride home he broke out of the kennel and was loose in my car, luckily I was close to home and I would later realize I was lucky to be alone in the car as well. So I did a basic assessment at home alone, I am not a trained professional but I was able to determine basic shelter behavior, lots of jumping, lack of muscle tone, food and toy aggression, problems walking on a leash, etc. What I wasn't prepared for was the aggressive behavior towards small children! He would be aggressive towards my 9 yo twin boys, who showed no interest in him, my other children are 18, 17 and he had no problem with them. But constantly growled and seemed to stalk my sons who were in the theater room (that's sound proof) playing a video game, and the dog was growling trying to get in. My neighbor is a firefighter and has actual animal behavior experience, even he noticed the stalking and went to the fire house to get me a safer kennel from there as a loner, even on a walk the dog showed an unnatural aggression towards small children. The dog spent the night in this kennel in my heated garage. The following morning I sent an email and was told it could take some time to find him a new foster. I informed them, I had agreed to foster a dog not endanger my children and if this dog was not picked up within hours I'd call my local shelter. I was given an address to take the dog to and my neighbor zip tied the kennel again and I dropped him off. This could've ended badly, he was also aggressive towards cats and small dogs only, please be careful.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	108736	4	/users/profile/147989	jisell9036	Client Served	1	04/01/2012	I saw five star ratings on Yelp about this place. I couldn't believe it. NO. I tried adopting a dog I saw online. I applied, and for a week of being strung along, thinking I had a chance, all of a sudden I was told that I couldn't adopt the dog because another party was interested. Also, I found out about the policy about not moving a dog from one "foster situation" to another "foster situation." I'm moving to my new townhome on the 14th/15th. I was either going to have my parents look after my new dog or have them hold the til I moved in so it would be a really nice transition. I thought I was being responsible by providing accomodations until I moved in. Apparently they used that to their advantage and strung me along for a week while I was getting more and more attached to the dog by the minute. And then poof! I can't have the dog I want and I'm being asked to compromise for some other dog that is coming in and I know nothing about. I would never recommend this place to anyone. They take forever to get back to you. I received one tiny email per day from these people, asking about checking out my place and everything, when really I didn't even have a chance due to their policy. I suffered minor heartbreak from being so excited about adopting a dog for the first time. THANKS FOR NOTHING MARS, YOU MADE THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EXCITING/FUN INTO A FRUSTRATING HEARTBREAK.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	96557	3	/users/profile/112722	Wendy234	Volunteer	1	08/25/2011	I have fostered 2 dogs for this organization, and there is clearly no situation that they consider to be "extreme".  The first dog I fostered clearly had a behavior issue.  I found out that subsequent to my returning him to be fostered by other people, he bit 3 different people - 2 of them were children.  They still adopted him out to a family. While fostering the second dog (thinking the first was a fluke), I was told I could take the dog to my vet for xrays, and MARS would reimburse my vet the normal fee they pay their affiliate.  Should I be surprised they haven't followed through on this yet?   I came to Guidestar looking for their 990, and to confirm the name of the executive director. If you want to donate to a rescue organization, there are many others that are better managed.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	89677	3	/users/profile/102043	kgese	Client Served	1	06/06/2011	If I could give them less than one star I would.  I fostered a dog for this agency that viciously attacked my Boston Terrier almost killing him.  They came and took the dog back, but when they re-listed her on their website they listed her as "good with other dogs."  When I expressed my outrage they took that down, but did not list that she shouldn't be around other dogs or tell any part of my story.  They are willing to misrepresent this dog to get her fostered or adopted. 
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	89583	4	/users/profile/101892	Pam G.	General Member of the Public	1	06/03/2011	They currently have a dog on their website that I have seen brutally attack a smaller dog.  They put that dog back up for adoption saying it was good with other dogs.  Please be careful if getting a dog from this organization.
Midwest Animal Rescue & Services	85954	3	/users/profile/96054	Annoyed	General Member of the Public	1	04/15/2011	It seems that an operation that was anxious to get dogs and cats into permanent homes would get back to a potential adopter in a reasonable time. I have been waiting  since April 6th to get a call or at least an e-mail about meeting the dogs.  Gaaaa.
Great River Greening	110682		/users/profile/150657	Fit S.	Volunteer	5	04/24/2012	I have volunteered with Great River Greening since 2008. I have been a supervisor since 2010.  Great River Greening is an organization that actually gets things done. They engage the community through volunteer opportunities for all. I look forward to working with them in the future. 
Great River Greening	110680		/users/profile/150655	rjstenseng	Volunteer	5	04/24/2012	Great River Greening is an excellent organization committed to community-based restoration of natural areas.  I became a volunteer with Great River Greening when I heard that they were assisting in restoring the natural habitat in a Scientific and Natural Area near my home.  I was impressed with the commitment to improving the natural environment in my community.  I went through the Great River Greening training to become a volunteer supervisor; a volunteer assisting other community individuals or groups as they participate in organized events focused on natural area restoration.  After three years of volunteering with Great River Greening and working with numerous volunteers, I can say without reservation that this organization is unsurpassed in quality and results, in their mission of restoring natural areas in Minnesota.  What works with Great River Greening?  The staff is well organized and skilled in both human relations and the natural ecosystems associated with restoring natural areas.  Events happen as advertized.   The volunteers (supervisors and community members) are welcomed, trained, provided the tools and the background information needed to accomplish the assigned task, are given positive feedback during and after the event, and leave with a sense of completion and accomplishment.  The volunteers understand that they have invested in and can take ownership in making their community a better place for themselves and for the natural world.  Great River Greening enables all that to happen.  Without Great River Greening, our communities would be less inviting and our natural areas would be less robust and diverse.  I support Great River Greening and their mission of community-based restoration of natural area.
Great River Greening	109970		/users/profile/149780	TRM1	Board Member	5	04/16/2012	As a new Board member, I am impressed by the many community and volunteer-based activities GRG organizes, as well as the outstanding commitment to ecological restoration. GRG is an outstanding organization that emphasizes grassroots efforts. One of my favorite programs is the Science Area Teens Network, where teenagers volunteer a part of a Saturday to work on a restoration project and learn about the importance of maintaining the well-being of their natural environment.
Great River Greening	109364		/users/profile/149003	Tim McGraw	Board Member	5	04/09/2012	I have worked with Great River Greening for over 5 years and have been a Board member for the past two years.  I love that we work collaboratively in partnerships across communities to acheive tangible improvements for key habitat areas and waterways in Minnesota.  And, at the end of any project, we can look back at the work and see our dirty hands and the clear progress for the environment.  Go Greening!
Great River Greening	109355		/users/profile/148987	cvue22	Volunteer	5	04/09/2012	Great River Greening has been one of my favorite non-profits to partner up with because I work for a non-profit organization myself.  The great things we've done together isn't forgotten but will strengthen our partnership and organization as a whole.  I thank you.
Great River Greening	109346		/users/profile/148978	Marie O.	Volunteer	4	04/09/2012	Employees from the Braun Intertec Bloomington office got their hands dirty to help restore the Conservation Corridor in Woodbury, Minnesota. Braun Intertec volunteers spent several strenuous hours removing invasive species and hauling non-native brush to preserve the habitat for rare birds and species including the bobolink, meadow lark and Henslows sparrow.  The work done will help to ensure the prairie is allowed to thrive for generations to come! 
Great River Greening	109344		/users/profile/148976	pedro55116	Donor	5	04/09/2012	I've been long impressed with Great River Greening's ability to mobilize volunteers for large scale restoration projects. I've participated in some projects and am always impressed with volunteers' commitment and enthusiasm for planting native species and removing buckthorn and other invasives. Volunteers know they are making a tangible, long lasting difference. Great River Greening is very strategic and looks for opportunities to stay relevant. Recent campaigns have involved planting a million acorns and now they are focusing on restoring land habitat for better water quality and protection. Great River has also been involved in protecting and preserving a sacred native American site in Mendota Heights.
Great River Greening	109187	1	/users/profile/148705	JimZ	Volunteer	5	04/06/2012	I have volunteered for years with Great River Greening.   They are an outstanding organization and employee some of the most intelligent people when it comes to conservation, restoration, etc.  They really understand various ecosystems such as wellands, rivers, forests, prairies, farmland, etc.   Not only does Greening understand the science behind how all these ecosystem work and interelate, they take the time to teach us layman about these systems and how they benefit not only the environment but the communities we live in.  I have been so impressed with my experience as a volunteer with Greening that I became a board member last year.  My involvement with Greening has been extremely fullfilling.  I have been involvde with them on several projects that involved hundreds of volunteers and thousands of trees and shrubs.  Not once have I ever been disappointed with the level of service, care, involvement, and educating that Greening provides.
Great River Greening	109182		/users/profile/148695	mkaphing01	Board Member	5	04/06/2012	Great River Greening is a top notch organization that has the unique ability to preserve prairies, forests, and waters by coordinating the talents, efforts and resources of the various communities it serves as well as large corporations.  
Great River Greening	109135		/users/profile/148622	Cath G.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	I teach Environmental Science at an urban community college. Since 1998, I have worked at Great River Greening events with groups of my students almost every semester. I offer these events to my students for extra credit and as a way for them to gain experience in hands-on ecological restoration work, while also studying about habitat loss and fragmentation in class. The events are well organized and planned by staff with extensive ecological knowledge and expertise. I have had more than 400 students participate in these events throughout the years, and many have benefitted greatly from what they learned and experienced. Some have even brought friends or family back to the sites to see what they have done. Many of our students have never done this sort of work before or had a direct connection with making a difference in the natural environments of their community. I am grateful to the staff of Great River Greening for providing this opportunity for my students and me. 
Great River Greening	84532		/users/profile/93776	allesist	Volunteer	4	03/31/2011	I am an intern with Great River Greening. I find their cause to be an ideal one in the environmental field, since it both helps the environment and engages and educates the community-- their team of professionals determines what needs to be done to restore natural areas, and they engage the community in doing so. I've also found their staff to be friendly and welcoming, and their events to be an enjoyable experience.
Great River Greening	84513		/users/profile/93754	Bridget R.	Volunteer	4	03/31/2011	I worked for Great River Green as an intern for almost a year. They are a wonderful nonprofit organization with an endless drive to make our Minnesota communities a little greener each day. The employees are tireless workers and the volunteers have amazing spirit. The work environment is very comfortable and you always feel welcome as soon as you walk in! 
Great River Greening	83974		/users/profile/93085	mecr	Volunteer	4	03/29/2011	I've volunteered for Great River Greening for 3 years, and really enjoy the events that they host.  The restoration events are well thought, the right amount of work, and definitely get work done.   I have volunteered for other ecosystem restoration nonprofits and the difference that is seen immediately when you show up to a site; somebody is there to greet and show you to the registration booth, maybe grab a coffee or water, and then converse with your group supervisor until everyone shows up.  I also like that volunteers are shown why a certain exotic species is bad; not just that it has to be removed.  
Great River Greening	83959		/users/profile/93071	CourtneyM	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	Great River Greening is a local non-profit organization working to restore the metro Minneapolis-St. Paul community, by removing invasive species and re-introducing native species to the area. This organization is dedicated to encouraging local citizen to support the local community through environmental volunteer efforts. I have enjoyed my volunteer time with Great River Greening. It is always a pleasure working outside to improve the environment no matter what the weather conditions are. I have volunteer with Great River Greening on days where it is only 1 degree outside and snowing, to thunderstorms, to beautiful sunny days. The Great River Greening staff is helpful and friendly. 
Great River Greening	83948		/users/profile/93055	amberhill423	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I love volunteering with Greening.  The outdoor events not only are completing a needed ecological service, but allow people from different communities to interact.  Plus you get some sunshine and exercise.  It's an overall great experience and I love the energy at the events.
Great River Greening	83826		/users/profile/92907	laurak	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I have volunteered for Great River Greening for the past three years. Great River Greening is very well organized and offers fun and interesting volunteer projects. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and welcoming. I've always felt appreciated by the organization. Some of the projects I've worked on include restoring native habitat, planting trees, clearing out invasive plants, restoring shoreline, making a rain garden, collecting seeds, and more. One can also volunteer in public relations projects such as staffing booths at various events like the Living Green Expo; a wonderful opportunity to network with other Green organizations and meet other volunteers. They also serve a nice lunch after the project is complete! This is especially appreciated after working hard in the fresh air. A top notch organization to volunteer for!
Great River Greening	83812		/users/profile/92893	Reun	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	Great River Greening has been the best organization to volunteer for my far.  The management is very organized and has the site set up for volunteers so that their is no confusion upon arrival.  The day is planned to the minute so that volunteer time is not wasted.  Most events include a brief discussion of the history of the area in order to provide a broader context for the project and give volunteers a sense of ownership in the work they are doing because they feel a part of the area.  At the conclusion of the event, GRG does a presentation which sums up the accomplishments of the day. Overall, great leadership, great events, and great fun with GRG!
Great River Greening	83184		/users/profile/92071	ms.marney	Volunteer	5	03/24/2011	I've worked with Great River Greening for about a decade. I love the organization! I've worked as a volunteer, and a volunteer supervisor.  Greening works with the government organizations, and corporations to find sites around the metro area to restore to native vegetation.  They organize volunteers into work groups and then depending on the task of the day we clear invasive species, plant natives, build rain gardens or anything necessary to restore the site.  Greening visits sites over the years, so I've had the pleasure of working at two sites over the years that are very special. The Flint Hills Resource site has changed from a buckthorn choked mess to a  lovely oak savanna.  I have also worked at the Mendota Bridge site over the years, this sacred area had been urbanized, and then fallen into disrepair. When the community was discussing how to use the site, developers were interested in building condominiums, but through an effort by the community, environmental groups, and the native American tribe in the area, the open space was preserved for habitat and again as a sacred site.  The mission of the organization is outstanding - bringing habitat to area's around the river. Also, the volunteer work is very satisfying, it's good physical labor, and you can see the fruits of your work in a day, and over the years.  I love Greening. 
Great River Greening	83127		/users/profile/91994	Gordon H.	Volunteer	5	03/24/2011	The work of Great River Greening transforms both people and places.  People are transformed as they see their efforts make a meaningful difference in their community.  Places are transformed with native plantings that restore the lands to their natural beauty.  Imagine neglected lands overrun with invasive, non-native plants.  Then imagine a weed patch turning into a wildflower prairie.  Or a forgotten property becoming a reborn oak savanna.  Or a threatened woodland evolving back into a healthy maple and basswood forest.  That is the work of Great River Greening. And that's why I keep coming back as a volunteer.
Great River Greening	83081		/users/profile/91917	Daniel	Volunteer	5	03/24/2011	Great River Greening is by far one of the best organizations I have volunteered with.  They really appreciate and value their volunteers, and get you up and working quick.  It never feels like they are wasting your time, there is always important, vital work to be done.  They help to restore native plant communities, and the health of the soil and water in important and vulnerable natural areas along the Mississippi, Minnesota, and St Croix rivers.They are able to attract and manage a large number of volunteers.  It is very encouraging to see such a vast number of volunteers showing up on a weekend to help save a portion of the planet.  Normally we are cutting out buckthorn, and hauling brush.  It's a very good workout, and you get a visceral understanding of the unique environment of the site - true "hands on learning".  Working in a crew, you get to meet like-minded people, and everyone has a unique perspective or factoid to share.  I love how community is created while at the same time "real" work is being accomplished - invasive plant species are ripped out, native plants and wildlife habitat is allowed to flourish, and at the end of the day, everyone knows they did something good.

Great River Greening	36377	5	/users/profile/37162	barbara20	Volunteer	5	04/21/2010	Great River Greening not only leads and supports community based initiatives for the preservation and restoration of natural areas, it brings together business, education, enviromental professionals and community action in sustainable partnerships to foster long term interest in ecological stewardhip.  All of my experiences have been professional, well managed and their passion shows.
Great River Greening	36343	5	/users/profile/37133	mikimoto123	Volunteer	5	04/21/2010	My experience at the planting events has been very good.  The events are very well organized, and volunteers are treated very well.  Coordinators and staff provide excellent directions and instructions.  Planting events provide a great experience for everyone,  particularly families.
Great River Greening	35771	8	/users/profile/36571	cassandra-moe	Volunteer	5	04/14/2010	I've been volunteering with Great River Greening for over three years. This organization does important ecological restoration work. They involve people from the local community in restoring prairie ecosystems. The volunteers work hard, but always have fun, and by the end of the work session, two things always happen: lunch is served, and awareness is raised in the community. The events are well-organized. The staff is knowledgable, helpful, and fun. Great River Greening events always seem to bring out the best in the group of volunteers, and that kind of consistent experience must be attributed to the organization's staff. Because I usually bring a group of students from the two-year college that I teach at, and I require that those students write about their experiences, I know that Great River Greening's work changes lives in addition to restoring ecosystems.
Great River Greening	35480	5	/users/profile/36312	bob11	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	This organization has provided a great  opportunity for me to get involved with like minded people. It's helped me to have a positive impact on the physical environment. Plus on people new to issues impacting quality and richness of life. I worked with inner city kids that had their first experience with planting a tree. It's been deeply rewarding to me to see their interest in the natural world come to life. I would not have had this without Great River Greening.
Great River Greening	35455	8	/users/profile/36285	greeningfan	Volunteer	5	04/11/2010	Greening is a great place for volunteers interested in making a tangible difference in the metro's natural areas. They engage all kinds of volunteers in projects that bring a richer understanding of conservation and natural resource management. One of the best things about Greening is the way they strive to bring in the local community on projects. I am lucky to have had a wonderful internship experience as well as acting as volunteer supervisor at a few events. Greening allows volunteers to take on a lot of responsibility, which allows for greater learning and growth as well as a better sense of stewardship for the land.
Great River Greening	35136	8	/users/profile/35977	39999	Volunteer	5	04/08/2010	I love volunteering with Great River Greening for it is extremely well organized fills a need in our metro area.  They help foster community and a sense of respect for nature and living things, for after helping to restore an area, one tends to claim it as one's own and want to protect it.  I especially like Great River Greening's work with less affluent teens, both in the field and the classroom, planting the seeds for leadership and future work in ecology.  At events, Great River Greening does a good deal of informal teaching, not just about invasive/exotic plants but how removal of those plants can have an effect on that area.  Having gotten into Great River Greening, I find Great River Greening has gotten into me and my flower garden is now one of native plants.
Great River Greening	35024	8	/users/profile/35867	kiwi9467	Volunteer	5	04/08/2010	This is a top notch environmental volunteerism organization. I've worked with them for several years, doing invasive species removal and site clean-up and planting, on helping their management to plan education initiaives for volunteers, and on supervising volunteers on work sites (working alongside them all the while).Independently and by conicidence, my place of work screened many volunteer organizations for an Earth Day initiative we started last year, and found this one to be the most professional they came across. They are well deserving of my praise, and of your precious time and money.
Great River Greening	34912	5	/users/profile/35764	giliasavage	Volunteer	5	04/07/2010	When I first volunteered with GRG, I helped remove invasive buckthorn in a park near the twin cities. It was a wonderful experience and I was extremely impressed by how smoothly the project went especially considering there were hundred of volunteers.  At all the events I have volunteered at over the last five years, GRG has done an amazing job of getting the community involved in restoration work.  I have been involved in projects that range from building rain gardens to removing invasive species and helping with erosion control. As an ecologist, I appreciate the work that GRG does at promoting native plants and wildlife and improving water quality in the region. GRG also does an amazing job at reaching out to the community and people who have never been involved in restoration work. After I volunteered a few times with GRG, I became a volunteer supervisor and helped lead groups of volunteers at the events. Being a supervisor really showed me the impact that GRG has on the local community. I have had the opportunity to hear the stories of dozens of volunteers including those of elementary school students who cant wait to show their friend the rain garden they helped plant, those of employees of businesses located across the street from a restoration event, who are excited about going on walks in the newly restored area during their lunch breaks, and those of teenagers who had never thought twice about the parks next door. By making the tasks at each volunteer event straight forward and having the work broken down into tangible units, GRG allows people with any background to make a significant impact on the environment and to feel a connection with and a sense of ownership of their public lands.

Want to learn improv have some of the best improvisers in the state teach you! They not only provide great entertainment, but they teach classes, and give back to the community.  
Huge Improv Theater	111560		/users/profile/151910	Freya	Donor	5	05/08/2012	I have donated my time and money to HUGE Theater in Uptown. They are a fantastic community of some of the most talented people you will ever meet. Never have I failed to attend and not be in tears from laughing so hard. Not only that they have the most dedicated volunteers who work extremely hard to make HUGE a home for everyone. From the Bearded Men running the bar, to the amazingly friendly chipper people working the front desk. HUGE Theater is the best place to go to have an inexpensive night out with great laughs and a crisp cold beer.

Huge Improv Theater	111720		/users/profile/152118	Cosima K.	Donor	5	05/10/2012	HUGE is my very favorite place to be in the Twin Cities. I love theater and when it comes to improv theater it just doesn't get any better than HUGE. They have some of the most talented people I have ever seen on their stage. It's different every time, but there IS one constant: It is always amazing. Also, it's super cheap - 5 or 10 bucks for a night of perfect entertainment - it doesn't get much better than that! I've brought a variety of people with me, from friends from all over to my parents and my sister's Bachelorette Party and each and every time it was a success. I have yet to bring someone who afterwards says they did not enjoy it. These guys are just doing such a wonderfully amazing job both on and off-stage. The atmosphere is welcoming, heartfelt and friendly. The volunteers who work there are open for conversation and make everything to make everyone feel appreciated and at home. And once you know that they are volunteers who do not get paid a cent, your amazement just grows. And on stage I have seen the widest variety of shows, from musical improv to solo to Film Noir-inspired and political shows, from the all stars at Show X to the Newbies at Space Jam. It's different every time and I never ceased to discover new nuances. The tips ask for criticism too, but I have none. I'm just proud of the people that run HUGE and I will always keep coming back and support them because they have enriched my life with so many wonderful experiences.

Before HUGE came along, there were only a few select opportunities to see long form and the actors were required to PAY to perform most of the time!  Not only does HUGE theater give us something funny and intelligent (most of the time) to watch, but the volunteer effort that put this theater together has been amazing.  To my knowledge, no one has ever been paid for the work they have done, from the "board"- the talented founders of the theater, to the nightly box office, bar and tech staff.  HUGE has provided a welcoming community for actors and theater lovers alike.  
Huge Improv Theater	111579		/users/profile/151934	Sarah56	Volunteer	5	05/08/2012	HUGE Improv theater is an artist led non profit company, dedicated to being awesome.  Long Form Improv finally has a home in Minneapolis and it couldn't be happier.  You can tell by the awesome way it lives, breathes, and cultivates creativity each and every day inside HUGE.  Whether you are a first time improver, a seasoned vet or somehere in between, HUGE is the place to be.  The first thing you will notice when you enter HUGE, is that someone will be nice to you.  Truly!  Not "Minnesota" nice just plain nice.  Smiles, welcomes and thank you's are all given out fast and freely at HUGE.  This niceness encourages a sense of community a place where you can feel free to be yourself and to believe that that is good enough.  This is escpecially helpful when you are a nervous new student, not knowing what to expect, questioning if you are good enough, quick enough, smart enough.  One smile from Jill, Butch or Nels let's you know that it will be okay, all they ask is that you bring a willingness to play and to accept the possibilities.  HUGE also brings in visiting artists, to hold workshops which is invaluable to Minnesota improvers, who may not be able to travel to train.  HUGE also gives back to the community by holding improv sessions all over the metro, to those that need some good cheer.  So, next time you want to laugh, learn and feel a part of an awesome human experience, check out HUGE Improv Theater and get ready to smile.

I was living in Korea, performing with Seoul City Improv, but I was rooting for my hometown improv theater with all I had. I watched as people donated time, effort, money, consultation, and optimism in droves to get the theater opened. After returning from Korea I immediately went to HUGE and asked to volunteer. They said yes! Hurrah! It's been a pleasure volunteering as a Technician and Box Office Attendant at HUGE. Everyone is playful, has fun and wants nothing more than for the theater to succeed and grow the improv audience in Minneapolis. We've made good progress so far with good people, but we have a lot of work to do. I'm happy I have a chance to help fantastic people doing wonderful things.

Huge Improv Theater	111569		/users/profile/151923	bethkgibbs	Volunteer	5	05/08/2012	Huge Theater is such an amazing place. Not one person working at Huge is working for money. The reason they are there is because they truly care about the art of improv and they care about the improv community. I see many of the same people there every week performing, teaching classes, cleaning the bathrooms, just because they love the art of improv. The Huge community is extremely kind and welcoming. I have been a patron at Huge for quite some time and just recently I started volunteering. As I worked at the box office, all of the board members stopped by to check how things were going. They made sure I felt welcome and comfortable in that environment. There are so many different people who came through Huge's doors that night and everyone of them left with a smile on their face. It is amazing to see so many people working together to entertain people and make them laugh. It has quickly become my favorite place to be.

I started seeing shows for entertainment and it looked like so much fun, I started taking the classes they offered! I didn't know if a non-profit could offer quality education, but all three classes I've taken have blown me away. I benefited so much from the classes and really felt like I was getting plugged in to the improv community, I decided to volunteer by selling tickets and being part of street teams. I just had to do something to give back to the organization that has benefitted me so much. A lot of people have a hobby that they enjoy, but I have one that not only can I enjoy doing (improv), but others can enjoy watching me do it too.

Huge Improv Theater	111565		/users/profile/151918	octoberdandy	Volunteer	5	05/08/2012	HUGE Theater is a theater space dedicated to the art of improv - - the art of creating instant theater. It's an art form that takes agreement from both the performer (improv is based on the idea of "Yes, And" - - acceptance of an idea and then the adding of information) and the audience (they have to Yes And the performer and take a step away from themselves and believe.) This agreement creates community, and a wonderful community has formed at HUGE. I volunteer as a performer at HUGE, and I've been lucky enough to experience some of my most exciting and surprising  moments on stage. It's a safe space to explore, and we're lucky to have it. 
Huge Improv Theater	111563		/users/profile/151913	noneplease	Volunteer	5	05/08/2012	Huge theater's presence in Minneapolis has made a tremendous difference in diversifying and expanding the improv theater scene. I teach improv at another theater in town and I see my students directly benefit from Huge - both from watching other improvisers and from the many more opportunities to perform that exist because of Huge. It's hard to imagine the town before Huge even though it's only existed for about a year and a half. It took me a while to realize that my students' rapid improvement wasn't because of something especially clever I was doing, it was because they were working on their craft outside of class at Huge. Before Huge, there was no opportunity like that. Huge's impact ripples outward beyond the immediate audience and performers on a given night to increase the overall quality of the improv and improvisers in the Twin Cities. Thank you Huge!

The community that HUGE Theater has created in Minneapolis is great; everyone is friendly, welcoming, and a lot of fun. Not only is a great 'nonprofit,' but Huge Theater is a a great place to me.

Huge Improv Theater	89287		/users/profile/101228	Courtney M.	Donor	5	05/26/2011	I am so grateful to have Huge Theater, in my neighborhood especially, but in the Twin Cities in general.  A welcome addition to the thriving TC performing arts scene, Huge Theater provides supplementary performance/instruction in improvisational theater to its well-established peers, the Brave New Workshop, Comedy Sportz, and Stevie Ray's.  But Huge also provides a complement to these institutions as well, by giving a home to performances almost every night that we weren't seeing as frequently OR for as low a price before Huge opened.   Add to that the classes that Huge offers, ranging from the basics to advanced with improvisers that have experience from all over the nation.   PLUS "play days" like Improv Fight Club or drop-in classes at $10 a pop.  Huge makes improvisational theater even more accessible to everyone (even to youth!) and that is what makes it different than other institutions in town. The performances I've seen at Huge have featured improvisers of all experience levels.  This is encouraging for a beginner like myself; I get to believe that I too can soon perform at Huge (which I can - through applying for the Improv-A-Go-Go lottery!), while also witnessing the mastery of long-time improv experts.  Plus, I believe ALL shows at Huge are $5!  There's just no excuse to not go see great improv ALL THE TIME! I also really love the special events held at Huge, like the Twin Cities Tiny Funny Women Fesitval.  Five hours of awesome, hilarious women talking about comedy, with a couple of insightful "lectures," and workshops by aforementioned improv masters made for an extremely enjoyable day.  And it was FREE (well, we all brought something to the potluck). I adore Huge.  I have donated a few times and plan on donating again, as well as volunteering, performing, and hopefully soon becoming a student!   Huge

After several attempts to find a place for Mom, we truly found her HOME at Rakhma.  Rakhma is fully dedicated to caring for those with dementia with great love, compassion, and dignity.   Everyone from the Executive Director to each staff member, to each caregiver, to the wonderful volunteers, has a heart to serve.  Mom was loved and cared for with great compassion and understanding.  It was such a comfort to me to know that while I couldn't always be with my Mom, she was in the best of hands at Rakhma.   The small, residential housing was perfect for my Mom.  She loved being a part of the family...meals around the table, singing and listening to music in the living room, craft projects, and wonderful outings  (especially the trips to the Art Institute).  The care my family and I received after my Moms death was also exceptional.  Even 14 months after Mom'ss passing, I still consider myself a part of the Rakhma Family?  I would highly recommend Rakhma Homes to anyone seeking care for a loved one with dementia!
Rakhma Inc	222379	1	/users/profile/286083	Jean55	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2014	I have been associated with Rakhma Homes for 20 plus years.  Staff are caring and for the most part consistent.  There's not a huge staff turnover.   The smaller size of the houses allows for much better specialized and immediate care than a large facility.  The residents seem happy, clean and well fed.  They do many special events, activities and outings.  There is nearly always something going on, and someone visiting.  Family members are included in activities, and often keep coming back for special events even after loved ones have passed on.  It truly is a "family" welcoming program both for residents and their family and friends.   Rakhma homes are an excellent alternative to traditional Nursing Homes and care facilities.

My family and I are so grateful she is able to live in such a caring and love-filled home. The staff are welcoming to family and friends when we visit and they show genuine respect and care for the individuals living there. Rakhma is a beautiful place to live, each resident has their own comfortable and cozy bedroom. The yard is large and well-kept with gardens, seating areas and a nice front patio where we like to share snacks and have coffee with my grandma. My grandma enjoys walking around the yard looking at the flowers, as she was a gardener her whole life. Rakhma provides numerous events and gatherings for family and friends to come spend time with their loved one. During the warm months this year Rakhma hosted several barbecues that were always fun and filled with laughter and good home cooked food. The residents are frequently taking day trips to museums, going on river boat rides and having guest musicians and other visitors.  Before my grandma lived at Rakhma she was living in a medical nursing home with much more of a bleak hospital-feel. The staff did not understand how to work with those with Alzheimer's and it was hard to know she was staying in a place that was inadequate. On the other end of the spectrum, Rakhma is an incredibly special place for those with Alzheimer's and their family. I feel relieved to know that my grandma is surrounded by people who love her. It's clear when you enter the home that the staff build genuine relationships with the residents and nothing could be better than knowing my grandma is safe and cared for immensely where she lives. The staff at Rakhma have a thorough understanding of Alzheimer's and dementia and how to work with those who have the disease. The staff makes a true effort to know my grandma and what her life was all about. Rakhma is a wonderful caregiving home and I feel lucky that my grandma is able to live there.
Rakhma Inc	222342		/users/profile/286046	ruthbarrett	Client Served	5	10/13/2014	My mother moved into Rakhma Peace house when her Alzheimer's symptoms made it unsafe for her to live alone. The staff went out of its way to give us an accurate understanding of what her day to day would be like, how her special needs would be met, and how we could best prepare for this transition as a family.  Inevitably in the three  years she was a resident there were challenges when staffing would change and when her health declined.  In all cases I found our questions and concerns to be readily addressed, and the staff went well out of their way to make my mom comfortable, happy, and busy.  We especially appreciated the special outings and in-house events that kept the residents' days from becoming too routine.  We were always welcome in the house, which added to our own peace of mind.  My mother spent her last years as happy as her illness allowed.  I strongly recommend Rakhma to those who are looking for care for their family members with memory disorders.

This is the best situation we could have hoped for, excellent staff and the "at home" living made this transition smooth for all involved. They really do what they say they will, just the best situation for those with memory issues!

After several attempts to find a place for Mom, we truly found her HOME at Rakhma.  Rakhma is fully dedicated to caring for those with dementia with great love, compassion, and dignity.   Everyone from the Executive Director to each staff member, to each caregiver, to the wonderful volunteers, has a heart to serve.  Mom was loved and cared for with great compassion and understanding.  It was such a comfort to me to know that while I couldn't always be with my Mom, she was in the best of hands at Rakhma.   The small, residential housing was perfect for my Mom.  She loved being a part of the family...meals around the table, singing and listening to music in the living room, craft projects, and wonderful outings  (especially the trips to the Art Institute).  The care my family and I received after my Moms death was also exceptional.  Even 14 months after Mom'ss passing, I still consider myself a part of the Rakhma Family?

She loved being with people but by 90 was unable to get around and became solitary.  We were lucky enough to find the home like setting at Rakhma Peace and mom now has activities and has friends in the residents, wonderful care staff and uniquely talented volunteers.  The administration  staff even found a Czech speaking volunteer to come in to speak with my mom in her native language. The loving atmosphere of Rakhma  Peace Home is the best for my mother and I thank them every day.

We searched many facilities and feel so fortunate to have our beloved mother with Rakhma. Mom was an exceptional cook and made soup and bread every Saturday. At Rahkma she continues to enjoy homemade meals and treats, and when she wants jello they make it for her.  Mom was a gardener and lover of flowers, at Rakhma there is a raised garden bed and  flower border around the house. We wanted to personalize mom's room and they supported us. The weekly outings to museums, other cultural settings and boat trips in the summer, make the stay at Rahkma enriching. Mom grew up speaking Czech and the administration searched out enthusiastic volunteers to come weekly to talk to her in her native tongue. Mom speaks more Czech now that in the last thirty years.  The staff is loving and happy and this atmosphere permiates the house. The nurse is accessible and friendly as are the house managers. The director always addresses my concerns quickly and is sympathetic and knowledgeable  on the progression of dimentia and alzheimers.  We highly recommend Rakhma Peace Home.  Mary M.

I enjoy hanging out and entertaining all the ladies at the Peace Home...I have been around Alzheimer's most of my life...my Great Grandmother and my Grandmother both had Alzheimer's and now my Grandfather has been diagnosed with Dementia.  I believe this is one of the worst diseases that Elderly get.  It is very scary for those that are losing their memory and very hard on the rest of the family.  The most we can do for the patients is to make them feel loved and at home everyday!!

The workers gave us clues on what to do if we needed help and all of the residents were so happy. They would cheer us up and always bring a smile to our faces. It was the best time I had in a long time. The week with them was amazing. I would love to go back and volunteer there again. 
Rakhma Inc	179250		/users/profile/235890	DBinSeattle	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	My mother has alzheimers and we were so worried she would live when her needs went beyond our ability to care for her.  She is as spunky now as she was before the alzheimers, which made her a great escape artist and someone in need of constant social interaction.  She had to leave one facility for these reasons and our family spent a lot of time searching for a place that she would be safe and not feel like she was institutionalized.  We were so fortunate that a caring social worker heard of a space being open in one of the Rakhma homes and our mother now gets to life in a family-like situation - in a house, with people who care about her, and she gets to go out in the yard in the summer and garden.  Rakhma house organizes field trips, which she enjoys wholeheartedly no matter if its at a museum or boating.   Her life is still meaningful and she gets the interactions she craves.  Rakhma house is as supportive and caring for the families as well as the people who live there.  They helped us adjust to this new situation and keep us informed and engaged in the care of our mother.  I can't say enough about them.  I am so grateful that they have brought a culture of loving support to people who need so much.

Meanwhile my Father was forcibly removed from his home and went to the hospital to be "observed"  while the social worker tried to find a place close to our home.  There was nothing available except a large locked unit which was horrible in everyway mentionable.  My Father started to have behavioral issues and was sent to Bethesda for observation.  What a gift!  The social worker at Bethesda found the most wonderful, loving, caring group home for my Father.  His behavioral issues got much better and he's so much happier with this wonderful Rakhma Joy House.  The staff are unbelievably patient, kind and truly, I MEAN TRULY, care for their clients.  It's just like a family.  Actually the staff are like my family!!!  Recently and very suddenly my oldest brother passed away and the staff, you know who you are, were their for us in every way possible.  I just love them all!!!!!

True to the vision they started with over 3 decades ago, Rakhma homes offer a safe, nurturing environment for people suffering from memory loss.  Not only do they treat their residents with dignity and compassion, but care givers also extend themselves to family members by getting to know each person who walks in the door.  There is a real sense of fellowship within each house and a plethora of meaningul, engaging activities for the residents which can be attended by friends and family members. Communication via social media, email, and phone calls is ongoing with the utmost respect for each situation.  More of these residential homes should exist in every community across the United States.

We have had a continuing relationship with Rakhma for the past 3-4 years as we have placed some excellent caregivers with them. In all of my interactions with Susan Eckstrom, the Executive Director, Bethany and other staff members, I have been very impressed with the integrity and the true heart motivation that I have seen to give the most compassionate, respectful and individualized care to their residents as possible. They are not a huge organization but do a wonderful job in providing nurturing care and a supportive environment for both their residents with dementia and for their families. If it were necessary for any of my loved ones to need memory care, I would certainly entrust Susan and her staff with their care.

Rakhma Inc	158734	1	/users/profile/210637	Martha.Carey1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/24/2013	In September 2012, I responded to a Craig's List posting on behalf of the 3 Twin City Rakhma Homes. They were looking for a volunteer Musical Worship Service presider to come and bring music, worship, meditation and spirituality reflections.  It happily and immediately resonated with me and shortly afterward,  I met with the Volunteer Director at one of the Rakhma homes, had my first tour visit and met my first Rakhma residents. Some were open, curious, welcoming, listening, child-like and animated. Others were shy, reticent, withdrawn, pacing, sleeping, disconnected or 'somewhere else.' In all 3 homes, I find that the committed continuity of staff itself is the golden glue in the homes and its the devoted household staff that makes it all work and come together. I had heard of the Rakhma Homes over the years and was always drawn to its name: Rakhma, in the Aramaic, it means 'unconditional love and caring.' On this visit, I saw ''The Rakhma Story" book on a bookshelf and they gave it to me to learn about the beginning vision-mission-history of the Rakhma homes in the Twin Cities.   Suffice it to say that the founders, Shirley Joy Shaw and her colleagues, were way ahead of their time, paying attention and responding to the signs of the times to come, the esalating increase of Alzheimer's-Dementia needs in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and the nation at large. As a former-current Hospital-Hospice Chaplain and trained pastoral counselor for health care issues, I come to Rakhma as a volunteer and also as a professional with expertise in the needs, concerns and disease progressions of folks struggling with Alzheimer's-Dementia, having experienced and working with both on deeply personal as well as professional levels. Most of the past and current research focus is on the medical-cognitive-organic processes of what is failing, gone or missing.  However, my love and recognition for the Rakhma residents and staff are far more about the spirit of music and the music of spirituality...which touches and moves all souls, no matter what stage the resident's memory might/might not be in. I come to Rakhma to respond to and engage in what still remains intact and alive in those whose memories are so fragile, the stuff that is not gone or missing, yet. I come with my background in Music and hail its universal creative value with its power to move body, soul, and even memory itself. And it does! That's another word and meaning that I love. The word, "Memory," is to remember,  to be able to recall past experience--which reminds us of who we are. In my 9 months of volunteering, the Rakhma residents and some of the staff have taught me about my own understanding of memory:  that 'once lived experience is buried in there somewhere' because it was once real lived experience, and remains so.  When driving to one of the Rakhma Homes to provide musical worship services, I often hear myself humming the words to Barbara Streisand's incredibly soul-filled and bitter-sweet song: "Memories, like the corners of my mind, misty watercolor memories...of the way we were. Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind, smiles we gave to one another...of the way we were." The Rakhma Homes and this song...is about the story of each and all of us! 
Rakhma Inc	158667		/users/profile/210529	Sarah B. from Minneapolis	Volunteer	5	05/23/2013	I have been volunteering weekly with Rakhma since I moved to the Twin Cities in the fall of 2012, and it has been a wonderful volunteering experience that I would recommend to anyone who's interested in volunteering with older adults. First, the organization appears to be very well administered and organized; communication with and within the organization is easy.  The staff is very understanding of my schedule and (unfortunately frequent) last-minute cancelations.  And they're friendly and they do a lot to make me feel like my volunteering is appreciated. Second, and much more importantly, I love the feeling I have when I'm in the home.  The residents seem comfortable and happy and the staff seem very capable, caring, and conscientious.  Being here feels like visiting in someone's home -- it doesn't feel "institutional" at all.  And because the staff take complete care of all of the residents' needs, I get to spend my volunteer time simply chatting with the residents, watching movies, playing catch, etc.  It's a lot of fun.
Women Of Nations	266969	3	/users/profile/355730	CALMN	Board Member	5	10/24/2015	Women of Nations Staff is dedicated to helping our clients recover from the trauma of ongoing abuse.  They advocate for women and children and assist them with finding jobs and housing as well as help for whatever other issues they may face.   Working in a domestic abuse shelter, or any area involved with health care or that serves clients with mental or emotional issues, sometimes chemical dependency, is very stressful in itself - it is just a stressful environment in which to work.  All organizations have some areas that they could improve on, and WON is no different.  There was mention of the E.D. being out for herself and being President of the Board therefore being her own boss.  This is simply not true.  She is a dedicated person, duly qualified for her role as E.D.  She is Board President because she is the one that is listed as having fiduciary responsibility for the organization.  There isn't another person that could be held financially accountable for the proper administration of funds at W.O.N.  It isn't a Board member duty - therefore, there is nobody else.   Being E.D. means that yes, you are in charge - someone has to run the day to day.   However, being President of the Board is a title only for the reason previously stated.  She is not a voting Board member.  The Board sets the overall direction for the organization, they also conduct her performance review and determine her salary and the HR Director salary.  The HR Director did marry Della's daughter about a year ago, therefore, he is her son in law; however, the Board is aware of this and the Board carefully reviews financials and information to ensure proper operation to the best of their ability.   I hope this information is helpful to those that take the time to read and consider it.   
Women Of Nations	253997	1	/users/profile/342291	sbr33	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/25/2015	Women of Nations is a stressful and unhealthy environment to work in.  Women of Nations does not provide the necessary training to work there which unfortunately makes many of the staff unqualified.  For instance the crisis line is a suicide hotline but while I worked there no one was trained to provide advice and counseling to suicidal callers unless they received training from outside resources not provided by Women of Nations.  The website has false information on it.  The survivor story is an exaggeration of someone who use to work there.  She no longer works there and as far as I know did not run the Domestic Violence 101 group.  She has not been involved with Women of Nations in anyway for a year or more.  Also it says there is 24 hour Trauma informed care.  This is not true.  The only workers there 24 hours is the advocates and they are not trained in trauma informed care.  As far as I know the only person trained in Trauma informed care is the ED and maybe a supervisor.

Women Of Nations	234311	1	/users/profile/298469	Baglady	Volunteer	5	11/23/2014	Disappointedparent- You say you want peolple to lead by example and stop the blaming. Maybe you should lead by example and not point fingers at what is being posted. You do not know who is posting anything on here. Just like nobody knows. I've been volunteering at Women of Nations for almost two years now. I collect over 500 hygiene items for the women and children there. After reading some of the positive and negative reviews I will agree that there is a problem in the organization. Employees need to stop using family dynamics as a scapegoat. Like any organization, if an employee has a problem they need to write down the FACTS, and report them to their supervisor. Once after reporting the problems, if the issues are not addressed, then go the next person in charge. Employees that do no report issues are just as much to blame. Management needs to stop using the union as a scapegoat. Management needs to sit down with their employees and find out what the issues are that they have with their staff and figure out a way to solve these issues. Both employees and management can not help each other if neither side is willing to speak. If neither employees and manaments are willing to do this, then perhaps they need to look for employment elsewhere, and management needs to make this a top priority.  I strongly encourage all of you to come together as one to better the lives of women and children in crisis. And for all employees that are unhappy with their jobs, I encourage you to look for employment else where. To the former employees that post negative reviews on here, move on and let the organization grow. I will give Women of Nations a 5 star rating, because of the work they do! For my fellow members of the community that read these reviews, remember that is a social forum and have all the facts before we judge. Tracy

Women Of Nations	234280	4	/users/profile/298432	SageBurner	Volunteer	5	11/22/2014	Women of Nations is a safe haven for many women who enter through their doors. Many are on the run from their abusers, leaving with nothing but the clothes on their back and their frightened children in hand. The shelter provides shelter, meals, clothing, and most importantly a safe place where they can begin to put their lives together. The Staff is friendly, compassionate, and dedicated to what they do. Many of the Staff identify with the women and are able to connect with them and provide support as they move forward. This organization is based on Native American Culture, using traditional teachings and ceremonys to help these women and children heal. I was surprised to learn that this is the only Native based shelter not on a reservation; making it a rare gem. I have personally seen many success stories come from women of nations. Women of Nations is an organization dedicated to its clients; providing them with whatever they can to help.

Women Of Nations	234234	3	/users/profile/298376	michelles688	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/22/2014	I love the " crab mentality" phrase. Describes perfectly how some people deal with others successes. How are people like that suppose to help others? Thank goodness for the management otherwise those Union employees will ruin that place if they ran it. Always out to get others I see, making personal attacks on other employees, then you go after their families? I hear they're harassing that management staff, then they talk about abuse of power. So what's the next bad review going to be about? Management? HR? ED? Nepotism? Family? Power? Harassment? Abuse?  Only people who get reprimanded use those excuses. Never mind these are suppose to be adult women who act like children who basically act like they got their hand caught in the cookie jar.  If any of this is an issue, then why are they still there?  Honesty and love will prevail over all evil. 
Women Of Nations	234233	2	/users/profile/298374	katerinan780	Volunteer	5	11/22/2014	Volunteered here spring 2014. I enjoyed it! I'm studying abroad currently and look forward to coming back and volunteering again. I look forward to the 5k this year as well!  Thank you WON, you've opened my eyes to a lot of things in this world. Not sure what this Union business is about, but don't let it get ya down.  Miss you all!  :) Namaste 
Women Of Nations	234232	3	/users/profile/298373	tiffinycarls	General Member of the Public	5	11/22/2014	Has anyone heard of "crab mentality"? Crab mentality, sometimes referred to as crabs in the bucket, is a phrase that describes a way of thinking best described by the phrase "if I can't have it, neither can you." I feel as though some of the employees can't get over the fact that maybe they just weren't a good fit (or are not currently a good fit) for Women of Nations, and perhaps didn't support that mission there. So therefore, if it's not working for them, then it can't work for anyone else. Some employees hide behind the Union to get away with not showing up on time, talking back to all staff members (like the 2 senior advocates), and perhaps they are being encouraged by their Union representative to make it a hostile work environment there, (they are all friends on Facebook) and we want to talk about abuse of power? They are all friend with the president of their Union on Facebook. They think they're united when really they throw their own under the bus, because they think of no one but themselves. This is what Women of Nations is trying to fix!!!! Hands are tied because the Union pretty much supports bad behavior. And why would they do this to a little nonprofit,  Abuse of power maybe? Everyone knows who these two workers are, and it's sad that they are TRYING to make everyone miserable. To be honest......if any of the negative statements that were made in the previous reviews were true, do you really think they'd still be working there? Think about it? No matter how much these few disgruntled employees try to sabotage Women of Nations, everyone in the community knows that these are honest hard working employees. There is a reason why that place is still standing and running successfully. Union strong, or JB??? There's a reason why you're not there. I'd like to say Management strong, that's why they're there, they will continue to be there, and will be for years to come. Some of the employees may support the union being in a small organization, but the community and Native community see what Women of Nations deals with on a day to day basis. The management and board have full support of both. Have a great day!!
Women Of Nations	234229	5	/users/profile/298366	SDA3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/21/2014	I am currently an employee at WON and I truly love my job. It's pretty sad that people are so miserable that they need to hide their faces behind a site and on the internet. Women of a Nations has been open for 32 years and has been going strong and making changes in families lives since day one. We have a 44 bed shelter and anyone can check our records we are always full and we have nothing but success stories from the families we serve. I think if you are so unhappy, like to tell nasty lies, and have hatred in your heart you should leave and find peace and happiness. You don't deserve working with families in crisis and struggling with real life hard ache and pain. Go find another job where you can be happy.  If you are no longer an employee at Women of Nations go find peace in your life and move on. If you were unhappy for whatever reason and you decided to leave be happy with your choice and few up. Maybe focus on your current position or struggles in life and move on. Women of Nations is an amazing agency and the management team has done an amazing done as well as our new advocates who are happy and part of the team. If you work at Women of Nations currently and your unhappy think about ending your employment and finding something that will hopefully make you happy. Stop spreading lies and rumors about individuals you barely know.  Thank you to those that have given great reviews and told the truth about a passionate agency that truly cares about our families and employees.  Those disturbed, untruthful, nasty, and ungrateful individuals get a life and good luck finding true happiness.  I love my job and I am extremely passionate about what I do. Keep up the great work Women of Nations
Women Of Nations	234224	3	/users/profile/298360	CMC1212	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/21/2014	Volun101 is current or former employee of Women of Nations. And here is why. They said their last experience with WON was in 2013. I am currently employed at WON I have been with WON since 2009. And in 2013 managment was not in the process of getting rid of Union employees. The union was not involved until 2014. Also as a former member of the ''union'' not because I want to be, but because i was required to pay a fee in order to work at WON.  I have seen many people come and go during my time their, not because of termination. Because they moved on to other jobs. When I was an advocate i never saw my union rep, never. But they certainly collected their dues from my paycheck. Women of Nations continues to work hard. Obviously if their were wrongful terminations within the organization union or non union positions, they certainly would be looked into right? Management staff continues to work hard, and we will not let the comments of former or current advocates affect us. 
Women Of Nations	234060	3	/users/profile/298141	nona_wilch	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2014	It's great to see an organization represent and give support to women and children of the Native Community here in the cities.

Women Of Nations	234017	2	/users/profile/298089	What_an_experience	General Member of the Public	5	11/19/2014	I would like to comment on my experience with David and an unknown resident of the Women of Nations.  I had just bought a brand new cell phone ($400) with my hard earned money and lost it within my first couple weeks.  I was devastated.  I was forced to use my old, broken phone until I could save up to hopefully by another new phone.  About four weeks went by and I received a message from David stating that one of his residents had found my phone and turned it into him.  Whoever this woman was, thank you so much and please know I strongly believe good things happen to people who do good things for others.  David went so far beyond kindness by helping me get my phone packaged and delivered to me because I was unable to get to him to pick it up.  I just received my phone today and it was wrapped like a Christmas gift...which it truly felt like it was.  So, thank you.  You have made someone very happy with your generous kindness.
Women Of Nations	233950	3	/users/profile/297985	laura_mogs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2014	I used to work at WON for a year. I NEVER had an issue with any of the management, supervisors, or any other staff. They were all my teachers! I learned how to listen, be empathetic, relate, and try to make these women believe that they have the power to do anything. I learned so much during my time there and the only reason I moved on was because I found something that was closer to my home. It's sad to see other people talking so negative about this place, and they don't see it for what it is. It's a place where a woman can seek another chance and change. That's why people work at Women of Nations. I hope nothing but the best for this place, and honestly, ever since the "ED" came in, that place has done a complete 180, FOR THE BETTER.
Women Of Nations	233898	3	/users/profile/297918	awalker_1985	Client Served	5	11/18/2014	I appreciate all the help Women of Nations has done for me. I don't understand where all this negativity against these people comes from. Just from the last review, I could probably guess who this person was, due to the fact I reported the same person (she said the exact same thing) to her supervisor and then she had to report it HR. Funny how that these people who do such wrong try to turn it around on the organization and the good that people do.  They can't handle the consequences for their own actions and then make it difficult for people like ED, case managers, DSS, and HR, etc. It's everyone's fault but their own. lol. The ED, case managers, and DSS have done nothing but get me back on my feet.   It looks like the same people keep writing the negative reviews. lol.  Who cares I guess, I loved my stay at Women of Nations,  HOPEFULLY I don't have to ever go back. I learned a lot, I learned a lot about myself and I look forward to the future!!! Thank you Women of Nations!!! I'm already asking if I can come volunteer in a year or so. 
Women Of Nations	233894	2	/users/profile/297913	AmandaHW	Volunteer	5	11/18/2014	I am currently a volunteer at Women of Nations. Women of Nations has a special place within my heart because it has allowed me to do a great majority of my Social Work Intern hours plus learn a great deal about many of the issues and concerns of women and children who expeirence DV  Women of Nations has become many of the women and children's last hope before getting into serious trouble like attempting suicide or getting into drugs or prostitution after getting kicked out of their own homes.  The current ED has done more in that organization then anyone before her. Everyone that works their continue to do your hard work, and don't let the comment of current or former staff affect what you are doing. We all see the great things that you are doing!
Women Of Nations	233851	10	/users/profile/297836	Mari13	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/17/2014	The family dynamics by itself is not what causes this organization to fail, it is how they use this power.  Favoritism is not only shown by management to staff but also to residents.  The ED has certain residents come up and report to her.  These residents are allowed to stay at the shelter for months no matter what they do.  One such resident threatened staff, other residents, and even children and was never exited.  On top of that the ED's son in law, HR, is a big gossip.  He spreads false rumors among the employees to cause friction and separation.  Multiple employees have been forced out because of this.  These employees are hard-workers and go on to continue to work in this field and do great things!!!  It is not them, it is the agency.!
Women Of Nations	233129	4	/users/profile/296806	SueTobwinski	Donor	5	11/06/2014	I haven't lived in St Paul very long, but was told this was one of the Native American organization to watch and become involved with. I checked out WON and was extremely impressed with their methodology for working with the women and children , their impressive group of staff and administrative  staff and, of course the women and children themselves.   This is a program of substance and one that I've chosen to work with and contribute to.  I do not care who's related to who. The most important thing about WON is that the women and children are getting the services that they need. Keep up the great work Women of Nations I am happy to be apart of your team!  See you at the fundraiser!
Women Of Nations	232817	5	/users/profile/296419	dawnmjjo4	Volunteer	4	11/04/2014	I used to volunteer in the beginning of 2013 and I had a great experience at Women of Nations. I had many powerful discussions with the Executive Director about what I can do to improve my skills on trauma informed care and how I can support this movement especially in my Native American community. I've seen Women of Nations staff go over and beyond for their residents. I'm from a rural reservation in South Dakota, and as a Native woman with a small child, I know the importance of having a sense of family. We always say it takes a tribe to raise a child and I felt like this organization embraced that cultural aspect and provided its residents the best of compassion and care. It was an honor to be a part of this organization. The knowledge I gained from the ED and its staff has led me back to my people in SD to make a real difference in my community. It deeply saddens me to see negative comments as some may have lost sight on the true goal and mission to help women and their families. When it comes down to it, the resiliency of residents and volunteers are a true reflection of the great work that goes on at Women of Nations. 
Women Of Nations	232783	4	/users/profile/296376	kstingley1972	Donor	5	11/03/2014	I guess the least of my concerns is the family dynamics. How does the family dynamics have anything to do with how the program is ran? If I felt that this was running interference with how the program is ran, I most certainly wouldn't be donating to this organization. I also wouldn't donate each year if I felt the program and the people running it weren't capable of making sure that Women of Nations was a success and that they were providing the right services to women and children who are victims of domestic violence. This is our first priority yes? I've heard nothing negative in the community about Women of Nations.  I personally haven't ran into any issues with the "family dynamics" either . They were very upfront about this I personally didn't care. To hear the personal story of the ED and her daughter and why they work here, it's inspiring! They are the reason places like this need to exist.  I think it's silly that people keep coming back to this, they've been there for three years and they improved far beyond my expectations.  Maybe those who want to continue to be so negative should take a look at themselves and rethink the field they're working in. It's sad people feel the need to put down such a good cause because of petty reasonings. My money helps the shelter take care of over 300 women and children each year and it will continue to do so. Keep up the great work and I'll spread the word! All that staff has worked too hard these last few years and I know they will continue to put their heart and soul into that place. 
Women Of Nations	193531	4	/users/profile/252774	Allysandson	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/30/2014	I have to agree with dlynn 136. I worked for the organization for 2 years while I was continuing my education to become a social worker . I had a great experience with WOMEN OF NATIONS. The Executive Director is doing a far superior job to any other ED that was there. I just think is another disgruntled employee trying to tarnish the hard work that everyone is doing there. Because they were let go because they couldn't fulfill the job requirements. That's all this is, is someones opinion that doesn't hold any merit. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK WOMEN OF NATIONS!! 
Women Of Nations	193529	4	/users/profile/252772	dlynn136	Volunteer	5	01/30/2014	I loved my experience at Women of Nations, and I plan on coming back to volunteer again this semester.I've never had a problem with any of the staff, they all offered me so much knowledge about working with women and children in domestic violence in the Native American Community.  I love the mission and focus behind Women of Nations, very different from any other place I've worked or volunteered at. I agree with the strong one-on-one relationship that the staff have implemented into working with the residents. Most of the time residents say this organization has done more for them than any other agency/family/person has done for them. the fact that they.If a person is no longer working at Women of Nations......there's probably a GOOD reason why they're not. lol....that's just my opinion. I plan on applying here when I'm done with my spring classes. I actually get to help staff with groups now which makes me really excited about this semester!!! 
Women Of Nations	192889	10	/users/profile/251903	SaintPaulIsTheBest	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/21/2014	I echo the review above. The current executive director is looking out for the interest of her family, which she employs whether they live in the state or not. Her current family members on the payroll include her daughter, who has no job accountability and her new husband, who does the HR with zero HR experience. She also employs her sister as the office manager who lives in SD and her niece as a program coordinator. None of these family members have experience in their job titles but are given generous salaries of up to or just over $60k per year. Her brother in law was the grant manager from 2011-2013 and didn't raise a single dime from the organization but made over $50k while living in SD doing nothing. Not only does the current executive director employ her family to do nothing, she is aggressive, manipulative and threatens staff and residents.  She has no knowledge of grant funding and how it works or has even tried to become familiar with foundations in the area. She is never at the Native American events and has said she doesn't like the Native American Culture and how traditional it is and couldn't wait to get away from the reservation where she lived. Her trauma-informed care approach is an absolute failure since she can't seem to stay on one track and changes the program often.  She has a cultural coordinator, her niece, but the most they do is put some beads on a string. They used to have full moon ceremonies and would take the residents to such events that were offsite but that no longer happens. The board is dysfunctional, at best. They have some that have been there for many years that are Native but they just added several more, none of which are, and don't seem to have a problem with the nepotism. The program doesn't need to be centered around the culture but they risk losing a lot of their funding that stems from that very fact and the executive director takes more and more steps every day to phase it and is convinced no one will notice. The executive director "requires" a degree for anyone being hired now but none of her currently employed family members, other than maybe her sister, actually possess a degree, only certificates and even then some don't and none are related to the position they hold. The family will fight and bicker within the shelter for domestic violence while her daughter and niece run around in stiletto shoes, low cut tops and short skirts.  Two years ago she fired an advocate for not obtaining a license, even though she was hired without one 6 years earlier and then all of sudden made her go to get one and fired her when she didn't. Her housing advocate and a new advocate who used to reside at the shelter do not have one either. Where is the fairness and union when this happens? She simply didn't like the other advocate and found any reason to fire them possible, and does so with anyone she doesn't like. There are so many things wrong at this organization, wrongful terminations, nepotism, residents not being treated fairly by her, inconsistent employment and shelter practices, etc.  
Women Of Nations	174313	12	/users/profile/230581	exit	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/06/2013	This agency is losing the focus on battered women.  The director, who is working on  her PHD, is more interested in bringing new residents upstairs and "interviewing" the new residents in order to give them a "diagnosis".    The new director and her administrative staff, who are mainly her relatives,  have created a hostile work environment and have been abusive to both staff and residents.  The new director has had her own agenda since she was hired.  She stated to a resident "know how those advocates are.  I intend to get rid of them and get all new staff.  I just can't do it all at once, I have to do it one by one."  She has reached her goal, and this includes firing a SIXTEEN YEAR employee.  I did not get fired, as I quit with notice.  I did quit because she called a "restructuring meeting" and announced that I was being demoted and then announced to me that I was to train in her daughter and her niece to take over my position.   As of now the director, her sister, her daughter, her niece and three male relatives have come from South Dakota to work at Women of Nations. 
Open Arms of Minnesota	131424		/users/profile/176982	Mary Pat L.,	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Open Arms has created a community where the volunteers receive as much from the organization as the clients served.  I have been volunteering for about 8 years, mainly delivering meals.  Volunteer management is excellent, well organized and personal.  For the past two years, I have been volunteering with one of my various nephews most Saturday mornings.  It has been a wonderful experience doing this together and has opened their world to one of service.  They experience first hand how important a good meal is and the clients are appreciative and they want to help -- and that all types of people need help.  The new facility is great, the farm is great, but the best is thing about Open Arms is they allow us to help make some sick  person and / or their family's week just a little easier.
Open Arms of Minnesota	149517	1	/users/profile/199306	Patrick25	Volunteer	5	02/16/2013	Open Arms of Minnesota is by far the best non-profit going...the works they do is imortant and in some case life saving. My mother is currently battling cancer and has had serious food issues, she became a client and RAVES about the food. I volunteer there a couple times a week and always have a great time with Cassie, Sara, Juan and thr entire staff. As a long time hospitality worker and a foodie, the kitchen at OA is "top shelf" I know alot of chefs who would kill to work there...but really it is the food that they provide to people who might not eat regularly that is the proof that Open Arms is the non-profit to check out.Patrick McMonigal

You arrive to help out in the kitchen, committee meeting room or delivery car & you feel others welcome you with open arms. AND the warmth, attention to volunteers, & lightheartedness is matched by the efficiency, attention to detail and planning, & teamwork that makes an organization like this do great things. It seems nothing is too big for this team of people. I am so proud to be a part of Open Arms!
Open Arms of Minnesota	125743		/users/profile/131451	Vicki O.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I was a client served and a volunteer.  In September 2006 I had signed up for orientation as a volunteer for Open Arms through a recommendation by a friend of mine.  Before I was able to attend I was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I called and cancelled the orientation.  At that time they said that they not only served HIV, MS and ALS patients but also breast cancer patients and that my sons and I would be able to receive meals during treatment at no charge.  I thought that was very generous but probably wouldn't need it.  Between my first and second round of chemo I realized that it would probably be a good idea.  It was such a lifesaver for me!  I worked throughout my treatment except for the day of chemo and was exhausted.  When I came through all that my son and I rode in the inaugural Breast Cancer Ride in which Open Arms was a beneficiary and then started volunteering in the kitchen and delivering meals.  I try to get together with my two sons and deliver meals the week of Thanksgiving and Christmas as a way of giving back and showing our thanks.  I am proud to be associated with Open Arms!!!!
Open Arms of Minnesota	101829		/users/profile/131451	Vicki O.	Volunteer	5	12/06/2011	I have done volunteer work throughout my life.  When my sons were in school I served as a volunteer in various areas.  The fall of 2006 I had time to volunteer for something else.  A coworker suggested Open Arms and I set up an appointment for orientation.  A few weeks later I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer and had to call to cancel/postpone my volunteering.  I was told that Open Arms now helped Breast Cancer patients too and if I was interested I could receive meals.  I said thanks, but didn't think I would need it.  After surgery, my treatment consisted of three months of chemotherapy followed by three months of radiation. I worked throughout my treatment(taking the days off of chemo).  I became more and more exhausted--so much so that while grocery shopping at Cub someone came over to bag my groceries.  At that point I knew it was time to ask for help, so I called Open Arms and they started delivering weekly meals for myself and my two sons.  The volunteer would bring the meals to me at work and it was a lifesaver!!!  It was hard to ask for help, but I am so glad that I did! The following year was the inaugural Breast Cancer Bike Ride.  My son Matt and I participated in the ride and volunteering raising money for Open Arms.  Three months later I began volunteering in the bakery and did that for a few years.  For that past few years my sons Matt and Sean helped deliver meals during the holidays--it was a great family experience! My Open Arms experience has come full circle and I am so grateful and proud to have been a part of it!  I guess my role is client/fundraiser/volunteer.

There will always be something meaningful to do, and that work will always have a direct and immediate impact on someone in my community. There is always a plan--whether for the day's kitchen work, the year's development goals, or the leadership direction the organization will take in the coming decade. Compassionate, energetic people will always pull together to make these plans become reality. And there will always be a place in those plans for me and for everyone else who serves and is served by the mission at Open Arms.

The work of preparing and delivering food is easy to understand; but it is surprisingly transformative for me and other volunteers, for clients, and for the community we live in. Open Arms is a chance to spend a few hours a week acting mindfully and with specific intent to help real people. The fact that this service returns so much benefit to me is nothing short of a miracle.

Open Arms of Minnesota	101835		/users/profile/131462	reism001	Volunteer	5	12/06/2011	I have volunteered with many organizations but I have never experienced such love, support and thankfulness for the little bit I do as I have at Open Arms.  Where else would the head of general operations offer to bring me, a volunteer door holder at a fundraiser, a drink of water when it got hot?  Where else would the head of volunteers make sure that every volunteer gets thanked by name and in person at the end of a huge, exhausting fundraiser?  The staff attitude here is beyond anything I have ever experienced.  That is just my experience.  I am not even mentioning how well-run the organization is.  In this economy, how could anyone but Open Arms raise $8.1 million for a new building, if not because everyone knows how great they are and believes so much in the mission?
Open Arms of Minnesota	101517		/users/profile/129983	Jasmine S.	Volunteer	5	12/02/2011	I started delivering meals with Open Arms in high school and decided to become an intern here a few summers later; I rounded out my experience by participating in the Re/Max Results Breast Cancer Ride this past August 2011. This organization has changed the way I see society; I see hope, I see laughter, I see dedication and I see love every single day I walked into Open Arms. Their "let's figure it out" attitude has successfully impacted SO many people within and outside of the community and I am consistently astounded by the perennial work and impact created by this organization. Open Arms of Minnesota is a beautiful, life-changing, life-giving organization that has both impacted my career goals and heart.
Open Arms of Minnesota	101311		/users/profile/129158	RitaN	Volunteer	5	11/29/2011	I began volunteering at Open Arms about 5 years ago when my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Her diagnosis and illness were devastating to me - we knew her cancer was terminal and, although I helped in her care, I knew that care was palliative and not curative.  Volunteering at Open Arms gave me a chance to help others in a way that I knew helped in their healing.  I learned from my Mom how to love cooking and feeding others, so it seemed the perfect fit.  When my Mom passed away, I could not have asked for a more supportive group of people than the staff and other volunteers at Open Arms.  I love my Monday morning volunteer shift in the kitchen and look forward to it every week.  We sing along to the radio and swap recipes and share our lives and laugh a lot.  I know my Mom is looking down on me and smiling every time she sees me working my shift
Open Arms of Minnesota	101300		/users/profile/126668	Deborah A.Randolph	Volunteer	5	11/29/2011	I have been volunteering for Open Arms for the past five years first in the building on Franklin Avenue near the Indian center and now in the beautiful state of the art building on Bloomington and 25th in Minneapolis.  I volunteer twice a week- once cooking soup(chopping onions, celery, kale, cucumbers-you name it we do the prep work.  I have never laughted so hard anywhere-I leave full of good cheer, having spent time with the best chefs in the world and a treasure full of volunteers-from all over the community.  On Sunday I bring a teenager and we pack soup and I get to visit with a great group of college kids and cassie and Sarah who are the best directors of traffic you can imagine.This is the place to come when you need a boost to your spirits and you will be quaranteed a hug from all sorts of folks. And Open Arms is now partnered with an Organic Farm in Belle Plaine and I weeded on the farm this past summer.  The farm provided 20,000 lbs of produce and our clients were thrilled with farm fresh everything!There is nothing that needs improvement0it is the best!
Open Arms of Minnesota	58306		/users/profile/61982	tgoembel	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	I have been a volunteer and donor with Open Arms of Minnesota for almost 15 years.  What keeps me coming back is the wonderful mission of Open Arms-feed both body and soul.  The organization is grassroots and very connected to the community and the families they help.  We bring our children to help volunteer and the staff is warm and caring.  The people we bring food to are so grateful and sometimes we are the only caring person they see.  Giving your time and effort to this group truly makes a difference.
Open Arms of Minnesota	57812		/users/profile/61228	Nick M.	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	I love volunteering at Open Arms because the agency is delivering such valuable services in such a professional manner. The staff is well trained in proper food handling and takes the time to train volunteers as well. I always feel that my time is valued when I am at Open Arms. Tasks are assigned and thoroughly explained so I feel like I am making maximum use of my time. I always feel energized when I complete my shift at Open arms.
Open Arms of Minnesota	57627		/users/profile/60975	ibalderas	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	I first learned about Open Arms MN when a friend and I visited their new facility during their grand opening.I was impressed with their staff and mission statement and decided to apply for a volunteer position.I've been a volunteer since the summer of 2010, and I could not be more satisfied with my experience with Open Arms MN.  The staff is sassy and friendly, and the clients are polite and charming.Whether it be on the busy mornings preparing weekly food packages for delivery, or on the afternoons helping out with phone calls at the front desk, I would always leave Open Arms with a feeling of charity, joy, and optimism.  Be they potential clients, volunteers, or donors, I recommend Open Arms MN to all! 
Open Arms of Minnesota	57144		/users/profile/60031	lallers25	Volunteer	5	11/16/2010	I've enjoyed my experience volunteering at Open Arms MN so much I recommend it to everyone! The staff and clients are wonderfully friendly and diverse. The organization beautifully balances efficient production and delivery with tailored meals to each client based on their interests, culture and health needs. And I am delightfully appreciated each time I step in the door, which means a lot considering I am unable to financially contribute to this well deserving outfit. I am thrilled to be apart of Open Arms MN and the innovative ways they serve the community and promote a healthy environment for all residents.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56977		/users/profile/59764	SKK BB	Volunteer	5	11/15/2010	Open Arms MN is an exciting, fun, effective, and thoughtful organization that provides critical services to people who are very much in need.  In 2009 alone, OA prepared and delivered over 300,000 meals!  It is highly organized, accessible to volunteers, friendly, and fun.   I'm hooked. It's an important part of each week for me. Also, I observe that the management team and other staff are highly cost conscious and efficient, ensuring that donations (time and money) are spent with care.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56895		/users/profile/59644	Emily N.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2010	From my first meeting with Open Arms, I knew this was an organization worth giving my time and money to support. What they do is so simple, yet so critical. They provide nutritious meals to people who are living with a chronic or life threatening disease. And when you deliver the meals, you truly understand how important this work is - and how much it is appreciated. I am honored to be able to give back to Open Arms through a number of committees. Having worked on committees for other nonprofits, I am always impressed by how the staff works with the volunteers. They are so respectful of peoples time and are careful to make sure they never ask too much of any individual. With other groups, I always felt like they were always trying to get more out of me. With Open Arms, I know that they are truly grateful any time I offer to help and that always makes me want to give more.  
Open Arms of Minnesota	131424		/users/profile/176982	Mary Pat L.,	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Open Arms has created a community where the volunteers receive as much from the organization as the clients served.  I have been volunteering for about 8 years, mainly delivering meals.  Volunteer management is excellent, well organized and personal.  For the past two years, I have been volunteering with one of my various nephews most Saturday mornings.  It has been a wonderful experience doing this together and has opened their world to one of service.  They experience first hand how important a good meal is and the clients are appreciative and they want to help -- and that all types of people need help.  The new facility is great, the farm is great, but the best is thing about Open Arms is they allow us to help make some sick  person and / or their family's week just a little easier.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56883		/users/profile/59629	Carol Hancuh	Volunteer	5	11/13/2010	Open Arms of Minnesota feeds sick people! It's about the food! It doesn't preach to or judge it's clients, but rather brings good nutritious food to their doors with a smile and a cheery "hello".  Without the help of hundreds of volunteers, there would be no Open Arms. I am the one of the luckiest volunteers at Open Arms. After a sudden retirement from a full-time job, it became apparent that bon-bons and t.v. soaps were not going to fill my day, so I pursued my lifetime passion of cooking. After one 2-hour shift per week, my volunteering has grown to four 4-hour shifts per week. Open Arms has graciously allowed me to join the kitchen staff in preparing meals for clients with specific dietary needs - those with renal failure, those who prefer gluten-free food, those who need ground meals, and those who prefer African-style foods.  I've learned so much more about cooking and cooking for people with compromised immune systems. Everyone at Open Arms is incredibly willing to share their knowledge along with laughter, smiles, and stories. Open Arms people are family to me and we all work together to give sick people a better life.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56819		/users/profile/59534	Anna Potter	Volunteer	5	11/12/2010	Open Arms staff and volunteers opened their arms to me immediately.  I was welcomed that first day 3 years ago when I walked into the door.  As Ive chopped vegetables, onions were my specialty, made soup and other nutritious food for our clients, I discovered a safe environment where people respect my skills and my talents.  Now I volunteer each morning packing the food  ensuring the right food gets to the right people  and having it ready when the drivers arrive to take the food to our clients.  Interacting with Open Arms staff and volunteers is the highlight of my day.  My life is changed forever because of Open Arms.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56803		/users/profile/59508	tboylan57	Volunteer	5	11/12/2010	I have been volunteering in the kitchen at Open Arms for 16 months. I arrive weekly at 5:00 and they are prepared for me and put me to work; I never feel as though I am wasting time. The shifts are well managed and coordination of cooking/packing projects appear seamless from my perspective. The staff is always friendly and open to volunteer feedback. The professionalism of the chefs is reflected in the high quality food they prepare daily for delivery.The new building has changed the dynamics of each shift but allows Open Arms to take their services to next level. The increasing need for these services could not be sustained in the old space. The Staff and Board of Directors long range vision allows for expansion of our services into the next decade.I look forward to my shift each week and have only cancelled a couple of times when it could not be avoided. I have met some awesome  people during my shifts and it is an incredible feeling to spend two hours a week with a group of individuals sharing the same vision!! Everyone at Open Arms is appreciative of all the volunteers and do not take us for granted. They welcome you in at the beginning of your shift and Thank you as they tell you it is time to leave; never asking for more than you can give in time and effort.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56780		/users/profile/59474	MIchael	Volunteer	5	11/11/2010	I have been volunteering consistently at Open Arm for close to two years, and my experiences have been nothing but positive. From the moment volunteers walk in the door they are greeted warmly, and everyone is given the opportunity to share their talents. Volunteer shifts are available throughout the week and weekends, so I'm able to cook in the kitchen after my day job. During the past two years I've bonded with my co-colunteers and with the Open Arms staff and made lasting friendships. I've also had the opportunity to serve with the young professionals group and gain a whole new perspective on the organization. Open Arms is a collection of some of the most skilled, passionate, energized people I have ever had the pleasure of working with, all driving forward an essential mission of nourishing mind, body and soul.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56772		/users/profile/59459	Karen	Volunteer	5	11/11/2010	I have been actively volunteering with Open Arms of Minnesota for almost 14 years.  Not only does the organization prepare and deliver healthy, appetizing, visually appealing meals to individuals living with life threatening illnesses, but Open Arms provides hope, a sense of dignity, respect, love, care, support, encouragement, compassion, strength, and vision to their clients and volunteers.  My volunteer experiences have included helping in the kitchen to prepare, portion out, and package the meals, to assisting with special events and volunteer appreciations, to now delivering meals on a weekly basis to clients.  Open Arms cares about every aspect of their operation, from the detail of planning, preparing and presentation of the meals to continuously engaging with the volunteers to get their input and feedback to make the organization better.  The Open Arms staff is accessible, friendly, engaged and values their volunteers.  I feel like I get more out of Open Arms than I give.  Volunteering with Open Arms has enriched my life, shown me how impactful an organization can be in the lives of others who need help, and enabled me to establish life long friendships with other volunteers.  I would strongly encourage anyone looking for a meaningful volunteer experience to give Open Arms a try.
Open Arms of Minnesota	56739		/users/profile/59414	Margaret Ann	Volunteer	5	11/11/2010	Open Arms is a sunbeam in the dreary world of hunger.  By preparing and delivering nutritious meals to clients with chronic and progressive diseases (HIV/AIDS, MS, cancer, ALS), we bring that sunbeam into our clients homes.  When you envision a world of abundance where people wont go hungry, you have to start small to accomplish such a big goal.I came to Open Arms 15 years ago as a volunteer.  Hugs welcomed me into the doors of a new building.  I made carrot cake, soup, sandwiches and many more delicious treats in quantities I couldnt have fathomed before.  Ive stuffed and sealed envelopes, I set up and worked at fundraisers, I helped get our name into the community through outreach and media work.  Always working next to a dedicated staff  a staff constantly looking for ways to serve more clients better.  And always working next to volunteers  an amazing number are also still volunteering for Open Arms 15 years later.  When our client need outgrew our building, we raised money and built a new building.  The hugs, the volunteers, the staff and, yes, the love moved right into that new building and set up shop  motivated by the knowledge that with more space we can serve more clients and bring our goal of people not going hungry to fruition.  When you start small, your work snowballs.  Open Arms sunbeam ensures that our clients dont go hungry  and each year we add more clients to our numbers. 
Urban Homeworks Inc	233197		/users/profile/296899	havehammer	Volunteer	5	11/07/2014	As a volunteer, I came onsite hoping to do my thing, feel good, and get outta there - on to the rest of my life and back to my schedule.  I expected I'd walk away feeling bad about the amount of need in certain communities.  Instead, I walked away completely humbled by the information that I was given, the "Doodle", the beautiful people that are intentionally building and inhabiting stronger neighborhoods, and the degree to which Urban Homeworks staffers are enmeshed in it all.  I walked away inspired and reevelauting my agenda in the first place.  I look forward to going back and to supporting this strong organization.
Urban Homeworks Inc	140317		/users/profile/186490	MN Farm boy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2012	I work nationally as a consultant and trainer to housing development nonprofits. These travels allow me to have many conversations with leadership and front line staff in all parts of the country with regard to best practices, challenges, and sustainable impact. Urban Homeworks is by far the most creative, productive, and innovative community development organizations in the entire country. And to top it all off, they do what they do in true parttnership with the entire community and with a faith-based mission in the heart of the city! 
Urban Homeworks Inc	138912		/users/profile/185005	Anonymous donor	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I have been supporting Urban Homeworks for over a decade, and as a 100 Gives 100 monthly donor for 5 years or so.  Here's why: I find myself "refreshed" and impressed how they creatively approach challenging issues in their target communities.  Lets be honest: there does not seem to be a whole lot of creativity or innovation coming from most non-profits or ministries when it comes to addressing the issues/needs in poor communities.  But time and time again Urban Homeworks is creatively combining marketplace expertise with informed compassion with impressive outcomes.  Well done!
Urban Homeworks Inc	138506		/users/profile/184573	Ron_17	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I'm not an "evangelist" but I feel I make a difference by volunteering with Urban Homeworks to renovate homes and apartments that benefit people who normally couldn't afford dignified housing.  One house, one apartment at a time we are making a difference and improving the lives of others.  Urban Homeworks is a concientious steward of the donations they receive, always working to maximize the benefit of donations through volunteer labor and great leadership.
Urban Homeworks Inc	138500		/users/profile/184567	MarkJD	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Urban Homeworks is the one organization that our members at Westbrook Community Church love to volunteer for and to support!  From top to bottom the Urban Homeworks staff is top-notch and passionate about their mission within the community, neighborhood and families that they serve.  They utilize their resources in a manner that is unmatched and you will not find a better non-profit organization.  All in the name of Christ - Yeah!
Urban Homeworks Inc	138244		/users/profile/184294	rerlandjohnson	Donor	5	11/13/2012	We have had UHW on our list of favorite non-profit organization for more than five years. As members of Christ Presbyterian Church in Edina, it has been a great joy to participate in several work weekends and with the QuickSilver volunteers. UHW's impact on their community has been considerable, not only in housing, but most assuredly on the lives of many.   One Hudred for a Hundred, a rent subsidy program, has been very successful.

The group is forward-thinking and operates beyond the four walls they are dedicated to putting around people/families. Their commitment to neighborhood as a state of being is inspiring and effective. Please help to support this incredible organization.
Urban Homeworks Inc	137823		/users/profile/183835	Glen C.	Volunteer	4	11/13/2012	My involvement with Urban Homeworks began over two years as a result of a St Marks fundraiser.  Over the past two years, I have volunteered twice a week and have observed firsthand how this organization has helped build community and restore housing in North Minneapolis.  They have provided gainful employment, mentoring opportunities, and both work skills and life skills  to various individuals (and organizations) in the community. Along the way, I have also increased my own home building/restoring skills and learned how to use power tools more effectively.  Keep up the good work!!
Urban Homeworks Inc	137697		/users/profile/183693	J.Otto	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I had the opportunity to work with Urban Homeworks last year. I really admire the difference they are making in the community for so many people. This is a great organization to donate your time with. They are able to use any level of help with their projects. I painted and cleaned a home and had a great time with the other volunteers. It is really important to get involved in our communities and this is a fantastic way to do it! I highly recommend donating some of your time to this great organization.
Urban Homeworks Inc	137635		/users/profile/183633	Ashley H	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have been volunteering with UHW for about 3 years now, I started doing it with my church and now have become the contact between other volunteers at my church and UHW.  This is a great place for men and women to get involved no matter what your skill level is.  I like that aspect of it because it allows a diverse group of people to get out, be in Minneapolis, and doing something productive with their hands.  I love that they always share the story of who UHW is and what they are trying to do, this not only allows volunteers to know that they are needed and appreciated but also know what role they play in the bigger picture.  I have enjoyed working with many people at UHW and look forward to finding more ways for our church to get involved through making gift baskets, connecting with other inner city churches, and hearing the stories of hope coming out of this organization!

The people are fun and laid back but still focused on getting the job done and creating a better Christ centered community of people helping people. Thanks to all at Urban Homeworks for allowing us to help out.

Urban Homeworks Inc	137347		/users/profile/183320	wvermilyea	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I'm a volunteer at Urban Homewoorks and part of a group of senior guys that really enjoy working on the various projects.  To see the transformation of houses starting with the demo and ending with the "punch list" to finish various tasks is amazing and, we have a ton of fun while doing it.  I've mentioned to leadership that, having lived in the Twin Cities for over 30 years, Urban Homewoorks is the best kept secret and shouldn't be such.   What this organization does to offer affordable housing while revitalizing neighborhoods is outstanding.  I'm just happy to be a small part in making that happen.

Not only has the experience of helping prepare the properties for occupancy been very rewarding and inspiring, but the fellowship with the Urban Homeworks staff and the dedicated guys on the crews has been amazing.

Urban Homeworks Inc	137321		/users/profile/183291	Ben J.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	My name is Ben Jaworski, and I have volunteered with Urban Homeworks both in the office and on-site with some of the renovations. Initially, I was a volunteer draftsman for Urban Homeworks. I chose them for my internship so I could finish my degree in Architectural Drafting. After I caught them up on their renovation plans, I got to help with some of the actual remodeling, even on some of the home I myself had been in and drafted. It was amazing to see just how fast the changes could take place, and how hard everyone was working. Then, after a few months of renovating, they acquired more houses that needed drafts, and they hired me as a private contract draftsman for three homes.  It has been an honor to serve with Urban Homeworks. My only regret is that I was not there for the tornado relief effort, for which UHW has received a lot of praise from the communities. Urban Homeworks is a wonderful organization. When they need something done in the office, they don't just send an email, or try them on the phone, they walk to that person's office and get the task done as soon as possible. They hold weekly meetings so that everyone involved is up-to-date on the current happenings at UHW, and get progress reports on renovations. They are a wonderful organization, and I am happy to have worked with them.

I've been impressed at the organization's intense focus on their mission.   As a business executive, I appreciate how effectively and diligently UH goes about their work - being excellent stewards of donors funds.   I applaud their ability to wrestle with the changes brought on by their rapidly expanding operation.  
Urban Homeworks Inc	136812		/users/profile/182755	Kari D.	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2012	As a neighbor in North Minneapolis I have the privilage to live near many of Urban Homework's houses. Any organization can rehab a building but Urban Homeworks rehabs neighborhoods by the quality work they do, engaging the community during the transformation of a building and challenging those who become an Urban Homeworks resident to be part of the solution for the surrounding blocks. If North Mpls had more organizations like this you wouldn't be hearing such bad things on the news about the "Northside" but rather a transformation. From top down the folks at Urban Homeworks are top notch as experienced first hand and your dollar if donated here will go further than you would ever imagine.

I was fortunate to see the evolution of a property that seemed like it was barely habitable to a wonderful, multi-family dwelling that was getting comments from neighbors and passersby on what an amazing transformation took place after Urban Homeworks acquired the property.  God Bless !

The people of UHW have the right heart and have developed the ability to effectively and consistently serve our city.   I have complete confidence that every hour and dollar we provide them will be used to strengthen families and individuals in meaningful, powerful and lasting ways. UHW does big work and it's an unsurpassed delight to be one of their many partners.

Urban Homeworks Inc	136653		/users/profile/182590	Blmtn	Donor	5	11/10/2012	This organization gives me a warm heart -  and hope!  First, the fact that they are faith based is wonderful.  In a very secular world, knowing their faith is first in the structure and how they function is great!  The employees are always looking for new ways to help, give others hope and grow their faith.  The volunteers are great too.  My boss is constantly coming back with enthusiastic stories about Urban and the people who work and volunteer there.  They are giving people a place to live, a life with dignity and a chance to see there are good people who care and practice what they preach in our community.
Urban Homeworks Inc	135501		/users/profile/181367	KatyaP	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2012	I worked in the same community with Urban Homeworks for much of a year.  I arrived just after the devastation of the tornado and was more than impressed with the leadership and effort Urban Homeworks dedicated to addressing the needs in the community.  This is one example of how their team is both exceedingly professional while also deeply personally committed to their work and the people and community.  Its a pleasure to see the creativity, persistence, and shear hard work that this organization brings to its mission-based work.  They have a profound impact.  Executive Director, Chad Schwitters, is a smart, passionate, committed individual leading a team of exceptional people to work in concert with the neighborhood.  Urban Homeworks stands out among the best and most impactful organizations in the Twin Cities without a doubt.

Through the influence, foundational messages, and philosophy of Urban Homeworks, our students and graduates from Bethel have grown immensely in their understanding of urban systems, poverty, and the assets found in urban neighborhoods!

I've had the great pleasure of working with them on a number of initiatives; their work ethic is unmatched. To boot, they are a fun-loving staff and always a joy to be around. Results are key to success in the community development field. The numbers they put up - supported by the stories told by families and individuals they have helped - speak for themselves. Innovation + Passion is a winning formula. This is an A+ organization.

Global Volunteers	248656	3	/users/profile/336422	northerngirl	Volunteer	4	07/16/2015	I have been on the Global Volunteers trip (to Peru) & I was so impressed with this organization, the way the planning process was all the way to the last night in Lima, with our local team leader (Edith:). Both my husband & I found meaningful work to do, from childcare to kitchen duties, our entire time was pleasantly "busy". The food, lodging, and Peruvian hospitality was wonderful.  We are now planning a 2nd trip, to St. Lucia, again with GV. I do agree that only negative is the fees being a bit high for the average traveler. Also, we live in Canada, so flight costs can be higher for us (especially to South America in winter!). and our fees cannot be claimed as charitable expenses in our taxes- as any American traveler is allowed to do. I did ask about this but was simply told that is due to Global Volunteers being an American based organization & they do not have any agreement in place with our CRA. But after travelling for years & living abroad, I realize that you also get what you pay for.I know several people that have taken "volunteer" trips with other groups, saying that the others were much cheaper than GV but the experiences they had were not good at all (little or poor support from local staff, inconsistent/bad food, dirty/unsafe lodging, NO actual valuable work for volunteers to do). My daughter opted to take a volunteer trip with another organization based in the UK (projects abroad) with only budget in mind,  but she quickly regretted it after she was forced to share a volunteer house with a group of students that had more interest in drinking & partying all night than doing any kind of work. After she found herself pretty much left on her own every "workday" with a map & a bus schedule, wondering when the promised "lunch" was going to be served, she certainly wished she had chosen Global Volunteers!Honestly, I feel that the fees we pay are well used; salaries for the local team leaders, quality food & housing for the volunteers, safe transport to & from airport & volunteer sites, and so forth.I would prefer to have 1 quality trip every few years with GV (which really does make a difference to the local communities they serve) than an annual "cheaper" volunteer vacation with any of these other bargain basement deals.

I just took my 10th  Global Volunteers trip  and traveled to Chennai, India. This is also the first time there was a husband and wife team.  I enjoyed the family and 4 year old son very much.  This is the way to travel to see, feel,  and stand in their shoes for a culture experience.Margaret Gabriel, Columbus, Ohio
Global Volunteers	140016		/users/profile/186170	Joe T.	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	During my 23 years associated with Global Volunteers I have had the pleasure of befriending many wonderful people.  I have learned and witnessed the common thread of humanitythe desire by all to provide for their families and the hope and optimism for a better life for their children. I believe what makes GV unique is our philosophy of service.  First, we only go to where we are invited.  We partner with the community and work on projects of their choice.  Our only requirement is that it serves the community and that they provide an equal number of community volunteers.  Local people are in charge.  This allows us the opportunity to work together with our new found friends on a common goal and share our life experiences.  We learn of their day to day struggles and share with them life in Americathe good and the bad.   We depart proud of our contributions but realizing that we have received so much more than we have given. 
Global Volunteers	137158		/users/profile/183115	conzelma	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	Global Volunteers will change your life. It is an organization with integrity at its core, with unassailable foundational principles of bottom-up international development, and with talented and committed staff and founders. I have been involved with Global Volunteers since 1994 as a volunteer, a team leader, and a National Board of Directors member. Every team is a unique experience, guided by the needs and direction of the community and the diverse personalities of the local people and the volunteers. Service learning often seems like an abstract ideal; with Global Volunteers it becomes a reality. You have the chance to enact the Philosophy of Service in real time with concrete results (and you should read it thoroughly as well). Life is short, get out there and volunteer!
Global Volunteers	137143		/users/profile/183102	juliefknudsen	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	My three daughters and I have volunteered on several trips. Our first trip was working on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 2005. We have been on three subsequent trips, and we are hoping to volunteer again with Global Volunteers this summer. Initially, my husband was very concerned about our safety, but Global Volunteers is a top-knotch organization. Our Global Volunteers' experiences have truly positively impacted our lives in many, many ways.
Global Volunteers	136995		/users/profile/182948	Cindy Murray	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	Global Volunteers has been a part of my world for over 15 years.  My first experience with Global Volunteers was in Metcalfe, Mississippi, a town of 1400 African Americans.  Our volunteer group consisted of 10 Caucasian women ages 17 to 84, none of whom knew one another.  The community was gracious and welcoming.   The volunteers were fun and anxious to serve.  Most of us had never had the chance to peer into another community so closely.  We learned and bonded quickly; through stories, laughter, and working alongside one another.  Since then, I have had the privilege to volunteer as a team leader to various states and countries, on behalf of Global Volunteers.  Global Volunteers is one of the best run organizations in which I have ever been associated.  For individuals with open minds, flexible mindsets, and the desire to contribute toward a more just and peaceful world, there is no better organization.  Join us!  You will be rewarded beyond what you can imagine.

I speak from experience - as a volunteer team leader who has led several Global Volunteers teams. (Full disclosure: I am also a former staff member, having worked there from '97 to 2007.) This is a great way to immerse yourself in another culture and meet the local people on their terms. In addition to helping others, you can also learn a lot about yourself through these programs. And you really are making a difference. Thumbs up!  
Global Volunteers	136207		/users/profile/147954	Rickyloo	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I have been a Global Volunteers team leader since 2000.  I have lead about 50 teams.......and I am passionally dedicated to the philosophy of the organization.    Among the many goals is to build relationships and friendships between people.....one person at a time.   When we go to a site....we go as "servant learners" meaning we do what the community wants us to do....and we respectfully follow their direction.   I have met extraordinary people in each community I have volunteered in.   The men and women on the teams I have lead are equally dedicated to the work we do.....so I see many of the same people on other teams.  My husband and I went on our first team to Xian China in 1999.   I have been a loyal volunteer ever since.
Global Volunteers	108713		/users/profile/147954	Rickyloo	Volunteer	5	03/31/2012	I have been a team leader for Global Volunteers for 12 years.   My husband and I went on our first team with Global Volunteers to Xian China in 1999.   I volunteered at a private school teaching English and my husband worked with a group of business men and women.   It was our first experience volunteering with a non profit organization.   We were so impressed with the integrity of the organization.  Everything they told us was as they said.  We were sent valuable and useful information that shared with  us the philosophy of the organziation.  We found their goals and values to be exactly what we were looking for.   The goal of the organiation was to build friendships and promote peace....one person and one community at a team.  We had a team leader who guided us through team building meetings.....and then saw to it that we were taken care of for the three weeks we volunteered.  We stayed in comfortable accomodations....were treated to decilcious meals and were assigned to interesting work sites.   We have maintained email relationships with many of the people we met in the community.  I was so impressed with the organization that I have since become a volunteer team leader.  I went through an intensive training program in St. Paul MN.....and over the past twelve years have lead about fifty teams.   I am more and more committed to the philosphy of the organization.....being servant learners....doing what the community asks of us and following directions in a respectful way.   I am very proud to be a Global Volunteer.     
Global Volunteers	135685		/users/profile/181563	Maria55	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I became a Team Leader for Global volunteers in 1998, and lead many groups while living in China.  I think An Wei and Bud Philbrook and Michell Gran should get the Nobel Peace Prize for their relationship by building the first NGO school in An Shung village.  This was dedicated to An Wei's daughter, An Lin, who lost her life in America while studying English to take over the China Program.  She was my translator.  I thought of her as my daugher.  This time in my life was the most significant experience in peace-making.  I cannot express my feelings more that saying it was friendship and love.  My experiences also led me to Hawaii and the project in Kauai which was helping eradicate invasive species in the tropical jungles.  I have been to Mexico.  The experience of Global Volunteers is awesome.  It is an adventure.  It takes a flexible person ready to drop their expectations of how things should be done, and following the direction of the local people.  It is all around a first class operation of change.

Global Volunteers	134768		/users/profile/180641	Lorene3	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I have completed 20 service programs with Global Volunteers, volunteering primarily in Poland. The programs are well coordinated on both ends of the volunteer experience -- before leaving and when on site. The reason these programs work is that Global Volunteers helps other accomplish their own goals. Volunteers don't come in and tell others what they need. Volunteers also work hand in hand with people in the host site. It's a great program. 
Global Volunteers	110440		/users/profile/150354	eric noyes	Volunteer	5	04/21/2012	My wife and I traveled with Global Volunteers to Pommern, Tanzania three times over the past four years.  We were impressed with their Philosophy of Service and how it is implemented every day during the service program.  Global Volunteers took care of all our basic needed throughout each service trip.  We had meaningful work in the community every day.  We helped teach English and other subjects in the Secondary School, we worked on various work and minor construction projects side by side with community members, we helped weigh babies during a monthly well baby clinic, and we learned a considerable amount about local and national Tanzanian culture and society.  Global Volunteers' in-country staff are very well trained.  They work with volunteers to fit volunteers' skills and interests with those of the community to maximize their benefits.  They seek opportunities for volunteers to interact with the community to promote inter-cultural awareness.  We had a wonderful experience each time we traveled with Global Volunteers and plan to do so again many times in the future.
Global Volunteers	109118		/users/profile/148597	minnesota	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	I have gone on trips with Global Volunteers in China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Guatemala and Jamaica, as well as in the U.S..  They have always been well organized and extremely cost-effective for what I received.  I am impressed with their professionalisma nd oganization.  I would happily go on another experience when time the opportunity arises.
Global Volunteers	108773		/users/profile/148051	pbazany	Volunteer	5	04/02/2012	I loved my Global Volunteers service opportunity. I chose Global Volunteers because I wanted to maximize my chances of a interacting with the people in the community I would be visiting.  My Global Volunteers adventure did not disappoint in any way.  The trip was well-organized, well-managed and well-received by both volunteers and host community.  I enjoyed my fellow volunteers, our project and the time available to pursue personal interests.  What I enjoyed most, however, was being in that small Costa Rican community -- the people, the food, the chance to both glimpse and be a part of a different way of living.

We have taught English, painted,built, helped children with disabilities, and done whatever the local community wanted us to do. It has been a wonderful experience in every place we have served. Also, the bonding with other volunteers has been in itself so worthwhile. We are looking foward to again going with Global Volunteers to leave our mark on the world.--Roger Yockey, Lynnwood, Washington
Global Volunteers	108738		/users/profile/147993	KenB2	Volunteer	5	04/01/2012	I was impressed by my experience with Global Volunteers. The team leader in Xi'an was fantastic: upbeat, personable, incredibly helpful and supportive. I worked for two weeks at La La Shou, a special needs school, and it was a terrific experience. The language barrier was difficult, but I felt that our presence at the school (I volunteered there with a friend) gave a lift to the teachers. We were a novelty in their busy weeks. I'd recommend Global Volunteers to others: from our lodging to the work site, we were well supported and cared for.
Global Volunteers	108734		/users/profile/147986	Teri Calvin	Volunteer	5	04/01/2012	Global Volunteers gave me an opportunity to "Leave My Mark" on the world in Xi'an, China.  For two weeks, Monday through Friday, I taught  conversational English, pronunciation and comprehension to students with various levels of English understanding at Xi'an Biomedical Technical School.  Most of the students, who ranged in age from 15 to 22, were Han Chinese from various provinces.  However, one group, were Uyghurs from Xinjiang province.  These Muslim students had their own language and customs, including dietary requirements.  The Uyghr students are learning Mandarin, The Chinese national language, as well as English.  The stundents eagerly shared their culture and were enthusiastic in learning about the United States.  My volunteer experience put me face-to-face daily with typical Chinese locals in daily situations. It was a living experience of a cultural exchange. The Global Volunteer Country Manager, shared with us the language, customs, history and the daily opportunity to taste the delicious foods.  I do believe that World Peace does begin through mutual international understanding, which is one of the philosophies of service with Global Volunteers.  I felt that I made a "difference" and was gifted with a rewarding experience.  I look forward to another opportunity in the future to "Leave My Mark" with Global Volunteers.
Global Volunteers	108716	2	/users/profile/147874	gpotvin	Volunteer	5	03/31/2012	My wife and I have done five volunteer trips with Global Volunteers - Ecuador (June, 2007), Romania (October, 2008), Tanzania (January, 2010), Peru (January, 2011) and India (January, 2012).  GV is extremely organized and makes every effort to assure that volunteers are well prepared for each service project.  GV provides a wealth of written materials, responds promptly to inquiries and questions and has a comprehensive web-site.  Programs are sponsored by local entities which provides positive interaction with the community we serve.  The country managers are well versed about their countries and assist each volunteer in having a meaningful cultural experience.  We  have great respect for GV and believe they are one of the best NGOs, if not the best around.  We recommend the program highly and would be glad to answer individual questions.
Global Volunteers	108714		/users/profile/147955	akleissler	Volunteer	5	03/31/2012	My husband and I have four sons, Matt, Jack, Dan, and Ryan.  In 2007 Matt was invited to participate in an educational travel program designed for high school students.  Having remembered seeing a piece on The Today Show a number of years previously on short-term volunteering abroad, Matt and I began to investigate Global Volunteers.  Based in St. Paul, MN, since 1987 Global Volunteers has worked in partnership with local leaders in over 15 countries around the world to bring human and economic resources to children and families in remote areas such as the small village of Pommern, in the southern highlands of Tanzania.  Although Tanzania is an emerging and very safe country, it continues to be one of the most disadvantaged countries in the world.  While drawn by the opportunity to meet new people and experience a new culture, what quickly convinced us to go was Global Volunteers itself.  Global Volunteers is guided by a unique philosophy of service, stating simply, that to be truly successful in sustainable development assistance, volunteers must work at the invitation, and under the direction, of those they are attempting to assist.  Local people are always in charge.  Global Volunteers believes that true development mobilizes empowered people:  both those seeking assistance, and those who seek to serve them.  Matt and I had the privilege to serve with GV in 2008.  I then returned with my son Jack in 2008, and will return in July 2012 with Dan and Ryan.In the Iringa district where the village of Pommern is located, the needs are immense and resources are few.  Although Pommern is high on a mountain, there are many smaller villages further up, forcing villagers to walk 25km to come to the clinic, school, or to catch the daily bus to Iringa. Homes are made of sun-baked mud bricks, and must be re-bricked each year before the rainy season begins in December.  Most roofs are thatched, but a few have corrugated metal roofs.  A few of the buildings in the village receive electricity from a generator from 7-10PM each night.  On each of our trips, all the members of our GV service teams took turns rotating jobs throughout the village, working on labor projects, teaching at one of the local schools, or assisting in the local clinic or remote clinic. If one of the volunteers had a particular interest or talent to share they were always graciously received and encouraged.  For example, when at the vaccination clinic we spent a morning weighing babies, recording the vaccination schedule, and administering the necessary immunizations.  Working to assist the doctors and nurses, a bed functioned as our examining table and work surface, while the mothers and children waited patiently for hours on end until we could help each of them. Nervous about teaching, Matt found his niche teaching computer skills at the secondary school, while Jack had a blast teaching conversational English at the primary school.  After a successful lesson in the use of with, but, and then, Ill never forget him trying to teach a group of 40 kids how to play Heads Up, 7-Up!  Each afternoon after our teaching assignments were done, we worked on labor projects such as painting dorms, or resurfacing the floor of the mess hall.   In the past teams built the school library, and put a new roof on the school kitchen that allowed for better ventilation.  Until then, kitchen workers had routinely died from prolonged exposure to smoke.  My sons loved refining their masonry skills on the labor projects, learning to take vital signs and the procedures of meat inspection with the village doctor, and most especially, laughing and playing with the children each afternoon.  Priceless is inadequate to describe the value of these moments in the lives of my children, but I think Jack summed it up beautifully for our team journal:  When my mother and brother came to Pommern two years ago I couldnt relate to them about what they experienced while they were here, but now that I have been here I can look back and see the change in them.  It is very hard to explain and that is what I am worried about when I am back trying to explain my trip to my friends in America, but it is there.I didnt have a dramatic moment when I felt this new perspective become part of my outlook but now I know it is there.  It comes from seeing the kids wearing the same clothes day in and day out, from watching the patients at the clinic fight their diseases and injuries with such courage, from watching how the students work hard all day long, and from seeing how Moses sleeps on a bed he made himself with an old torn-up blanket.I feel like a different person now, and though I miss my friends and family, I never want to leave.  I have become attached to the people here and my fellow team members.  From the calls of Jackie Jackie as I walk through the village, or the warm mandazi while sitting on a bench packed with people watching the World Cup, Pommern has given me much more than I could ever repay, and I am grateful for this.  I hope to take what I have learned here back to my day-to-day life in America.  I will miss all of you and I hope to see you again.

Global Volunteers was organized and thoughtful throughout the entire process. By the time we left we felt that we'd gained a family among the other volunteers, and the memories we have of the amazing children we worked with are with us every day. My kids, who were ages 8, 10 and 13 at the time of the trip, worked harder than I had ever seen, and enjoyed themselves every step of the way. They still keep photographs of the children they worked with at the center and we plan on doing another trip with Global Volunteers again soon.

Global Volunteers	99921	1	/users/profile/121312	J. Sinha	Volunteer	3	10/28/2011	I had 2 very satisfying experiences volunteering with GV.  They took good care of us.  However, when I went on line to see what programs they had for this year i was surprised to fnd that GV had only a 2 star rating from Charity Navigators.  I agree that the fees GV charges are WAY too high!  I also had the suspicion that the for-profit school we taught English in Hanoi used us English teachers as a marketing tool.
Global Volunteers	86587		/users/profile/96980	Caregiver	Volunteer	3	04/20/2011	I also volunteered with GV.  Although the coordinator often called in "sick", they took excellent care of us.  I will never forget the babies.  HOWEVER, the price they charge is WAY TOO MUCH.  They also charge an ungodly amount for a single room-there is no way the hotel gets that money.  So it was an unforgetable experience, but I will donate my $$$ elsewhere.
Global Volunteers	84990	3	/users/profile/94523	Daniel Rusthoi	Volunteer	2	04/07/2011	I enjoyed serving in Crete, and yes, I agree with the Volunteer who served in Romania, that the fees charged to the volunteers is far far far in excess of what should be charged.   They must be 'lining their pockets' or having to support a huge overhead.   I was greatly overcharged -- brought it to their attention, but it was never addressed.
Global Volunteers	53224		/users/profile/54307	hope5	Volunteer	4	09/23/2010	I went to Romania for two weeks over the holidays and it was heart breaking and heart warming.  GV took excellent care of us.  My only concern is the very large fee charged.  We are told much goes to the housing, but the amount we are charged is far far far above what is needed for that part.  Why else is an extra week only $200. more?  But I will never forget the babies.

Each experience is different yet somewhat the same. It is a good way for any person who is a little fearful of traveling to a foreign country, yet wants to travel to abroad. You have a built in support group.  Try it; you'll like it.

I have traveled with Global Volunteers because I believe in their philosophy of service, know that I will be safe and know that I am making a difference in someone's life. The feelings that I have in my heart when I return from one of these special trips sustains me throughout the rest of the year. Volunteer vacations is the perfect balance of exotic travel, intimate involvement with the communities you visit, making new friends and making the world a better place for all of us. I encourage others to consider this way of being of service. It will transform your life!
CaringBridge	236071	1	/users/profile/319826	stripey,	Client Served	5	12/30/2014	My mom was diagnosed with cancer and she lives in a very remote area and has few real-life friends. She read that cancer patients have better survival rates if they have a website/blog, so she found caringbridge. It has surpassed all of our expectations of a nonprofit organization. They helped with IT support when my mom decided she no longer wanted certain people accessing her site. It gave her something to do between treatments...she would journal and post plenty of pics of her progress, and family and friends from around the world would support her through the hardest times. I don't know how our family would have been able to get her updates and support her without this site. I would recommend it, hands down, above any other site for anyone having a significant life event. My mom said she would go back and read the posts from people and look at pics people sent her when she was feeling very weak and down. Normally there is always a catch with a good website but there really were no fees, ads, or anything like that. You just need to be aware that if you donate it goes to caringbridge, not to the individual who is using the site. Try it and you won't regret it. Thanks caringbridge- you helped me be by my mom's side when I couldn't do it physically.

Sonja Mehring  created this website to help a friend in need, but has now in just the last few years given herself over $100,000 in raises. $180,000 a year to head a NON-profit is disgusting.

During an incredibly difficult family crises I turned to CaringBridge to help with family communication. I was appalled when I found my newly created site had ads and pop-ups all over it, using my personal story as a way to ask for donations. Not to support me or my family during this difficult time, but to support this website. I had friends and family informing me that when visiting the site they were greeted with  annoying pop-up ads informing them that my daughter (by name) needed their finical help. In reality, CaringBridge was using my daughter, her story just yo make money. I did some research and found that CaringBridge makes millions of dollars every year has has many employees making 6 figure incomes. This profit machine should be ashamed of it's practices. Needless to say there are may other great alternatives to CaringBridge and I recommend checking them out.
CaringBridge	200061		/users/profile/261154	mardeesaxton	Client Served	5	05/11/2014	I first used CaringBridge in 2008 when my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. At that time, I lived 1500 miles away from my parents' home in Arizona, and then I moved to Germany in 2010. We were miles and then countries apart, and the site provided a critical and constant connection for us. Like any family experiencing a health crisis, we needed and appreciated the support from friends and family. Yet Dad and I couldnt keep up with all the questions and messages of support. Then a friend told me about CaringBridge. Over four years, my mom and I wrote over 100 Journal entries and her site received more than 16,000 visits. Writing in this journal was cathartic for me. Some days I was technical, defining terminology, researching, giving context and clarity to my mom's diagnosis, prognosis and options for treatment and care. On other days, I shared the emotional ups and downs we experienced. With the CaringBridge Journal updates in mind, I asked my mom questions, took notes on everything from doctor visits to what she ate that day, and always chose to look for positives during a difficult time. CaringBridge was a lifeline that connected us to each other, and to an incredible community of support.

She read that cancer patients have better survival rates if they have a website/blog, so she found caringbridge. It has surpassed all of our expectations of a nonprofit organization. They helped with IT support when my mom decided she no longer wanted certain people accessing her site. It gave her something to do between treatments...she would journal and post plenty of pics of her progress, and family and friends from around the world would support her through the hardest times. I don't know how our family would have been able to get her updates and support her without this site. I would recommend it, hands down, above any other site for anyone having a significant life event. My mom said she would go back and read the posts from people and look at pics people sent her when she was feeling very weak and down. Normally there is always a catch with a good website but there really were no fees, ads, or anything like that. You just need to be aware that if you donate it goes to caringbridge, not to the individual who is using the site. Try it and you won't regret it. Thanks caringbridge- you helped me be by my mom's side when I couldn't do it physically.
CaringBridge	199818	1	/users/profile/260848	EJayF	Client Served	5	05/07/2014	CaringBridge was an invaluable resource to me, my family, colleagues and dear friends during the year I was battling and recovering from Gastric Cardia cancer (June 2010 - 2011). It would have be exhausting, if not impossible, to keep our network informed  without CaringBridge.  It is an invaluable private website journal  that my 'supporters' had the choice to read and respond to made all the difference in our digital world.  I was referred to use CaringBridge thru a friend. Today I have 6 CaringBridge Sites that I have followed, sad to know that many people who have had the need - so pleased that CaringBridge was available to them too.  Six families that have had the opportunity to be supported through this incredible and private journal and messaging resource. I understand CaringBridge has been able to expand their resources to include other support services (meal schedules, etc.) that friends can use to reach out and help the patient and family.  Regarding the donations (which some reviewers have complained about), it is very clear that the donation goes directly to CaringBridge. No smoke and mirrors here: "When you donate to CaringBridge, you help build a world filled with care and compassion." It is no different that when you donate to other charities "In Honor of, or in Memory of" an individual. This is not uncommon, and is a wonderful way to let the person you are paying tribute to know how valuable their communications are during their difficult journey.  I am constantly told by friends and family how much they appreciated being able to stay updated on my health through CaringBridge. It was the year of my 35th HS reunion, an event I had helped organize in the past. Through CaringBridge so many of my HS alums were able to reach out and send inspiration to the woman they had known so long ago. Those friendships long abandoned by busy lives have even revitalized. Such a Blessing. The Guestbook messages gave me comfort, strength, and encouragement. Even today, 3 years later I can look back and see how far I have come from those days and reflect on the support I received from so many - in a private concise journal. Email and Facebook cannot easily provide this private space for reflection.  The Prayers, Support and Encouragement I received using the CaringBridge site was an invaluable asset to my recovery! Thank you CARINGBRIDGE!!  I have worked for 3 non profit organizations during my career. I have no connection to the CaringBridge organization, staff or volunteers. My experience is just that of a member of the general public and someone who has received support through the service provided by the CaringBridge website.

Our young son was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, and Caringbridge offered us a convenient and efficient way to keep family and friends informed about his progress as we fought his cancer.  It also provided us a source of strength and encouragement as we read messages to bolster our fight along our journey to recovery.  It continues to provide support encouragement to us, and we strongly recommend Caringbridge as a worthy charity for those looking to make a donation which will go a long way.  Thanks!

This site was invaluable to me at that time.  It gave me a way to keep family and friends aware of how he was doing.  It gave those praying around the country a place to check in and made it so easy for me as I did not have to worry about omitting anyone.   He received a new heart in August of 2010 and is doing well.  Could not have done it with this awesome site.Then in 2011 I was diagnosed with Lymphoma and a friend began a site for me.  I continue to update the same people.  I have been cancer free since competing treatment in June of 2011.  I Am so grateful for this website and the ease of use.Thank you CaringBridge for being there.Donna BlauwLake Forest Park, WA

We use the free website to communicate with our large extended families and my parents' extensive network of friends. It would be exhausting, if not impossible, to keep all of these people in the loop without CaringBridge. I am constantly told by friends and family how much they appreciate being able to stay updated on my mom's health through CaringBridge. The Guestbook messages give my mom comfort, strength, and encouragement. Our experience of my mom's journey with ovarian cancer would be entirely different without CaringBridge.  Regarding the donations (which some reviewers have complained about), I do know that CaringBridge is willing to refund any donation if the donor misunderstood that the donation would be directed to CaringBridge and not to the patient. That being said, 25 tribute donations have been made in my mom's honor, and I know that every single person who made a donation knew that it was going to CaringBridge. They wanted to give back to CaringBridge because of everything that CaringBridge have given to us. Several people have given multiple donations.  For full disclosure, I began volunteering for CaringBridge several months ago. However, my comments here are related to my experience as a CaringBridge user. Indeed, I would not be giving the organization any of my time if I did not think it is a worthy cause. 
CaringBridge	196353	8	/users/profile/256671	Duped-into-Donating	Client Served	1	03/24/2014	This company is sitting on a mountain of $4M in cash they've collected from unsuspecting donors... and that is after they pay their staff of 66 employees over $4.4M PER YEAR in compensation!   This company needs to be investigated by the IRS, FTC and FBI.  Clearly its core purpose is to enrich the founders and employees by duping people into thinking they are helping other people with medical bills. I will be contacting the Minnesota attorney general's office about this. Also, I believe most of the five star reviews on this site and Yelp and others are written by employees... take a look at how they are worded and you will see what I mean.  Scammy... very scammy.
CaringBridge	165389	8	/users/profile/219846	Catherine37	General Member of the Public	1	08/19/2013	This website asks for donations that go directly to the company. If you do not read it carefully you assume you are giving the money to your friends or family that is ill. Another example of a company making money of people's charity.
CaringBridge	164675	10	/users/profile/218867	BP40	General Member of the Public	1	08/12/2013	The design of the CaringBridge website is very deceiving.  They make it LOOK like the "tribute donations" will go toward a particular family when, in fact, the donations go directly into their pocket!!  On the top and the sides of the very personal and heartbreaking journal entries they have placed the DONATE buttons!!  There are over 40 "tribute" donations to a particular family that I know and I will bet that a good percentage of those donations were intended for the FAMILY and NOT CaringBridge.   What is worse, is the FACT that this has been an on-going complaint that CaringBridge refuses to correct!!  I am clearly not the first person who has made a donation only to figure out later (after a second, closer look at the "Thank you" email), that I had been DUPED.   Had I not looked closer at the email, it would have never occurred to me that CaringBridge pocketed my money.     They were great about issuing a refund. 
CaringBridge	151259		/users/profile/201879	Cassie G.	Volunteer	5	03/18/2013	This is just an amazing site! Being able to bring all their loved ones together in one place at one time. Those who are too far away or those that can't make a daily trip to spend time with the person at the other end of the "CaringBridge". Keeping everyone updated with the SAME information instead of relying on word of mouth, which let's face it, things get misinterpreted or facts gets communicated wrong. This site lets you set the "record" straight and keep everyone on the same page. It also gives the chance for all their loved ones to show love and support which is a key component the good health and healing!

It took all of 5 hours for me to realize its value as the various emails poured in following the operation that gave us the unwanted details. I simply could not have kept up with communications any other way. As new people hear of his issue, we just send them to Caring Bridge first so we don't have to constantly retrace things. It is much, much easier for us and leaves the other person better informed. Since then Caring Bridge has become our primary way of sharing our lives with friends and family. We know of many who go there first each day to see if there is a new post. For us, it is a way to talk about his cancer with some distance and perspective. They have a Support Planner that can go with it the blog, to list tasks that the Caregiver or Patient may need done, that is also offered free.

It keeps everyone in the loop and also makes it non-intrusive to the families.  Friends can get updates without having to bother the family or person that is ill.  It's hard to ask how a person is doing and sometimes the answer may not be good, so all involved are uncomfortable.  CaringBridge makes it more comfortable for all parties involved and keeps everyone apprised of details.  This is an amazing site.

WHO KNEW FROM THIS SITE?  she sent me the link and it. bounced. my. socks. off!!  at first i thought "how cool is THIS?" look at what she (my friend) made; then..."wait a sec...this isn't a personal deal...look at what is available to her at the hospital.  how come i never saw this before?";  then..."umm....hang on, here,  this isn't a hospital site, it's something different."; then...."HOLY  WOW!!"  after i read my friend's story and several journal entries, i found the parts where i could write to her and then where i could send a donation to help this site continue.  i wrote and wrote and wrote to her and then..."uh oh.  i haven't been working in a while.  money is kinda tight."  and then "I'LL KISS FEET ON BROADWAY IF I HAVE TO, BUT I HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP THIS CONTINUE!!"  and i did.  not a lot.  nothing huge.  just a little.  just the kind of amount that says that i can't have two bags of snicker's minis and three magazines this week; or the kind of amount that says i'll have to get my darned hair cut after 8 weeks instead of my usual 6 weeks.  you see, 28 years ago i watched my father die with my 6 month old only child in my arms.  thankfully, it went quickly, and for the most part he wasn't aware of much.  however, I was.  i was hyper-aware of EVERYTHING.  every breath he took; every squelch of a nurse's shoe in the hallway; every ring of the telephone which made me jump up like a cat kicked in the caboose because my nerves were so raw; all of the constant repetitions of the same litany i had to recite to every person that paraded through his room or called; over and over and over and over....had something like CaringBridge been available at that time (we didn't even have computers back then...wow, i'm a fossil) i think it would have taken me to a different place.  i believe that my hair would have stayed hair instead of the live nerve endings it had become.  i would have had an outlet; i would have been able to reach out; i could have let everyone know when it was a good time or a bad time to come or, when they needed to ALL come right away.  i could have read words of encouragement to my father as he lay in his bed in the hospital instead of snippets from books or newspapers that had nothing at all to say to him.  over the past 28 years since my father has been gone, we've gotten computers and cell phones and microwaves (WHOA) and so many friends of mine and family members, as well, have had me sitting at their bedsides asking them questions that, i'm sure, had been answered ten thousand times previously and so many of these same people hadn't heard from me at all because i didn't want to call or visit because i was afraid to disturb them and their family members during such a stressful time.  lots of times i was too late to call or visit.  lots of times i never got to say "i love you, you know that, right?"  i would have had that opportunity if we would have known about CaringBridge.  lots of people roll through life blessedly unaware of these kinds of situations; unaware of how blessed they are.  then, there are the people like me; people that have watched so many of their friends and co-workers and family members heroically wrestle with impossible diagnoses only to succumb in the end while we watch them, sit with them, see ourselves reflected back to us in their eyes; helpless and lost and unprepared even though we've been prepared; people like me who could have made a great and happy present of CaringBridge to our loved ones; people like me who could have written daily; who could have been better informed by reading daily posts and who could have made sure the words "i love you.  you know that, right?" would have been read.  before it was too late.  THIS SITE IS ONE OF THE SINGULAR MOST IMPORTANT PATIENT/FAMILY RELATED TOOLS I HAVE RUN ACROSS SINCE RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE.  it is a blessing and one that shouldn't be in danger of being lost.  now, i get onto facebook daily and urge, encourage, plead, cajole, bully, sweet talk and say anything and everything i can think of to get people off of their dead behinds and PAY ATTENTION!!  if they can pay REAL money to play VIRTUAL games on a venue such as facebook, then they have the spare greenbacks to toss a few around to CaringBridge, in my opinion.  and something as easy as MICROvolunteering?  c'mon!!  if you're sitting there staring at a pc screen with your eyes glazed over and drool running down the corners of your mouth while you are plowing your FARMVILLE field, you can just as easily make a post on your page for people to just "take a look at this CaringBridge thing, yo!"  how simple is THAT?  very.  how many people can that reach?  infinite numbers.  how important is it?  one of the most important things in the world.  thank you.  God bless you  all for your huge hearts and your wonderful imaginations which are making dire situations more palatable and pleasant and less stressful.

She always believed in early detection and went every year on time for her routine mammogram.  This July her journey to survive started and she has shared daily her progress, experience and feelings publicly. She has so far had over 1,000 visits and post that have inspired  her and brought her courage by way of their inspiration. During her work up prior to starting chemotherapy she had a PET scan, which shows if there has been any other organs affected. During this they found a spot on her kidney which also proved to be cancer. Both were primary sites, non related to each other. Since the breast was the fastest growing type of cancer and the kidney was the slowest they decided to jump on the breast aggressively with chemo and then follow with radiation. The chemo is different for each site so the chemo for her breast will not help her kidney. She has just finished her 3rd treatment and has posted her day to day emotions,, fears, concerns, an experiences for all her friends and loved ones to see and respond. She always looks so forward to reading her guest book and has never felt such an out pouring of love from others. The post inspire an encourage her to realize she is not alone and keeps her spirits up. She thanks God everyday that  Caring Bridge is available to her and gives her strength to carry on. She now believes she doesn't have a death sentence but a survivor sentence that she can carry on and help others on here going through a difficult time. Thank you Care Bridge for allowing her a place to vent her day to day recovery.

Depart Smart Dba Clearcause Foundation	198415	2	/users/profile/259131	outreachne	Volunteer	1	04/21/2014	While the work of the organization is needed and has merit, how the executive director handles the business end of things has a lot to be desired. It's unfortunate that she feels that the how she runs the business doesn't matter as long as she is able to do the service, because doing business that way really doesn't honor the kids the organization is supposed to be serving. She paid me in cash and never required a contract. Then she tried to pay me in clothes, so she could hide what she was doing from her husband and the board of directors. Then she finally gave me a check for $100 from the organization for work she never intended on letting me do. When I tried to call her on these and other questionable things she was doing, rather than take it as an opportunity to do the right thing, she retaliated and severed the relationship. She not only lied to her husband, but she wasn't honest with the board, either. While the work needs to be done, it is wrong to use the organization as an excuse to do whatever you want. If she wants control and absolute say to do whatever she wants, then do it under a for-profit set up. Otherwise, she needs to learn that the resources and assets belong to the organization and are not her personal toy. It's not an either/or thing. It has to be a both/and thing, and it's not that she can't do better, but rather she doesn't find it necessary to do better. It's unfortunate because how you run your business is what the IRS uses to determine whether or not you should have an exempt status or not, not on the services you provide.

More importantly, the ClearCause Foundation wants to do something  to prevent this from happening to any other families. That is why I became involved.  I am  a mother of a 20 year old daughter who died while studying abroad  in Costa Rica, in a vehicle driven by her professor, on roads that were known to him to  be unsafe to travel .  I am also a psychotherapist specializing in the treatment of traumatic stress  I know how senseless deaths  impact individuals, families, and communities; and I now my family and I are experiencing our own PTSD.ClearCause is serious about pursuing  legislation  that will hold universities  accountable and  that will mandate them to  provide adequate  safety standards and oversight of their study abroad programs. We want our children to learn, we also want them to return!  I am pleased with CCFs  persistent and strong effort to make change happen, and I will continue to support CCF until  our work is done. Bravo to Sheryl and Allen Hill for embarking on this cause, and bravo to all the families who are joining them.

During the time I have been involved with ClearCause Foundation, I have been very impressed with the fantastic work that they do to advocate for safe global youth travel; I am consistently humbled by how little parents and students know about safety while abroad. Donors, volunteers, and advocates should know that their donated time and resources helps ClearCause Foundation make tangible improvements in students' lives.

Client Served	5	08/21/2013	I met Sheryl about 4 years ago when my son got a letter from a company who wanted him to study abroad as a Student  Ambassador. I had my own reservations about the program,so I did my research. That is where I found Sheryl and I am so glad I did. I had already lost one child to Sudden Cardiac Death at the age of 7 and I was not about to send my oldest child abroad without doing a thorough investigation of the company, its members, & its track record! I am so thankful that I came across Sheryl's story because it helped me make the right decision for my son! Not only did she help me with my decision,but she was and still is a source of comfort when my spirits are low,regarding my daughter. She never fails to send an encouraging note or just an online hug. I also took the chance to send another tragic story,regarding the death of young man from my area, to Sheryl and she posted it on her sight to bring more awareness to the issues involving our young children and adults traveling abroad! As a result,that mother has contacted me and we will have lunch very soon! I cannot say enough about how important this foundation has been in my life and many others! I know,without a doubt,Sheryl will continue to serve parents around the world who are struggling with the thought of sending their child to another country, as well as making the world a safer place for those who do decide to take the trips!
Depart Smart Dba Clearcause Foundation	165182	1	/users/profile/219573	rthackur	Volunteer	5	08/16/2013	I found Sheryl via indepth internet research over a year ago after the lost of my son on a study abroad program 100% preventable and because of the program's careless decision making.  I researched because I wanted to know how many students like my son lost their lives carelessly, how many were injured, what oversight are there on these programs, what laws were there.  I found out there was nothing that protects our students and no accountability.  The pain, the lost, the despair, how this have taken down what we have built as a happy family MUST never happen to another student and family.  I thought I was very thorough...my son was too.  Did everything was advised to do...printed embassy information, he received his 8 shots for the jungle, got all meds advised.  Went above and beyond got him a snake boot to protect him. It was the decision of the program.  I like Sheryl and ClearCause advocate for the safety for your kids...we no longer fight for our own. They get away with it, their programs go on.  Look at it in this way...they get to commit murder without with careless decision and get away.

Depart Smart Dba Clearcause Foundation	114786	1	/users/profile/156408	kimbra	Donor	5	06/12/2012	I was introduced to Sheryl Hill at a Clear Cause event  about 6 months ago.  Immediately, I was drawn to hear more and participate with this mission.  You see, one evening around 3 AM, I received a phone call from my daughter who was traveling in Italy.  She was in the hospital and so very scared.  Even though I was in a state of panic, she needed to hear my reassuring and calm voice.  Fortunately, she was traveling with good friends who didn't leave her side throughout the entire ordeal and we were able to communicate with the hospital administration and she is in good health, safe and now at home.  However, it was an extremely distressing time... I can't imagine how a parent would feel when they are not able to receive adequate and timely  answers when their children     Sheryl's "cause" is "clear" - getting the message out to keep children safe while traveling.

She has educated me about the need for standards of practice for all travel programs, from those at our public schools through private institutions. How many deaths and traumatic experiences will it take until regulations or at least safety minimums are established by legislators? I applaud Sheryl and CCF for their huge steps forward. This year, I am proud to be part of helping CCF take even larger steps toward making study abroad an extremely positive, life changing, rather than life taking, experience.

Many people, unfortunately are just not yet aware of the need until something tragic happens during travel. I have know Sheryl Hill, ClearCause founder for 20 years on a personal and professional level. She is a motivated individual who is organized, connected, compassionate and able to accomplish whatever she decides needs to be done. I give ClearCause an excellent rating!

ClearCause seems to be the only organization that is bringing awareness to unsafe conditions, and their voice needs to be heard.

It is impossible to be with Sheryl for even a minute before recognizing her passion and dedication to working for a safer tomorrow for American students going abroad.  Parents too often have no idea the travel organization to which they are entrusting their child is unreliable and unfit to handle real emergencies.  Mrs. Hill is already having an impact - the US State Department is taking notice as are several schools who unwittingly are also often part of the problem.   This is a new nonprofit that has "just begun to fight."

Animal Humane Society	168614	2	/users/profile/223547	vmiller	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	I have volunteered with the Animal Humane Society of Golden Valley for several years, both on the adoption floors and in the surgery room. I can assure you that it is NOT a kill shelter. Animals stay with AHS until they are adopted. The staff at the Humane Society are very caring and will go to the ends of the earth to make sure that each and every animal finds a happy "forever home". They also have several programs that help shy pets grow more accustomed to humans: Project Pit Bull and Courageous Kitties. I can certainly debunk Pamela's assertion that the Golden Valley Humane Society is a kill shelter, because it is not. They take every single animal into their care that is brought to them and will NEVER kill an animal because they don't have enough room for it. That is simply absurd.

Animal Humane Society	120035		/users/profile/163197	Katie42	Client Served	5	08/05/2012	I adopted a dog from the Animal Humane Society in the spring of 2012. I could not be more pleased or satisfied with my experience. My dog originally came from an overcrowded shelter in Alabama, and the AHS accepted her and several other pets that didn't have a home or potential adopters down south. Despite being a few pounds underweight, she was healthy and happy when I adopted her. She had all her shots, was tested for heartworm (negative), tested and treated for worms, and was recently spayed. The AHS sterilizes ALL dogs and cats before adoption to help reduce pet overpopulation. She was also clean and I could tell she was loved and well cared for during her short stay at the shelter. My family and friends have always adopted their pets from the Animal Humane Society, and I will continue to be a donor and client because the work they do is nothing short of amazing.

It's a shame that there are so many outpoken people who are negative to the AHS.  They do wonderful work for both the community and the animals they serve.  It is a difficult time for everyone with the economy and they are just one of the organizations that are trying to help make a difference to so many lives, both animal and people.    They not only help unwanted/stray animals they help with education in the community and strive to provide enrichment programs to local organizations (schools and therapy).  We can ill afford to put down such a dedicated group of people who work so tirelessly to serve so many. I will ALWAYS continue to help support this organization both financially and through my speech and actions.  I hope others will speak up for themselves and stop letting the minority speak for the majority through default! These people should be ashamed of themselves.  If you cannot help then I challenge you to help find a solution and stop just protesting.  The old addage that if you aren't part of the solution then you are part of the problem definately applies.

Animal Humane Society	59053		/users/profile/63511	Ann Nelson	Donor	5	12/23/2010	I have been both a donor and volunteer of the Animal Humane Society. It is at the top of my list of organizations I consider deserving of my contributions, and I always feel good when I write my check to AHS. Also, being a volunteer gives me a behind-the-scenes look at what the organization does. It continues to amaze me all of the services the shelter provides - way more than the average member of the public could ever know. Two cats my family adopted from AHS had been hit by cars, and in both cases, the AHS invested time and resources to give those animals a second chance. One of the cats required the amputation of a leg, and the other required several weeks of treatment for a head injury. For animals that are surrendered at the shelter but are too fearful or have behavior issues which need addressing before the animal goes up for adoption, AHS offers a socialization program where volunteers work one on one with those animals until they are ready for the adoption floor. Many animals recovering from surgery are placed in volunteer foster homes until they are well enough to go on the adoption floor. All animals who are adopted have already been spayed or neutered to help address the overpopulation issues.  The animals also have a microchip implant so they can be easily tracked should they get lost. Once animals are adopted, AHS offers services to adopters including training classes and a help line. AHS even offers a support group for people who are grieving the loss of a pet. AHS is sometimes critized because it is not a no-kill shelter. Unfortunately, though, there are many more unwanted and stray animals than there are available homes and shelters. No-kill shelters are also doing important work, but there is a limit to how many animals the no-kill shelters can take, meaning they aren't able to take in every animal that someone tries to surrender to them. My sense as both a volunteer and donor is that AHS is very mission focused and is a wise steward of the financial resources it receives. Expenditures are made carefully, and the organization utilizes volunteers wherever it can to help keep expenses as low as possible and focused as much as possible on the care of the animals.
Animal Humane Society	59020		/users/profile/63413	Cat lover	Donor	5	12/21/2010	I started as a volunteer at the Animal Humane Society in the 1980s.  Between 1984 and 1996, we adopted three cats from them.  Each time, we received help in selecting the best cat to fit our particular situation.  We had a chance to visit with several different cats in private rooms and talk to volunteers who knew the cats.  Twice we adopted adult cats, because the Society does not put an age limit on cats accepted for adoption.  Also, animals who are on the adoption floor remain there until they are adopted; there is no "kill by" date.  All adopted animals are now spayed/neutered before leaving the facility, one of the real ways we can attack the problem of stray and unwanted animals.  The Society is currently raising money for a low-cost spay/neuter clinic in their Golden Valley building to serve people who already own pets but cannot afford the surgery.   I have also been a contributor to the Society, and have increased my donations as my circumstances have allowed.  I like that the Society provides services to help adopters with their pets after the adoption: puppy training classes, advice on behavioral issues, and so on.  I also like their program for taking carefully selected animals to assisted living/nursing homes: my elderly mother greatly benefitted from such visits.  And finally, they provide many tours and education on proper care of animals for school groups; summer camps for children interested in animal-related careers, etc.  I am constantly amazed at the range of services and programs that are available.  Even a pet-loss support group when your pet has died.  Are some animals euthanized?  Yes, because some animals come in with overwhelming health issues, or are feral animals, and so on.  But I would rather they be humanely euthanized than roam the streets and die from injury, hunger, or our cold winters. People also need to know that the Animal Humane Society has two humane investigators who work with police around the state of Minnesota to investigate animal abuse, puppy "mills", animal hoarding situations, and so on.  They are the only two full-time human investigators in the state. The Animal Humane Society is my number 1 charity, and I support them completely.

Animal Humane Society	59014		/users/profile/63395	orphie	Donor	5	12/21/2010	I am a volunteer, donor and customer of the AHS.  When I first started volunteering 8 years ago I was amazed by how much AHS does for the animals.  This lead to me wanting to contribute to the organization as it is obvious that the majority of funding goes toward making the animals lives as pleasant as possible.The staff is invested in the lives of the animals.  All you have to do is ask them a questions about the animals and you can tell they love and care about each animal in the shelter.Part of my volunteering involved 'vising' the animals that were sick so they would have socialization.  AHS does everything possible to bring the animals back to health so they can be available for adoption.The reality of euthanasia exists however it is not based on the amount of time an animal has been at the shelter or the age of the animal.  Frankly I believe sometimes euthanasia is the humane answer for some animals.  Because they accept all animals that show up at their door (unlike many shelters that turn animals away) they have animals that have terminal illnesses (leukemia) or behavioral problems (urinating in home, feral cats, etc).  They go through a process with every animal to determine if the animal is appropriate for adoption.  I support this organization 100% and feel confident recommending them to anyone for donations, purchase of animals,or volunteer opportunities.

They provide a great service to the entire state by taking in animals that people can no longer care for, are found wandering the streets - lost, no longer wanted, and a myriad other reasons animals need a home.

You decide for yourself if that's the "bang for your buck" you want.My advice? Find some local rescue groups who do better work, don't kill and never draw a salary.  Your donation would go directly to saving lives, not perpetuating this killing industry.

Pets Loyal 2 Vets	303274	4	/users/profile/267469	Gunny79	Advisor	1	09/12/2016	DONOR ADVISORYIt is illegal for 501(C)(3) charitable organization to engage in political activities. Endorsing one candidate or showing bias against another, is simply illegal and PL2V has been reported to the IRS and Minnesota Secretary of State for blantantly disregarding this strict prohibition. As a veteran myself, I find PL2V's public communications and lobbying of its support about ANY candidate to be playing fast and loose with it's tax exempt status. We reccomend anyone who wants to ensure their donations go to helping vets and NOT for political lobbying purposes, do not support this organization. They are at extreme risk of loosing the tax deductibility of any donations.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	272268	8	/users/profile/267469	Gunny79	Advisor	1	11/17/2015	I urge anyone considering supporting PL2V to DO YOUR RESEARCH on them!  You'll see that they are simply a "paper tiger." In spite of all their claims that they are helping veterans, they've  only succeeded in using your money on a building; it will be years before they actually put a  vet and a dog together. In the mean time, as has been previously noted by others, veterans commit suicide each day. Sad. PL2V needs new direction and new leadership if they are ever to see more than one or two veterans helped in the next few years.

I am one of the vets on the waiting list patiently waiting and have sent back the packet of info. Thank you Jeff for your professionalism and rapid response.  I am so excited to have met you and your facility is awesome.  Several of my veteran friends are also looking to get enrolled in your program so look for their applications.  I am also sending you another donation.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	274373	6	/users/profile/363763	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	12/14/2015	I've been following this back and forth here for some time now, and I have agree with the criteria offered by "DONOR ADVISORY."  Instead of name calling and rationalizing, how hard would it be for an actual, verified representative of this organization to simply answer these questions publicly? It wold only help them in gathering donors and shut down the critics.A) How do they keep donors informed? Have they issued an annual report?B) Mission specific: How have they met their mission? What has been the outcome of the donor dollars? (and how many dogs have they placed)C) Who are their Board of Directors, their affiliation and and their contact information?D) Do their public claims match reality?E) Are their program/overhead costs reasonable?F) Are they properly registered with the State Of Minnesota Secretary of State, Attorney General, and have required business licensing and IRS standing?G) In what ways are they cooperating or coordinating with other non-profits with the same or similar missions to prevent duplication of effort and maximize your donor dollar?
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	274202	3	/users/profile/363570	Writer	Donor	5	12/10/2015	I have visited this great facility several times during its construction in a country setting and I have donated as well and people, consider the source of this misguided woman with an agenda. It's so clear she has no idea what she is talking about. If any of you ever want to know just how well this group is doing, just call them or check with the state. They are in good standing.  As for other groups or individuals trying to help veterans with PTSD. That is just fabulous as there are thousands of veterans in Minnesota who need assistance all over Minnesota and for this person to insinuate otherwise, shows she is neither a veteran nor does she know what she's talking about.  Lets all keep supporting Pets Loyal 2 Vets as they have the best overall program to help veterans in a big way and it's a crying shame this ill-minded individual has so little positive things to say for an organization doing so much to help our veterans. If she has ever made a donation, tell everyone here your name and how much, and when you donated. Don't just wine about it. Peace.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	273670	5	/users/profile/362938	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/03/2015	When I read the claims these numskull people are writing, it is clear they do not know what they are talking about and all they want to do is make false statements. vI crack up when I see a continued effort by one or two conducting a smear campaign on this site against such a credible organization and they are all anonymous....  Go figure. Not one who will mention what they donated, or their names.  Mine is Debra.Those who say they are donors, if you feel your donation was not clearly defined, ask for it back. I'm sure they would not hesitate to accommodate you. Continually trying to smear this great group and the hard working board members they have that I have met at their events is a testament to the hard work they are doing in creating an organization that helps veterans free of charge. I suggest you read their web site for clarification and transparency before you open mouth and insert foot.  It is clear you have a hidden agenda or maybe a boarding kennel that is jealous.....lol  I called the executive director and he has stated not a single person has complained to him or asked for their donation refunded.I have come to know these people for the past 18 months and volunteered to help build the facility and they are 5 star all the way.  I wonder what these jealous commandos will say when pets loyal 2 vets starts training dogs and placing them.  Get a life, as your comments here do nothing to support your intellect or claims and only make you look like an idiot.  I have checked with the AG's office since you mentioned it and they are in good standing with them, the IRS and the state of Minnesota so go jump of a cliff.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	273616	5	/users/profile/362873	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/02/2015	DONOR ADVISORYI advise potential volunteers and donors  to conduct serious due diligence on this nonprofit organization asking questions concerning their transparency and mission.A) How do they keep donors informed? Have they issued an annual report?B) Mission specific: How have they met their mission? What has been the outcome of the donor dollars?C) Who are their Board of Directors, their affiliation and and their contact information?D) Do their public claims match reality?      Example: they claim to be the "only organization in Minnesota placing dogs with veterans with PTSD and TBI free of charge"   Patriot Assistance Dogs in Detroit Lakes, MN has been doing so for years and have placed over 50 dogs with veterans. There are many many other organizations right in Minnesota that place Mobility Assist Dogs  and/or psychiatric service dogs  with vets for free.E) Are their program/overhead costs reasonable?      Example: under GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - the common set of accounting principles, standards and procedures that companies use to compile their financial statements ) the acquisition of physical assets is generally considered overhead when the  acquisition  is not mission essential or directly involved in a program use. In this organizations case, the years long project of building of a "training center" might seem at odds to  accomplishing their mission - placing a dog with a veteran. However, since they do not issue an Annual Report, it is  hard to determine what percentage of your donation actually goes to programs and achieving the mission.F) Are they properly registered with the State Of Minnesota Secretary of State, Attorney General, and have required business licensing and IRS standing?G) In what ways are they cooperating or coordinating with other non-profits with the same or similar missions to prevent duplication of effort and maximize your donor dollar? These are only a few of the questions I would ask of this particular organization.   
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	271903	7	/users/profile/360816	newhorizons	Donor	1	11/12/2015	I am disappointed in this group.  The goal appeared to be dogs for vets but that doesn't seem to be getting done.  Many years have passed with hands out getting donations and no dogs are in the hands of vets.  You don't need a fancy building to train dogs you need to start with dogs.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	271845	8	/users/profile/360746	Writer	Donor	1	11/11/2015	I became a supporter of PL2V in the Spring 2015, and have lost confidence that they can complete their mission quickly or successfully as currently structured under current leadership. It seems that they meet or exceed many of their fundraising goals yet progress on placing a dog with veteran only inches forward in comparison. I truly hope that will be able to start helping veterans, but I will not continue to donate money or time without noticeable results (even that that is just communication about progress of current goals or accountability for not reaching them).  If you choose to support this non-profit,  I urge you to start off minimally to prevent greater disappointment if your expectations are not met.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	307586	1	/users/profile/398928	Reeper1,	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2016	To Gunny79It's obvious you are fictitiously portraying yourself as an adviser for the org when you are simply masquerading as a clown in disguise.  I for one have read through their web site and on-line presence and do not see where they endorse any political candidate but only speak of those candidates and non candidates alike that support American veterans. I stand behind this great org all the way no matter how many times you falsely portray their work.

Pets Loyal 2 Vets	268567	8	/users/profile/357299	Writer	Donor	5	10/28/2015	Pets Loyal 2 Vets has been nothing but an outstanding organization.  Their ED is an honorably discharged US Navy veteran who served during the Vietnam Era, not in Vietnam or a battle zone like this crazy person keeps claiming.  I read up on the ship he was on and it served off the coast of Vietnam many times, also in the South China Sea, the Sea of Japan and the Tonkin Gulf and it was not just sitting in the harbor on the west coast doing nothing like this person claims. It was a fighting ship.  I have met Jeff and he is a dam hard worker, putting the organization first above everything.  This maniac is just that. A person with low self esteem  trying to tarnish the reputation of such an honorable organization and leader. It appears this numbskull is bored with their life and childish beyond words.  After I read the crap this person keeps posting, I couldn't help but feel he/she has stepped over the line and is now harassing the Executive Director via the Internet and posting false and milicious information to harass this non-profit 501c3 company.  This slacker also admitted publically their intent is to harm the organization financially by discouraging donors from making a donation.  Now the organization can show a cause for losses on top of harassment and intimidation (multiple civil crimes).  If I knew of an attorney who handles crimes against people via the Internet, I'd turn them on to go after this person and to do it probono or a bunch of us veterans will do a fundraising and raise the money to get this person behind bars.  With the FederaL and state laws that protect people from being harassed, and laws that protect against Libel and Slander, "defafamtion" I'd think PL2V would have a very good case against this person and they should sue the pants off them. I talked with an IT friend of mine and he said IP addresses can be gotten through a court order and then the IP number can be tracked to the internet service provider and then, to the actual address of that person.  A reasonable hacker can get that also i'd think but that would be illegal... And, in case they try to use a library or coffee house, he said they also have service providers and security cameras that can pin point the person.....to the spot......   I have met the hard working folks who do their fundraising events and do a great job building a training center that will serve hundrdes of veterans with an opportunity to have a new dog help them through the day.  It was long over due.  Get a job bozo. Anyone who beleives your line is just as nieve and gullable. I am a proud Army member of the VFW and American Legion and when I see someone like this who claims to be a veteran attacking a fellow veteran who is trying his darndest to help fellow veterans suffering from PTSD and head injuries by building a traning center that has never been in Minnesota till now, and he doesn't get paid for it!!  Get real..  This person just needs to take a long walk off a short pier into a garbage can cause that's all they are, garbage.  Me and my Army friends are going to do even more now to show our support and we encourage those who read this persons reviews to consider how lonely and ignorant they are as they are in need of some serious mental health counciling. Freedom of speech is one thing, and one that we fought for.  Stepping on another veteran with milicious intent to cause them harm, should be dealt with by prison time.  If you don't cherish your freedoms now, how are you going to enjoy them when you are behind bars. If anyone here knows of an attorney that can help this organization bring charges against this person, please have them contact the organization.  Please have everyone you know who beleives in this organizations work, post a positive review here and lets show everyone how well we support fellow veterans.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	268208	18	/users/profile/356943	Writer	Donor	1	10/28/2015	"Top Rated Non-Profit?" Quite an accomplishment for a business that has not rescued one dog, and not given a single dog to a veteran since they've been around, supposedly to do just that!  22 veteran s commit suicide every day and these people are busy building a shiny new building for the last few years. Quite an accomplishment for a guy who was fired from a job at a GAS STATION for mismanagement! Quite an accomplishment for a company whose leader claims to be a Vietnam veteran  suffering PTSD from his wartime experiences...when the Navy ship he claims he was on never left the west coast of the USA when he claims he was in the Navy - AFTER HOSTILITIES WERE COMPLETELY OVER  IN VIETNAM. Quite an accomplishment for a company whose biggest claim is that they rescue dogs from shelters for vets and the only dogs they've ever had came from a breeder and they don't even have a trainer! I've been to their place at their first "corn roast" and have simply grown tired of their "gonna do"  and "some day" and self back patting. I've stopped donating to them and have got my DAV and VFW to NOT support them. Read their recent reviews and you'll see most of them are written by the same person.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	264987	3	/users/profile/353721	Debra83	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	This is an excellent organization.  There is absolutely nothing that can take away the feelings of  loneliness and  helplessness like a best friend.  And there is no better best friend in the whole world than your pet.  They love you no matter how you look or feel.  They are always eager to see you and spend time with you.  Having a full time companion like that is great for a veterans moral and attitude.  I love the philosophy behind this organization.  The benefits are great!       D Dinius, Columbus, MN
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	264917	5	/users/profile/353645	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	Pairing a pet with a vet in need is such a great idea. It offers vets independence, confidence and a support system that might not otherwise be available.

Being a volunteer and a veteran, seeing how hard this organization has worked to build its dog training facility inspires me.  I know the future is bright for this great organization.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	264756	4	/users/profile/353479	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2015	The vision and goals are great but they need more support to get it off the ground. As a currently serving service member I can tell you how vital these services are needed in the veteran communities. If you have the ability donate your time or money to save the life of a veteran who is still suffering from their scars. Both visible and invisible. 
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	264390	6	/users/profile/353113	Writer	Board Member	5	10/15/2015	I have been very impressed with the people and the passion associated with Pets Loyal 2 Vets.  This is a group of people who have worked very hard to build a non-profit organization from the ground up, and they are very focused on making sure it will be successful and effective.  Our veterans deserve nothing less, and that is their primary motivation.  The organization is laser-focused on developing a program, facility and process that doesn't simply provide a dog to a veteran, but the right dog, highly trained and specifically matched, to the right veteran, based on specific needs and criteria.  I am confident the result will be a significant, positive and long-term impact in the lives of many veterans suffering from PTSD, TBI or physical assault traumas.Thanks to the donors and volunteers who have helped so far!  Your contributions of time, treasure and talent have made a real difference in getting Pets Loyal 2 Vets started, and very soon you will see the direct result of your efforts.
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	264303	6	/users/profile/353017	KingCole	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2015	It has been some time coming (mostly because they are not only doing the prep work and building the facility in a large part by themselves, in great detail and in the right way but they also just want it done right so its the best it can be to help our Vets ). It looks like they are getting ready to start operation and I am thrilled. I have been following them since the beginning and know how hard they have worked and their passion to help Vets. Jeff and Mary and their staff are all simply first class and when the doors open soon it will be something to see. I am proud my Marine Corps League and VFW have supported them and will in the future. It really does upset me when other Vets play the arm chair quarterbacks and think they know what is going on instead of trying to see if they can help too. We should all be pulling together. If they need help I'll be there. King

By pairing our brave vets with challenges such as PTSD with top trained companion dogs is a win-win situation that should be applauded. I have been part of many PL2V fund raising events, and each  is as comfortable and easy going as a backyard party which shows that not only are they fundraising, but they are reaching out as a friend. I rate PL2V as one of my favorite non-profit organizations for many reasons. Great Organization. Great People. Great Cause!!

Pets Loyal 2 Vets	261055	6	/users/profile/349647	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	I have volunteered to help build the new Pets Loyal 2 Vets training facility for veterans and have to say, they have busted their behinds to get this place up and running as soon as they possibly can.  When I read the reviews from IAK9 and Med1  this poser was posting and their  rediculous claims, I couldn't help but feel they have never been to this facility or met the people behind Project Companion.  Pets Loyal 2 Vets is an incredible organization and any veteran waiting for a dog knows this and would never post crap like that. I have donated and bid on items at their silent auctions and can attest, these people are the real deal and creating something that Minnesota veterans need.  They have my support 100%.  I will continue to offer my help and to help raise funds for them even after they open.  
Pets Loyal 2 Vets	259106	4	/users/profile/347624	NASHC1	Board Member	5	09/23/2015	Unfortunately, posers can post messages on the Internet leading well intentioned donors astray.  There is one individual that has been going around the Internet posing as a long time donor and a Military Veteran who has been waiting for a dog for 4 years making false claims against this organization.   One review of our web site and Facebook pages will show what we are doing and the time frames for doing it. This person has NEVER contacted Pets Loyal 2 Vets, is neither a donor nor a Veteran in any way and instead in fixated on discrediting our fine name and reputation.  As you can see, both postings from IAK9 and Med1 are the same person posting on other Internet sites with the same text so please consider this person's posts as a crank.  Our doors have always been open to anyone wanting to stop by or contact us and we encourage our donors and veterans to continue to support Pets Loyal 2 Vets.

I am directing the program "My Brothers Keeper" a homeless college student resource center scheduled to open in January 2012.  I'm an Army Veteran that needed assistance while I was in college.  I'm currently completing the PhD in psychology and noticed as a professor many college students arriving at the campus early to shower in the campus gym and sleeping on benches after I have taught my last course in the evenings.  The college has offered funding and a building to house our program!  We are currently raising funding to sustain the program while going through the college foundation.  What I actually need is current statistical data regarding the amount of homeless college students in the United States and if there is a US initiative in place to address the issue.

National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	24724	4	/users/profile/25739	Lydia	Volunteer	5	12/21/2009	NAEHCY is an organization that supports those in the education arena working with homeless children & youth.  It is well organized, has access to dozens of very helpful resources, and offers excellent annual conferences.
National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	24713	4	/users/profile/25731	Christina	Volunteer	5	12/21/2009	The National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth is an outstanding nonprofit agency that conducts important work.  The agency's ongoing work includes ensuring that the educational rights of homeless children and youth are known and protected. They also administer the LeTendre Education Fund, which provides scholarships for higher education for homeless or formerly homeless youth. I have no doubt that, were it not for NAEHCY's important work in shaping and supporting the national dialogue in this area, the field of homeless education would not have progressed to its current position, providing vital support to vulnerable students.
National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	24709	4	/users/profile/25727	minneapolis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/21/2009	NAEHCY serves an invaluable purpose by providing the most up to date information about educational rights and programs for children and youth who are homeless.  My most recent experience with this organization was getting clarification of students' rights based upon the McKinney Vento Education law when a school district is "redistricting," and many of the schools of origin will no longer exist with the same students and staff or with the same program focus.  School community stability is critical to the well being of students who are homeless.
National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	23828	4	/users/profile/24967	Mattie Lord	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/11/2009	The National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth(NAEHCY) is the voice and social conscience for the education of children and youth experiencing homelessness.  It has been an absolute honor to work within such an amazing group of diverse, passionate, dedicated people, all determined to positively influence the lives of our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  NAEHCY harnesses the expertise, energy, and good will of its vast membership and uses it to shape federal, state and local policy, practice, and law; therefore impacting children and youth and their families across the nation.  NAEHCY identifies and promotes best practices through media channels, publications, and the annual conference.  It helps educate jursidictional leaders, legislators, advocates, school administrators, teachers, social workers, shelter staff, and other direct service providers so that collectively, we are able to meet the needs of our children and youth experiencing homelessness.  Without NAEHCY, we would not have nearly the level of interconnectedness and coordination needed to achieve results.
National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	23571	7	/users/profile/24679	Jodi	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/08/2009	NAEHCY is an amazing organization run by passionate advocates, many of whom work as volunteers. NAEHCY organizes a conference every year for professionals in the field of homeless education and homeless services. They provide technical expertise and advocacy for people working with homeless children and youth at all levels of service provision  local, community, school district, regional, state, and among peers at the national level. Just one example of their great work: A student in a western state had been homeless for 6 years and had not had a stable home during that time where he could complete school. Given all those challenges, he was about 2 years behind schedule in completing high school. He turned 19 but was completing 10th grade. This student had talent as a singer and had won many school and regional competitions, but he was denied the ability to compete at the state level. The state office on extracurricular sports and activities said that he was too old to compete in singing with other high school students. Their reasoning was that his advanced age created an unfair advantage for him over other children and youth. NAEHCY advocates assisted the state education office in understanding the students rights under the law and also in recognizing how critical extracurricular sports and activities are to all students, since those competitions might create scholarship and job opportunities. This particular student was not at any advantage over other students, since he had not had a consistent school experience and had an unstable home life that disrupted his education. By competing, this student had the opportunity to earn recognition that could help him in supporting his future educational needs. Extracurricular activities help kids in many other ways as well, from building leadership skills to networking; this kind of involvement helps to develop the whole person and offers a complete education.These battles are fought every day in communities all over the country. I, for one, am so thankful that NAEHCY is there to provide expertise and support to professionals in the field of homeless education.
National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children And Youth	23399	7	/users/profile/24493	Jared	Board Member	5	12/04/2009	NAEHCY is a wonderful organization with which I'm proudly affiliated.  NAEHCY's good work is most easily observable though its LeTendre Scholarships - a select group of youth, whose lives have been disrupted by homelessness but who nonetheless pursued an education for themselves, are awarded college scholarship funding.  It's a remarkable experience for the students, the organization and the hundreds of association members who attend the annual LeTendre Scholarship Awards Ceremony.  Just as significant but far less visible, NAEHCY's small, dedicated staff and team of volunteers work tirelessly to ensure federal, state and local policies best support the educational needs of temporarily housed students and families as well as the school district homeless liaisons upon whom the students so often depend.  As the economic downturn has put pressure on families, children have become hidden casualties of Wall Street's collapse; they inherit parental stress and endure their families' losses.  The impact of this housing instability too often manifests in the classroom, thereby extending the effects of today's downturn well into tomorrow.  Please join me in recognizing NAEHCY's efforts to combat these risks.
Misfit Acres	108899		/users/profile/36289	forthehorses	Volunteer	4	04/03/2012	Misfit Acres lives by their wish list.....                                                       That no horse would ever be slaughtered again                                        People would treat all animals with kindness                                           People would understand about the dangers horses and all animals face as we integrate them into our lives.                                                   I found Misfit Acres when I was working with a group of 5th, 6th, and 7th graders and we were looking into ways we could help out in the community. Misfit Acres welcomed the help with open arms. We have raised money for them, collected recycleables, cleaned barns, painted fences, and visited the horses. Jody and Bruce have dedicated all they have and spent more time and money than they have to give these horses the best lives possible. Even though they do ongoing fund raising they cater to the special needs of each horse which may require a special diet or special vet visits. I will continue to help out Jody and Bruce as best as I can for as long as they need it and you can help them by supporting them.                   Thank you !!!  
Misfit Acres	35460	10	/users/profile/36289	forthehorses	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2010	I work for the local school district and on several occasions have taken a group of children out to see the horses. It is a valuable experience since many of these kids never get to see a horse that close and are in awe of them when they do. They have always been very welcoming to the children and explain why each horse is there. The children have fed the horses through the fence and loved the experience. I hope to keep returning to Misfit for many years.

Misfit Acres	108823	1	/users/profile/148108	Just Ducks	General Member of the Public	5	04/03/2012	A place where otherwise unwanted/neglected horses go to find the love and care that they so deserve. I have know Jody and Bruce for years and have followed their growth over the years. They have put their blood, sweat and tears into the rescue of horses. They have given themselves to the horses at Misfit Acres. Horses and ponies that have had their share of terrible circumstances in life. Some have required more care than others and have been gently, lovingly, cared for by Jody and Bruce. Each one lives out it's final years at the farm. A hole is left in your heart, and many tears shed when one goes over the "Rainbow Bridge." Knowing that they have been cared for so wonderfully before that time is a true tribute to the wonderful people that Jody and Bruce are. 
Misfit Acres	36413	4	/users/profile/37203	dede	Client Served	5	04/21/2010	Misfit acres was there when two aging, starved arabian mares needed them immediately. There wasn't any time to find other options, they needed to be removed the day I found out about it. Misfit acres was there. Even though at the time they weren't set up for two more hungry horses they knew the timing of the rescue was top priority for these two horses. The body score on the one mare was maybe 1.5 and the other 2.5 and I might be generous here. Jodi made room for the two mares and took great care of them. She found a great home for the younger of the two and kept the oldest one to live out her days there. Without Misfit acres these horses would not have lasted another week without suffering permenant damage. Their horses always look good and happy. These are great people who put forth more than they will ever get in return. Honest, Humble and Hardworking is how I would describe them. Value of their service cannot be measured for the lives of the horses they have helped.

She was severely foundered and had other health issues. On January 30, 2006, my sister was murdered by her soon to be x-boyfriend. We brought Cookie home with us but had absolutely no means to care for her. Bruce and Jody at Misfit Acres heard our story and immediately stepped in and took Cookie into their loving care. They did everything humanly possible to help that little girl. The love, patience and compassion they unselfishly give to these 'misfits' is remarkable and unending. I know we will never be able to repay them for what they did for our precious Cookie... and for us...

Books For Africa, Inc.	142307	2	/users/profile/188763	Agnes Igoye	Client Served	5	11/24/2012	I was introduced to Books For Africa by Anne Hussian who was working with Books For Africa on a project. She had listened to my speech about my work rehabilitating victims of human trafficking at the University of Minnesota during my Hubert Humphrey Fellowship. She generously reached out to support my cause and introduced me to the amazingly friendly staff of Books for Africa. What struck me most was the Passion and dedicated efforts of the staff and Board members towards their work-Ending the Book Famine in Africa! There is no bureaucracy in making requests for books  and when I expressed the need for books for the education/rehabilitation of victims of human trafficking in Uganda, they supported my cause including helping me with organizing a fundraiser for their shipment. For instance, Carole Patrikakos the manager of corporate relations and grants provided a lot of support in coordination and preparation of the fundraiser and Board member Henry Bromelkamp generously offered and matched any donations of $100 and over towards the shipment of a container of 22,000 books until it is fully fundraised! Am equally appreciative that Books For Africa gives me the freedom to choose the books relevant to the needs and educational environment of the recipients. They also facilitate/ help with networking the people they serve to collaborate in various ways towards common goals. Books For Africa is a true friend of Africa!

Books For Africa, Inc.	140046		/users/profile/186202	Jill35	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Books For Africa is a brilliantly run organization.  They have a clear mission: build literacy in Africa by shipping books to them.  A solvable problem, a simple solution, and they do it well.  Because they have been perfecting their practice, they now ship huge numbers of books amid the corruption and other obstacles similar organizations face.  They are experts in their field, and because of that they are constantly increasing the number of books they are shipping while also expanding into new areas such as sending computers, working here within the local community, or gaining important feedback about how the books are being used.  All of this growth while maintaining a miniscule staff of passionate, dedicated humans.  My personal opinion is that this is just the start for BFA, and that they will continue to grow and expand their benefits for many years to come.  The staff is incredibly uplifting and passionate, I absolutely adore being a part of the work they are doing.

General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2012	Books for Africa is an attempt to provide access to tools necessary to spread and achieve literacy. This organization takes books in full crates across seas to create a full, complete library available to the community. Its efforts are widespread and non-discriminatory. Not only are Books for Africa's efforts noteworthy, but the means of achieving them are distinctive; groups nation-wide-- from private individuals to college campuses-- donate books which are then used to create the library. This approach allows a wide variety of people to be involved.  Books for Africa create a sense of community, a positive green effect (Less books in landfills--what a waste that would be!) and a positive effect on the world as a whole. 
Books For Africa, Inc.	139770		/users/profile/185901	Paula Zenker	Donor	5	11/15/2012	Hello!   Books for Africa is an incredibly impressive organization!  The concept is simple--send books to poeple who do not have any.    My background is in teaching and this thrills my heart.  The low-overhead, small no. of paid employees, and wise use of resources all allow the hard work put forth by BFA to achieve its goals.  This speaks to ethics in my view.  BFA is organized and genuine in its values of serving the underserved.  Education is the base for moving forward in life, and this begins with literacy.  The faces of children receiving their BFA books, in photographs, says it all.  I have begun giving donation-gifts to BFA to friends and families;  this has become a favorite gift form.   KUDOS and GRATITUDE to BFA!-----Sincerely, Paula Zenker  (St. Paul, MN)

Books For Africa, Inc.	138186		/users/profile/184231	FCYF	Client Served	5	11/13/2012	I am Director of Development and International Partnerships for Fair Children Youth Foundation in Rwanda. We now have three schools and more than 1,000 pupils in FCYF: Wisdom Nursery and Primary Schools and a Deaf Children's School serve our beloved children in Musanze District. Our region was devastated for over a decade by civil war and genocide, and one of our early tasks when peace was restored was to build and open schools for some of the thousands of children who had been unable to receive ta basic education. We were so excited when a former international volunteer at our foundation who now works for Books for Africa asked if we would be interested to receive books and create a library for our schools. BFA allowed us to select what type and level of books our children needed. They kept us informed at every step of the delivery process, and even arranged for us to welcome in Musanze the wonderful person who sponsored the shipment to us. The books have now arrived and are all in very good condition. We will take care to ensure that they are kept carefully and will serve our children for many years to come. Our pupils are so eager to learn and this wonderful donation is surely a life changer for the children of Musanze. We now hear that more books will be coming our way next year. BFA is an amazing organization and we are grateful to them and all who come together through their excellent coordination and make it possible for our children to receive the learning they need and deserve.  We hope in time to come to set up reading classes and make our library more widely available to the many youth and young adults who have missed out on primary education and yet are eager to become literate. Thank you BFA!

Working with Books for Africa to distribute a shipment of 22,000 books to rural communities has been wonderful. I have been impressed by their professionalism and helpfulness throughout the process. They make the often-complex process of receiving books very clear for communities and folks in the field. The books donated to BFA are stocking libraries in impoverished areas where kids are really thirsty for reading materials - they're making an incredible difference.

Books For Africa, Inc.	137454		/users/profile/183437	kimh04302	Donor	5	11/12/2012	After my son died, I never thought that I would experience joy again.  A former board member of Books for Africa, my friend Pam, told me stories of the amazing resilience and joy of the Rwandan people.  I started reading books written by Rwandan genocide survivors and through their written stories, began to understand in a deeper way the human ability to survive, thrive and find joy again.  I decided to work with Pam to send books to Rwanda. The country had  just changed its official language from French to English, so the timing was perfect.  I visited the library sites and fell in love with the people and the country, so we are using my son's college fund to send more books!  I was particularly impressed with the way Books for Africa works with other groups to make a difference.  Two of the libraries we sent were Law libraries.  Only 49 lawyers were left alive in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide and there were few books.  The Law and Democracy Initiative through BFA and Thompson Reuters provided complete, new, specifically designed law libraries to Rwanda Law Schools.
Books For Africa, Inc.	136166		/users/profile/182075	Jane Ferguson	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I was introduced to Books For Africa through my daughter and a friend who also mentioned her volunteer experience. When I arrived, the staff members gave a thorough orientation to us volunteers, and proceeded to be most helpful and engaging throughout my time there. Since all the materials are donated, they explained, there are certain types of books that need to be recycled into boxes. Not everything will be appropriate or relevant to send to Africa. Imagine rural African schoolchildren reading about The Civil War or The South Beach Diet; not helpful at all in their quest for education! It is the volunteers' and staff members' job to process through an enormous amount of books and recycle materials that don't translate well to African culture. Then the books are meticulously sorted into subjects so that they can be efficiently packed when an order comes on. As an educator, I found working at this charity to be enormously satisfying, spreading literacy as a bridge out of poverty. Most people in America have access to books, either through free public libraries, or through public schools. In Africa, as BFA's website demonstrates, these privileges are basically nonexistent. Spreading literacy is Books For Africa's mission and they perform their tasks with efficiency, cheerfulness, and optimism. I'm definitely going back to help out!

What the organization does is so straightforward--gather up gently used books, sort them by subject and grade level and ship them by container load to waiting hands in African countries.  As a donor, I'm pleased that BFA has consistently high ratings for using funds very efficiently and keeps staff and overhead minimal.  I've been to Tanzania with Books for Africa and seen the village schools with no electricity, no running water and one book shared by ten students.  The children have so much less than even our poorest schools here, yet they seem hungry to learn.  It's not so difficult to get books into their hands.  Since the books are donated and volunteers sort and pack them, the main cost is shipping the container to an African port.  It costs about $10,000 to send a container holding about 30,000.  I like knowing that my monthly donations help make that possible.  Imagine the impact of just one container on the life of a community and the future of those children!  
Books For Africa, Inc.	134882		/users/profile/180747	Asratie T.	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	I am writing this letter in support of Books for Africa, a MN Based Charitable Educationorganization, that I have come to know and support since 1999.I have been and still is a strong supporter of Books for Africa because I relate to the circumstancesof the millions of children that Books for Africa is reaching out in Africa.The day I discovered the existence of Books for Africa was one of my dreams come true. It isnot an exaggeration and here is why?I was born in a rural village in a one room grass covered hut that we shared with the farm anddomestic animals at one corner, and an open fire place at the center of the room. A raised bunkerbed made of local materials is hanging little over the shoulders of the farm animals, and aflickering lamp fueled by of animal fat or wax at one corner. That was the setting of the ruralhouse hold in Ethiopia in the village I was born. That setting is still true to over 50% Sub-Saharan Africa and the continent in general in those countries lacking economic development.I will be turning 50 years next week, and to date there is no electricity and running waterin the village I was born. It is very remote that modern amenities are years away. So how didI get here from that environment against all odds?The story is long but brieflyWhen I was two years old my maternal grandmother decided itwas time for her daughter to be in the city and without much publicity she scooped me and mymom, and I ended up leaving in a larger town where schooling was available, and I went to aCatholic pre-school followed by elementary and secondary public school education. From thereI maximized the opportunity to further my education and have had a successful career in Ethiopia.I have a successful career here in the US as well, and currently I am pursuing a PhD onLeadership and Organizational Change. All this has become possible because I was given anopportunity to read and write. That is what Books for Africa is doing for millions of AfricanChildren.Over the years, I was part of Books for Africa witnessing its growth. For instance Ethiopia hadreceived only 12 containers of books in 1999. As of budget year 2011, Ethiopia received 175sea containers of books and a total of 3.85 million books to date. Can you imagine how manyAsratie are born out of the opportunity to read and write that these books provided?I am convinced that no international organization has done to educate the African children thatcan compete with Books for Africa, and that is why I remain its permanent volunteer and supporter,and gives it the highest praise and recognition. I hope you do too.Sincerely,Asratie TeferraChair, Ethiopian African 2000 Millennium Group3924 Oliver St, Hyattsville, MD 20782P.301-277-3950 C.630-802-5901Www.ethiopiannewyear.com

How about gay and lesbian exploration is OK but anything American related is sent to the recycle bin as Americans volunteer that time to support this non profit.  Never again.
Books For Africa, Inc.	88443	1	/users/profile/99550	chrikelic	Volunteer	5	05/06/2011	My name is Kekeli Christianson and I have been interning with Books For Africa. I love working with the staff members and being a part of this organization that provides books for children in Africa, is really inspiring and I am very grateful to have participated in such endeavor. Coming from Togo(West Africa) Myself I understand how hard it is for students to aquire texbooks. I remember I used to get copies of entire books from previous students and many times books are passed down from siblings. Having such an organization like Books For Africa providing the essential tools for education to african children is surely extraordinary. There are many ways to help Books For Africa in their endeavors. I myself have conducted a book drive and collected texbooks from college students and also volunteered at the Books For Africa warehouse sorting and packaging books for the next shipping.  So ask yourself what can I do to help? 
Books For Africa, Inc.	88438	1	/users/profile/99538	HenryBMN	Board Member	5	05/06/2011	In 2003 a Books for Africa staff person heard I was going to Africa to visit friends and asked me to look in on a few recipients to see how they were doing with their books. Perhaps it was a thinly-disguised attempt to get me hooked, but it captured my heart and mind. I met so many wonderful hardworking people and kids, from a refugee camp in Botswana, to the Rotary Club in Mzuzu Malawi, to a school building project in Eshowe, South Africa, all of them confident and passionate that education was the way to develop every person's complete potential. We're not giving people a handout, we're giving them tools to be better family members and community and world leaders. Books for Africa is a simple idea, efficient and effective, that changes the future for millions, yes millions, of people.

After going to Minnesota and meeting the fine people that run BFA, my wife and I have been som impressed that we've become members of BFA's "Summit Society" and make substantial donations yearly.  I have personally placed BFA's books and computers in schools in Zambia, and have taken brand new law books donated by BFA to the Zambia Law Association.  Great organization and the people can't be beat.

Having 'Project Healthy Smile' as our partner is indeed an honor. Through PHSs generous dental supply donations, we are able to cater to a much larger number of children in the rural communities in the province. Having been personally visited by PHS, conducting dental education and rendering dental services themselves to the children in the mountain areas of Cebu is indeed a great thing to do.  We are grateful that they have reached the Philippines. With Hollie Mae's and Michelle's dedicated efforts, surely many children around the globe will be able to smile with much confidence.

I and my wife are running the children home in Thu Duc District, Saigon Vietnam. We have now 17 kids that are living with us in our home. One of the things that we really care is their teeth. And thank you so much that you guys came and help us in training our kids how to protect their teeth. Our two kids named Ho and Dao. They got very bad teeth and suffered  the paints and we once took them to the local dentist but it cost us a fortune to get their teeth fixed. Michelle and Hollie came not only help the kids to clean their teeth but to support them to get their teeth fixed. Now you can see a real big  smiles on their faces. We just pray and ask God to continue using you guys to help kids with their real big smile. Love to see you guys again. Sang and Jen from Eden Family of Vietnam.

Michelle and Hollie came  here in May this year to help these children with dental supplies, treated the children and also donated dental supplies to over 500 children at the Centre.  Now the children have learnt to keep their teeth clean and Michelle is also preparing to send more supplies before the end of  of this year.  these two ladies are wonderful, despite the fact that Africa is very far away from Washington, they were concerned about the poor African Children. and what surprised me is that Michelle left her young baby at home and decided to come to Africa to do an unpaid  work this is really wonderful. All of us here in Meeting Point are proud and praise the work done by Project  Health  Smile because all our poor children are now smiling.

Project Healthy Smile	140303		/users/profile/186475	cohiep	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I met Michelle and Hollie when they were in Nha Trang, Vietnam to do their project.  I recognized that  Project Health Smile is a valuable organization .  Michelle and Hollie worked tirelessly to help poor children at Loc Tho Charity School learn how to take good care of their teeth.  I'm very aapreciative to all of their efforts I'm very proud of them - the young women - who devote their time and efforts to help children.  I'm very happy if I can do something for their project.  Hope to see Michell and Hollie again soon. 
Project Healthy Smile	139207		/users/profile/185315	jspaulding	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	As a provider in the field of dentistry, I am approached by a number of for-profit and non-profit organizations to donate time or monetary funds. Since I have limitations with both, I prefer to restrict my energy and resources toward a few organizations whose providers are passionate and driven, and whose establishment has a strategy design with proven results. Project Healthy Smiles succeeds in this. I've had the pleasure to meet Michelle Patterson prior to her conception of Project Healthy Smiles. I found her as a compassionate individual who, after a journey to Vietnam and meeting orphaned children, truly wanted to make their lives better. In the field of dentistry, we are aware of how important prevention is. Unfortunately, this accepted belief is not emphasized in all cultures. I am proud of Michelle for unselfishly  spending her own personal resources and time to educate children who are oftentimes overlooked and forgotten. Project Healthy Smiles enables them with knowledge and tools that will help alter their dental habits and therefore improve their long-term health. I do believe in the structure of Project Healthy Smiles but, most importantly, I believe in Michelle's heartfelt benevolence and goodwill towards these young children.
Project Healthy Smile	137208		/users/profile/183166	qcwdcops	Donor	5	11/12/2012	I've seen the women behind this organization work tirelessly throughout the year with a level of passion that I've never seen before.  I've given and will continue to give to PHS because it seems like every dollar you give they turn it into miracles.  I wouldn't hesitate to promote PHS to anyone looking to direct their hard-earned money to a great cause.
Project Healthy Smile	137189		/users/profile/183146	Kath Huynh	Volunteer	2	11/11/2012	I have joined Michelle to an Orphanage in Thu Duc Dist., HCMC (Vietnam). So memorable. Project Healthy Smile is a valuable organization I found and I hope they can support more and more children with misfortunes over the world as they have done so far. Hope to have chance to join with PHM soon!
Project Healthy Smile	137145		/users/profile/183104	the grandpa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/11/2012	I have done volunteer work with Michelle in Vietnam, and seen the know-how and passion she has for working with orphans and vulnerable children.  She is incredibly passionate about her work with PHS and it shows itself in the results on the ground.  
Project Healthy Smile	137050		/users/profile/183007	Thserbus	Board Member	5	11/11/2012	Project Healthy Smile was created to provide oral health education & supplies to underprivileged children around the world. The organization has stood by its mission and made great strides over the past 3 years. The founders are 100% devoted to the cause and their passion shows in every mission  completed. I have had the great honor of working with the organization from the ground level and watching the growth both globally and locally has been extremely moving. It's organizations like this that prove you can make a difference in a person's life, even if that person stands thousands of miles away and their need may seem so overwhelming, positive impact can be made. Each dental supply PHS donates helps preserve another smile. I like to believe these smiles help make this earth shine alittle brighter each day. Thank you PHS for the wonderful journey thus far, I look forward to what the future holds. 
Project Healthy Smile	136961		/users/profile/182913	KCS86	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	As a volunteer with PHS I've witnessed first hand how (in the words of Margarets Mead) a small group of concerned citizens can change the world! The personal dedication of everyone involved is inspiring to be a part of. It has been extremely rewarding to watch how the well run fundraising and awareness activities I have participated in domestically have translated to real and impactful dental programs abroad. Having spent time in some of the countries where PHS has programs, I have seen the desperate need for dental hygiene education among these vulnerable children first hand. With a little equipment and some basic information I know that PHS and their partners are helping prevent real, and painful, health problems. 
Project Healthy Smile	136677		/users/profile/182615	Pamela27	Donor	5	11/10/2012	Michelle is our daughter in law and Hollie is a friend.  These 2 giving, generous, and loving women have done so much in helping children learn about dental care since the beginning.  They have left their families and traveled thousands of miles to give of their hearts.  We are very proud and and hope that the generosity of the public will help them continue their education and love to many children.
Project Healthy Smile	136311		/users/profile/182224	Lolaten	Donor	5	11/09/2012	Project Healthy Smile is such a wonderful non-profit organization.  The two young women who started it are so dedicated and hard working.  The love and compassion they have for others is amazing!  They are determined to help as many children globally as they can to have better health.  We here in Minnesota are very proud of them and totally back their foundation's hard work.
Project Healthy Smile	136148		/users/profile/182058	wjhschultz	Donor	5	11/09/2012	Project Healthy Smile is an organization run by genuinely concerned people who clearly intend to do something for the world's indigent. The intense work, time, expense and dedication to such a worthy cause is extremely admirable.  We need more people like this!
Project Healthy Smile	136060		/users/profile/181964	ftru	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Project Healthy Smile is an incredibly worthwhile non profit.  This organization is focused on helping children worldwide with their oral health.  Not only does PHS go to underdeveloped countries and provide dental cleaning services for youth who do not have substantial resources, they are also committed to education and maintenance. This gives these young generations of depressed populations a new life skill that can ultimately have a large impact on their overall health. I truly believe this is a necessary gift that the children receive due to the efforts of Project Healthy Smile, and a skill that is simple, yet crucial at the same time. Please do what you can to support them.
Project Healthy Smile	91672		/users/profile/104956	jmkartak	Board Member	5	06/22/2011	Project Healthy Smile is a nonprofit organization that brings light to a major problem in other parts of the world where impoverished children lack sufficient dental supplies and knowledge of proper dental care techniques. I started working with Project Healthy Smile as an intern at the beginning of my Senior year of college. I have served a number of roles within the organization and performed many duties since I joined, including tracking and organizing donations, sending thank you kits to donors, and acting as the event coordinator.  As the event coordinator on the board for PHS, I am responsible for coordinating and executing our largest fundraising event of the year, Styles for Smiles. Styles for Smiles is a fundraising event that consists of a fashion show, a portion of the proceeds from clothing and jewelry sales going to PHS, a silent auction, and a raffle. This involves planning the event space, finding and coordinating vendors, soliciting donations for the silent auction and raffle and organizing these items/services. Another role that I have as the event coordinator is to venture into other fundraising events and start to plan those as well.  If this is a review of the organization, then here is what I have to say about the strengths and weaknesses of PHS. There are three major strengths of PHS. The first is that the organization has a strong mission and is a great cause that it is easy for people to come behind. The second major strength that PHS has is the loyalty, hard work, and dedication of its board members and those who support PHS. The third strength is the integrated marketing communications. The branding for PHS is very clear and uniform. This is shown through the website, the business cards, the event communications and marketing, and more. The reason for this clear and consistent branding largely rests with Hollie Mae, and I think it is a tremendous strength for the organization.  The only weakness that the organization has is that as it is growing, PHS is having trouble keeping up with the increasing number of contacts, amount of donor data, and other information that is incoming. However, even this weakness is one that the organization is working on even now. PHS is now collaborating with a group to now track all donor and contact information.  So, even the weakness that PHS has is going to be turning into a strength. Project Healthy Smile is an organization that has the highest integrity and a strong and wonderful mission. The founders, Michelle and Hollie Mae, are two women who had a great vision. It has been a pleasure to see that vision grow and their work be carried out, aiding impoverished children around the world.
Project Healthy Smile	91557		/users/profile/104796	bmxjay	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	Project Healthy Smile is really fun to help out, because it never feels like work or a chore. They always have great events, that are not your standard fund raisers. I was a bartender at a fashion show fund raising event and got to wear a wig with a fake mustache. PHS is very good about raising awareness with out being push and keeping things lighthearted. 
Project Healthy Smile	91553		/users/profile/104787	Michelle P.	Board Member	5	06/21/2011	Project Healthy Smile addresses an important health issue so many of us take for granted. According to the Center for Disease Control tooth decay affects children in the United States more than any other chronic infectious disease. One can only imagine how it affects children in impoverished countries. Many children have never even seen a toothbrush. Bad oral health can lead to many systemic health problems. Teaching children good habits at a young age increases their chances of carrying those good habits into adulthood. Project Healthy Smile has a powerful mission that will change the lives of many children one smile at a time. 
Project Healthy Smile	91549		/users/profile/104777	deanamf	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	The passion that Michelle and Hollie Mae put forward to make this organization successful is amazing.  They see that the children who are suffering cannot make a positive change in their lives if they do not have healthy gums and teeth.  They have traveled to some of the most needy places in the world and have helped children to learn the importance of good oral health.   They are very creative in planning many successful fundraising events that cover all economic ranges and interests.  They will stop at nothing to continue this journey that leads to a better world and future.  I am proud to be a donor and volunteer with Project Healthy Smile.

Kip(Viszla mix) spent 12 years with us and we couldn't have been happier he was such a wonderful dog that created so many crazy stories and awesome memories for our family.  We have since adopted 2 more dogs who have become an equally important part of our family and now are the protectors of our 3 boys, with living out in the country sugar(lab mix) is never far away from the boys when they play outside she is always watching over them to make sure no wild animals come near them.  She plays catch for hours on end with them and then they take turns each night with who's bedroom sugar gets to sleep in.  Our third dog we adopted for our parents who have now moved houses and couldn't take Pepper(lab mix) with so she came back to live with us and has just fit right into our family, she finds a spot at your feet and just snuggles in.

I just lost my 12 yr old English Setter due to old age, and I was heartbroken. The thought of replacing her seemed unrealistic but I still dropped by this Humane Society "just to look".  And there HE was . . . Charlie, the perfect English Springer Spaniel puppy, just 3 months old and ready for a new home.  The staff was so patient with me as my tears flowed, still missing my old dog.  They didn't push the puppy onto me, they listened and wanted only the best for me.  They gave me time to play with him outside, and said that if I needed more time to think about it, that they'd hold the puppy for a day or two.  Yet, I didn't need time.....I knew that this little puppy would fill the hole in my heart.  That puppy, Charlie, was with me for the last 13 years.....and he just crossed over the rainbow bridge 23 days ago.  He was the BEST dog in the whole world.  I'm a marathon runner, so he trained with me on hundreds of miles.  As a business owner, he came to work with me every day.  We were inseparable.  Thank you, Tri-County Humane Society, for the best 13 years of my life!!

Had there not been adoptive pets at the pet store, I wouldn't have him in my life and I think we're both really happy with him coming to his forever home.  I have also become a donor to the TCHS via their online and phone in options,  and I have also shopped at their thrift store. I will continue to donate when I can so that other cats like mine have a chance to find the right home for them.

We were looking at a different puppy when we first arrived and he was already reserved. We then decided to just look around and see who else was available for adoption. Staff were exceptionally welcoming and helped us when needed. When we ran into "Rascal" he gave us those puppy eyes and we connected right away! We got to play outside to see how he would do and he did great with us, the only thing was, we already had a German Shepard/Husky, so we were told by staff to do a Meet and Greet. It went over very well! So we ADOPTED Rascal. Today they are BEST friends. They follow each other EVERYWHERE! My husband and I also learned what it was like caring for one dog but now two and we love it! I love everything about St. Cloud Tri County Humane Society. I definitely will be back someday to adopt that dog who is still waiting for a forever home.

This benifits me because I would have no trouble being the crazy cat lady, but my husband gives me "that look" so fostering is the best way for me to get my kitten fix and I know how much it benifits them.  I have taken some kittens that were almost farrel and hanged them to loving, sweet kitties....it just takes time and patience.  The shelter is so nice to work with and accomodating to me.  The peopl who work there are friendly and helpful.  My daughter has adopted 2 cats that are so wonderful, no health or temperment problems at all.  I recommend this shelter to anyone looking for a great family member or anyone looking for volunteer hours.

Client Served	5	10/25/2013	I have been here many times, sometimes just to visit the animals, and every time was greeted by friendly staff. The facility is also clean and inviting. We have adopted 2 animals from the humane society and it was an easy, informative process and they turned out to be the most amazing pets anyone could ask for. They truly care about their animals and want what's best for them.  
Tri-County Humane Society	173189		/users/profile/229286	KatWoman	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	This is such a great shelter.  Each animal is treated like a beloved pet until they can find their forever home.  I spend a lot of time here, and I'm always touched by the way the employees interact with the dogs and cats.  They recognize each animals strengths, and help them to realize them.  In doing so, each animal presents its best face, and it helps them get adopted.  I'm always happy to see a fur-son get adopted, but somewhat sad to see them leave.  It's nice to remember all the friends I miss.  I've been privileged to be part of the Foster program.  I took grumpy Shannon the cat home for a few months and helped her get over her touch aversion and aggression.  She was adopted by a sweet 4 year old.  I also took home (part time) a dog who'd lived here his whole life.  He was 15.  Sadly, he passed away, but happily, it was at home with me, with my voice in his ears, and my hands around him.  There were more than 20 dog walkers at his wake.  That's the type of Shelter this is.  It's a true community of animal lovers, who do what they can for the most that they can.
Tri-County Humane Society	159642	2	/users/profile/211812	JW.MN	Donor	5	06/05/2013	I am always impressed with the hard work and dedication that every member of the TCHS displays. Their work with the animals in their care is outstanding. They truly want the very best for every animal who passes through their doors. When I stop in, I often hear staff at the front desk giving specific, helpful information to callers. These staff also give behavioral information to new pet owners to help make the transitions of and, ultimately lives of, both the pet and new owner. From my own experience, I very much appreciated the support and care that I received 15 years ago upon adopting my first cat, Pookie. He's a wonderful companion who is still with me today. Their contact with the public is top-notch, as well. I witness outstanding service and true appreciation for donors and volunteers. The staff are always gracious when I bring donations to the shelter, and when I walk through the kennel areas, the staff are helpful and answer all of my questions. Their commitment and dedication is not limited to in-house care, either. Their fundraisers are wonderfully orchestrated and always a great success. I especially appreciate the annual Companion Walk that the TCHS sponsors every September. The atmosphere is so positive, and the vendors are a wonderful touch as I always learn something new from their expertise. As a client as well as a donor, I feel strongly about supporting this organization. I give *only*  to this charity because they truly make a difference.

Tri-County Humane Society	159619		/users/profile/211790	Susan211	Client Served	5	06/05/2013	I have adopted both cats and dogs from the Tri-County Humane Society. Every time I go into the building, the place is clean and everyone is friendly and happy to help. One time I had to give up some rats (the pet store sold my son a pregnant rat!) and they were very happy and willing to help. I was afraid that I would have to pay a fee for each of the 10 or so rats, but they did not make me do that. They made me pay just one fee. I have been very happy with all of the cats and the dog that I got there, and with the service that I got!
Tri-County Humane Society	96428		/users/profile/112308	bernst	Volunteer	5	08/23/2011	The Tri-County Humane Society (TCHS) operates an independent non-profit animal shelter in St. Cloud. The Society has been providing quality services to the people and animals of Central Minnesota since 1974. Some of their services include care for homeless animals, pet adoption, pet lost and found, and humane education. On an annual basis the shelter gives refuge to approximately 4,400 pets.  The number of animals that this shelter helps is just staggering to me. Over 4,000 animals every year is just unbelievable. I started out volunteering at the shelter, but it would just break my heart to know I couldn't take an animal home with me. I fall in love much too easy! So I started helping in other ways. Most recently I have been helping with  special fundraising events. In the spring Tri-County raises money through a dinner and silent auction. In the fall they have a 5k walk - the Companion Walk. I have been a board member for both events. Mostly helping with planning and organizing. In addition, the last two years I have helped tie-dye t-shirts which are given to people who raise $200 or more in pledges for the walk.  This a huge fundraiser for the shelter. Last year the Companion Walk raised over $50,000 dollars!!!! -  I feel very lucky to be able to help with this event. Just think of all the animals that money will help!

We now have a new member in our family that we love terribly and it wouldn't have been possible without them.

Diana from IRIS came up and was very accommodating to our emotional needs. she gave us priceless heirlooms. photos that we would have never thought to take, plaster castings of his hands and feet, a special outfit and blanket to wrap him in, and all her years of knowledge. she helped us prepare emotionally for what to expect when we left the hospital, helped bring in a priest to baptize our baby, and spent a full day with us, only leaving when we felt ready for her to. the best thing about IRIS is they remind you that you aren't alone and with people in various stages of their grief, they show you there is a way to live after loss. without the IRIS foundation my husband and I would be lost, we are forever grateful for Diana and the team of volunteers.

My daughter, her mother, reached out to this organization to help with her grief she was experiencing during this devastating time.  I then found them and have been following them on facebook since then.  They helped her in areas that I could not.  I have not been through a tragedy such as this.  I didn't know how to help.  This group is full of caring people that have experienced the same things she was going through.  With their guidance and kind words she is getting better.  I'd love to visit them one day and would love to make plans with my daughter to do so.  They are committed to assisting all when this happens to families.  The IRIS lantern event that took place last month looked phenominal and peaceful honoring our lost children/grandchildren.  They even went over and beyond by sending me back the lantern that they floated and created in honor of my granddaughter.  I just want to say Thank You to IRIS for being there and available to so many.  Lori Swearingen

They are life threatening.  I cannot explain how overwhelming it is to live with allergies, especially when first diagnosed. Cooking, shopping and eating immediately became an intense puzzle.  We found so little information and resources at the time so we were grateful to find AFAA.  Through them, we met a number of helpful people who shared recipes, travel and shopping tips, and could truly empathize with the daily fear and frustrations of allergies. Over the years we've discovered that although daily life becomes more managable, each new experience brings incredible challenges.  Navigating childhood joys like playdates, birthday parties, school, church or camp is very stressful.  Because allergies are a life-long journey for us and our daughter, we deeply appreciate the advocacy, education, support and awareness AFAA does on behalf of all families with living with food allergies.  The founders are tireless and continue to offer new, creative opportunities while providing steady support and advocacy.

Our son has a life-threatening food allergy to peanuts and tree nuts. It has changed the way we look at food, live our lives, and interact with the world around us. AFAA has been our lifeline as we navigate through this food allergy journey. It has provided needed food allergy education to families, schools, and communities. The organization's advocacy work has provided our son with safeguards at school and in emergency situations (i.e. anaphylaxis) that ensures our son will receive epinephrine treatment. Thank you AFAA for taking the fear out of food allergies and for being a leader as a MN non-profit food allergy organization!
Anaphylaxis and Food Allergy Association of Minnesota	46858	5	/users/profile/47671	tysmom	Volunteer	4	06/29/2010	AFAA has helped our family deal with the very difficult task of living with a child with a life threatening food allergy.  We received so much support and help - both concrete and emotional - from AFAA that I volunteered to take on the huge task of chairing the first ever AFAA Walk at the Mall of America.   I was more than happy to do the work - as AFAA's director came to our school to talk about training the staff on Epi-PEns.  I have attended the AFAA conference for years and received loads of information from the medical professionals and other families living with food allergies.  My family has volunteered for years at the AFAA booth at the State fair - it is so important to educate other people about how scary and life threatening a food allergy is - all it takes is one bite!  And we see thousands of people every day at the State Fair booth so this is a perfect way to get out the message.  Living with a food allergy is a daily challenge and AFAA has helped our family in countless ways - their help is prioeless!
Anaphylaxis and Food Allergy Association of Minnesota	46666	7	/users/profile/47498	shegarty	Volunteer	5	06/29/2010	All my life (of 40+ years) I enjoyed eating what I enjoyed, skipping what I didn't, and not worrying about how my food habits affected other people.That all changed when I met three people and got involved with the Anaphylaxis and Food Allergy Association of Minnesota. First, I met my sister-in-law who has a severe reaction to onions; the second person was a coworker whose lips would grow to the size of circus clowns when she ate certain fruits; the third was a young neighbor boy who has severe allergies to nuts. As a former hotel kitchen worker, I realize now how serious food allergies can be and that everything I touch may result in life or death for persons with severe food allergies. Since a cure is not available for my friends and family, education is key. I volunteer for AFAA to raise the conscience of those who were oblivious like me and don't realize the importance of food safety. AFAA does that through several outreach events, such as a state fair booth, benefit concert and walk, kids and family daycamp, peanut-free MLB ballgame suites and more. I've seen the smile come across a stressed mother's face when she realizes that she is not alone in her struggle to raise a baby with recently discovered severe food allergies to milk. She can get help through AFAA of MN and talk to other parents who have learned with the help of AFAA, to take the fear out of food.

It's amazing to see the variety of resources available to help stabilize those in need and then to help them develop the skills and give them the support for career advancement, housing, etc. The staff and volunteers have a passion to support this community and make a difference in the lives of others. It's an amazing organization!

It is so rewarding to see the difference it makes with their confidence and self-esteem level.  The heartfelt appreciation that is given to us is worth the time spent, to know that we are helping people to get back into the workforce .  This is the final step of a wonderful program to help people regain independence and self-worth.  
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	312239	1	/users/profile/403595	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	Interfaith Outreach is filled with caring, dedicated volunteers and staff who want to make sure everyone  in our community has the opportunity to thrive.  From the food shelf, resale shop, employment services, housing and education assistance they are there to help families in crisis find stability and move to self sufficiency and success.  I've been a volunteer there for four years and have seen the incredible impact Interfaith Outreach has on the lives of those in need to feel valued, respected and empowered to succeed.  It's a great place to volunteer and really make a difference in the life of your neighbors.
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	301160	1	/users/profile/392045	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/21/2016	IOCP has been in our community for as long as I have been alive.  I participated in their food drives, holiday gift programs and sleep outs as a child.  I have grown up to be able to support these efforts along with some of their other programming including employment services as an adult.  Poverty, food insecurity, housing and employment instability can often be "invisible" in the NW suburbs.  IOCP works to not only provide visibility, but opportunity to connect those in need with those who can help across a broad spectrum or programs.  I am proud to volunteer with them, I am proud to be a part of the community that they are a part of.

As a volunteer and Board Member I see both the strategy, plan and infrastructure as well as see the wonderful staff and volunteers who make a difference in the lives of those in need on a daily basis.  Everyone is valued!  It's truly a special place.
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	300198	1	/users/profile/391046	Markkula	Volunteer	5	08/11/2016	Last winter I was at a point in my life (personal and professional) where I wanted to give back.  Interfaith Outreach was a natural fit because it is in my community (I live in Wayzata) and my employer (BMO Harris Bank N.A.) has historically been involved.  It was a great time for me to step up and represent BMO at I nterfaith AND get my family involved.  Today I volunteer at the Food Shelf and serve on the Development Committee.  I like the Food Shelf because I can see the immediate impact in the community.  It is also something my kids can see the impact.  They are young, 5 and 8, so when we participate in "Pack for Seniors" they can see we are following a list and putting together packages for seniors.  And they understand the importance of having food and maybe not being able to go to the grocery store or Target to buy it.  I love that Interfaith Outreach combines multiple groups within the community so it really is a one-stop shop.  
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	299967	1	/users/profile/390792	jocella	Volunteer	5	08/09/2016	I've volunteered with IOCP in a variety of ways.  I continue to be amazed at the powerful impact this wonderful organization has on our local community.   I have witnessed first hand the amazing services and educational opportunities provided to those in need, and I am so impressed with the professional, respectful and constructive manner in which they deal with all of their clients.  The staff and board are wonderful stewards of the donations they receive - ensuring that the organization is run in the most efficient manner so that the maximum benefit is bestowed on those in need.  I am also impressed at how easy they make it for community members to get involved - from one-time volunteer opportunities to long-term assignments.  
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	299958	1	/users/profile/390780	Writer	Donor	5	08/09/2016	Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners is one of the most highly respected non-profit organizations in Minnesota.  The organization has a very focused mission and very strong community partners who work collaboratively with the organization to achieve that mission.  The organization has an outstanding staff and over 1,500 volunteers who commit themselves to delivering high quality services to the clients of the organization.

Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	299957	1	/users/profile/390778	erincella3	Volunteer	5	08/09/2016	I have worked in a few different roles within IOCP and in each new role and experience I get to see how big the impact is that IOCP has on the community.  My favorite experience was working at the Christmas gift exchange, helping families pick up their Christmas presents.  The reason this experience was my favorite is because I was able to see first hand the joy in these parents and children's eyes when they received their gifts.  It's such an amazing program that IOCP puts together and I can't wait to help out again next year! - Erin Cella 
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	299950	1	/users/profile/390769	Janet140	Board Member	5	08/09/2016	I've volunteered in several capacities at Interfaith Outreach over the last 8+ years.  Through that,  I have seen their operation from the ground up all the way to the Board of Directors.  The vision, integrity, relationships and compassion that I see EVERY day is truly remarkable.  What I find most impressive about Interfaith Outreach is not only the organization's ability to deliver amazing support to our community but to manage this non-profit as a successful small business.  A small business that is able to sustain itself over time because of proper leadership, planning and budgeting.  A small business that employs a wonderful group of case managers and leaders - and a small business that is truly part of their community.  
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	298857	1	/users/profile/389745	Rima T.	Board Member	5	08/01/2016	Interfaith Outreach is truly a special nonprofit organization.  It goes far beyond providing emergency assistance to well over two thousand families in need every year, helping them move from crisis to a more sustainable life situation.  It actually channels the power of our entire community to help each other to create opportunities for everyone to thrive.  Key partner organizations make such a difference in the impact made, as do the affiliated faith groups and congregations.  Interfaith outreach brings us all together to make our community stronger.  Our next frontier is education and this organization isn't shying away from that great challenge.  Kudos to Interfaith Outreach - a great nonprofit! 
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	284198	1	/users/profile/374230	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/31/2016	This organization is creating opportunities for people to thrive every day.

I so enjoy being a part of this great team. 
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	25727	1	/users/profile/26731	CWolohan	Board Member	5	01/16/2010	IOCP is a visionary organization focused on helping people in our local community deal with a continuum of issues and support relatd to having and keeping a home.  IOCP is very effective and efficient provider of services, and "helper" rather than enabler for those needing help - and is unique in the way that it establishes collaborative partnerships with others (churches, non-profits, businesses) to help the local community deal with housing issues.  As a result of IOCP's efforts, hundreds of families have been able to stay in their home, dozens of affordable homes have been added to our local community, and there is a very real presence of care, concern and constructive support for our clienrs.
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	25453	1	/users/profile/26452	chrisbelle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/12/2010	As a pastor in the community, I get a chance to see IOCP work from a variety of different perspectives. I am continually impressed by their professionalism and compassion. They not only respond to crises but help individuals and families work toward sustainable independence. The staff is professional and effective, and stewards their resources with wisdom and discernment. They are also collaborative partners and participants in the life of the broader community.
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	25436	1	/users/profile/26437	Fred Hegele	Board Member	5	01/11/2010	IOCP is making a very positive impact in our community.  In addition to meeting emergency needs of less fortunate people in our area, my observation is that IOCP is helping many to become independent and stable.   I see the staff of IOCP as competent and highly efficient, making good use of every dollar contributed.   I believe IOCP is a great organization to give time and skills in a volunteer capacity.  IOCP helps the whole community to be engaged in helping others and celebrating successes.   Thank goodness there is an IOCP in our community.
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	25429	1	/users/profile/26428	Caroline	General Member of the Public	5	01/11/2010	Interfaith Outreach And Community Partners serves a critical need in our community - every year, but particularly now when the need is so great. The Sleep Out event this year was tremendous, surpassing the amount of donations raised last year, which is a testimony to the professional and ethical way that this organization is run. Truly giving back and helping those in our community every year!
Interfaith Outreach & Community Partners	9087	1	/users/profile/10876	Lenore Franzen	Volunteer	5	08/13/2009	The event, held at a park, was very well organized, with plenty of staff on hand and volunteers to explain each activity and cheer them on. I had as much fun as the kids, and it was particularly great to know that these kids were enjoying a safe, healthy afternoon. Two boys who were doing the 3-legged race really concentrated and worked as a team. It was wonderful to see how proud they were to win, but also how much fun all the teams had, just participating. I would definitely do this again, and would like to find other ways to help out with the CONECT program.

Secondhand Hounds	312668		/users/profile/404041	Tina113	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I've been a volunteer and foster for this truly amazing organization for 4 years now. I've watched this rescue grow leaps and bounds and I'm so excited for what's to come. The work they do is second to none. 
Secondhand Hounds	308667		/users/profile/400041	Brittany57	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	SHH is the most well organized rescue I have ever worked with. It runs like a well oiled machine thanks to their staffs tireless hard work and dedicated volunteers. The facilities are spotless! Every effort and precaution is taken to ensure all animals have the best care, fosters and adoption possible! I am honored to be able to volunteer for Secondhand Hounds! 
Secondhand Hounds	308627		/users/profile/399995	Jeni S.	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	The people are almost as awesome as the animals they rescue. They make adopting a thorough but easy process. The animals come from very diverse backgrounds, but are all treated like family the second they come in. 
Secondhand Hounds	308550		/users/profile/399924	Susie24	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I'm so blessed to have had the opportunity to work with this passionate, authentic organization. Every volunteer and staff members strives to live out SecondHand Hound's mission, which is truly so unique. The amount of immediate and unwavering support I've received as a foster was overwhelming. I can't thank this awesome group enough for working so hard towards something I, too, care about so deeply. 
Secondhand Hounds	308461		/users/profile/399840	Kyle39	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	My family has been volunteering and fostering with shh for about 5 years!  We've had about 30 dogs and puppies go through our home and the rescue has been amazing with all their help.   Can't tell you how many people they have helped let alone the 10,000 plus dogs and cats!  We've foster failed on 2 dogs,  Spanky (pitbull/whippet) and Bentley a special needs bulldog/beagle mix....I'd include a picture but I don't have any small enough!
Secondhand Hounds	308358		/users/profile/399743	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I have been involved as a volunteer with Secondhand Hounds for the last year and a half.  I help staff the office, support intake of animals, and do animal photography for their adoptable animals.  The organization is amazing!  They save animals in even the most dire of situations and have the most amazing staff....typically working their SHH role on top of other full time work.   I can't say enough about the community of rescue they have created....saying yes as much as they possibly can!   They have definitely changed my life for the better based on my involvement!!  Kudos SHH!!
Secondhand Hounds	308226		/users/profile/399618	Alanna N.	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	I'm a volunteer for SHH and adopted one of my dogs there. My experience on both sides has been amazing. The staff and volunteers are dedicated, organized, and provide great service. Fosters take amazing care of their animals and ensure a good match with adopters. I'd highly recommend adopting from this rescue and becoming involved as a volunteer!
Secondhand Hounds	308216		/users/profile/399608	Sara150	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I've been working with SHH for about five years. The way that the different programs work, and the amount of organization that comes from each coordinator is amazing. I've adopted and fostered and it's become a lifestyle 
Secondhand Hounds	308170		/users/profile/399559	Writer	Advisor	5	10/06/2016	I have been working with SHH since Rachel founded it in 2009.  The amount of support and growth we have seen is incredible, and we are literally saving animals from being euthanized.  There are so many ways to get involved.  I have met so many amazing people through rescue that I now call my friends :) 
Secondhand Hounds	304076		/users/profile/395244	CindyLevey	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	  I have NEVER met a group that is more passionate about their animals and finding them proper care, love and "furever" homes!!  They put the Can-DO in everything they touch.  The workers are well- guided and so caring.  It's Clean, It's organized, and they get a lot of things done!!   I totally support them!!!
Secondhand Hounds	303777		/users/profile/394943	Writer	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	We started volunteering in early 2010 and made fostering dogs a family affair. We have adopted 2 animals from SHH (cat & dog) and they have become each other's best friends! Secondhand Hounds is a smartly run organization that we have always proud to be a part of! 
Secondhand Hounds	303729	1	/users/profile/394899	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I started fostering with Secondhand Hounds a little over two years ago. When I started, I thought I would just try it and save one dog. Well Secondhand Hounds made the experience SO easy and enjoyable that I have fostered 12 dogs and 9 kittens so far. I'm so happy that I can make a difference for these deserving animals. It certainly takes a village to make it happen! Lots of volunteer opportunities- I would recommend this organization to any animal lover that is looking for an opportunity to get involved in the rescue community!
Secondhand Hounds	303714		/users/profile/394882	SpinArtFocus	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I am a Home Visit Volunteer for Secondhand Hounds. I love having a role in the adoption process, completing the final step for approval. I truly enjoy meeting families committed to welcoming rescued animals into their lives. Secondhand Hounds has continued to build an organization that answers many needs. Over time, I have seen SHH rally forces on behalf of urgent medical cases, special needs categories, foster recruitment and so much more. Just one example of what the Secondhand Hounds community is capable of....The effort to raise big $$$$ to buy bulldogs at auction last year was truly amazing. Getting the word out, scrambling to put the logistics in place in a very short time -- so many caring people at the edge of our seats as we waited for updates on facebook. Folks invested in any way they could - a giant network of prayer, support, donations - to see those angels brought to safety and into a loving, healing life. My volunteerism with SHH has opened me to new, bigger dreams and goals for my own future. Advocacy is my purpose. 
Secondhand Hounds	303522	1	/users/profile/394694	zubar	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	I have adopted one dog through Secondhand Hounds.  Our dog had some medical issues which we were aware of prior to adoption.   The dog has blossomed into a wonderful family pet.  The adoption process was thorough and efficient.   The dog arrived fully vetted and SHH was able to answer all questions regarding our dog.  I would not hesitate to adopt from SHH and have recommended SHH to many others. 
Secondhand Hounds	303501	1	/users/profile/394670	Andrea146	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	Secondhand Hounds (SHH) is foster based animal rescue that is very well run.  I'm a current foster and volunteer and love SHH.  All vetting and supplies are provided by SHH to care for the fosters, making the process super smooth.  There are also soooo many excellent people involved that are always willing to help troubleshoot any situations.  End goal is always to find the best match for the animal and their furever home!
Secondhand Hounds	271928	1	/users/profile/360845	Steve_S42	Volunteer	5	11/12/2015	I am both a volunteer and client served with Secondhand Hounds. I see up close and personal how much blood sweat and tears (literally) the staff put into rescuing these animals. SHH doesn't take just the easy animals, they take the difficult ones as well, ones with health issues, seniors, so called aggressive breeds, and even hospice cases. Without SHH I would never have found my Gloria and who knows if she would have made it out of a shelter.
Secondhand Hounds	233603	4	/users/profile/297466	Andrea118	Volunteer	5	11/13/2014	Secondhand Hounds regularly goes above and beyond for animals that would otherwise not have a chance, from rescuing misunderstood breeds, animals that have come from abusive or neglectful situations, and animals with serious medical needs that other rescues might not be willing or able to accept. Its network of volunteers works tirelessly to provide the best veterinary care and foster homes, and to re-home each animal in a loving adoptive home. The organization also goes out of its way to ensure each animal that comes through the rescue is cared for for life, allowing adopters to return SHH animals if they are no longer able to care for them. This is something that I believe makes Secondhand Hounds truly unique and special in the rescue community. 
Secondhand Hounds	233600	5	/users/profile/297458	David274	Volunteer	5	11/13/2014	I believe and stand by the work that Secondhand Hounds does, which has saved over 6,000 animals to date. It is not an easy process or job, but as a volunteer I have seen the heart of the staff, volunteers, fosters, and supports. They are trying to do the best they can to find each animal a great home. SHH has a process that ensures no rush decisions are made and that the foster homes decide which is the best home as they know the animal best out of anyone, even though as a foster I can say it is not always easy to say no to one family when you have a choice to make. There is no magic equation or guidebook to making this decision, but it is one made out of love and compassion for the animal that was saved.
Secondhand Hounds	198468	5	/users/profile/259192	Harley2468	Client Served	1	04/21/2014	I'm convinced the work SHH is doing to save the lives of animals is to be honored and applauded however we found the process to adopt a dog to be huge disappointment.   We had been researching breeders for a specific type of dog and stumbled upon the SHH website where there was a new adoptable dog that was exactly what we were looking for.  We applied and contacted the foster family immediately to schedule a meet and greet.  A full week and 60 miles later we met with them at their home, and made an immediate connection with both the foster family and the dog.  We learned there were four other families being interviewed and the criteria for making a decision was solely in their hands based on what they feel is best.   In the end, the dog was awarded to another family and we were left wondering why we were not selected.   I wonder how a foster family is so confident in knowing what is best for a dog they have only had for less than two weeks.  I cannot imagine the thought of being interviewed over and over again for our ability to provide a loving home for an animal that needs one.   I would not recommend Secondhand Hounds or this process to anyone looking for a companion unless youre willing to make many attempts to adopt and can live with this type of disenchantment.

Finding resources and opportunities for developing kindness and serving as a family can be difficult and DGT makes it much easier.  We so value the impact that DGT has had on our family that we are dedicating a ten-month family effort, Project Becoming Our Best, to raise $ and awareness for them. We are so thankful for the wonderful (and very important) work that DGT does!

We have been working to teach our children how to give back, how to demonstrate kindness and empathy, how to be helpers, and how to generally face the world with compassion.  DGT has given us the necessary tools, ideas, and support to make this a part of our life.  They have great ideas for projects and activities and provide lovely reminders about how to incorporate these values into holidays and other occasions.  We have found DGT to be a wonderful resource for our family.

Doing Good Together	313769		/users/profile/329144	TheFamilyPartnership	Client Served	5	10/24/2016	Doing Good Together has been a great resource for tapping into new volunteers in and around the Twin Cities. Listing with Doing Good Together as worked so well that we were able to get enough homemade play-doh to fulfill the needs for all of our preschool classrooms within days.
Doing Good Together	311748		/users/profile/403105	ashley.a.raggio	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	I used Doing Good Together's online resources for my own family for 2 or 3 years and followed their developments through their newsletters since I did not live in the Twin Cities area. Now, a few years later my passion for the quality and depth of what they do has led me to begin an affiliate program for DGT in the Silicon Valley area. I wanted to be able to take the important lessons and values I saw in their programs and share it with my community. I also wanted to find a way to encourage families to volunteer together by providing localized listings. I love how Doing Good Together looks at kindness and compassion as a family value and how a family can build upon this through so many different areas of conversation, reading, volunteering, advocacy, etc. 
Doing Good Together	311533		/users/profile/402889	natsilverstein	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	I am a local area affiliate of Doing Good Together in New York City, and the reason why I spend so much time and passion working with DGT is because it is truly changing the way parents raise kids to be kind and compassionate in the world today.  DGT's resources online are extraordinary.  It is a one-stop shop for all of the wonderful ways you can engage your kids in conversation about kindness, empathy, fairness and compassion. It offers real, fun and easy ways for families to engage in hands-on service, both through local listings (like the one I curate in NYC) and other general ideas for projects that can be done by any family, anywhere - and with only a little bit of time commitment.  The blog posts are inspiring.  The book club is both a wonderful gift and a great way to incorporate service into reading with your kids.  There are simply limitless ways that Doing Good Together is spreading the word about the vital importance of service and kindness in family life.  We need DGT today more than ever! 
Doing Good Together	308014		/users/profile/399393	Jess28	Volunteer	5	10/05/2016	I found Doing Good Together about a year ago while I was looking for volunteering opportunities for myself and my two girls. I was amazed at the opportunities of events that the organization provided for all members of the family to be a part of together. I'm really happy with the concept that was created here, because I feel that it is really important to raise children who have a sense of the world around them, and who contribute and give back. After being impressed with the organization I became a volunteer and now work as an employee with the organization. I would absolutely recommend this organization to anyone! My kids absolutely love the activities that are available and they are always excited to attend their next volunteering opportunity.

DGT Family Services Fair gave us a perfect venue for connecting our Company's Mission of giving back to our community with our internal desire to find opportunities for the families of our employees to do volunteer work in our community while also spending time together developing family bonds that extend beyond the workplace.

Doing Good Together	294665		/users/profile/385407	Mark214	Board Member	5	07/04/2016	This is the best nonprofit that I have ever been associated with.  They have a great mission and their executive director and employees are very passionate about what they do.  They really do help families in so many ways raise children who care, starting with mine.  I actually am blown away by how much they can accomplish with their current resources.  It's pretty amazing! - Mark
Doing Good Together	243373	1	/users/profile/330105	LGMomOf4	Board Member	5	05/21/2015	I discovered Doing Good Together several years ago while searching for ways to introduce volunteer activities to my children who ranged in age from 9 to 19.  The ideas presented in the monthly volunteer opportunity newsletter were applicable to the whole family.  DGT also provides information to parents to generate conversation about volunteering.  Over the years, I have seen my children develop their own interests in doing good things for others, and they have even shared their involvement in the organization with their friends.  The resources provided by Doing Good Together are exceptional and make volunteering so easy, no matter the ages or time constraints of the family.  And the 30 Days of Kindness Challenge is perfect for the summer months when kids are looking for things to do!

By creating authentic and FUN activities, they help foster a young person's desire to give back, and to be involved. So important!

Our daughter is only 8 months old, but my husband and I are already keeping notes of DGT's great ideas for promoting a spirit of service-mindedness in children and plan to implement them as our family grows. We can't wait til our daughter is a little older, and we can start subscribing to the Big Hearted Families Book Club!
Doing Good Together	200265		/users/profile/261426	Jennifer326	Board Member	5	05/14/2014	DGT is an amazing organization. I know first hand. I have participated in DGT events (Family Service Night) and utilized many of their advertised activity ideas for deepening kindness and compassion within my family such as the birthday party activity, reading books from the book club, identifying accessible family volunteer opportunities, and creating and giving May day baskets just to name a few. The organization fills a need in our society that is not meet by other nonprofits (empowering families to raise children who care and contribute), it is run by a passionate and extremely intelligent Executive Director,  has strong ties with community members in Minnesota and across the United States and has a dedicated volunteer base.   Their activities are inspiring, meaningful and fun.  I am proud to give this organization a 5 star rating.

Monarch Butterfly Fund	309297		/users/profile/400662	Paul208	General Member of the Public	1	10/10/2016	Monarch Butterfly Fund has never posted photos documenting how it has ever used donation money to help monarch butterflies in a biologically meaningful way.  Example: TheFund has never posted photos of new butterfly cluster trees planted at the overwintering sites in Mexico to replace those that were cut down by loggers, toppled by storm winds or mudslides or burned during forest fires.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	309131	2	/users/profile/400487	Don_Davis	Board Member	5	10/08/2016	Monarch Butterfly Fund carries out effective work in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve because of partnerships developed with the Reserve management, local communities and NGO's. These projects benefit the monarchs but also the ejidatarios who make the Reserve their home. Past projects include reforestation, workshops on the construction of water cisterns and high efficiency wood stoves. As active participants in the reforestation and rehabilitation of 10 ha of Monarch Reserve forest that were egregiously illegally logged on Sierra Chincua last summer, MBF was involved in the planning, Board members engaged in tree planting, and MBF made key recommendations which included allowing parts of the area with healthy oyamel fir seedlings to regenerate naturally.  MBF paid for fencing to keep wandering cattle out of the natural regeneration areas. This important work must continue! Your generous donation will make this happen. Read about our work at http://monarchbutterflyfund.org . Thank you.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	305323	2	/users/profile/283090	Monarchtagger	Donor	5	09/18/2016	From what I am reading at the Monarch Butterfly Fund website (monarchconservation.org) this has been another productive year for this effective 501 (c) (3) non profit, engaging in projects that benefit both the monarchs and the ejidatarios who live in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Contrary to comments made in an earlier review by John Marks, MBF was not created in 2014 but in 2009 through a merger of two non-profits, and they have expanded on the projects they support in the Reserve. I am sending them a donation today to ensure that the work they do will continue. 
Monarch Butterfly Fund	277831	2	/users/profile/283090	Monarchtagger	Donor	5	01/23/2016	Inspired by reading the latest MBF newsletter posted at www.monarchbutterflyfund.orgI will donate even more money to MBF this year! Almost 28,000 trees planted in partnership with Alternare and 700 men and women from 7 indigenous communities; workshops sponsored for the building of energy-efficient wood stoves, water cisterns and dry latrines; important scientific research sponsored; 21 tree nurseries established. Both the monarchs and people living in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve benefit from this work. Collaboration with U.S. monarch conservation efforts as a member of Monarch Joint Venture.  Founded in February 2009, this non-profit has an admirable track record of landmark accomplishments. The results are in! DONATE TODAY!
Monarch Butterfly Fund	219485	2	/users/profile/283090	Monarchtagger	Donor	5	10/02/2014	What an incredible year for Monarch Butterfly Fund in carrying out it's Mission to foster the conservation of North American Monarch butterflies and their migration through habitat restoration, research, monitoring, education and support for sustainable community development in and near the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Having developed the trust and cooperation of local communities through past projects, 32,500 tree seedlings were planted on 32 hectares of land, providing communities with the incentives to be the protectors and guardians of their own forests; skills and knowledge leading to sustainable forestry; future resources with which to heat their homes, cook their food or sell wood to make money with which to support their families; reduce the demand for wood and timber at higher elevations on the mountains where the monarchs spent the winter months. Seeing members of communities rally together - husbands, wives, children and grandparents - digging holes and planting trees is so exciting! MBF is really making a difference!
Monarch Butterfly Fund	259870	1	/users/profile/348396	JohnMarks	General Member of the Public	1	09/26/2015	Think, people!  This organization JUST STARTED in summer, 2014!  Their so-called "reviews" are dated at the same time as their start-up! Yet, those reviews and the home page are claiming a long and successful track record by the MBF! Do you really want to give your money to a group who is not honest about their origins? Who is not honest about what they have actually done as the Monarch Butterfly Fund? Who recruits others to be DIS-honest for them in writing these "reviews"? Whose very tiny, very recent track record exists in another country where their alleged activities cannot be monitored or verified? The PEOPLE who have formed MBF have a long track record as dedicated monarch researchers with MANY years in that field combined. But the ORGANIZATION is not as they claim. Why would they do that? What could possibly be the motive? Would it have anything to do with the U.S. President opening the financial floodgates for monarch and pollinator conservation and these people hurriedly formed this group to cash in? The presidential announcement and the MBF were made public at the same time. Why not say" we have created this new group and this is what we want to do, will you help us"? Why lie?  That's a BIG RED FLAG.  You would all do well to back up from this thing and go very slowly. Or maybe not go at all! There are other groups of long-standing and with an incredible success rate who have been re-foresting the monarch biosphere reserve areas. You would do well to check them out first before going with a brand new group who makes false claims and believe they are very clever to do so.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	221332	1	/users/profile/285034	Roots	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	The monarch butterfly fund is a professional and credible organization dedicated to conserving monarch butterflies and their habitat. By partnering with local communities, the Monarch Butterfly Fund is working to strengthen conservation efforts while improving the quality of life of both butterfly and local people populations. The experts, members and donors who invest in this organization are committed to the well being of people, butterflies and the planet. 
Monarch Butterfly Fund	220404	3	/users/profile/284051	pjaramil1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/06/2014	I could not think of a group of people that is more committed to monarch butterfly conservation than MBF. I completely disagree with username VGRR who says that MBF only provides travel funds for a few monarch enthusiasts. Clearly, this person has not been involved with MBF and has no clue of what MBF does for Mexican ejidatarios who protect and conserve the overwintering habitat for monarchs. I have been lucky enough to get to know and to collaborate with MBF board members who are the most knowledgeable group of scientists I know. I have never been in touch with a group of people that is so driven to conserve the migratory phenomenon of monarch butterflies. I would like to invite username VGRR to come to Mexico and witness how MBF has changed the lives of many people and has supported various projects aimed at conservation of the overwintering sites. If anybody is interested in knowing what MBF does in Mexico I invite them to contact me. Kind regards, Dr. Pablo Jaramillo Lpez, Ph.D. (pjaramil1@gmail.com)

Their local programs in education play a vital role.  Their reforestation projects replace and improve the stands of Oyamel Fir trees that the wintering monarchs need to roost in. I have been following the activities of monarch support organisations for many years and count the Monarch Butterfly Fund among the most valuable. Carolyn KingToronto Entomologists' Association
Monarch Butterfly Fund	217160	3	/users/profile/280679	Butterflynola	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	I have been a Monarch Butterfly citizen scientist since 1994.  Since that time I have been actively involved with many of the people and organizations affiliated with the Monarch Butterfly Fund.  Its existence is very important for the support of educational programs in three countries and the many tracking and data collecting programs around the country, mostly being led by people like me and my associate volunteers in parks and gardens year around to render the information of the importance of this marvelous bell-weather for our fragile environment.  We need the Monarch Butterfly species to thrive and we need the support of your organizations to continue do all we can to protect and improve the plight of all the smaller life that has to rely on the spaces we create.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	217095	8	/users/profile/280613	MonarchCrusader	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	Monarch Butterfly Fund provides grants for forest conservation, monarch habitat assessment and species monitoring, scientific research on aspects of monarch conservation, public awareness and outreach regarding monarch conservation, and support for local livelihoods in Mexican communities adjacent to the monarch habitat.  It's the last work that I believe is especially important.  The local people near the reserves used to clear these forests as did our ancestors, to feed their families and have wood for fuel.  Poverty is a huge problem, and when people are desperate, they turn to logging.  MBF works to improve the local economy so that people are not driven to poach. I know many of the people on the Board.  They are volunteers, experts, and passionate about conserving monarchs.  Their integrity is impeccable. Carol Pasternak, Toronto Canada
Monarch Butterfly Fund	214836	4	/users/profile/278148	dianepruden	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2014	Monarch Butterfly Fund is one of the most valuable organizations supporting the monarch butterfly migration.  Their support of reforestation at the overwintering sites in Mexico is wonderful.  Their funds improve the lives of the local people as well as enabling the planting of thousands of the Oyamel fir trees.  I have seen the work that MBF supports at Alternare (in Michoacan) and it is phenomenal.  MBF also has several valuable publications that I use for presentations and displays.  The website is very user friendly and MBF has worked to provide excellent resource material.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	214815	5	/users/profile/278123	Ruth47	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2014	Monarch Butterfly Fund's strategy focuses on protecting and expanding the forest in the Monarchs' overwintering habitat.  In addition, they have programs to educate local people about the butterflies as well as sustainable development projects to help locals make money in ways other than logging. Without these local initiatives in Mexico, the species will not survive.  Protecting habitat in the U.S. is not part of this charity's mission, not should it be, since it would be spreading itself too thin.  I am currently a citizen science participant in the Monarch Watch tagging program, and they and other groups are working very hard on the habitat issue in North America.  I would be sad if people criticized us for not also working to save the forest in Mexico. Each group needs to focus its mission, and that is what the Monarch Butterfly Fund has done. I rest better at night knowing there are groups at work protecting the forest where my hand-raised Monarchs will end up needing a place to roost.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	214795	4	/users/profile/278094	VGRR	General Member of the Public	1	09/11/2014	The Monarch Butterfly Fund mainly provides free airfare and hotel expenses for a select few monarch butterfly enthusiasts to visit the overwintering sites in Mexico and attend various meetings in the USA and Canada.  MBF hasn't done anything that truly helps monarch butterflies - like it hasn't spent time contacting state highway departments in its own home state of Minnesota to get them to stop mowing milkweed plants at times of year when monarch eggs and caterpillars are on the plants.
Monarch Butterfly Fund	214036	4	/users/profile/277258	stromboli	Donor	5	09/08/2014	I am so grateful that there are people like those in the Monarch Butterfly Fund to act on behalf of all of us to protect and preserve these creatures, both delicate and hardy, as they struggle with the conditions that we have created.  Their activities (the MBF that is) are both sensitive and practical and get at immediate solutions to the plight of the butterflies, food and safe habitats. The butterflies are one of the early victims of our carelessness with our environment and we need to pay attention to the warning they are providing.I'm behind the MBF 100%Wendy Campbell

Give me a garden to weed and rocks to move around and I will happily do that for hours, but WORKING OUT??? No,However last year a friend turned me onto I.E.MPhit - an awesome and amazing facility that caters to the reluctant as well as the physically challenged. I go every week. That is an major measure of how good these people, and Chris Coffey is that good. He is is inventive, observant and well-grounded in his training. I went from "didn't like it but it is good for me", to "I'm here to play hard".Check it out. Do yourself a favor.
The Institute for Exercise Medicine and Prevention	203465		/users/profile/265402	Fiona4	Client Served	5	06/23/2014	I don't like working out at all. I find it boring and tedious, even though I know it's good for me. Discovering I.EM.PHIT has been a godsend. I started February 27, going once a week, but have upped it to twice a week, and feel quite virtuous in telling my doctor I do so. Chris Coffey really knows his stuff, and is inventive in finding ways to get muscles working by creating variations on different exercises. Having someone keep me company while I go through the cycle (usually twice) keeps me from being bored, and keeps me showing up to work out. This organisation provides the kind of service I know costs a great deal at other fitness places - a truly personalised trainer. I know that I am getting stronger, I can feel it in my day-to-day activities, as well as in my participation in the exercises with the various interns Coffey has working there. This is a phenomenal non-profit, and I am so very grateful I found it!

Ashland Productions	282546	2	/users/profile/372706	Writer	Client Served	1	03/16/2016	I have no idea who has been working with these other reviewers, but our experience with Ashland has been miserable.  They are rude to the children and parents, sarcastic, mean, have no idea how to keep busy kids busy, and tell them they will be kicked out of the play if they get too many strikes.   Their approach may work for older children who have a huge love of theater, but for a first experience with a younger and energetic child, it was a very long and unhappy 4 months and we couldn't wait for it to be over.  There are other children's theater companies out there who do a much better job and in a shorter amount of time.  I certainly hope our school got something out of it because we certainly didn't.

My sister loves the people at Ashland, the adult leaders and the older students. She comes home from rehearsals singing and dancing around the house. It is incredible that Ashland can provide kids with an activity where they can learn to express themselves through theater arts and be taught by amazing people. I have known many friends that have been involved with Ashland Productions and each has nothing but good things to say about the program. My friends in Ashland continue to go back show after show because they have found how beneficial it is for them and it also gives them a chance to be leaders for younger children.

Within the last two years we have implemented the Ashland Collaborative Theater (ACT) that allows us to go into the community schools and offer children a hands on experience with performing a jr musical on stage.  Ashland has received numerous accounts from teachers and parents of how childrens self esteem, attitude, excitement, and confidence (among other things) have improved after just one performance with Ashland.  Ashland is growing at a phenomenal rate, this is an exciting time for Ashland and the community.
Ashland Productions	31034	10	/users/profile/31966	jenmatt	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	I have known Ashland from its conception and it has been amazing watching it grow.  The organization is continuously looking for ways to get more children exposed to the arts that would not otherwise have the opportunity.  The quality of shows they out on is outstanding.  The variety of activities they provide is incredible: thetre camps, music lessons, dance lessons, opportunities to meet broadway performers and choreographers, bringing theatre to area schools and of course theatrical shows themselves.  My daughter attended their theatre camp and we had a wonderful experience-very inclusive and fun.  We all love Ashland.
Ashland Productions	30880	3	/users/profile/31821	v-t-s	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	Ashland not only teaches the skills and technique necessary for live, on-stage performance, but it teaches the intangibles that provide benefits for a lifetime.  I've seen insecure, shy, timid children progress through Ashland programming and become beautiful, self-assured swans who sing without reserve.  The staff of Ashland train and encourage participants to discover their potential, potential that they don't yet even realize exists!  They draw the hidden talents out of kids whether it be song, dance, lighting, organizing, choreographing, etc.  Each child is made to feel special and important as a team player.  Many children find their niche through Ashland and continue on in theater at their high schools.  Ashland has even been fertile training ground and the spring board for several stage performers who have gone on to perform on Broadway!  One of Ashland's primary goals is to keep class prices, performing fees and ticket pricing at a reasonable level so that all ages/income brackets in the community can be a part. Ashland has never let financial difficulty be a barrier to participation. Because of this, Ashland relies heavily on donations which are scarce in tough economic times.  This is one arts organization that makes its community a better place in which to live and is sincerely deserving of endorsement-
Ashland Productions	30684	4	/users/profile/31641	denise-h	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	My first experience with Ashland was when my daughter was is one of their shows. I quickly realized what a wonderful and nurturing organization it is.  What a fantastic oppertunitiy is being offered to these children and the community at large.  A chance to work with experienced adults who loved what they do and are willing to share that passion with children.  My daughter went on to perform with the Ashland youth group for many years, and it also was a wonderful experience. With all the mentoring provided and fantastic oppertunties afforded her by Ashland, she has developed a love for theater and music and is now majoring in both in College.  I so appretiate everything Ashland has done not only for my daughter, but all the children that continue to benefit from this exciting program, that I have continued to volunteer my time to this worthy project.
Ashland Productions	30539	4	/users/profile/31505	michellej	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	Ashland's ACT program is AMAZING!!! It gives young kids, who may never have the opportunity to get involved in theatre, the experience of a lifetime.  Our school doesn't have a theater, so their concerts and drama club perform on the alter of the church.  With the ACT Program, they work in a beautiful theater, with lights, sound, costumes, props, beautiful sets, professional directors, choreographers, and music directors.  And the kids are hooked!  It's an excellent program and the kids learn so much.  Not just about theatre, but you see their confidence level rise...they learn to work together as a team and to focus on something to create a great show! It's an awesome program that should be available to every child!
Ashland Productions	30382	5	/users/profile/31365	susan9	Volunteer	4	02/24/2010	Ashland Productions has done an amazing job to get youth involved with theater. They teach responsibility, organization and the overall love for singing, dancing and music. The production and directing crew are amazing with the kids and provide them with an incredible stage experience! They continue to find ways to bring the community in to share in the joy of live theater.
Ashland Productions	29896	5	/users/profile/30889	phlynn	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2010	Whether volunteering my time as a performer in a production, or working as a paid professional, I have always enjoyed my experiences with Ashland Productions.  The directors and professional staff are creative, hard working and professional in their dealings with everyone who participates in Ashland's projects.  In working with younger children, middle and high school performers, I liked that everyone is treated with kindness and respect. The mixed age productions are a wonderful vehicle for younger performers to work with adults in a fun and nurturing atmosphere.  AS I've observed young people who have gotten training and experience at Ashland, growth in performing skills and personal confidence are very evident benefitsof being a part of this fine theatre arts organization.  Parents are encouraged to be involved, so doing a show is a wonderful opportunity for families to work together, as well as introducing non-performers to the world of theatre.
Ashland Productions	29892	10	/users/profile/30883	heatherm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2010	I have performed with Ashland Productions as an adult professional, music directed for their shows, and taught many of their youth performers voice lessons.  I was involved with this company for about 6 years and then moved out of state.  I can appreciate even more now what a gem the Twin Cities has in Ashland Productions.  You would be hard pressed to find a theatre organization that cares more about its students, that welcomes new talent, and has a special ability to nurture abilities and encourage growth.  I am proud to have been a part of this company and really miss it.  I know the students that have come out of Ashland carry with them great confidence in themselves and a feeling of belonging.
Ashland Productions	29891	4	/users/profile/30882	joann2	Former Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	Ashland is a great organization run by professional, fun people.  They do amazing things with the kids.  My daughter has been involved with Ashland for over 2 years now and just can't get enought of it.  They do such great things.  They make learning new things fun and exciting for the kids and make the kids feel good about themselves.  We have recommended Ashland to many people and will continue to do so.
Ashland Productions	29635	4	/users/profile/30644	annie1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/21/2010	Ashland is a place to grow and nurture, learn and teach, receive and give.  I grew up performing with Ashland and now I teach kids through this company.  Year after year, I have seen kids flourish, teenagers learn what it means to be leaders, and adults serve for the pure joy of working with talented and fantastic youth.  Ashland isn't just a theater company, it's a place to belong.
Ashland Productions	29595	9	/users/profile/30606	jkmob	Volunteer	5	02/21/2010	Ashland Productions is an amazing organization run by amazing, caring, creative people. I don't know of anywhere else in the twin cities where children can get such a comprehensive, quality, performing experience. The quality of the productions is unbelievable and the life lessons that the kids learn will be with them into adulthood.
Ashland Productions	28216	4	/users/profile/29287	katy1	Volunteer	5	02/13/2010	I have had a wonderful experience with Ashland. I have always loved theater and wasn't surprised that my youngest daughter wanted to get involved too. My older girl was incredibly shy though and struggled with reading especially in front of people. After seeing her sister in a play at Ashland she decided to try out. I was worried it would be totally overwhelming for her but she had so much fun. She didn't even get into the first play she tried out for but emerged a different kid after callbacks. She sang and dancde the routines she learned and couldn't wait to see the show. She tried out later that year for another Ashland show and got a role. She ended up having a large part that required dozens of lines and she did great. What an amazing experience. It improved her reading and her overall confidence. We'll be back : )
Ashland Productions	27592	6	/users/profile/28673	debbie1	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	We found Ashland about two and half years ago when my family moved to Minnesota. My daughter was searching for some of the same experiences she had where we use to live.  She was involved with a singing/dancing group. When she moved here she was extremely upset to leave her family/friends that she had grown up with, until she found Ashland Productions. She attended summer camp and found a whole new, as she describes it, FAMILY.  She has found a new home at Ashland Productions. She has been able to be cast in professional quality productions, performed in both the Ashland Youth Performers (grades 1-8) and Ashland Performing Company (grades 9-12), counseling with the younger productions, assistant directing, sound, lights, and back stage.Her growth and confidence since joining Ashland Productions has been extremely immeasurable. She is truly happy here and wants to continue in some type of production manner after college.

Arts Midwest	32206	9	/users/profile/32993	wendy-mc	Client Served	5	03/01/2010	I had the pleasure of working with Arts Midwest on The Big Read 2009.  I serve as the public information officer for the Poughkeepsie Public Library District and it was my first experience with The Big Read so I definitely had a lot of questions and concerns.  I found that Christine, Birdie, Angharad and the entire Arts Midwest staff to be extremely helpful and responsive.  I was very impressed with how smoothly the initial Big Read Orientation event went, as there were close to 1,000 people in attendance, and it became obvious from the way we were greeted at the airport to the time we departed that a "well-oiled machine" was running the show.  Their obvious enthusiasm for promoting literature through community involvement is contagious, and there was never a question too obvious or a concern too small for them, they were a wonderful partner in what turned out to be an unforgettable experience for me and the community I serve.

I have been engaged in numerous ways-- and have been personally and professionally enriched at every intersection with both their programs and their staff.  Arts Midwest has given me industry connections that allowed a job transition across state lines (from Nebraska to Minnesota)to be much easier. I'm grateful for Arts Midwest and all it's programs and membership activities.
Arts Midwest	30538	8	/users/profile/31506	nyons	Board Member	5	02/24/2010	Arts Midwest provides many services to audiences, arts organizations and artists, through programs such as Arts Midwest World Fest, the Performing Arts Fund, the Midwest Arts Conference, The Big Read, the Arts Learning Exchange and many others.  Services vary among programs and may include providing educational support to teachers and students; supporting arts services organizational staff through professional development; providing opportunities for regional arts and artists to step beyond where they are today.  Most important is the collaborative leadership role taken by each member of the extraordinary staff at Arts Midwest in approaching their constituents, their work and new challenges. As Executive Director, David Fraher brings vision, creativity and compassion to his work and always thinks beyond...even when the next step is to confront the impact of today's economics on state arts agencies. "Beyond" keeps the focus on the new opportunities for the arts, artists and audiences. I have experienced Arts Midwest as an employee, a retiree, a volunteer and now, as a member of the board.

Arts Midwest	29990	5	/users/profile/30981	waygoodagent	Client Served	5	02/23/2010	I found out about Arts Midwest because of their annual conference. What a beautiful thing! - both the conference and my serendipitous discovery of it.   It seems like an oxymoron, but Arts Midwest has this arts conference thing down to a science. They are efficient and organized. They listen to feedback and adjust as (or if) appropriate. Being my first arts conference experience, they spoiled me. Subsequent conferences hosted by similar organizations have not met the benchmarks set by Arts Midwest in terms of organization, information sharing, caliber of participants, etc.   By their cooperation with and connection to both artists and presenters, I can only guess at the thousands of dollars saved by communities throughout their nine-state region. With Arts Midwest as the catalyst, fine and performing arts centers in communities large and small can bring the highest caliber of talent to their audiences. This is accomplished perhaps most immediately through the funding programs made available through AM. Also important, though less direct, are the educational workshops, seminars and round-table discussions at the conference. AM invests in career development for those willing souls who work at keeping the arts alive for the rest of the community. And then, by the showcases at the annual conference, they allow presenters to catch a 15-minute live audition by some amazingly talented artists which they might otherwise never get to see. Sure, they receive press kits all the time, and they might occasionally make a talent scouting trip to some other venue to assess one performer or performance. But the Midwest Arts Conference lets them scout dozens of performers in one extended trip.   These are just the obvious strengths of Arts Midwest's annual conference. I haven't even begun to mine the wealth of knowledge and cooperative spirit that I'm sure they bring to all their other programs. I'm sure that it takes a substantial budget to maintain the programs and to retain the knowledgeable staff. But when I think of how they help the community theaters and restored opera houses and other shoestring budget places bring world-class talent to their stages, I know that the world is getting a bargain in the Arts Midwest states. Please support Arts Midwest with whatever time, effort, funding or skill you can, because especially in times like these, "the show MUST go on."

But the way they explained their music and the instruments they played  was awesome to hear. The students that I  brought  to hear Mauvais Sort were quite disabled.. and the joy that these students got from listening to the music and the presentations  was  wonderful.Some students satill ask about them.

Arts Midwest	29081	6	/users/profile/30122	susan7	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	Arts Midwest is a well-run organization which provides valuable programming and support to presenters, artists and agents throughout the region. I have attended the Midwest Arts Conference nearly every September since 2004. The conference is an excellent opportunity for professional development, networking and connecting with artists and agents for future performances. Quad City Arts has received Performing Arts Fund grants from Arts Midwest for more than 10 years. This program helps us reach students of all ages and backgrounds through educational outreach performances by professional artists. We've also been a host site for the Midwest World Fest - an excellent opportunity to bring in international performing artists our rural and urban communities may otherwise never see. Arts Midwest staff is always friendly, knowledgable and energetic - we look forward to our continued partnerships in the future.

However, I quickly learned how so much of what Arts Midwest does has great impact on my life in many realms: as a student of the arts, an arts patron, and a future arts administrator. The Arts Midwest staff took me under their wings and provided me with a wealth of knowledge and support. They truly have one of the hardest working teams of any arts organization I have encountered, and showed me that through working hard, asking questions, and having a little fun, I can achieve my goals in Arts Administration. The programming and support they provide is so valuable and helps not only organizations, but individuals like myself, achieve their goals.

Specifically, Arts Midwest World Fest allows rural communities to participate in rich global arts experiences, experiences that would normally be far too costly for rural North Dakota to afford.  Arts Midwest is well recognized regionally, nationally and internationally for its work with global projects, specifically music and literature.  The NEA has repeatedly relied on Arts Midwest to manage national programs such as Shakespeare in America and The Big Read.The leadership of David Fraher and Susan Chandler is without equal.  Their partnership is outstanding and has resulted in an organization and staff that the entire region is proud of.

I have worked directly with David and the staff as a board member and am impressed with the ability of the organization to meet the challenges of numerous arts initiatives and manage them effectively. They have expanded ArtsMidwestWorldFest, which I initiated before turning it over to Arts Midwest.  It has become a model for cultural exchange that enables underserved Midwestern communities to interact with young, inspiring, international artists in student workshops and performances; community outreach activities; and public performances. Shakespeare in America and the Big Read, two superb national initiates of the NEA, are managed by Arts Midwest.  Other arts organizations would benefit from looking at Arts Midwest as a role model.
Daystar U.S.	320513		/users/profile/413152	elschefers	Donor	5	12/27/2016	We have Supported Students at Daystar University for the past 13 years and feel we are full filling a dream and creating a legacy of helping others through the future work of these Students we support.  My dream while working my way through college was to try to help others perhaps by joining the peace corps, but for many reasons it was not possible. When nearing retirement with Family financial obligations taken care I still wanted to do some good but decided I could do more good by working longer and giving more to well managed non profits. I retired in 2011   at age 71 my wife and I took a trip to Kenya to visit  Daystar and another non profit that we support to see what good our giving was doing. We Were extremely pleased at what we saw at Daystrar and everything Daystar US told us was correct in terms of Facilities, instructors and the culture of developing "servant leaders". The most important part for us was when we had a short visit with 8 of the students we had  supported who had recently graduated  and they sincerely thanked us for this opportunity only because of us. I confirmed that for me this is an excellent investment in that it fills a DREAM & LEGACY  of what I wanted to do, when I asked what they hoped to be doing in 10 years, and each one in some way wanted to help others by creating jobs or community building and while making a good living to also help others get the same chance they  received. You also  get very good value for your charitable dollar in that you can educate a student in Kenya, Africa for less  than 1/4 the cost of in the USA and more likely they will stay to help develop Africa as 80% who graduate do.

The vast majority of the graduates return to their home towns and follow God's call to help others and make a better Africa.  My husband and I participated in a trip to Kenya 11 years ago that included meeting alumni, faculty and staff in a variety of ministry roles, helping others learn skills to support themselves, working in orphanages & hospitals, living out their love for God.  With many opportunities for support, from scholarships to clean water projects, this is a very worthwhile organization to support.

Daystar U.S.	320106	1	/users/profile/412242	Writer	Donor	5	12/13/2016	I first learned about Daystar University in Nairobi.  After retirement, my wife and I were  volunteers for 3 years at two primary schools with American curriculum in East Africa.  During that time, we got to know and respect the work Daystar was doing.  When a Kenyan youth worker we knew wanted additional education,  we took her to Daystar admission office  and they gave extensive help in advising her how to qualify for admission.   later when the husband of the young receptionist at our school died, we sponsored her at Daystar.  She is now finishing her Masters Degree.  We now have another friend who is finishing a degree in business at Daystar.  We are now retired back in the states, but we have visited both the Athi River and the Nairobi campus several times and applaud Daystar's effort to prepare leaders for Africa's growing economy.

They model Christian servant leadership, strong ethics and expertise to government, business, teaching, medicine, and every walk of life.

We feel confident that Daystar is using our donations to help worthy students reach their full potential. We hope to be able to help more in the future. Making recurring monthly gifts makes it easy for us to budget our charitable giving to organizations whose mission we believe in. We're proud to be able to help support the mission of Daystar U.S.
Daystar U.S.	292584	8	/users/profile/383122	judijohnson	Donor	5	06/09/2016	My annual gift to this organization is specific to a nursing education scholarship fund under their foundation.  I know that the money goes for exactly that and nothing else.  I often get messages from the receipents.  Without scholarships many many of the students could not affor to be at a university.  Besides scholarship most also have part time jobs at the University, with exception of nursing students whose heavy academic programs plus clinical assignments make it impossible for them to work.  That is another reason why nursing scholarships are so needed!  I have visited Daystar in Nairobi for 2 months at a time and am very impressed with both the faculty and students.  They emphasis through out the academics the theme of "servant leadership" and stress Christian values such as ethical and truthful practice regardless of their chosen field post graduation from Daystar. 
Daystar U.S.	291919	9	/users/profile/382398	Mrsdkrebs	Donor	5	06/02/2016	I feel like I'm getting to know students and staff at both campuses of Daystar University through the videos,  photos,  and stories published on the website and social media.  The donations I make go to important work at this Christian college--where they are always working on a vision for a better future.  Right now,  the campaign is for development of a sustainable water program for one of the campuses. I feel like my donations are well-used. 
The Rapunzel Project	204388		/users/profile/266401	Kristan N.	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer (for the 2nd time) in March, she was having a very hard time seeing the positive in any of these ordeal, until she met with an amazing oncologist at the University of Colorado who introduced her to Penguin Cold Caps.   She lives in a very rural and remote area and within a week she had found out about the amazing group of people at The Rapunzel Project, they not only were able to donate a freezer to her small hospital but she will now be able to donate this freezer to future chemo patients who want to use this amazing system.  I could not think of a better group I would recommend, if I could find a way to volunteer my time and knowledge of the caps to people in my area I will jump at the chance.   GREAT ORGANIZATION!!!!!
The Rapunzel Project	201389		/users/profile/262870	Katonthemat	Client Served	5	05/30/2014	Spreading awareness through their hard work and generosity. These people helped my children by helping me save my hair. I cannot thank them enough. Spread the word!  CCT WORKS AND THE RAPUNZEL PROJECT ROCKS!!Thank You!!
The Rapunzel Project	47758	3	/users/profile/48513	calix43	Volunteer	5	07/05/2010	The Rapunzel Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping chemotherapy patients keep their hair during treatment.Mission:    Funds raised by The Rapunzel Project will be used for two related purposes: first, to create awareness that hair loss during chemotherapy can be prevented through the use of specialized cold caps, and second, to purchase specialized freezers, cold caps and related equipment to facilitate this process.
The Rapunzel Project	46191	4	/users/profile/47071	smeagheaolcom	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2010	This non-profit is run by highly qualified professionals and offers a great option for cancer patients.  Keeping our hair directly affects our sense of dignity and self esteem.  Cold caps should be available to all who want them.
The Rapunzel Project	42541	9	/users/profile/43243	igraham	Former Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	Organization dedicated to providing the newest technology available that allows chemo patients to keep their hair during and post therapy, education and raising public awareness. Non-invasive wholistic approach.  Highly recommend.
The Rapunzel Project	42303	9	/users/profile/42970	jonh	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2010	The Rapunzel Project is a great non-profit effort and shining example of how a difficult life challenge which is shared by many (the emotional/physical strain of battling cancer) can be turned into something beautiful.  A phenomenal organization has blossomed from the determination of a few individuals not to allow an illness to dictate how they look and feel.  Ask anyone in those shoes how important it is to feel good about yourself, at the time when your body is at its weakest... then you will know the importance of The Rapunzel Project.  To all involved and all who benefit... keep it going.  Great job.
The Rapunzel Project	42276	8	/users/profile/42997	kate13	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2010	As a friend to a patient who had twice gone through chemo, her attitude and dignity was much better when she went through chemo the second time when she used the cold cap service. She felt "normal" during her chemo treatment period because when she left the hospital she still had her hair. She was not questioned about her illness from strangers as she attended her kids' public events and just did everyday activities. Her dignity was intact.
The Rapunzel Project	42164	10	/users/profile/42896	kerrykrepps	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2010	Having cancer takes away so much control from the individual. It seems that the path of your life is determined by medical professionals and the medicine they prescribe. How wonderful it is to take back the control over whether or not you lose your hair at a time when so much strength, courage and effort is required. I was delighted to see it work for the mother of a friend at work as she conquered her battle with cancer. I hope it becomes de rigueur at every hospital that treats cancer.
The Rapunzel Project	41863	9	/users/profile/42653	marc5	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2010	I am an entertainment industry professional living in NYC. As a passion, I work with various non-profit organizations including the prestigious Byrd Hoffman Watermill Foundation.  I am currently also working closely with the Open Space Alliance of North Brooklyn to form a community outreach for the youth in my neighborhood. In the past i have worked with many other non-profit organizations. On a personal note I have lost 2 very close loved ones to breast cancer and am also acquainted with many survivors.I am thrilled by the work Shirley and Nancy are doing with the Rapunzel Project.  I can think of a more suitable non-profit organization deserving of the GREAT label!!Be well!Marc Scrivo
The Rapunzel Project	41827	6	/users/profile/42621	higgins1	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	This is an amazing non-profit organization. It gives women the confidence and keeps their spirits high while they are going through the chemotherapy. The ability to keep your hair during this process, give women the hope and courage to stay positive, which is extremely important when faced with such an awful disease.
The Rapunzel Project	41712	9	/users/profile/42502	cbv6	General Member of the Public	5	05/29/2010	When I was diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago, I researched every treatment, every option and chose the set of treatments that best fit my situation. It is wonderful to learn that developments and treatment breakthroughs are STILL happening. I can only imagine the empowerment felt by those who have successfully used the caps, kept their hair and triumphed at a time when their life is so challenged. I applaud the Rapunzel Project and look forward to watching their work flourish in the future.
The Rapunzel Project	41247	8	/users/profile/42105	sgraiziger	General Member of the Public	5	05/27/2010	Seeing first hand the fear and frustration many women face fighting cancer, I'm thrilled to see the Rapunzel project which helps women keep their hair and their dignity, is gaining momentum.  Cancer is a vicious contender; these women need all their strength and composure to fight it.  Thank you to those working so hard to build Repunzle Project, it will help so many.
The Rapunzel Project	41178	6	/users/profile/42052	anne-r	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	This group is so important--how many women delay treatement or do not undergo treatment based on losing their hair? Please support them and push for awareness!
The Rapunzel Project	41045	9	/users/profile/41946	olddoctorbob	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/27/2010	As the spouse of a breast cancer woman survivor/thriver, I can assure you that it is extremely important to hear the concerns of woman facing the loss of hair. As a physician, it is critical to hear their voice. Rapunzel can help with the message!
The Rapunzel Project	41038	9	/users/profile/41939	kiki2	General Member of the Public	4	05/27/2010	This is a fabulous project.  I ultimately chose not to use the caps, and am now kicking myself.  I completely plan to volunteer for them after I am done with my treatments.  This is such a great cause.  Your looks are so important to your recovery attitude, and this is a fabulous way to help all cancer patients go through chemo with more ease.
The Rapunzel Project	41029	7	/users/profile/41928	alumate	General Member of the Public	5	05/27/2010	Fabulous nonprofit.  What could be better than an organization that supplies cold caps to help women going thru chemo keep their hair!!!  Happy to support the cause!
Designwise Medical Incorporated	46230	7	/users/profile/47104	margit-j-lund	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2010	I worked in Diagnostics and managed the Radiology Department at Children's Hospital in Mpls. and St. Paul. I have felt the frustration of working with pediatrics and knowing that the device we needed was out there but not developed for the pediatric patient, for adults only. Mr. Slaker had the vision to understand that through a non profit organization these devices/products could be created for children and it would be a win for the producer/manufacturer, but most importantly for our children, our future. He and his Board are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of children and their families!
Designwise Medical Incorporated	46122	7	/users/profile/46999	jennifer53	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2010	DesignWise Medical came to the University where our students were able to work with Brad Slaker to design a vein transillumination device for the pediatric market. It was a fantastic project. The students gained experience working with a project that can make a difference in the world. Our students also gained experience working with a client. Its wonderful to see a company dedicated to the medical pediatric marketplace.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	46069	6	/users/profile/46958	alanrkahn	Volunteer	5	06/28/2010	I have been directly involved in the management of research and product development in the biomedical engineering industry for more than 50 years and have had the opportunity to directly invent and patent several products as well. In recent years, the environment for innovation has been compromised. DesignWise provides an opportunity for significant improvement in the process of development of new products. For example:In the early years, entrepreneurs have had incentives to work in research and development in primary corporations such as Medtronic. The development of new products depend on their efforts and support. However, in recent years, these corporations have begun to outsource new product development to the acquisition of small startup companies who must find outside sources of funds and technical guidance.In the early years, medical engineering opportunities were sought after by innovative students because of the developing field and the creative possibilities. However, in recent years, engineering has become less attractive to American students and possibilities for making a difference are not apparent to candidates.  Largely as a result of these factors, the success of innovative entrepreneurial ventures in biomedical engineering has become limited and a majority of such ventures do not succeed.DesignWise has answers to again generating the creativity and innovation to provide new biomedical products for underdeveloped markets such as pediatrics. The relevant features of this new program are:In the face of today's economy, the DesignWise strategy makes it possible to invest a very small amount of money in order to initiate a project. The direct involvement of biomedical engineering students in the design and testing has been generating a great deal of effort and creativity by students on the teams. The enthusiasm of University faculty has facilitated the opportunity to perform well supervised clinical studies at no charge to the DesignWise projects. This would otherwise typically be one of the most costly parts of the development project.  The DesignWise projects are able to move to the point where a product prototype has been constructed and clinically tested at very little cost, leaving further investments for product development at a relatively low risk.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45920	7	/users/profile/46787	jodiraus	Board Member	5	06/26/2010	DesignWise Medical was founded on the sole guiding principle of addressing an unmet need: that need is designing and developing medical devices for the pediatric patient. The "for profit" medical device industry shies away from this segment of the patient population because 1) it is small and the ROI will not be realized and 2)it is risky.Brad Slaker has successfully built relationships with the medical professionals who treat these patients; medical device/legal/financial professionals who eagerly volunteer their time; and most importantly academia: both the professor/instructors/advisors as well as the students who make the devices a reality.  The students are getting real-world medical device design experience that cannot be taught in the classroom. Brad has personally financed this nonprofit organization. DWM has now reached a critical juncture where additional funding is necessary or we will not be able to help these children. If we don't, who will?
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45657	6	/users/profile/46537	janinej	Volunteer	5	06/25/2010	I've been very impressed with the special focus Brad and his volunteer teams have ensuring parents have a critical role as adviser at every stage of development for medical device projects for children. DesignWise Medical is truly an organization that meets the 'customer' need with innovation AND fine-tuned attention on the needed solution.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45628	5	/users/profile/46514	al3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/25/2010	In our world of Neonatology, there is a common saying of little people equals little funds. Brad and his team have seen beyond these limitations and have worked diligently to create opportunities to bring much needed technology to underfunded/underserved  populations such as the babies I work with daily in the neonatal intensive care unit. His creative utilization of local universities not only gives back to the education of multiple students but also allows his projects to reach goals and results far beyond expected for his small budgets. He is a high achiever and creative thinker. His non-profit company gets my highest praise!
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45569	5	/users/profile/46453	brian15	Former staff	5	06/24/2010	Brad Slaker, founder of Designwise Medical Incorporated, was my advisor for the capstone course in mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He was always in close relation to the medical staff at the children's hospital and had a determination to make life better for the patients there. I was always impressed with his friendly demeanor and the passion for the work he was doing. He took our design group to visit the medical staff that we would be working with and the patients that we would be working for, and I cannot stress enough the importance of that appointment and the relationships Designwise Medial makes with its customers. I think every company should be run with the same ambitions and goals as Designwise Medical Incorporated.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45533	5	/users/profile/46421	almjessica	Volunteer	5	06/24/2010	I got to work with DesignWise Medical for my senior design project and I am so lucky I got to have that experience.  DesignWise Medical works to create medical devices that are needed for the unmet pediatric market.  The best part about doing my senior design project was that I not only got to experience how to design a medical device, but I got to meet with physicians, was taught how to focus on creating a product that was right for the customer, and learned so much about the entire path a medical device takes before it is marketed.  And beyond guiding our design process, DesignWise Medical also provided mentorship to me and my group members.  Anyone who has the opportunity to work with DesignWise Medical should take full advantage of it, as you will have the opportunity to truly affect some child's life.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45530	5	/users/profile/46420	jolson1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/24/2010	I've worked with Brad and DesignWise for over a year.  As a professional within pediatric healthcare, I know first-hand how medical device innovations, and the timely adaptation of those innovations, are critical to improving the health of the children and families we serve.  DesignWise represents the collaborative, innovative approach that healthcare needs now and in the future.  Brad Slaker is a capable, engaged leader who integrates well with clinicians, scholars, professionals and healthcare organizations to drive new concepts from inception through implementation.  The DesignWise projects / involvement with Children's over the last year have been professional and effective.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45524	6	/users/profile/46412	houa78	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/24/2010	Working in a pediatric diabetes clinic we often see children and families frustrated with the lack of pediatric specific devices to help their child.  DesignWise understands this constant frustration and gap in management of diabetes.  They have been able to come in, listen to our suggestions, and start development of potential useful child friendly diabetes devices.  With little more than self-motivation and passion for what they do, DesignWise has proven a non-profit organization can succeed in developing complicated, much needed pediatric medical devices other companies have steered away from.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	45521	7	/users/profile/46410	mark21	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/24/2010	I am a physician-researcher at Children's- St Paul and the U of MN. Brad Slaker approached me and my team to ask if they could help in design of a product for babies that we though was important, but might not generate the interest from a larger company due to the small neonatal market. In partnership with student at the U of MN, Brad worked with us to create a system for monitoring and adjusting oxygen therapy- a potentially very valuable adjunct to the care of sick babies. This is a fantastic organization, managed creatively, with Brad's vision for a nonprofit engineering design firm unique in my experience.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	44738	9	/users/profile/45653	pnorbom	General Member of the Public	0	06/21/2010	I support DesignWise Medical's mission of developing medical devices for the pediatric market.  Most medical device companies do not focus on this segment of the market because the market opportunity is significantly lower than the adult market.  Thank you DesignWise for providing medical devices for our children!
Designwise Medical Incorporated	44466	9	/users/profile/45352	steve26	Volunteer	5	06/18/2010	Brad is a man on a mission - a mission to help children, families and care providers with solutions in the arena of pediatric care and solutions.  He is one of the most incredible people I know and it's an honor to be his friend and supporter.  Brad has a heart of gold and is truly working to make a difference in the world.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	44302	10	/users/profile/45217	david36	Volunteer	5	06/17/2010	This experience gave me a taste of the other side of biomedical engineering.  I learned skills on the fly and interacted with different vendors to test new materials.  Our team managed to devise creative solutions to problems as they arose.  I am excited to see how Designwise Medical grows and contributes to pediatric health care while interacting with organizations in the twin cities community.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	44027	10	/users/profile/44947	datacat1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/15/2010	I was recently asked to help do some research for devise, the team at Designwise Medical is creating. Working with the team of engineering students, biomedical people, doctors, and nurses, and seeing their creativity, care and commitment is inspiring. Designwise Medical is changing the lives of children needing all types of medical care - from those living with asthma or diabetes, to the child in intensive care.
Designwise Medical Incorporated	43906	9	/users/profile/44809	rehuneke	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/14/2010	As a pediatric IV nurse, there is nothing more frustrating than not being successful with an IV insertion.  The product designed with DesignWise Medical was a creative and innovative method of identifying vascular structures for the young patients that I serve. The team work, energy and collaboration between the University of St. Thomas engineering department, Children's Hospitals & Clinics of MN and DesignWise Medical was very respectful and wanting to advocate to do more for pediatrics in making a painful procedure as stressless as possible.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	108409		/users/profile/92555	Jim N	Volunteer	5	03/28/2012	The value of CNC is evident by the continual progress they make in improving environmental education for K-12 students, as well as habitat restoration and preservation.  Programs are offered virtually every week and the Center stays open almost every day of the year.  Thanks to the generous 2011 donation of 3M and other significant donors, CNC completed an outdoor pavilion that enhances the center's ability to teach in all types of weather, and adds a revenue stream from pavilion rental.  Most significantly, I feel, is the quality and capability of their naturalists who reach thousands of students every year with superb environmental education and naturalist programs.  CNC is a first-rate facility.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83527		/users/profile/92555	Jim N	Donor	5	03/28/2011	Thanks to hundreds of volunteers and a small, dedicated professional staff, CNC gives more "non-profit bang for the buck" than any other charity I know.  It's a well-managed organization with enthusiastic, skilled naturalists. Their K-12 environmental education/natural science classes are filled with classes from area schools, and the center coordinates their curriculum with Minnesota and Wisconsin state education requirements.  The public programs serve the needs of their community, and their apple orchard is eco-friendly.   All in all they do a terrific job in providing children with a quality natural science education. Local charity; 100% privately supported.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	84575		/users/profile/93826	splankis	Volunteer	5	03/31/2011	The expanse of land and the views from Carpenter Nature Center make it one my favorite places to be. This preservation of land is one of the most important aspects of Carpenter. Then the commitment to nature and outdoor education is another of Carpenter's strengths. They do it so well addressing the needs of young and old,  as well as those of limited abilities. As well, the orchard, the bees and the maple syruping are excellent demonstrations of how we are connected to the land. Lastly, the staff make volunteers feel very welcome.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	84433		/users/profile/93664	Tammy	Volunteer	5	03/31/2011	I have been a Friend of Carpenter Nature Center and volunteer for over 5 years.  I love the story of Carpenter.  How Thomas and Edna Capenter wanted to have a place for children and adults to come and be close to nature.  This is a peaceful place to walk the trails, visit the apple shack,  or attend one of the many great events they have during the year.  The staff are so dedicated to the programs that CNC offers and the many volunteers who both put in countless hours to keep it all going.  This is a  wonderul place to experience and learn about the natual world around us.  CNC has truly enriched my life.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	84163		/users/profile/93311	Couple	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	We have been associated with Carpenter Nature Center as volunteersI for over 25 years.  Our experiences have always been positive.  We have learned a great deal about nature, the environment and banding of birds in this period of tme. It is a joy to see children come and get exicited about birds, reptiles and amphibians.  It is particularly satisfying to see the public schools in the area bring the children to the Nature Center for classes in the out of doors.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83993		/users/profile/93105	Larrys	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I've been volunteering at Carpenter Nature Center for several years as a bird bander. A wonderful opportunity to learn more about birds. Their emphasis on environmental education for children is important since so many kids don't get much exposure to the out of doors. 
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83937		/users/profile/93041	Kay D	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I have volunteered for the past 2 summers as a Greeter at Carpenter Nature Center. I have enjoyed getting to know the very dedicated staff and many of the volunteeers. The trails are scenic and I firmly believe that no one leaves Carpenter Nature Center in a bad mood. Stress seems to evaporate within minutes.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83885		/users/profile/92981	Donna D.	Volunteer	4	03/29/2011	My family and I find great value from being in nature.  Carpenter Nature Center is place where we can enjoy the beauty, renew our energy, marvel at the natural systems, and learn so much about ourselves and our environment. Carpenter has taught us about sustainable practices and environmental stewardship.  Their apple orchard is an excellent example of a pest management system that doesnt require loads of chemicals.  In a time when its so easy to bring out the can of bug killer, we can all use a reminder that there are simpler, more environmentally sound ways to deal with what ails us.   Im happy to volunteer my time to build a place where my childrens children can go to learn these valuable environmental lessons.   If you value the environment, please join me in volunteering.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83806		/users/profile/92887	feather quest	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	As a retired high school biology teacher and an active birder I was drawn to Carpenter Nature Center when the director offered an instruction class for anyone interested in banding birds. That was 20 years ago. i have benefited and contributed to this wonderful nature center whose mission is dedicated to increasing adult's and children's knowledge about the natural world and its vulnerability each week for those years. The dedication of the staff and the volunteers they have recruited are doing a spectacular job in very meaningful ways to bring about behavior changes to enhance such difficult concepts as sustainability. 
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83722		/users/profile/92788	Afton Runner	Donor	5	03/29/2011	A friend recommended Carpenter Nature Center and now I just keep going back.  The Carpenter Nature Center provides a place of connecting, enjoying and discovery. The staff is incredibly dedicated, knowledgeable and committed to helping people enjoy and learn about nature. It is such a great place that I am willing to donate time and money to make it possible for others to learn and enjoy.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83651		/users/profile/92696	Bluebird	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	One of the most wonderful sounds I hear while working at Carpenter Nature Center is the sound of excited children's voices, from pre-school up to high school, as they enter the CNC Visitor Center and see, possibly for the first time, live MN amphibians, reptiles, and raptors.  Beautiful life-like displays of MN mammals in the presentation area also hold the interest of everyone.  Their questions and comments as they watch the live presentation, and their attentive faces indicate that this is science and environmental education at its best.  Add that to the diverse wild habitats, Mississippi River, and trails surrounding the nature center for hiking and viewing animals in the field, and you have an outstanding nature center. 
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83647		/users/profile/92691	LMHedin	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	Carpenter Nature Center is a terrific outdoor education organization.  It's facilities are a jewel on the St. Croix River and will long serve as an accessible green space.  I love the focus on getting kids outdoors in all weather - preschool storytimes always include an outdoor element.  We have learned to snowshoe, tap a tree for maple syrup, the life cycle of a butterfly, and so much more.  
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83594		/users/profile/92632	belinda	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	I first became acquainted with CNC as a St. Paul Schools teacher. Our science specialist arranged a 4th-grade field trip there around winter studies. The educational experience was excellent, and as an outdoor enthusiast, I was very impressed with the recreational, as well as educational potential that CNC offers to all ages. Subsequently, my husband and I visited Carpenter for purposes of our own, hiking, snowshoeing, birding, and wildlife-watching.After I retired, birding figured even more importantly in my life. I volunteered in the clinic at the Raptor Center on the U's St. Paul campus, where I made the acquaintance of Jen Vieth, who was on staff there.  With her vast ornithological knowledge and devotion to education and the environment, she quickly became a personal birding mentor and partner. When she joined the staff of CNC, I developed a permanent connection to Carpenter. Taking advantage of my training at TRC, I now help care for Carpenter's four raptors, as well as the wonderful variety of other animals that are part of the education program.  Being there on bird-banding days also adds  to my education and enjoyment.Most of all I have seen first-hand what a strong, all-around education program Carpenter has developed, particularly for young children, who were the focus of my professional years.  Both content and delivery are  high-quality. I've enjoyed assisting with small field-trip groups in lessons around concepts familiar from my years in a science magnet.Also impressive is the Carpenter commitment to green practices--conserving energy,  recycling, composting, highway clean-up, etc. They try to practice what they preach.Finally, the staff is unerringly kind and respectful in dealing with everyone. They're patient and cheerful in training volunteers, and always address requests and suggestions. I'm proud to support them with both money and time.  
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83572		/users/profile/92607	naturalista	Donor	5	03/28/2011	The Carpenter Nature Center is perhaps the finest nature center I have spent time exploring.  As a Minnesota Master Naturalist I have had opportunities to visit many.  The location, programs, volunteer activities, bird banding, trails, newletter and events are all worthwhile.  Like some of its larger cousins; namely, Nature Conservency, it has done a wonderful job of acquiring and restoring habitat in an important flyway for migratory birds.  Though I live in New Mexico now, I still visit as often as I can and remain a donor.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83561		/users/profile/92594	Don Kern	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	I have been visiting the center for over 20 years. Over this period of time I have had two children that have visited and grown up as a part of the center and its natural programing heritage. Not only my own children but thousands more children and many good people of our local communities have got involved, learned a little and have become better stewards of the lands we inhabit that go well beyond the borders of the Carpenter Nature Center. This place, its staff, the volunteers have become a second family to me in many ways.
Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center	83528		/users/profile/92556	tschroer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/28/2011	Carpenter St. Croix Valley Nature Center has much to offer!  The center is a wonderful place to visit as a family or individual just to take in the great trails and spend some time in the outdoors.  As an educator or Mom of little ones they have fantastic onsite education programs for youth of all ages.  They also offer great events for adults such as their Owl weekend they hold in March for the public to come and learn about Birds of Prey or the raptor release they do with the Raptor Center.  Don't forget the opportunity to snow shoe in the winter!  I understand they grow some amazing apples although I have not been fortunate enough to experience this aspect yet!
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	159197		/users/profile/211317	sbee	Client Served	5	05/31/2013	My daughter is a student here currently and absolutely loves it. The teachers are wonderful, it a welcoming and warm place. Every one seems to be very supportive of each other with none of the competitive nonsense I have seen with other dance schools. It's just such a unique place and the dancers are all very well trained. We love it and plan on continuing here for many years.

I know several dancers and it is a little village.  This is the place you want YOUR child to experience any type of creative movement.

I have always felt welcome and a part of something larger. OOAL puts on shows with auditions open to the public. That means anyone, regardless of experience, is welcome. 
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	120568		/users/profile/163981	cpalmermn	Client Served	5	08/13/2012	My daughter has been a student at OOAL for a number of years now, and may very well be on to a career in dance.  Limb is her 2nd home.   The environment there is incredibly positive and student-focused.   They put the students' personal growth first, pure and simple.   No politics (that I see or hear), no drama, just a group of people that really care about the kids.   Along with their classes, they offer great performance opportunities throughout the year.   OOAL is not just a business or studio, its a "cause" that everyone enjoys being part of!  
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	119492		/users/profile/162478	CJOY	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2012	First of all, I have been dancing with Out on a Limb for about 10 years now and I would never want to change that. OOAL is not only a place where I can be myself and express who I am, it is also a home and the people there are my family. The teachers at OOAL are teaching me something that I love, and they have made it possible for me to follow my passion where I would not be able to anywhere else. The support and love I have been given from the students, teachers, (and company members), is remarkable. This company will forever be part of my life and forever be in my heart. 
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	108771		/users/profile/148049	Marcey M.	Board Member	5	04/02/2012	Out on a Limb Dance Company  and School is an organization that serves the community on many different levels.  One of the most amazing experiences as one of the founders and Board vice president of Out on a Limb, is raising the money to bring in thousands of school children to come and see our shows for free.  It is an experience that drops me to my knees year after year.  Seeing a full auditorium of children so delighted to see a show that is put on for them is life-changing.   In my heart I also know that it is life-changing for them as well. I also feel it is a life-changing experience for those that come dance with us.  We are inclusive. There are so many great things that Out on a Limb Dance Company and School offers its dancers, teachers and audiences.  It is all done out of the love in our hearts by wanting to bring a positive, fun, artistic outlet to those involved in the company and school, and to those that come see our shows.  If you want to dance, come dance with us.

From its scholarships to public student performances to accepting students of all abilities, OOAL inspires everyone to open themselves up to the beauty of dance.  OOAL is so much more than a dance studio; it is a creative, inspirational community of staff and students who support each other's growth as dancers and people.  My daughter has been dancing there for four years and it has honestly changed her life; she now attends a high school for performing artists.  We are SO lucky to have found OOAL!

We came on the recommendation of an old friend and we are not only thrilled with the quality of the program, we are PROUD to have the privilege of working with Kim, Amber, Sarah, Allie and all of the others great people at OOAL.  The high quality, low pressure, anti-hootchie-mama environment was just what we were looking for--and that was just the beginning.

Their mission and, more importantly, their execution to bring dance to everyone regardless of age, ability or social status is very impressive. The love and support they offer their students would best be described as a family type atmosphere. Everyone, student and faculty alike, encourages creativity, acceptance, and cooperation. I appreciate everything they have done for my son and believe OoaL has been a major influence in him becoming the thoughtful man he is today.

We fell into this studio because of it's location initially.  But knowing what I know now about other dance studios, I feel like we won the dance studio lottery!  This is such a nurturing environment bringing joy to movement for any and all.   I cannot say enough about the staff and their approach.  I love how the kids encourage each other and it's non-competitive.  I've never seen an age inappropriate costume on a child there.  
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	107174		/users/profile/145096	Margo L.	Client Served	5	02/27/2012	Where do I begin?  After 3 different dance studios, I didn't even know what I was looking for, until Out On A Limb fell in our lap.  The healthy environment is created from the top down.  Our family values mesh beautifully with this entire studio.  I have a 7th grade daughter and for 5 years she has always come home happy from dance.  As a result, their shows beam with pride and a love for dance.  Outstanding life lessons are being taught and I'm incredibly grateful that she is so appreciated by her instructors and fellow dancers.  What a blessing.
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	107082		/users/profile/144940	Elora	Client Served	5	02/25/2012	I was a student of Amber Keeley's at another dance studio when I was very young, and when she left with a group of dancers and teachers to begin Out on a Limb, I was heartbroken. I followed them to a little studio on Como Avenue and found myself in a beautiful, loving, supportive environment where dance is not a competition, but an art, and an individual process. Since then, they have moved into a beautiful space on Larpenteur, and every year they perform for thousands of schoolchildren, exposing the world to dance in ways that I have always admired. Out on a Limb, if I could describe it in one word-- the experience, the company, the growth that I have received as a person and a dancer-- is family. They are a lovely group of people and I am blessed to have known them.

So I bid. That was 6 years ago. My daughter always wants to do her best and succeed. At Out on a Limb she can do that without the pressure of competition. The students are like a family.  They work together to assist each other to be their best. They encourage each other. She has learned so much. She has poise, confidence and grace that goes into her daily life.
Out on a Limb Dance Company & School	107044	1	/users/profile/144884	Gretchen G.	Volunteer	5	02/24/2012	I found out about Out on a Limb Dance Company from a former student of mine at the U of M. She had mentioned that she was a dancer, and I bemoaned the fact that I could not find a dance school that didn't overemphasize competition and/or the more egregious beauty pageant aspects of dance. My older daughter had been at two studios already and really just wanted to learn to dance, not simply learn ONE specific dance for a specific show and then spend hundreds of dollars on costumes and shoes for the occasion. Out on a Limb focuses on dance skills and dance performance as cooperation, not as competition. The instructors offer instruction to all the students wherever they are in their dance process, with whatever bodies they have for dancing (and stage acrobatics!) It is a healthy and nurturing environment for dancers. Both of my daughters dance there, both in weekly classes, as well as the more public ballet the school mounts every spring (Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, March 1,2,3, 2012. Don't miss it!) I have been privileged enough to be able to offer my skills in costume design and production for a few shows, and it has been very rewarding for me as well as my children. This dance school is such an asset to our community!
Feed My Starving Children	308152	3	/users/profile/399538	grhombe	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	This Charity is terrific on funds.  If you go to their website:https://www.fmsc.org/about-us/financial-accountabilityYou can see that 90% of donations are turned into food.  5% is overhead and 5% is 'fund raising'.  So any indication that questions their financials, as a professional Equity Research Analyst, I would say just is not substantiated by their annual report.  They spent $2.5m last year on administrative and $2.5m on 'fund raising' and $45 of the $50m they raised on food for starving kids.The other comment about it being a faith based organization is completely true. https://www.fmsc.org/about-us/our-missionTheir Mission Statement says they are a Christian Non-Profit organization in the first sentence.

Feed My Starving Children	106118	2	/users/profile/142828	waterprincess007	Volunteer	5	02/07/2012	FMSC is an excellent way to get young people involved with volunteer work.  Often its difficult to find a way to help a worthy cause - like feeding starving people in an organized, low committment manner.  FMSC allows you to donate 2 hours of your time when you can work this into your schedule and when they have an available slot, and the work is fun, easy and the instruction is clear and inspiring.  This opportunity is great for scout groups or families who want to contribute to a good cause without necessarilty spending any money.  You can volunteer with friends and consider it a play date that reaches across borders and grips the hands of others who are in desperate need.  My daughter and I volunteer frequently.

From the moment that you walk in the door as a volunteer you are whisked up into an efficient, well-oiled machine, leaving an hour or two later with confidence that your time and donation dollars have been very well spent.

It's great to have an organization that involves children in helping other children... My kids have learned that not everyone is as fortunate as we are here in the U.S., and that is a gift!  Their mission is clear, their operations are run like a tight ship, and they are helping so many children around the world get the nutrition they need!   God bless Mark Crea and all the other employees at FMSC who make feeding starving children their life's work!

Feed My Starving Children	91781	7	/users/profile/105101	WhatsNonAboutNonProfit	Volunteer	2	06/22/2011	Something didn't feel right abou this organization when I volunteered. They had enough people to work there so there was limited one hour volunteer meetings on certain nights that were aimed towards fundraising and there's all of these promotional items for sale as well. I didn't like their numbers regarding the numbers disclosed to the public. Anyone who has experiencce reading corporate numbers would probably agree. Their focus appears to me to be raising money instead of getting other assistance.

FMSC tells the story of global hunger in a simple way that even young kids can understand and relate to - but in a way that makes a powerful impression.    In just two hours, in our group of 65 people, we packed enough meals to EACH PERSONALLY feed one child for one year.   Now that made you feel like you made an impact in someone's life....and it was fun and just a short little bleep of time to give.

It is a great place to take your family to learn about the real world issue of hunger and a great place to help do something about it.  My family and I support FMSC because we have had an opportunity to see the entire process from start to finish.  We have packed food with friends and family on several occasions here in Minnesota and we have seen the food provided to hungry children and families when we travel to Haiti.  FMSC does a great job of making sure that the money provided is used to buy food.  They spend very little on overhead.
Feed My Starving Children	81179	1	/users/profile/88755	mtippery	Volunteer	5	03/04/2011	Many people don't become involve in charities because they don't feel they can make an individual difference in some of the world's greatest problems. FMSC creates the environment, provides the information and most importantly demonstrates results that even giving a little can make a life or death difference to a child in the world. My packing experience was one of the most rewarding and meaningful experiences I have had, and it was fun. FMSC relies totally on volunteers to pack the food for children around the globe and as a result controls overhead and administrative costs effectively. They have had a huge impact on children that otherwise would have perished and not had the chance to live and thrive and change this world for the better. I have been fortunate to have been given the opportunity to volunteer to speak to schools, churches and organizations on behalf of Feed My Starving Children and I am proud of my association with the organization. Not only does it change children's lives across the globe, it enriches the lives of those who donate their time, resources and money to the organization.

Feed My Starving Children	81106	4	/users/profile/88662	Claire Hassel	Volunteer	4	03/03/2011	This is a great opportunity to volunteer with a group or as an individual. As you see the results of your efforts pile up and get packaged for shipping, you know that hungry children all over the world will be eating nutritious meals because of the work you did.  As a donor, too, I am glad to know that so much of my gift directly benefits the children, as their operating costs are quite conservative. Even a small donation can make a big difference in the lives of the hungry children who are fed through this organization.

We have volunteered and it was a lot of fun (not to mention the great impact). Right after the earthquake in Haiti the "camp" where I was staying with the orphanage of 120 kids was also handing out FMSC through Convoy of Hope and there was order and a lot of hungry people who were very happy to have the nutrition they needed! Now that my girls are home in the U.S. we are looking forward to volunteering so they can help prepare the meals that they used to receive! God is good!

While I'm not physically located near any of their packaging sites in the US, I hear it is one of the most rewarding, short-term volunteer experiences one can have.  That they are able to commit 94% of all donations to direct support of the food program is amazing!  Their online platform for giving is seamless, and their balance of sharing information and asking for more is among the best I've experienced (don't feel overwhelmed by more and more asks for money).

You cannot do much more good then to feed people who are dying of starvation.The meals are packaged in centers in the US, and sent all over the world.  The meals are engineered to provide essential nutritional needs.  Look at the stories on their site..You can go down solo, or bring a group.  A little time can make a big difference.The centers are very well managed, and informative.  The staff is very knoweledgeable and accommodating. They even tally up the numbers from your group so you can see how many children you have fed with the meals you packaged.A very rewarding experience.
A Single Drop	42551	11	/users/profile/43003	clay2	Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	I stumbled across ASD two years ago while looking for video production work, but after reading their mission statement I knew I couldn't NOT volunteer.  They were looking for someone to edit together some promotional videos from existing footage, so I contacted them and offered my services, and immediately heard back from Gemma Bulos.Gemma quickly arranged to have a couple dozen DV tapes shipped to me, and while I digitized and indexed the footage she sent, I realized that the job ASD does is even more important than their mission statement lets on.  As such, I continued to offer my services as needed, and try to help out in whatever way I can, because this is a project that MUST move forward and continue to do what it does.In comparing what other 'clean water initiatives' are doing, and the methods they're using, this simple, grass roots, locally sustainable project is bound to have even more of an impact in the long run.
A Single Drop	42519	10	/users/profile/43219	microbehunter	Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	It is unacceptable that billions of cases of diarrhea and millions of deaths occur each year in developing countries because of the lack of safe water and sanitation. For over a century weve known that safe drinking water could solve this problem. This is the focus of A Single Drops work.          ASD has developed a comprehensive training program that includes microbiology testing with a Portable Microbiology Laboratory, options to make contaminated water safe to drink, and instruction in basic sanitation. The women attending these workshops return to their communities to share their knowledge and initiate water projects with initial funding and follow-up support from ASD.            ASD accomplishes this on a shoe-string budget. Im pleased to support ASD as a volunteer trainer and as a donor.
A Single Drop	42407	11	/users/profile/43123	clarehealing	Donor	5	06/01/2010	A Single Drop was pioneered by a single woman who realized the power of One.  She was unafraid to be that one who went into a number of different countries in Africa and her own country of origin, the Philippines, to address a problem no one had successfully addressed, the need for clean water, water that would stop transmitting water-borne diseases to three to five million people and the need to give l.2 billion people worldwide access to water.  Just 24 hours without water and a number of us felt the effects of being deprived of water; we were at a retreat and the house we were staying at had a well, but because we had not been careful enough about conserving water, the well had dried up.  We were lucky, we could go out and buy bottled water until the well refilled, but think of all the people who cannot do that.  So Gemma found a way to teach women how to filter their water simply, inexpensively, safely, which not only saved their health and the health of their families, but united the women, empowered them, and gave them a feeling that someone cared about them.  Little by little, A Single Drop has become an award-winning model of social entrepreneurship, giving the under-served economic opportunities to become self-reliant communities who can create and manage their own water service centers in environmentally sensitive and financially sound ways.  Women are becoming recognized as holding up half the sky, as Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl Wudunns book is called, Turning Oppression into Opportunities for Women worldwide, and ASD proves this with turning women into Water Stewards, which will benefit their entire communities in a myriad ways. I recommend non-profit philanthropists to get behind this vital project as soon as possible!

The event that was organized for Girl Scouts, Brownies, and young girls was amazing in bringing it to their level of understanding, and the girls were very receptive. I am also impressed with the world wide work being done by A Single Drop. Communities are helped with techniques according to what their needs are and they are the ones who build and become a part of the learning process. This is incredibly valuble work that, in my opinion deserves global attention.
A Single Drop	42392	8	/users/profile/43110	charlie-hartwell	Donor	5	06/01/2010	Here's what I like about ASD.  It empowers women.  It empowers local solutions to water problems, and has a model where it takes just a short amount of time to create a new program that can sustain itself.  With small investments, households are transformed so that they have access to safe drinking water.  ASD is cost effective, very sustainable, and has opportunity to impact literally millions of people (it's already impacting tens of thousands in the Phillipines and Africa.
A Single Drop	42367	8	/users/profile/43085	roachita	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/31/2010	The amazing thing about ASD is that it inspires and motivates people... apart from the numbers, the immeasurable things are what have the biggest impact.  Gemma Bulos is a tireless leader who has inspired and empowered many women.When I worked at the Centre for Affordable Water & Sanitation Technology (CAWST), I delivered training on household water treatment together with ASD in the Philippines.  The workshops were a success and led to many projects in the field, by Plan International and others, helping numerous families to learn how to treat their own water and therefore take control of their own health.

A Single Drop	42313	7	/users/profile/43030	lindadehaan	Donor	5	05/31/2010	I came to know  Gemma Bulos and her work about 10 years ago through her song campaign for a world anthem "We Rise" and her work with children's groups.  The inspiration I derived from witnessing this and coming to know the person she is has been profound, and I have followed her work as it has grown over time.  To work with the waters of the world and to promote self-reliance, pride, self-empowerment of women through practical application of means to improve quality of life is such a high service, I have been proud to participate as a donor to the A Single Drop initiative.  I have seen what can be accomplished when a single woman listens to the song within her, takes the courageous step to move into her dream while leaving everything else behind, and impact lives around the globe.  I am inspired, proud, and have seen the impact on my own life as a result of this work.  When we impact one life, we impact all.  And this most uplifting truth is what Gemma makes evident to anyone she has touched.
A Single Drop	42302	8	/users/profile/5560	anetucha	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/31/2010	I have known about A Single Drop's excellent work and unique approach since 2008 through my work at Blue Planet Run Foundation. At this time, I reviewed ASD proposals for funding and was consistently impressed with their coherent project plans. Of equal importance, their projects include follow-up, thus ensuring a higher success rate than many other organizations. Their community work is excellent: I applaud their ability to work with communities, hire locally and retract to a support position. In addition to their work in water and sanitation as an organization, ASD has taken a leadership role in an innovative partnership that focuses on women in the water sector: the Global Women's Water Initiative. I think this is a perfect example of Gemma Bulos going a step further, seeing what needs to change in the long run, and engaging with that vision. Women need the extra push that the GWWI offers them through training and seed grants.

They strive to go beyond improving access to clean water to providing education for business, technology, and health.

A Single Drop	42273	6	/users/profile/42994	gra	Volunteer	5	05/31/2010	A Single Drop is an amazing charity.  I heard about Gemma Bulos's work in 2003 and in 2004 and 2005 she came and visited Cork City - the first visit in March 2004 involved visiting over 10 schools in the city raising awareness on the water crisis as well as coming and singing at a concert we had which was attended for a few hundred people.  In March 2005, Gemma returned and visited some elderly day-care centres as well as a number of centres which work with adults with special needs.  The work of ASD has spread all over the planet with projects running in Africa and the Phillipines.  I can't rate highly enough the work that is being done by A Single Drop.
A Single Drop	42270	7	/users/profile/42991	shawnseyk	Donor	5	05/31/2010	A Single Drop is a tremendous non-profit that truly helps change the World.  For many years, the role of women in "less than developed" areas have been muted.  A Single Drop is giving these women, not only an avenue to provide the basic necessity of water to their family/community, but more significantly, changing the way that they think of themselves.  This important transformation of thought will only gain momentum through time and allow communities to depend upon each other, in ways that have been missing for many generations. In such war-torn areas like Africa, women will be the leading influence in creating a lasting and sustainable economic structure.  I am proud to be part of the donorship that helps to achieve this non-profit's wonderful mission.
A Single Drop	42259	12	/users/profile/42984	claytrell	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2010	In August of 2008 I visited an orphanage in Chimoio, Mozambique near the border of Zimbabwe. A Single Drop had just arrived and I was fortunate enough to spend nearly a month with Gemma Bulos, Mariah Klingsmith and Evans Chiyenge while they educated a group of local Chimoio women about fresh-water, sanitation and hygeine. Over the following weeks I observed and photographed as they taught the women how to construct gravity-fed bio-sand filters to purify their household drinking water. Keep in mind that the majority of these people survive on less than a dollar a day, have no plumbing and have been given little means of education. I have to say I have never witnessed anything more inspiring. ASD walked in and within a month's time educated these women about water, taught them to build the bio-sand filters, taught the women how to teach others, and gave them the tools and knowhow to begin their own business providing the most important ingredient in life after oxygen. Since then I have studied up a bit on Africa's economic and social dilemmas and the social entreprenuership model that ASD has created is magnificent. It is hard for a Westerner from a developed nation to understand the magnitude of what these Mozambican women are up against, and they have a voracious appetite for learning the skills neccessary to take care of their families, improve their lives and their communities. A Single Drop has stepped in to begin filling that void, targeting the most important and basic human needs to begin rebuilding this devastated nation. One need only look at the faces of the women in the program to know that it is making an immeasurable impact and is a cause worth supporting. I have to give ASD five stars, though I know that there are many more people out there still suffering, and I would urge whoever might read this to get involved and help A Single Drop to work toward a sixth star, where everyone on Earth has (at minimum) free access to fresh water and a basic education of sanitation and hygeine.
A Single Drop	42254	10	/users/profile/42987	ANEPO	Client Served	5	05/31/2010	A Single Drop has helped us bring our learnings from an international training back to our community.  They gave us additional on-site training in water testing, Biosand water filter construction, WASH education and solar cooking.  Local government, schools, Girl Guides, church groups and communities are benefiting from our work and advocacy for access to better water, sanitation and hygiene!
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	32759	8	/users/profile/33581	3fatapes	General Member of the Public	5	03/09/2010	A splendid mix of adult and kid plays happening year 'round!  It's a true delight to live in a community with such quality theatre productions.Aside from an audience member, i have yet to participate in a show, but i always feel welcome to assist.  There seems to be a place for everyone; from ushering, to costumes, to wrangling props, to make-up, to cleaning the popcorn machine, everyone is important.The Grand Marais playhouse is a true asset to our community and beyond.  I'd miss it greatly if i ever moved!
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	32250	10	/users/profile/33040	cassandra1	Former Volunteer	5	03/02/2010	This is where I developed my love for theater. I got a college degree in theater and have worked professionally in theater since graduation. It is a place full of people who care deeply for the arts. This place brings the community together and show the special talent they have to offer.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31978	4	/users/profile/32793	sandra3	Volunteer	5	02/28/2010	I am a parent of two girls, both involved in plays. Both have had a wonderful time. As a parent I also appreciate the amazing experience they are getting on stage, the support system of a mixed-age group of kids that continues to evolve and the inclusion of back stage experience that helps them see the entire process of putting together a bit of magic. My husband has been involved with stage-building, I have helped with costumes and my youngest daughter and I have written/performed in 10-minute plays. My kids see multiple community members who are involved as well as getting the chance to work with experienced professionals. It is a rich experience to share as a family. It is also an amazing thing to see in a smaller sized community.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31903	10	/users/profile/32733	marcia2	Volunteer	5	02/28/2010	I have been involved as both a consumer, volunteer and actor in the playhouse. The quality of productions are awesome. The impact on the kids in the community involved is noticable.  I have watched very young kids become confident, artistic teens.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31879	4	/users/profile/32709	painter1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2010	I have been in theatre all of my adult life, and am proud to be involved with the Grand Marais Playhouse. In fact, it is an important reason that I am here in this area.  Sue's level of professionalism is stunning, and working with her continues to challenge my own skills- which were honed as a scenic painter in all of the Twin Cities theatres- Guthrie, Minnesota Opera, Children's Theatre, Heart of the Beast, Dayton's, Science Museum, etc. Wherever there was theatre and display, I was there.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31739	3	/users/profile/32591	kurt1	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	I have had the great pleasure to be able to be involved in many great productions.  Everything to acting, helping with sets and tech, ushering... the list goes on and on.  I have learned so much during every production.  I have also been moved by the great people, both staff and volunteers, and the lasting friendships that have been built.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31589	4	/users/profile/32457	sailor	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	The Grand Marais Playhouse impacted my life at an early age! I started getting involved as a child and have been a huge fan and volunteer for many years. I rarely miss a production and bring family and friends along whenever I can. It is amazing what this theater can accomplish with all local community members. It is a great asset to the area both for locals and for visitors!
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31464	4	/users/profile/32345	jgellner	Board Member	5	02/26/2010	I have had the pleasure of acting in plays, working for the GMP during the summer, and helping out as a board member.  The Grand Marais Playhouse is a wonderful community theater.  There are opportunities for everyone:  acting, techie, directing, helping in just about any way possible.The plays for for children, high schooler, and adults.  There are musicals, comedies, farces, drama, period pieces, and more.The Grand Marais Playhouse puts out plays that can compete with any theater and most of the time far exceed other performances by other theaters.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31387	11	/users/profile/32283	northshoremom	Board Member	5	02/26/2010	I have enjoyed many plays that the Grand Marais Playhouse has  professionally performed over the years. What I feel is amazing from this tiny Northern Minnesota town playhouse, is the dedication of its talented staff, volunteers and actors. Who put these productions on for the community with such little funds, yet power pack the stage with such magic. I have volunteered as usher, ticket sales, secured advertisers and donated props. I am presently a board member who sees and believes in the visions of our Grand Marais Playhouse.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31327	7	/users/profile/32230	dtoma	Board Member	5	02/26/2010	I've been in and/or assisted with many productions over the last 20 years & every experience has provided lasting memory-highs! As a result of these positive experiences, I now serve on the board, hoping to help in providing similar experiences for even more community members. I am most impressed with how this organization provides such an inclusive atmosphere, especially with K-12 students, yet maintains high artistic standards. I love how each production is a feast for the eyes with creative set design & costumes. Musicals have been a special treat as I watch community members who are given opportunities to share their incredible talents vocally & instrumentally. I'm thankful for the lasting friendships that have been forged through working together on projects through this organization. I'm also thankful for how the Playhouse is developing a strong educational component. Through its resources with the theater world beyond our little county, we get these incredible opportunities to expand our knowledge of theater craft.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	31115	4	/users/profile/32049	bea	Client Served	5	02/25/2010	I love our Playhouse! It is one of our best community assets. Most people wouldn't expect to find the quality of theater production in a town of our size. Acting is superb, partly because many actors keep coming back for more opportunities to perform, partly because the directing brings out their best! Sets, costumes, and lighting are incredible. I've lived here for over 15 years, and never miss a play if I can help it.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	30636	4	/users/profile/31596	denny3	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	Grand Marais Playhouse is an integral part and essential element of our community. It has a 40-year history of giving both students and adults a wonderful opportunity to experience the joys and rewards of high-quality theater. The Playhouse could provide even more tangible and intangible benefits to the community if there were greater financial resources available.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	30586	3	/users/profile/31556	brown-sugar	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	My husband and I spend summer and part of the fall in Grand marais and imust say that the productions put on at the Playhouse are among the highlights of the season.  They are well done,very well staged and acted.  Even though it is a very small town the playhouse has a multitude of talent that adds to it's success.We look forward toeach production and only wish there could be more.Another admiral asset to the community the Playhouse offers ,is that each production offers one performance where the public can pay anything they like. This a great public service as it allows people toenjoy even if they are of limited means.
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	30582	4	/users/profile/31547	sunny1	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	The Grand Marais Playhouse is a great community organization on many levels. I have created lasting friendships, challenged my mind, and became a part of something special each time I've been a part of a play. Watching the kids on stage is a joy and what they learn is immeasurable! I will continue to support the Playhouse and the great work that they do!
Grand Marais Playhouse Inc	30388	1	/users/profile/31371	yetta	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	I have attended plays at the Grand Marais Playhouse for over 34 years.  When I think of the Playhouse, I think of exciting scripts with top shelf acting.  We are blessed with talented community actors and a very energetic, imaginative artistic director who guides and leads the team.  Our director makes it fun to be a volunteer and is always bend-over-backwards appreciative of whatever the volunteers accomplish.  Attending our local Playhouse productions are always my favorite community event!
Women In Progress Inc	43275	1	/users/profile/44090	kim16	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2010	I visited their facilities during a school trip to Ghana. Back home in the US I study economics and sustainability, meanwhile as a fair trade activist. I love what they are doing! They are an exemplary model of a fair trade cooperative. The producers seem to love what they do, and the products are gorgeous!
Women In Progress Inc	42783	9	/users/profile/43510	leslie-shages	Volunteer	5	06/03/2010	As a returned Peace Corps volunteer that worked in women's business development and empowerment for 2 years I can honestly say that Women in Progress is a power force for change.  Their work is sustainable, culturally appropriate and well-informed.  It is a true business (not based on hand-outs) that makes products people want. I am proud to have been a part of it.
Women In Progress Inc	40563	15	/users/profile/41471	davisonb	Volunteer	5	05/25/2010	Prior to my volunteer experience with WIP,I had traveled around the world, but never by myself.  Even though I arrived in Ghana by myself, I had instant friends and support with other WIP volunteers and staff.   Now, six years later, I still keep in contact with my Ghanaian friends and other WIP volunteers.  The organization is wonderful to let you set your own pace for work.  Also, I feel that the organization is really making a huge difference in Ghana.  I have seen tremendous growth in the last six years as more and more Ghanaians have financially benefited from the work of WIP women, staff and volunteers
Women In Progress Inc	40329	12	/users/profile/41258	paul19	Volunteer	5	05/24/2010	What an amazing organization.  The second I landed in Accra, I was met by the Executive Director and started the  adventure that is Ghana!  The 'WIP lounge' was a good size for us, but I imagine if there were more volunteers it would be a bit cramped.  One or two laptops might help the volunteers since power outages are common and much of the work is digital.  The living accommodations were fantastic and quickly felt like a home.  I am hesitant to suggest a map of the city, only because exploring is really essential to the experience.  Overall I had an exceptional time!  I wish WIP the best and hope to see the amazing handmade products in stores around the U.S. soon!  I bought 2 cooking aprons and tablecloth for my parents, they love them and use them whenever they cook.
Women In Progress Inc	39640	6	/users/profile/40592	muible	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	A friend and I had just graduated college and set off to assist Women In Progress (WIP) for the summer in Ghana.  Over our two month experience we became immersed in the most pro-active, sustainable and measured non-profits I have ever been a part of, or much less heard about.  While working with the guidance and expertise, my partner and I were afforded the autonomy to work with a shea butter producer whom responsibly exports her product around the world.  Through this, she employs over 700 women in the difficult region of Tamale Ghana.  In this region she pays far above the market rate, teaches the women practical business habits and assist in developing womens community groups.  Although we came in with decent business acumen, we were able help our shea producer an $85,000 grant from USAID, re-create a sales lead and distribution system, and frequently monitor production for possible growth aspects.  All the while we became close with the women workers, both in Tamale and Accra.  Our work, facilitated by WIP, helped in the growth of these women from the ultra-poor, to now, many of the women having excess money stored in the bank for expenses such as school supplies, clothes, and emergency funds.
Women In Progress Inc	39619	4	/users/profile/40568	xiajuan	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	My experience in Ghana is totally unforgettable and enjoyable. The women there have lots of passion and the kids have so much spirit and soul, all of these cannot be capture in the pictures. I miss the sun, beaches, fufu, and especially the people there who gave me the warmest hug I had ever received. Although I have left that country for almost a year, I still feel that I am being part of it.
Women In Progress Inc	39509	6	/users/profile/40463	atbowe	Volunteer	5	05/19/2010	70 women in the arid, empoverished north of Ghana want to sell more Shea Butter. Eugenia Akuete of Nasakle,Ltd got money from US AID to organize and maximize the operation. But Eugenia needed a stronger business plan herself, so I wrote an employee manual and help her develop employment contracts as well as develop a written performance review process.
Women In Progress Inc	39501	7	/users/profile/40454	marne	Volunteer	2	05/19/2010	I noticed a big change in the women as they became more proficient, more organized and more self-assured that they are able to work with tourists. The highlight was when the women showed just how happy my work has made them. Elizabeth, co-owner of Eli-Emma, said "I never could have imagined that someday we would be having this business and tourists would come here to see us!"One thing that still shocks me everyday is how happy the people in Cape Coast are. They are so happy and friendly even though by our standards they have so little. They are ever ready to help you out. I have had people run down the street to catch me a cab, chase me down to give me something I have dropped, and many gifts from people I do not even know. Even when facing hardships the people here are beautiful, loving and caring people and we could all learn so much from them.
Women In Progress Inc	39161	6	/users/profile/40107	gregsee	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	My wife and I volunteered with Global Mamas for three months in 2008. In truth, my wife was the formal volunteer, having arranged to offer her graphic designs skills to help with the organization's catalog, annual report, packaging, etc. To make myself useful, I wrote a few articles about and for the organization and contributed to a photo coffee table book about Ghana, where Global Mamas works: http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/750329.I cannot say enough about both the mission and people that make Global Mamas such a special organization. Committed to helping woman-owned business succeed, they are helping Ghanaians help themselves, the mark of a sustainable and enduring solution. Learn how contribute, either in time or money, by visiting their website: http://www.globalmamas.orgOur experience in Ghana was transformative, and we encourage anyone looking for an adventure and one in which you will every day feel appreciated and welcomed, to consider volunteering with Global Mamas.
Women In Progress Inc	38909	6	/users/profile/39826	kimberly4	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	I had such a great time reacquainting myself with the fundamentals of marketing and applying to a brand (Global Mamas) and a cause (Women in Progress) that I am truly passionate about. It reawakened my drive for building meaningful consumer brands and reminded me why I decided to make a career in marketing.
Women In Progress Inc	38742	6	/users/profile/39641	kristy2	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	I had a great experience with WIP.  I loved that I was able to feel like I was actually "living" in Ghana.  I was also able to help a great charity by doing something I was interested in - photography.  By spending even a day with WIP you can see how they give women (and men) jobs and life skills. As a "type - A" personality, sometimes charity work abroad can be painful; however, I did not feel this way at all with WIP.  I highly recommend this organization!
Women In Progress Inc	38722	10	/users/profile/39623	jlynnruss	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	My experience with Women in Progress was amazing! I have now been to Ghana twice, both times sharing my experiences with the Women in Progress Volunteers. I recommend this NGO to anyone who has ever asked me about volunteering overseas. Meeting the locals of Ghana or my fellow roomates in the Women in Progress house, I learned more than I could imagine about myself and the country I was visiting. I miss Ghana more and more everyday and cannot wait to go back; hopefully helping Women in Progress once again!
Women In Progress Inc	38699	6	/users/profile/39597	jayme1	Former Volunteer	4	05/12/2010	I went to Global Mamas with very little knowledge of what I wanted to get out of my experience or what exactly I would be doing once I got to Ghana. The only thing I can say is that Renee and the Mamas helped to form the path I've taken in my life and the concept of this nonprofit is very powerful.  All the women who own their own batik or sewing shops take apprentices whom are taught a trade and in the future can start their own shop and take new apprentices. This concept instills a sense of community and constant development.  Renee met every challenge head on and constantly worked to create innovative ideas, using the ideas and help of volunteers and all the global mamas to better the product production, working conditions, and lifestyles of everyone involved in the nonprofit.
Women In Progress Inc	38646	8	/users/profile/39534	christopher6	Former Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	Women in Progress is a great organization that makes a real impact in the communities they work in. My first experience with WiP was in 2006 when I interned at their then main Ghana office in Cape Coast as part of my undergraduate program. Not only did I have a great time, but I gained valuable experience and saw first hand how WiP's programs empower Women business owners and bring tangible benefits to the community through capacity building and income generating activities. I recently returned to Ghana on vacation and was impressed with how much WiP had grown bringing their programs and enthusiasm to women and communities throuought southern Ghana!
Women In Progress Inc	38641	3	/users/profile/39526	armyjeb09	Volunteer	4	05/11/2010	Women in Progress is the kind of nonprofit NGO that helps people (specifically women) by not giving them handouts but empowering them with their own skills to make a living for their families.  Women in Progress gives the women it works with a market they would never have access to by shipping to the the U.S. (and I believe Canada and Japan now).
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	179069		/users/profile/235701	Suzi3,	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I am on Affirmation's ally committee.  I love seeing the hope and spiritual strength Affirmation brings to LGBT Mormons.  It's challenging to be both LGBT and Mormon, and Affirmation brings these beautiful people together, online and in person, all over the world, so they can support and buoy up each other.  I love how inclusive Affirmation is and I love that the current leadership is concentrating on making a space for LGBT in the congregations.  I volunteer with Affirmation to help bring information and understanding to straight Mormons.  There is much work to be done, and Affirmation has the history and resources to accomplish it.

Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	217900		/users/profile/281449	mlkokol	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2014	As a queer saint, and adult educator, I have watched Affirmation grow in excellence these last 10 years. Not only grounded in purpose, not only reaching out for more and more diversity within its scope, but now coming to understand the significance of this annual gathering, I can state that this is an important non-profit organization whose has matured to the point of being a powerful voice far beyond the assumptions that people might make.  From diversity to inclusion, from the young to the old, from the faithful to the deeply questioning, the tent has been broadened, the spiritual nourishment deepened. This is a conference, even better than college reunions, that I now plan on attending as a regular habit to steady my diet, to better understand my own growth. And above all, to share and support the power of this story.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	185509		/users/profile/242483	kekpenyong	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	i'm a gay Mormon BYU student in Utah, and I first learned about Affirmation a year ago, in summer 2012.  One of my favorite things about Affirmation is the work that they have done to provide safe soscial spaces for young GLBTQ Mormons to express themselves and to meet other people who are in their situation. Affirmation partners with other groups, like Mormons Building Bridges, to organize monthly socials along the Wasatch Front for GLBTQ Mormons and allies.  Some of these socials have been in Salt Lake City, while others have beeen in Highland and other points south. Usually, at the ones that I've attended, there have been big groups of several dozen people there.  The socials are a fun opportunity to build friendships within the local GLBTQ community. They also are a good chance to help build or rebuild connections with one's personal spirituality and with the LDS Church. There is usually a spiritual thought from the scriptures, a guest speaker with an uplifting message, and a fun group hymn-singing session where anyone is welcome to join in.  Even at times when I've felt personally disconnected from the Church because of my sexuality, Affirmation has always remained in my mind as a helpful community resource where I can always go to be uplifted and supported. 
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	181096		/users/profile/237805	judymfinch	Board Member	5	10/22/2013	I was introduced to Affirmation early in 2013 when I was asked to serve on its board.  From my initial conversation, I have found each interaction with Affirmation to be positive, encouraging, accepting, and inspiring.  I have enjoyed up close and personal the impressive dedication, devotion and hard work this high caliber group directs toward improving relations between the LGBT community, family and friends, with the Mormon church.  Accomplished professionals in their work lives, the sterling quality leadership team brings to Affirmation keen intelligence, creativity, and tireless energy.  I joined Affirmation to become part of their cause; I never imagined becoming deeply connected with its individuals.  My relationships with Affirmation members have helped me examine and question my own thoughts and feelings and make positive changes.  If I can be so positively influenced, I believe other individuals can be, along with small groups and then large groups of people.  I love knowing that humans all over our world can have growing experiences through Affirmations honest compassion, love and acceptance.  I am terribly proud to be part of Affirmation.  Surely one of the Great Nonprofits, Affirmation exerts astonishing power for good.  
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	180623		/users/profile/237311	Yvettepz	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I became a member of affirmation because I have a gay son.  Rubbing shoulders with these tremendous people, giving service and attending gatherings and socials has become a highlight in my life.  I know other mothers like me with gay children, and see successful gay men and women who have  spouses, partners, families and careers and are breaking the myths often associated with gay Mormons.   This organization is run with intelligence by amazing individuals who have love as their primary motivation.  Affirmation is incredible!  They are a light ti many gay Mormons who otherwise would have no hope of finding love and support within the Mormon community.   
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	179369		/users/profile/236016	Peter38	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	Affirmation provides much needed support and assistance to a great deal of people - all different and unique in both what they require and where they are in their journeys. The organization has been around for more than 3 decades... but, recently, it seemed to have gained renewed energy and powerful focus. I have seen the consequences of Affirmation on people's lives... not just my own. I have seen people who would ordinarily not cooperate or work together join forces for the greater good. I have never seen - anywhere else - so many different kinds of people come together. Young and old, male and female, LGBT and straight, believing and non-believing... Affirmation confirmed in my mind the ability of people to work beyond borders and categories. 
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	179364		/users/profile/236010	Michael203	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	My first experience with Affirmation was about 4 years ago and it was such a bitter place.  Just a lot of members or former members speaking ill about the church - not any longer!  The is a renaissance happening within Affirmation.   By far the most spiritual and uplifted conference I have attended in a very, very long time.  It was a safe place welcoming of so many in different stages of their journey.   So many loving people who are striving to be who they are - Both LGBT and Mormon!!  It really felt like THE PERFECT ward conference teenagers running around, straight and LGBT couples sharing stories and testimonies.  
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	178215		/users/profile/234839	Tina47	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	My first exposure to Affirmation was when I attended the 2011 in Cleveland Ohio.  Before then I felt an island unto myself.  I had no LDS LBGTQ associates to share my struggles, fears, questions, happiness or spiritual insights with concerning this enormously conflicting part of my life.  Becoming involved in Affirmation has given me a home of safety, a voice of validity, and a bedrock of encouragement.  I have meet some of my dearest friends in affirmation.  I have been given the opportunity  to share of myself and help others.  I now have the opportunity to be a member of something bigger than myself, to be apart of a great movement for change and awareness.  What a cool thing! I love all that Affirmation offers, from local events and socials, to teleconferences on healing and spirituality, social media resources to connect with others, regional and national conferences, the podcast, newsletter and website, the resources available to help educate my local leaders, the incredible people i get to work with, the list goes on and on and on!  Affirmation has changed my life and I am happier and more whole since becoming a member.  Thanks to everyone who is apart of this great organization!
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	177802		/users/profile/234389	Colby G.	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I am a gay Mormon, and with that came extreme amounts of inner conflict. In the fall of 2009 I reached a point where the Mormon church was not giving me enough to get through. I didn't see where I fit in. I turned to the internet for help and understanding. I googled "Gay Mormons" and found Affirmation. I saw that there was a group 3 hours away from where I  lived. I contacted the local chapter leader and attended my first Affirmation social a few weeks later. I met dozens of other LGBT Mormons who were like me and who were so kind and welcoming. I saw authentic healthy adjusted gay Mormons, just that example alone did wonders for me personally. After that first social I attended what Affirmation gatherings I could.  In September 2011 I attended my first national Affirmation conference in Cleveland Ohio. The Sunday testimony and devotional meetings in the Kirtland Temple were experiences that  I will never forget. The spirit was so strong that day. Next year in Seattle 2012 I had the privilege to be on the conference committee and planed a Saturday night dance. It was the highlight of my year. I had a lot of fun. And again this year I was able to help with the Salt Lake City 2013 conference.   Affirmation is a place where I can express myself openly and authentically. I feel like my talents and abilities are used and appreciated in Affirmation. I appreciate the opportunity Affirmation has given me to serve other LGBT Mormons Family and Friends.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	179069		/users/profile/235701	Suzi3,	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I am on Affirmation's ally committee.  I love seeing the hope and spiritual strength Affirmation brings to LGBT Mormons.  It's challenging to be both LGBT and Mormon, and Affirmation brings these beautiful people together, online and in person, all over the world, so they can support and buoy up each other.  I love how inclusive Affirmation is and I love that the current leadership is concentrating on making a space for LGBT in the congregations.  I volunteer with Affirmation to help bring information and understanding to straight Mormons.  There is much work to be done, and Affirmation has the history and resources to accomplish it.  
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	177645		/users/profile/234215	Swimdoc7	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I joined Affirmation almost one year ago. I have found it more than welcoming to all who are affirming of all types of relationships and all levels of connection to Mormonism. The leaders are very passionate about the movement to bring lgbtq individuals closer to the church and at te same time work with members of the church to understand and live their gay brothers and sisters. The annual conference, this September held in Salt Lake City, brought together more than 400 lgbtq Mormons, friends, and family members. My mom attended to support me and has never enjoyed a weekend more. This is a fantastic organization for a broad range of individuals.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	177627		/users/profile/234195	Trich12	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I found Affirmation when I was looking for an LGBTQ community of friends who shared similar backgrounds to me. I attended a conference that was a transformational experience. The organization's goal is to proved a safe space for LGBTQ Mormons, families, and friends to interact with one another, drawing strength from one another. The organization also provides resources to members of the Mormon(LDS) faith who either are struggling to reconcile their faith and sexuality, or struggling to help others do the same. Affirmation leadership is unpaid and spends countless hours bringing faith, hope, charity, and love to their brothers and sisters.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	177624		/users/profile/234192	Peter37	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons is an important part of my life, especially since I am no longer active in the LDS Church.  Affirmation provides me a link with the Church and the many wonderfulpeople that are in the Mormon Church.  Affirmation is working to bring together LGBT Mormons, whether they are active, inactive or totally disengaged with the Church.  It is a wonderful place to interact with people that have similar experiences and are willing to give support to those who may be going through a difficult transition.  The people I have met are so warm and caring, it always lifts me up when I read, speak with or listen to other Affirmation members.  It is a place for spiritual uplift as well. The most recent Affirmation Conference in Salt Lake City was a spiritual event from the opening event to the closing luncheon.  The speakers presented from the heart, and it was obvious to me that personal revelation was being received by many.  It is hard to single out a favorite event during the conference, but the presentations by Barb and Steve Young are a couple of highlights, as was Benjy Schwimmer's dance performance.  As always the close of conference with "God be With You till We Meet Again" was a very spiritual moment.   It was so good to be with so many good people.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	176842		/users/profile/233297	Trevor C.	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	Many people are not aware of the intense internal conflict that LGBT individuals (and their families) in conservative religions or subcultures face. Affirmation is a group that affirms LGBT Mormons in their sexuality and faith--however they pursue it, or not, and whatever it means to them. It's unique in the Mormon culture and plays a very important supportive role in the lives of many LGBT Mormons both directly through sponsored activities and indirectly through advocacy. I have met some of my best friends through Affirmation; it means so much to be able to associate people who understand what I go through and how I feel as a minority within a minority. I volunteer for the organization because it helps me to realize my own ideals of creating a better environment for my gay brothers and sisters.
Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons	171046		/users/profile/149808	Fred8	Board Member	5	09/22/2013	The words Eight stars of gold on field of blue have a special meaning to me. So do the words Melchizedek Priesthood. It was in 1986 at North Pole, Alaska that these two sets of words converged together as part of my life story as I was ordained an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The state song and flag of Alaska both refer to the eight stars of the Big Dipper and the North Star on a blue background.  As part of a military ward at an Air Force base, I met other military LDS members and served as the ward chorister. I was transferred to Washington D.C. in the 1990s. At this point in my life, life was changing drastically as I began to question my sexuality. I also started attending Affirmation in Washington D.C. while stationed there. Being a member of Affirmation helped me come out as a gay man and several members of the group remain close friends and are my Affirmation family.  As I was stationed in various places throughout the U.S. and overseas, one constant in my life was Affirmation. I have been a part of Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons for over 20 years.  During this time I have served in leadership roles at the chapter and national levels for many years including: local Chapter Director; Chapter-at-Large Director; Assistant Vice President for Strategy and Development; Affirmation National Board of Directors; Conference Director; and the founder and current Director of the Affirmation People of Color and Allies Group. In my eyes, Affirmation Gay and Lesbian Mormons addresses the needs of LGBT Mormons in a ever changing world where LGBT Mormons are seeking to have someone to talk to in times of crisis, establish friendships with one another, and find resources that support their coming out process at the intersection of two often conflicting worlds, being both LGBT and Mormon. I have enjoyed my service to Affirmation and continue to "pay it forward" because of the support and friendship I have received from many people in this organization.
Minnesota Humanities Center	73997		/users/profile/80860	Maureen	General Member of the Public	4	02/23/2011	I attended the program called Revolutionary Leadership at the MN Humanities Center.  To prepare for the two day seminar I took an online class called "The Absent Narrative."  As a member of our school's leadership team I felt this was a good opportunity to look at new ways to approach the way we teach students from diverse backgrounds.  Part of our school improvement plan is to help all teachers be culturally responsive in their practice and this program at the Humanities Center provided resources and information to begin to achieve this goal.  I've already used some of the resources provided and our staff is discussing ways to continue to look at our curriculum so that our students can see themselves in the content.  This was an excellent program and I would highly recommend it to any school looking to provide a more culturally relevant as well as culturally responsive curriculum.

I have loved every course I have taken from them.  They have fantastic knowledgable speakers/presenters and a comfortable space to work.   I attended one of their sponsored Landmark workshops last year and it was a well run, fun, and interesting hands-on learning opportunity. Lastly,  I took 3 of their online training courses and they were a great and informative guide on the topics.  The resources are all listed if you want further  information at the end of the videos/guides.  I recommend these to all!

I am a high school social studies teacher at a charter school for immigrants ans refugees.  I took a geography course about Africa and one about American Indian land tenure.  Both classes gave me more knowledge and teaching ideas and strategies to use in the classroom.  I especially found the class on American Indian land tenurre to be most helpful because it is difficult to find resources and this complex issue is ususally left out of textbooks, so the duty of researching and collecting resources falls on very busy teachers.  
Minnesota Humanities Center	66688		/users/profile/72890	Kathyg	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	I have attended programs at the Humanities Commissions for many decades ( and at least once or twice a year) and never have been disappointed by the content, expertise, and thoughful planning of the events.  The diversity of topics, speakers, and ideas are always top-notch.The staff at the NHC understands what adult learners need and how to design professional development opportunities for adults who have  wide range of interests. As a classroom teacher so much of what I have learned through  MHC programming has been embedded back into my curriculum. The materials from events have been passed through my faculty for dissemination. The MHC is a strong center of support for teacher renewal, growth and development which has such direct impact on our students.

I find it to be one of the best facilities for good food, pleasant surroundings, excellent presenters, and current provocative subject matter helpful to me in my field of education. I have recommended them often to other colleagues because it's such a great place to go, not to mention the helpful staff and good rates. I always come away  with new ideas that I can actually use in the classroom.   It's a 5 star rating with me!

We were able to have the  history of our community that has been traditionally ignored distorted  and neglected by MN historical venues , finally get heard and recorded. And MHC did it right . They went to the community for imput throughout the process from the start to the completion. Unlike other groups who tell our story without our imput .MHC certainly personified the words of their mission statement "fosters collaboration among cultural organizations  ". Muchisimas Gracias.

The library provided a comfortable meeting space with the modern audiovisual necessities for presentations. The meal and snack choices were slightly spartan but of good quality and affordable. We will continue to use the Humanities Center for our annual retreats. Their staff made all aspects (reservations, set-up, invoicing, etc.) of the retreat run smoothly. It provided a comfortable setting that was conducive to staff rejuvination and brain-storming. We already are looking forward to next year.

When the Humanities Center speaker presented historical information about the Iron Range and immigrant miners who worked there, we learned about how immigrants adapted in the face of hostility from earlier settlers, which is what Somali immigrants face today. How else could we have learned about that, other than at the Humanities Center? Theyre unique and irreplaceable.

Minnesota Humanities Center	63373		/users/profile/69288	Monica Cofell	Client Served	5	02/04/2011	Where do I start to tell you about what the MN Humanities Center has meant to me over the last 18 years? Their programs are top notch. They always have extremely qualified and interesting presenters. I have learned so much, and it has helped me to be a better teacher in so many ways--in my interaction with my colleagues and with my students, in my knowledge of my subject area and in interdisciplinary subject areas that affect me. I come away from their workshops feeling like I have truly spent my time wisely, that I haven't wasted another day going to another boring workshop. In fact, I CHOOSE to go to their workshops and recommend them to fellow teachers. I sometimes fantasize about how to justify going to a history-related workshop just because it sounds interesting to me (but knowing that it will never get approved). It isn't just the presentations that make me a better teacher, it is also the way I am treated: like a true professional! I think I carry myself more proudly after I have attended their workshops. And in my profession, that is worth a lot! Just thinking about this organization and what they stand for makes me feel good. They truly stand for what is right in Minnesota, what makes us great. A specific example? I attended the workshop on Latinos in America, and I had so much material to share with my students and my colleagues that I didn't know where to start sharing it. I even was able to use some it in my Master's thesis on diversity. The info, the presenters, the networking I did was invaluable.

Whether I was part of  a group of 12, 50 or 100+, I always felt appreciated and taken care of.Recently, I had the oppurtunity of attending a wedding reception and dance at MHC.  All of the rooms were for our use.  It was easy to mingle and touch base with all of the guests and, of course, the food was GREAT!I am also aware that the facility has rooms available to the presenters and participants should they need overnight accomodations.
Minnesota Humanities Center	56290		/users/profile/58700	patr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/02/2010	My field of expertise is professional development for educators, especially in the area of classroom practices. When teachers ask: "how can I understand culture and its impact in my school?" my answer has been: Seek out the the Minnesota Humanities Center. It is one of the highest quality  professional development providers in this area in the country. Their programs are timely, informative and especially applicable to Minnesota educators. Their staff has been filling a void in teacher professional development for many years: cultural identity and cultural awareness are directly related to the achievement gaps in MN.  The MHC is dedicated to closing those  gaps through its focused, professional opportunities for educators and the community--they provide an understanding of the many cultural  contributions and the needs of all our diverse communities. Topics are explored by  MHC in a variety of formats-from introductory sessions to in-depth, interactive work with local, regional and national experts. 'Sensitive and informative presentations' have been repeated compliments from members of teacher groups.In my capacity as the director of Education Minnesota's non profit program, I welcomed the opportunity to promote the MHC's work and to advocate for expansion of their delivery system--from Aitken to Zumbro, educators and the community in this state rely on MHC to  heighten awareness and understanding of the impact of culture in our schools and communities.

We enjoyed many "firsts" together -- simple things like baking cookies and going to the county fair.  I was sad when they moved to Alaska with their family but overjoyed when they came back to visit four years later and said that they want to stay connected.Being a mentor is one of those things you do where you might never know the impact on the lives of others as well as your own.
Kids-n-Kinship Inc	257303		/users/profile/38666	cheerful	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	As a mentor for more than 8 years with this great nonprofit, I had a wonderful opportunity to spend time with twin girls whose family included a single Mom and several brothers and sisters.  Was amazing to experience so many firsts with them -- going to a county fair, a ballgame and baking cookies.  In the process, I learned about how much we take for granted and how a little time can make a big difference in the lives of others.
Kids-n-Kinship Inc	297990		/users/profile/388817	kirstor	Volunteer	5	07/25/2016	I've been a mentor with Kids 'n Kinship for 10 years.  It's a great feeling to know that a small investment of time pays amazing dividends in the life of my mentee.  I've seen her grow from a shy 8-year old with very little self-confidence into a lovely young lady who is mature, applies herself in school, and dreams of going to college.  The best part is that she and I spend time together doing the silliest and easiest of things:  we go for walks, scrapbook, and even draw on my driveway with chalk just for fun.  Spending time with her is a highlight of my week, takes very little effort, and is just plain fun.  This organization is important for kids like my mentee who are looking for a positive adult role model.  I'm grateful that Kids 'n Kinship supports our match and gives us opportunities to spend time together by providing free events and suggestions for activities.
Kids-n-Kinship Inc	258185		/users/profile/346672	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	We have been mentoring through Kids-n-Kinship for almost 15 years.  Our first experience was with a 9 year old young man who came from a single parent home with no male role model.  We invested in his life (and he in ours) for 12 years.   Most of our time together was simply including him in all our family activities.  We encouraged him during his difficult times in school and let him know how much we cared for him.  The Kids-N-Kinship coordinators were always there as a resource to us whenever we needed guidance for any situations that needed to be addressed.  Our mentee is now 24 and has since moved to another state as is working for a law firm.  We still keep in contact with him and spend time together whenever he comes back to our neck of the woods!  We are now mentoring two young brothers who also come from a single parent home and need guidance to navigate through the environment that surrounds them.  Kids-'N-Kinship has been a wonderful organization to work with.  Their outreach to the community and program support for mentee/mentor matches has been awesome!  They also have plenty of fun things to do with your mentee(s) by providing tickets for sporting events, recreational activities, educational trips , and great ideas on how to interact with and support your mentee.  I can't say enough about our positive experience with this organization.....

I  was a little bit hesitant to call for more info because  I had never been  an mentor before. When I gathered enough confidence  to call, I talked to Ingrid, she gave me more information and we had set a date and a place to meet. There was paperwork I needed to start the ball rolling. When it got rolling, I hopped on. The staff at Kids nKinship are great, whenever had a question about being a mentor. I mentored an individual  for over 2 years and I learned a lot about myself and learned a lot from my mentee. Right now I am doing volunteering  for Kids n Kinship.   The program helps kids and the community  and when I am able to mentor again,  I will be first in line.

I started  volunteering  when my kids were teenagers and I had more free time on my hands..I was matched with a shy 11 year-old  named Ashley who turned out to one of the best things I've  ever done for myself and my family. Kinship really did a great job in matching us up, it was like a perfect match from the start and our friendship has now lasted 18 years and that shy little girl has turned out to be part of our family. Kinship made it easy with outings to do fun things together, they always were a great support if you needed anything, just can't  say enough good things about this organization and the people that run it.

He was very apprehensive and certain he'd never make a difference in a child's life.  Now, that young man is a sophomore in college and frequently keeps in touch, sharing how's he's doing in school, what's going on in college, etc.  The simple fact that the two of them still make time for each other, even 10 yrs later, tells me that both of them have had an impact on the other.

I was then matched with twin five-year-old girls, and the fun began.  Over the years, I've been able to watch these girls experience a lot of "firsts" (like riding a merry-go-round and baking cookies) which they otherwise might never have experienced.  When they said they didn't know what a college was, I had a chance to take them to my daughter's university so they could see what might possibly be in store for their future.   All along the way, I've had great support from the staff at Kids 'n Kinship, who truly are making a difference in our world.

I came here with only the clothes on my back.  Soon after I moved here I was introduced to TCCVM, which provided me with a voice mail.  This voice mail connection helped me in obtaining employment, the rest is history.  Now I'm on the Advisory Board committee.  I know this is a great organization thru experience.
Twin Cities Community Voice Mail	24565	7	/users/profile/25601	Jerri	Volunteer	5	12/18/2009	When TCCVM served its 1st client in 1994, the expectation was that it would enroll 20 community agencies and programs to link low-income individuals and familiesto the voice mail service.  Organizers hoped to help 500 users communicate with prospective landlords and employers, that year. Those goals were met in just 5 months, indicating how needed this basic service was.  The numbers, and the positive outcomes, have continued to grow.  In 15 years, TCCVM's no-fee approach has made  communications accessible and linked folks to services statewide.  It was demonstrated that partnerships between agencies and clients can help clients achieve their goals.
Twin Cities Community Voice Mail	24550	8	/users/profile/25591	Thomas	Donor	5	12/18/2009	Twin Cites Community Voice Mail provides an important service to the homeless that helps them reestablish themselves and return to normalcy. The voice mail service reconnects them to the community - - doctors, potential jobs, family and government agencies. This ability to reconnect is often the first step for homeless individuals as they seek to find a more successful life. This is a well-run organization that operates efficiently and effectively in providing this service.
Twin Cities Community Voice Mail	24542	7	/users/profile/25586	simplemedicine	General Member of the Public	5	12/18/2009	I am a volunteer with "Voices for Change", a grass roots advocacy to address issues of homelessness. Twin-Cities-Community-Voice-Mail (TCCVM) has undeniably filled a very important need to help the homeless/ those in transition/ and low income persons keep in touch with needed services, such as MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. Staying in touch with work opportunities, family, social workers is a big challenge for the homelessness who are struggling with pennies to even make phone calls.    Besides providing voicemail, TCCVM has been instrumental in partnering with agencies that address needs for of the homeless.  They are continuously looking for ways to bring the homeless and agencies together. TCCVM has been the voice of partnership. TCCVM is very innovative and a motiviating force for other agencies (state, county, and non-profit).   It is not a surprise that agencies seek input from TCCVM. I have been a user of "Voicemail".  I am happy to work with any of TCCVM's outreach programs.
Twin Cities Community Voice Mail	24539	8	/users/profile/25583	voicemail	Volunteer	5	12/18/2009	I am an RN CAse Manager working telephonically with patients across all walks of live, including homeless men, woman and children.  The voicemail services provided by Twin Cities Community Voice Mail is a crucial service to bring case management nursing care to the homeless population.  An RN Case Manager  provides  advocacy, self-care education, coordination among health care providers, therapeutic support and contact for community resources.  I would say confidential voicemail is my primary contact for reaching the homeless population that are insured by Medicaid and General Medical Assistance.

Volunteer	5	07/08/2011	The Diversity Council is my favorite non-profit organization in Rochester because they do so much to help build a truly welcoming and inclusive community. The DC offers a positive vision for our future, and works to achieve this vision through education. The Diversity Council's programs educate people at all stages of life to respect their fellow human beings. I am participating in the Corporate Training program and the K-12 Spark! workshops program; I think both of these programs have and will provide tremendous benefit to every member of our community.

Diversity Council	93555		/users/profile/107702	Dawn L.	Client Served	5	07/07/2011	The video "Living together [videorecording] : a history of prejudice in Olmsted County  produced by the Diversity Council and held in several  local libraries has been most useful in my community role.  This video shows the groups of people who have been discriminated against from the 1850's (Dakota) to the present (Somali).  This video also contains several views of Rochester from historically significant bluffs that are still very important to Dakota and Native American peoples, as they were 150 years ago.  Additionally, when needed  I receive very helpful expert advice from Diversity Council staff (usually Kay Hocker) as I proceed in the Rochester Park and Recreation  Steering Committe for a city park on a bluff, known to be Dakota burial grounds.  Here, my roles include working with many Native American and white people (and the groups they represent) to recommend  plans for this park.  The value of this land  and its appropriate use varies considerably given the ethnic group I am speaking with.   Kay's guidance has been great. 
Diversity Council	93554		/users/profile/107701	troy	General Member of the Public	5	07/07/2011	The Diversity Council is a beacon of hope, a constant light showing the way to a better future for ourselves and our children. I work in a healthcare setting, so I use a healthcare metaphor to describe the Diversity Council. The programming they provide for our community is similar to a vaccine - they are helping to rid the disease of racism and other social injustices. They were a principal force in making the RACE exhibit come alive for our city and for thousands of others in the surrounding communities as well. I also receive regular emails, which are alwasy smart, even witty, and enrich my day by providing educational materials to help me be a better advocate for social justice where I live!

Diversity Council	93550		/users/profile/107692	frankwhawthorne	Donor	5	07/07/2011	My "exposure" to the good works of our Diversity Council extend back at least 15 years, to when our children were in elementary school.  The Council provided diversity trainers to the Rochester public schools, and the several I encountered in those years accomplished the challenge of being both high-quality professionals, and great, multi-generational communicators.  Best of all, they (and most other staff and/or volunteers  we met with affiliation to the D-C) have over time imparted to my wife & me the importance of empathizing with and "seeing the cultural Other" among us.  Thanks!

[I actually received mine on FaceBook where they do a lot of information dissemination.]  I've now read most of the books and have a personal and professional heightening of awareness.  I've talked with Diversity Council staff about possibly starting a community book club based on these excellent reads.

The trainings are always well constructed and practiced.  The Diversity Council is able to present very complex material without sugar-coating it. -the Diversity Council has been a leader in educating our City Council on Social Justice; this education often leads to new and revised ordinances that create a safer and stronger community for all. -the Diversity Council's SPARK curriculum educates thousands of school-age children every year; this is the finest thing they do. -they keep those interested in Social Justice news updated through Facebook. -the Diversity Council is well-managed with capable and realistic leadership.

I was then able to take my new knoweldge and help middle school and high school students talk about their experiences and thoughts after visiting the RACE exhibit.  In addition, I volunteered at the RACE exhibit and was able to greet visitors and answer their questions.
WINGS Guatemala	199916	1	/users/profile/260972	Yehudi	Donor	5	05/08/2014	I have been a donor to WIngs for several years.I am so impressed with the work of this non-profit that I increasde my contributions every year. The dedicated people of Wings are doing such a great work helping the women of Guatemala.The family planning and women's health that wings promotes helps not only the women but also the children, the whole family and the country of Guatemala.Thank you Wings.
WINGS Guatemala	176969	1	/users/profile/233428	diamond.kathryn	Donor	5	10/11/2013	I have been involved with WINGS since its inception and served on the board for many years.  In that time I have seen the growth of the organization, and witnessed the increased number of families that WINGS has helped.  It is my firm belief that the best way to raise the standard of living of all Guatemalans is by educating the youth and limiting family size, thereby decreasing the incidence of maternal and child death, malnutrition, and stunting that is so prevalent in this country.  WINGS is uniquely positioned to help effectuate these changes.
WINGS Guatemala	175078	1	/users/profile/231392	jess.surma	General Member of the Public	4	10/07/2013	As the former Communications Coordinator for WINGS, I was able to spend time in the field interviewing women, men, and youth about their participation in WINGS' program. I heard so many touching stories about how the organization had made an impact on the lives of the participants and their families. I also heard many vehement thank-yous which convinced me how directly donations to WINGS make a difference to families who need the most help. On an organizational level, from the time before I was employed by WINGS, until the current day, I have been impressed by WINGS' model which employs educators on the ground to reach out to their own communities in a culturally sensitive way. It is also admirable that WINGS continues to strive to improve their outreach strategy. Overall, I highly recommend this organization. 
WINGS Guatemala	174432	1	/users/profile/230707	MAB11	Donor	5	10/06/2013	If ever there was a program aimed at helping Guatemala improve the lives of all its people, it is WINGS.  By reaching far out into the rural communities it is accomplishing its mission of creating "opportunities for Guatemalan families to improve their lives through family planning education and access to reproductive health services."  Their approach to educate women, men and youth is so necessary.  Every family member, every community member, is offered the same information and thereby can make educated decisions regarding family planning and reproductive health.  WINGS does so much, for so many, with so little, when you consider the budgets of some of the huge organizations that exist in our world.  I wish them only continued success and growth!
WINGS Guatemala	174052	1	/users/profile/230267	EvieL	Board Member	5	10/05/2013	I have served as a board member since 2008. During this time WINGS  has expanded and developed a holistic approach to providing information about reproductive issues and increasing access for Guatemalan families in need.  Providing women and men with choice about thier reproductive health needs is life changing. 
WINGS Guatemala	173743	1	/users/profile/229893	Kathymw	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Providing women, men and young adults with critical information and eduction regarding family planning and reproductive health is the central focus of WINGS. Not only does this protect the health of these women and children short term, but it allows families to provide a better quality of life for their families long term. WINGS is doing a impressive job of reaching out to those areas of Guatemala where this support is most needed.

WINGS has helped us set up a youth sexual and reproductive health program and trained our sex educator. WINGS continues to collaborate and share resources with us on family planning and sex education programs that serve the indigenous population in our area of Guatemala.   WINGs is top notch NGO with a top notch track record and reputation in Guatemala and internationally. We are honored to work with them to address common goals for indigenous women and youth.

WINGS Guatemala	163499	1	/users/profile/217077	Margaret38	Donor	5	07/25/2013	Our foundation did a project with WINGS a few years ago.

WINGS Guatemala	163463	1	/users/profile/217014	David158	General Member of the Public	5	07/24/2013	This program is almost a one of a kind here in the Antigua Guatemala area.  It is so desperately needed, and they do so much.  I assist a family of shoe shiners, Papa, Martin (16), Gregorio (15), Juan Carlos  (14) and Luciano (9).  The family lost a baby girl to pneumonia about a year ago because they could not afford proper care.  Eight months ago they had another baby, Israel, there happens to be another brother around 19 who lives in Quiche, never comes to Antigua, but I just know they are going to try for another girl.  I have sat Martin down and had him watch your site page with teens talking to teens, but Papa is way out of my league.  You are a great program, desperately needed.

WINGS does a thorough and conscientious job in conducting its work, always being respectful of the local culture of our clients.

WINGS staff and volunteers are mostly Guatemalan and we coordinate our activities well with community leaders and other NGOs. Through our programs, for the first time Guatemalan families in Alta Verapaz have access to reproductive health services they want and need. 
WINGS Guatemala	158497	1	/users/profile/210289	moppy	General Member of the Public	5	05/22/2013	I have been fpllowing the work of Wings for several years and their approach to addressing the needs of families is very innovative, effective and important. An example of their work that I have found impressive is meeting with membets of the army and educating them about family plannng and prevention of sexually transmitted infections. Also Wings trains local community members to share information about the importance of spacing children and  other reproductive health issues. 
WINGS Guatemala	158493	1	/users/profile/210284	ginny133	General Member of the Public	5	05/22/2013	I visited the Wings office and talked with staff when I was in Guatemala a couple years ago. (I was part of Social Work Graduate School trip.) We found the staff to be very sincere and informed, but also gentle and kind. I came away confident that they are doing important work, in a very competent, culturally appropriate way. Family life is truly enhanced by their efforts.

It is not surprising to me that his family continues to honor him by establishing this fund.  The Zakkary Johnson Memorial Fund is based on a very simple concept...paying it forward.

The golf tournament and silent auction is a great evening to honor and remember the life of Zak, a young man who left us far too soon. His pictures are there to remind everyone of his spirit and that is evident in the evening itself. The Memorial Fund donates funds to different organizations that Zak benefited from. The Memorial Fund is an excellent Nonprofit organization and I look forward to this years event and the opportunity to spend the night remembering Zak.

Zakkary Johnson Memorial Fund	159005		/users/profile/211085	MaryBelle24	Board Member	5	05/30/2013	I'm a member of the ZJMF Board; and, I'm grandmother to Zakkary Johnson, a child who changed my life. At birth, Zak's prognosis was grim. The medical pros said he would be little more than a vegetable. I had never really been around people with disabilities and truth be told, "they" made me nervous. Well, I fell in love with Zak within minutes of his birth --- to heck with disabilites. And, through his 15 years he, along with his family, taught me about potential, about joy, about love, about what is really important. Sadly, he left us all too soon -- at only 15 years of age. It was decided that his legacy would live on by helping others with disabilities be included, have some fun, achieve their potentials. Thus, the Zakkary Johnson Memorial Fund. We are a young organization -- founded in 2012. We are dedicated and we care about our mission. Zakkary inspired us as well as all those who got to know him.

(WCR).  WCR is a nonprofit, volunteer-based organization whose mission is serving children and adults living with physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disabilities through challenging programs of therapeutic horseback riding. Horses allow people living with disabilities to travel with ease to places wheelchairs, crutches, and walkers cannot take them. Individuals with cognitive disabilities benefit from the discipline and concentration required to master riding on and relating to horses. This special bond and personal growth can help these individuals to think, dream, and perceive of themselves in new ways. Non-profit organizations like WCR depend on funding help from the community, to help fund financial aid for those individual who cannot afford fees, helped extend the WCR progam to reach those who have never participated, and for equipment.  The generous donation Zakkary Johnson Memorial Fund to WC has personally affected me and I am forever grateful and appreciative of ZJMFs hard work and their generous donation to another non-profit group.

The professionalism, enthusiasm, and openness with which they conduct business is refreshing and reassuring. They are truly a "Great Non-Profit" and I look forward to their continued success!

Recently my self-employment companies closed, and I found myself starting over, both my husband and I trying to find jobs.  The YMCA was able to put me on a reduced membership amount so that I could keep my membership.

I have served on numerous committees, the board of directors and was president of the board for one year. I can not imagine our community without the Y.
Itasca County Family Young Mens Christian Association Inc	65245		/users/profile/71316	Kim E Young	Board Member	5	02/08/2011	The Itasca Family YMCA has been an unbelievable resource for so many people in this area.  I joined 6 months after the Y opened 30 years ago.  I have participated in fitness classes, racquetball, etc and have been on many committees over the years.  I am on the board for the second time. For 30 years, the Y has provided day care, child care, after school tutoring, active senior center, educare for kids, camp for kids in the summer, dances for teens, fitness classes, aerobics classes, senior fitness classes, racquetball, walking, swiming in the pool and swim team, biking, treadmill and weightlifting-just to name some of the programs.  In 2010, we scholarshiped over $127,000. for child care and memberships for low income people. A task force is looking at all of our programs and our building to strategically plan for our future.  We are also involved in collaborating with other groups on whether or not we should have a new Senior Center in our area.  This Y is trying to keep up with the ever changing demands of fitness, childcare, health, senior issues, teen issues and capital issues of our building.  As most of us know, the Y is not just a building but a community. A place where some people meet people and then they call them their family. Our Y is trying to meet the needs of many people.  It is a struggle at times to provide for so many.  We all try our best to keep it going and keep providing services.  Thanks for hearing our story.

It has expanded by listening to its members needs, and continues to reflect the community's fitness and partnership needs.   The leadership of the Y is exemplary.  We are fortunate to have such a jewel in our community.

As a young child and throughout my teenage years my parents considered the YMCA a Family Neighbor, even though we did not live in the Grand Rapids Area.  I learned to swim at the and eventually gained my Lifeguarding certificate and taught swimming lessons at the YMCA.  The Itasca County Family YMCA was my first "Real" job, helping my pay for my first two years of College.  I was eventually able to give back to the YMCA at an even more meaningful level as a Board Member.  We are raising our 4 children with the support of the Itasca County Family YMCA, utilizeing daycare, preschool, swimming lessons, and yes even a first job for our oldest as a lifeguard.Thank you Itasca County Family YMCA!!
Itasca County Family Young Mens Christian Association Inc	63213		/users/profile/69108	Kathie	Client Served	5	02/04/2011	There is a difference between BEING good people and DOING good work.  When I walk into the Itasca County YMCA in the morning, I see employees BEING good to others - their fellow employees, their customers, the children, the elderly.  That attitude spreads to all of us who use the Y. Good work flows out of that attitude.   The Y isn't simply about fitness.  It is a place where people gather because every employee embodies the mission of the Y.  In a small town like ours, residents still believe in buidling community and that happens at our YMCA.  When I had a knee replaced, employees asked how I was doing.  The people I see in the fitness center and the lockerroom are like friends even though I don't know all of their names.  We are simply kind and good to each other because that is the example that is set by the staff.  The fitness classes are fun, there is comraderie among participants, and everyone is included.  I have found the staff to be flexible.  When I was rehabilitating my knee, as instructor allowed me  to use the corner of the pool to do my exercises even though she was teaching a class.  The Y is a place of safety for little ones who are part of the daycare at the Y.  I've observed parents as they bring their children into the building, and the kid are excited to arrive.  That has to make the parents feel good about leaving their children there!  I've also observed watching the elderly congreate around tables to enjoy coffee and conversation as well as meals.  It is just a GOOD place to be for all ages.

Itasca County Family Young Mens Christian Association Inc	62866		/users/profile/68737	Deb210	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	I have been a member of the Itasca County Family YMCA for many years.  I have served on various committees and also as a board member along with taking advantage of the many programs and activities that the Y has to offer.  I believe that this is the only organization in Itasca County that serves all populations, from the infants to the senior citizens and those in between, and does it well.  The Y is a friendly place to visit.  I have met many people through the Y and have continued these friendships through the years.  The staff and management of the Y are top notch, very dedicated, and helpful to all.  I have taken part in many of the activities offered through the Y.  I have played racquetball, participated in step classes, dance classes, spin classes, run the tracks, used the equipment in the weight room, and swam laps in the pool.  All of these experiences have been very positive.  One suggestion I would have would be for the instructors to speak louder when conducting classes for those of us getting older because our hearing seems not to be as good as it used to be.  That is a very minor criticism and nothing that deters me from attending a class.

I'm staying home with my two children at this point in my life and the Y has given us something wonderful to do each day.  The kids benefit from the childcare and I wouldn't be able to work out nearly as easily if I didn't have the Y.  I am able to be a better mom to my children as a result of having just a couple hours to myself and to improve my health. We have also benefited from the Parent-Tot gym time they offer in the wintertime and the swimming classes for our children.  We love the friendly atmosphere and social picnics they have too so we can get to know the community even more. We love the Grand Rapids, MN YMCA!!!
Itasca County Family Young Mens Christian Association Inc	62830		/users/profile/68700	Karen	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	I have volunteered at the Y for 4 years and all I can say is WOW.  Not only are they are very efficiently run organization, they got this couch potato involved and active both with my time and physically.  The group of people that work, volunteer and take advantage of the great Y opportunities all shine in our community.  All employees from the Director to the custodial staffwelcome people into the Y, they are always willing to help with any tasks presented and with a smile!  In my opinion they are the toal package: a workout facility, youth program leader, after school program (free of charge to families and it includes a healthy treat and free tutoring), childcare, summer camps, senior programs and yep I could go on and on and on!  I hope you consideer and grant this great organization the funds to help make it even better!

We are located in northern Minnesota.  The sevices the Y provides help build a great community. I use the fitness center often each week.   We have  wonderful fitness center that could only be created through excellant leadership and vision by the employees and board members. I have also used the EduCare, after shool day care program.  Now my children are old enough not to need the services, but when enrolled enjoyed the program very much. Our Y services so many ages through out our community.  With all the hardships families have had to endure over the last several years, the Y has been a great stable in our comunity. We are a gifted community to have this facility.

When I first arrived, I came to the Y to lap swim and needed assistance with membership.  The Y became the main place where I met people in the area.  My experiences grew as my family grew, from lap swim to WeeCare, from WeeFolks to Youth Sports, and now we use the Youth Center most days and my daughter is on the swim team.This Y strives to keep the building clean and in good repair.  With the addition of a huge variety of fitness classes and cycle classes, the Y is modern and attracts people of all ages and abilities.  The childcare is top notch, and I always felt my kids were in good hands when they attended WeeFolks and WeeCare.

Great place for the kids to meet and interact in the indian culture. Great place for moms to chat, dads to link up with the community around the twin cities. Schedule  runs through the school year.  If you are looking for a great start every saturday morning, wake up and meet us at the Como High School in St. Paul at 10 AM. Enrollment starts before labor day and ends in September. Languages, History, Literature and Cooking classes available for the novice and the expert.

The organization provides a community of belonging, while imparting education about India, its history and languages to our children. This is important as these young children will be the beacons of our society tomorrow. If they are well endowed, they can raise the next generation adequately and continue the tradition of what it means to be Indian. Kudos to SILC for allowing us all to be part of a wonderful community and revealing to our children a little India in the land of 10,000 lakes! Thank you!

Through the classes they take, they learn Hindi, they learn about the history and culture of India and they interact with a wide variety of people who have a connection to India.  The volunteer teachers and coordinators work hard to make SILC a positive learning environment for those who attend.
School of India for Languages and Culture	127657		/users/profile/172743	suryaiyer	Volunteer	4	10/22/2012	Here are some reasons I give SILC 4-stars. SILC is a welcoming community run 100% on volunteer time and effort. Families, some from hours away, come to participate and learn languages, music, cooking, and dance of the Indian sub-continent. Special classes, say on Indo-European music and events like social studies and literature day or diwali/holi day or participating in Festival of Nations generate an amazing mix of fun and learning for all ages. A non-denominational setting, chai every week, and samosas and jalebis every now and then adds to the experience. Why didn't I give it 5-stars? We could use some more organizational skills towards self-evaluations and continuous improvements.

What we found far exceeded our expectations. SILC is a vibrant and generous community where one can learn languages, how to cook or how to drum, and about the social and historical aspects of Indian life. There is a wide variety of courses offered for adults, as well as for children.Cooking teachers go far beyond simply demonstrating a recipe. They share tips on everything from choosing and cleaning food, to storing spices, to how to modify seasoning to one's taste. They give students the confidence to go and try these things at home, and the knowledge of where and how to shop for items not found in many grocery stores.One of the most valuable aspects of this school is that they don't just have set courses that you have to fit into. They go a step beyond to see who the students are, and then tailor the classes to their needs.For those of us hoping to find and maintain a connection with the Indian community, SILC has been a magnificent gift.

PLACE	288007		/users/profile/378209	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/02/2016	I first learned about PLACE when I told my  architecture professor that I wanted to help create buildings that are healthy for people and the planet while also being affordable to people of all income ranges and backgrounds. He immediately recommended getting in touch with Chris Velasco, the executive director and co-founder of PLACE. I began my research into PLACE and thought, "Is this real? Is someone actually weaving in all these wonderful elements of environment, health, art, community and affordability into their projects? This can't be real. I must be a part of this!" The work of pushing for innovative holistic strategies in a somewhat unmovable development system is always challenging, but reminding myself of all the people who will someday call a PLACE community home as a result of our work makes it worth it. Of course, it also helps working with a great supportive team at PLACE as well as all the other wonderful people I get to work with among our current and future community members, regional government staff, designers, engineers, contractors and subs, experts, and everyone else we meet along the way who is passionate about creating these amazing PLACE communities.

PLACE conceptualized a new type of creative and caring neighborhood, and the results have surpassed any of my dream like expectations.  The orchestration is no less beautiful than a symphony with co-creative minds working together to make this world a better place.

We have not been disappointed, and indeed our experience has exceeded all hopes. A huge amount of ingenuity has clearly been put into both the project as a whole and each individual aspect, from the design of the living spaces to maximise natural light to the selection of artists to ensure a balanced yet diverse community of individuals and families.The creating of a community, both in the bricks and mortar (a phenomenal achievement in itself) and in the people who are now living here, signals a radical yet brilliant vision. The lives of all those involved have been deeply enriched.These benefits are apparent after only a few months of the project being operational. The long-term postive impact on the community and the surrounding society is likely to be immeasurable.

The support listserv has been a life saver.  Attach DOES NOT support coercise treatment.  The narrative component of attachment therapy is something that helps our children create new neuro pathways in their brains.   It is ONLY positive.My family is working on this and my son is getting to see that he does not have to be stuck in negative behaviors.   He sees that he does not have to feel shameful and his life is worth it!  The recent conference gave me hope for my child.  For example, learning how to be mindful so I can better parent my son.  Also, looking past the behavior and seeing the trauma to be able to relate to you child to calm his fears.Attach is an amazing organization.  I encourage everyone who is to post thier comments to navigate through the website.

The Board, members, and volunteers of ATTACh consistently work to improve the standard of care that is available to families and children who are living with the aftermath of severe trauma and attachment difficulties. Far from subscribing to fringe approaches, ATTACh actively promotes the use of responsible, evidence-based therapeutic interventions.  I am also an adoptive mother, and within this context, I am particularly grateful to ATTACh for improving the level of knowledge and quality of practice regarding the treatment of trauma and attachment within the mental health, medical, and educational communities. ATTACh fulfills a unique role in this way, and they do it with a high quality of professionalism. Their work is critically important and strives to fill a void that I believe still exists in the graduate education of clinicians, doctors, nurses, educators, and others whose support families raising traumatized children so desperately need. I would encourage anyone who has concerns about the quality of ATTACh's standards and work to go to its website and read the white papers and resources available there.

I was just hanging on by a thread because I thought that I was the only one that had a child that was out of control because he was too afraid to attach to me. He has almost killed me twice now and also injured me hundreds of times. He has even cracked 5 of my ribs and stabbed me with pens.  This group has not only given me the support I need (talking to people that really "get it"), but it has trained me in all of the crucial areas of raising a severely traumatized child. I would encourage you to look at the speakers that were at this last conference a couple of weeks ago, along with following next years conference and the speakers that will be their. They do NOT even allow speakers at the conference that believe in any of the "holding therapies". There are always several speakers that talk about how the brain is affected by trauma and the fear that our kids carry every day. Their fear comes out as anger. They act the only way they know how to in order to survive. This group has been a lifesaver for me and hundreds of other parents just like me. Thank you for taking the time to read my email and hopefully look at the attach.org website to see what they truly believe in. I would love to hear what you think of Attach after reading their mission statement.  Thanks again...Faye..... I am one extremely grateful parent to Attach and all of its members. I couldn't get up each day and start NEW,  (being the best Mom I can be) without the knowledge and support I get from Attach. I am thankful to all of those board member and volunteers that work countless hours each year to make that years conference even better than the one the year before. My hugs to all of you:~} 
Attach	99003	1	/users/profile/117980	RadDad	Volunteer	5	10/05/2011	Ms. Thatcher's 2009 review is out-of-date and misinformed. Back in the 90's there were some attachment people who were way far afield, but ATTACh as an organization has worked very hard to focus on the positive aspects of attachment therapy of which there is an abundance. Parents, clinicians, therapists, etc. are all participating in making ATTACh (and other organizations dedicated to helping attachment-disordered children) a beacon for enlightened and compassionate efforts at helping children who are severely emotionally disturbed. Lumping them together with a small group of early practitioners who were long ago discredited is hardly fair and it is completely wrong to do to the people who are already giving way beyond the call of duty, This review should be removed from this site!
Attach	99001	1	/users/profile/117982	DR.M	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2011	I am a psychologist with 15 years experience working with high needs children involved with child welfare and adoption. ATTACh is a highly professional organization that has evolved greatly over the last 10 years to become a key resource for professionals and families from all around the world. I recommend their Parent Manual to all my clients. The one conference I attended was a tremendous learning opportunity for me as a professional and involved internationally recognized and highly respected experts in a variety of fields. The organization is a tremendous support to people (especially families) facing hugely challengins situations. The comments made in the initial review are both dated and inaccurate. ATTACh has explicit policies denouncing Holding Therapy. The policies and initiatives of ATTACh are carefully based in science and the professional literature. It has helped raise issues for helping children and families around the world.
Attach	98995	1	/users/profile/117969	muumuu	Client Served	5	10/05/2011	I am an adoptive mom of four.  I have found amazing support and resources for healing the traumas from my children's past.  For me, I have found resources for parent-child interaction therapy, holistic health services, Theraplay and healing through stories.  This is a wide network of parents and professionals that are truly seeking the most cutting edge research in neuroscience and attachment.  
Attach	98994	1	/users/profile/117967	mftjake	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/05/2011	I am an adoptive parent and Family Therapist. ATTACh has helped me understand my own children and the teenagers I work with. The network of professionals and parents connect us to the latest research and efficacy based practices the attachment treatment communinty has to offer. After this year's conference, I have great information and strategies to help my organization work with teenagers in a much more kind, gentle way, thus NOT traumatizing them further, even accidentally.To put it bluntly, the negative reviews on this site are ill informed. Attending a conference or joining the email listserve or browsing the website will demonstrate that. ATTACh is committed to healing children and families who have been impacted by the negative effects of developmental trauma. 
Attach	98987	2	/users/profile/117950	dalmspc	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/05/2011	The annual conference provides outstanding training with professionals experienced in the field of child development as well as research experts in trauma. ATTACh also gives its clinical members access to each other via a listserve, helping professionals connect in supporting each other in order to provide the best treatment for children with attachment disturbances. The organization requires clinicians to complete a detailed profile of training and practices, keeping standards of practice at its highest. 
Attach	98981	1	/users/profile/117919	Heather234567	Client Served	5	10/04/2011	I am adoptive parent who ran into walls getting help for a long time with my daughter who has reactive attachment disorder.  It was only through this organization that I was able to really understand and work with my daughter.  I get the support I need and a chance to work with some of the most renowned professionals that have evidenced based studies behind them.   Per the person negatively rating Attach - I find it interesting that she claims that Attach believes in holding therapy or other coercive methods when they published this years ago: ATTACh Position Statement Regarding Coercive Treatment     The purpose of this document is to set guidelines and standards for ethically and clinically appropriate treatment.  In this document, treatment means both psychotherapy and parenting.  ATTACh firmly believes that coercion has no place in the therapeutic milieu that therapist and family create in order to help heal a child with a disorder of attachment.      As a matter of policy and practice, ATTACh prohibits the use of coercive interventions by parents or therapists.  ATTACh does not condone its members, registered clinicians, or registered agencies using coercive therapies or parenting techniques.      ATTACh believes a central focus of attachment-focused treatment is to create a developmentally appropriate  therapeutic environment for the individual to safely work through and integrate previously unmanageable or traumatic experiences and emotions that interfere with the capacity to develop secure attachment relationships.     ATTACh opposes coercion in treatment.     ATTACh opposes abuse in any form at any time.      ATTACh opposes any intervention or activity that endangers a persons physical or emotional well being or that purposely and intentionally seeks to increase a clients dysregulation.      ATTACh believes all therapeutic interventions and treatment should be conducted in a respectful manner.      ATTACh believes that all attachment-based treatment should be based on sound theory, research, and principles, and that therapists should practice within their competence and training and with appropriate supervision/consultation.     For further theoretical rationale for this position statement, see the following:    1. Theoretical Rationale for the Treatment of Disorders of Attachment by Victoria Kelly, Psy.D.     2. White paper on Coercion.     Ratified:  4, 2003    Revised:  5, 2006  
Attach	15620	2	/users/profile/17481	Peggy Thatcher	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/18/2009	ATTACh is the trade organization of a subset of therapists, therapeutic parents and adoptive parents who adhere to "Attachment Therapy" (aka Holding Therapy, Compression Therapy, Rage Reduction, Holding-Nurturing Process, Rebirthing, Prolonged Parent-Child Embrace, Cuddle Therapy, etc.).  Many, if not all of the members, adhere to beliefs about child development that are far out of mainstream.  Attachment Therapy is denounced by APSAC and the APA (see the journal "Child Maltreatment," Feb. 2006).  Although ATTACh formally denounces abusive methods such as coercive restraint and highly authoritarian parenting methods, many of their members, speakers and resources they recommend continue to promote extremely abusive and unvalidated practices. There is a website for survivors of Attachment Therapy:http://stopchildtorture.org/
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	184735	1	/users/profile/241674	olsenj	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I recently joined Healthfinders as a volunteer student intern--I am consistently impressed with how the employees and volunteers at Healthfinders never forget why they are doing what they're doing--it's all about taking care of our neighbors. 
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	184336		/users/profile/241274	JayKnow	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	There are far too many people who don't have access to health care and HealthFinders helps remedy this, providing free health services to the uninsured and under-insured. HealthFinders has great outreach to deprived communities, even those that don't always speak English well, but that doesn't detract from its service to the community as a whole. Besides providing medicine which its clients wouldn't be able to afford, Healthfinders also helps them to manage long term conditions, such as diabetes, and also to improve their health in the long term through fitness classes etc. These approaches are not only cheaper and more effective but also have a positive impact on patients' lives in other respects.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	47708	5	/users/profile/46170	charlie-mandile	Volunteer	5	07/03/2010	My name is Rae and I volunteer as a nurse at the HealthFinders Clinic evenings. One particular evening a boy about 12 years old came in with his mother, for an athletic physical, required so he could be on a community soccer team. I enjoy joking with the children we see and this young man and I did our share of kidding around while doing his vital signs, taking a health history, and filling out forms. Then the physician went in to see him and I got busy seeing other patients.A bit later the boy and his mother were on their way out; the mom stopped me in the hallway and said, "We usually can pay our way but my husband has been out of work so we don't have insurance right now. My son wants so much to play on the team but we couldn't afford a clinic visit for a physical. I just told myself to swallow my pride and bring him to HealthFinders. I was braced for being treated condescendingly. This clinic was wonderful! You treated us as though we were paying customers. Thank you!"She had tears in her eyes and so did I.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45694	6	/users/profile/46577	jackiedhenry	Board Member	4	06/25/2010	I very recently joined the Healthfinders' board of directors because I was so impressed with their ability to provide quality services on a very small budget.  Nearly all of the funding received by Healthfinders is used for direct services and many services are donated.  Healthfinders recently underwent a strategic evaluation to guide development over the next several years and I am excited to be a part of executing that plan.  Healthfinders represents the best of grassroots non-profits, a group of caring people saw a need and acted in response with little bureaucracy or overhead.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45682	8	/users/profile/46566	ldickson	Board Member	5	06/25/2010	With our healthcare coverage changing everyday and the economy we are experienceing increased unemployment. With these factors the need has increased for uninsured healthcare coverage.  HealthFinders assists our patients in getting connected to resources they are not aware of in the community to facilite getting taken care of. Our community/county support from many organizations, companies, etc. see the need for this assitance and are a very integral part of HealthFinders.  HealthFinders is an organization committed to our community.

Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45573	8	/users/profile/46458	kf1100	Board Member	5	06/24/2010	I first learned about HealthFinders through a story in the Northfield News. While I am blessed to have excellent health insurance, many residents of Northfield, Faribault and the surrounding area are not so lucky: they may be unemployed, lack health insurance because they only work part time, or they lack the language skills to navigate the paperwork to qualify for service. We made a financial contribution to the organization to help keep the clinic open. As a recently retired fundraiser at a local college, I responded to a call for volunteers with fundraising experience. While I am not a doctor, nurse or translator, through my work on the board I am helping to provide much needed health care services and education to families and individuals who in turn contribute to our community in many ways. HealthFinders has made a huge difference to the people of Rice County - and to me!
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45546	8	/users/profile/46431	emjcarroll	Volunteer	4	06/24/2010	I volunteer as a clinic nurse at Healthfinders Collaborative. I come home from every clinic feeling so glad the organization is there to provide health care to people who truly need it. The organization itself is well-run and flexible. I feel as if my efforts are appreciated but we are all there to get the job done; there is not a lot of time wasted on unnecessary volunteer appreciation or superfluous training.   I've enjoyed meeting new people through the organization and having the opportunity to help out my community.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45511	8	/users/profile/46402	ellen13	Board Member	5	06/24/2010	HealthFinders is a vital part of our community.  With unemployment soaring, we are reaching more and more people in the unfortunate situation of being uninsured or underinsured. The volunteers are amazing, and our medication assistance and diabetes programs are fully enrolled. HealthFinders has a great reputation amongst patients, volunteers and community supporters.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45510	2	/users/profile/46401	nlude	Board Member	5	06/24/2010	For the last 8 years I have been involved with the HealthFinders Clinic....from the initial days of research, to board member to clinic volunteer.  I am amazed to see such a wonderful county-wide collaboration! So many volunteers, individuals, businesses, organizations and institutions all coming together to address healthcare issues for the low-income, uninsured in our community. It is very rewarding to not only provide medications for acute conditions, but also offer education and support to encourage healthier lifestyles.This makes our community 'work better' by keeping people healthier and keeping our area medical communities' 'unpaid debt' lower, too.
Healthfinders Collaborative Inc	45507	4	/users/profile/46397	mohamed	Volunteer	4	06/24/2010	My name is Mohamed Bakri. I am a College Health Corps VISTA assigned to work at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. Through my work as a VISTA, I have daily engagement with Carleton college community partners who are working on public health access and public healthy literacy issues. One of our community partners that I work with and admire is HealthFinders Collaborative.  HealthFinders was established in 2005 as a free medical clinic providing quality, accessible and culturally sensitive healthcare services, at no cost, to low-income and uninsured residents of greater Rice County. The HealthFinders Clinic Operates on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., at Little Prairie United Methodist Church, located on County Road 88/130th Street in rural Dundas, MN. Since its inception, HealthFinders medical clinic has provided more than 2,000 free clinic visits, and annually more than 100,000 in-kind donations of laboratory and diagnostic services from collaborating local third party medical entities. In addition, HealthFinders executes an ambition Diabetic Program that serves 62 patients annually, thereby preventing chronic conditions that are economically costly to society. This program provides culturally appropriate diabetic care and builds knowledge and skills of patient to be proactive in their behavior.  HealthFinders experience has been incorporated in health related course work in Carleton College, and Carleton students continue to volunteer supporting different aspect of the clinic work such as assisting with clerical, database, and translation work.

Commonweal Theatre Company	183952		/users/profile/240866	Lee_A	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	I've been attending Commonweal performances since 2002 and am amazed to find this company of extraordinary artists in this quaint little town. They bring the plays of Henrik Ibsen to life! So much more enjoyable than high school English class lead me to believe possible. An Enemy of the People is my favorite Ibsen play performance so far.The comedies have the audiences chortling and smiling all evening. Ah the joy of Little Shop of Horrors, The Odd Couple, and Harvey, just to name a few.The dramas keep you 'in the moment'; who can forget the memorable To Kill A Mockingbird?This season was our first opportunity to be Season Pass members (the perks of retirement - enough free time to attend all the shows) and we plan to do it again in 2014! Bravo Commonweal Theatre troupe, I love you all!

Commonweal Theatre Company	31900	4	/users/profile/32731	rootrivernatives	Donor	5	02/28/2010	"Greater Tuna!"  From the newspaper note sounded like a decent diversion for an evening in this sleepy rural and culturally-remote area,  so we attended our first Commonweal performance.  Hooked like a ravenous trout on a well-presented caddis fly!  How could this level of theatre be happening in a town that in our youth was famous mainly for the Friday cattle auction (still going, by the way), and a tiny cinema where we sometimes necked in the 50's?  Since that evening in the 90's we have rarely missed a performance.  During that short period of time, we've seen the Commonweal grow from a tiny cadre of actors performing in a tiny converted movie theatre to become the prime cultural force in Southeast Minnesota and a prime example of what a dedicated group of true professionals can do.  In our wildest dreams we would never have expected such a cultural transformation in our area, and we are gratified to have been able to be a part of that.
Commonweal Theatre Company	31784	11	/users/profile/32633	2lane04	Donor	5	02/28/2010	We moved to Lanesboro about six years ago, in large part due to the arts community in town, including the Commomweal Theatre.The quality of the shows performed are quite amazing, especially considering its location in a smaller community, and compare quite favorably with any live performances we ever saw while living in the St.Paul/Minneapolis area.There are quite a variety of productions from The Odd Couple,  Rainmaker and Wait Until Dark to plays written by Ibsen, including Peer Gynt, all wonderfully done and well received by the audiences.Something unique about the company is how all the core actors also have other responsibilities within the company such as fundraising, box office, and administrative duties which make them more well rounded and more marketable. They also include the interns in this process, giving them a great education.All of the actors are very engaging and accessible and very visible in the community.
Commonweal Theatre Company	31715	8	/users/profile/32571	boanun	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2010	I moved to the Lanesboro area about ten years ago and have volunteered for and attended many performances of our Commonweal Theater since then.
Commonweal Theatre Company	31602	9	/users/profile/32470	mikeb1	Client Served	5	02/27/2010	The year was 1994. My life was consumed with difficult challenges ranging from personal to financial. My confidence level was low and not likely to improve. This professional acting company drifted into town like a soothing breeze. How I became aware of their arrival and why I dared tip toe into their world I do not know. I only know that in many ways the experience I had...participating in an educational collaboration between professional and local residents...in some ways saved me. The actors welcomed me, taught me and encouraged me. With my self esteem steadied I was able to move forward again. I have been a faithful patron of the Company since then. I continue to take strength from the work they do. The entire Company always makes me feel I am an important part of who they are and what they do.Now in this time of twitter, tweets and text messages, human communication and comprehension is, in my opinion, devolving. There is nothing inherently wrong with communicating in this manner. But we are losing something. When and where in society today do we find quiet time to embellish to expand the minds eye to savor a story and find the message and so much more deep within its context? I reside outside a delightful but very small town in a rural area in Minnesota. My work week is consumed with travel to and from work and with work related tasks. There is little time to do anything more. With my formative college years behind me there are fewer and fewer opportunities for me to balance my life with the rich experience of developing stories and flushing out important themes in an effort to deepen the understanding of the shared human experience.   Thank goodness in the year Twenty-ten in rural Lanesboro, Minnesota there is this goldmine known as the Commonweal Theatre Company. It is there I continue to take refuge. It is there I can count on the sensitive, wise professional actors to consistently deliver that which I have lost. The chance to lose myself in stories of human strength and frailty. The chance to hear the intonation of the actors words and observe the manner of their body language and to let my mind fill in the details around them on the stage. The chance to experience the full tapestry of what might be boiled down to a tweet.
Commonweal Theatre Company	31276	11	/users/profile/32186	raeron	Donor	5	02/26/2010	The Commonweal Theater brings professional high quality theater to our doorstep.  We thoroughly enjoy the theater and have supported it since it began in Lanesboro.

Since childhood they have seen countless performances, formed relationships with the acting company, participated in their educational programs...and in the process it awakened the artist within them. Commonweal's "drama that unfolds where the river bends" has not only enriched our family's life; it enriches and inspires the thriving art communities of the bluff country.Scott and Karen Bingham
Commonweal Theatre Company	31173	11	/users/profile/32095	graycats	Donor	5	02/26/2010	My wife and I have been a host family for several years for Asian high school and college students.  The Commonweal Theatre Company's productions are a terrific resource as we introduce our beloved guests to art and culture in the US.  They have connected with plays like The Rainmaker in ways I never could have foreseen and have been thrilled and inspired by being able to meet and talk to the very actors who take the stage.  The Commonweal's devoted professionalism allows us to share our love of theatre with "our" students, and though the theatre itself resides in a small mid-western town, its influence reaches right across the Pacific.
Commonweal Theatre Company	30855	4	/users/profile/31799	TheSeaquist's	Client Served	5	02/25/2010	Whether you are looking for a date night or a family night out, the Commonweal Theatre in Lanesboro, MN has a terrific experience waiting for you!Mark and I came to Lanesboro to camp and ride the Root River Bike Trail.  What we also discovered is a lively arts community.  At the core of this community is the Commonweal Theatre.  For over 20 years, this theatre company consistently stages productions that rival major theatre venues.  The actors and production staff are passionate about their craft.  The audience is frequently invited to participate in talkbacks and social gatherings following stage productions.  The result is an excellence in live theatre that is consistently growing in stature, donors and record breaking audience attendance.The Commonweal not only focuses upon the current seasons productions, but also looks to grow the future through a variety of educational opportunities.  Whether you are a youth looking for a camp experience, an actor or production crew member applying for an apprenticeship, or a life long learner seeking an elder hostel, the Commonweal is committed to growing future excellence.Sixteen years ago we came to Lanesboro to camp and bike the trails.  We continued coming back, eventually building a home and a life that is greatly enriched by the Commonweal Theatre.  The entire Commonweal Theatre community, staff, volunteers and donors, are successfully working to provide a memorable theatre experience for todays audiences and for the audiences yet to come.  You are invited to join us.
Commonweal Theatre Company	30622	4	/users/profile/31586	kelly5	Client Served	5	02/24/2010	My husband and I first attended The Commonweal on a date.  It was love at first sight (with the acting company!  We were already married!) Although we had lived about 40 miles away for many years, and had visited Lanesboro for other activities, we had never made it to a performance.  We were immediately impressed with the involvement of the company members in all facets of theatre operations.  We have lived in much larger cities and have never seen the cast off stage, let alone in the box office.  We soon learned that the Commonweal is unique in this model and is actually a pioneer of this approach (formally known as the "artist/administrator" model).  As patrons, we can instantly feel a sense of pride and ownership in the cast.  Acting at The Commonweal isn't just another gig for them... it is their home and their business.As the only professional acting company in the region, the Commonweal is impressive in the depth and breadth of plays it presents.  We have been especially impressed at the opportunities given to apprentices and new works.  In tight economic times, other professional companies are sticking with "proven winners" to encourage ticket sales.  The Commonweal, however, stays true to it's mission with recent world premieres such as "Ice Maidens" and "Midnight Dreary", and apprentice company performances such as "Death and the Plowman" in addition to its well known classic and contemporary offerings.Finally, we have been impressed with the company members' involvement in their local community and beyond.  Members can frequently be seen promoting and attending local benefits, festivals, and the occasional cookout on the main street!  They give back in abundance promoting theatre to area schools and even to audience members in the form of after performance "Talk Backs" with the cast, and other educational offerings.With over 21,000 ticket sales this year (with a 200 seat theatre!), the Commonweal is most definitely a major cultural, educational, and economic force for the region, and one of the leading rural professional theatre companies in America.How they do all this and so much more on a relatively small budget (about $639,000 in 2009)is amazing. Their reach is thankfully wide due to their very evident passion and commitment to each and every patron. Each performance ends with a sincere wish to "be well, travel safely to where ever the road is taking you, and come back and see us often." We will.
Commonweal Theatre Company	30547	6	/users/profile/31516	holiday1	Board Member	5	02/24/2010	The impression one may receive of The Commonweal organization might seem like a fantasy when read by someone outside of the area; but in fact, it is all real. Our personal experience with Commonweal goes back to the mid-1990's.  They have continuously provided high quality, enjoyable, challenging theatre experiences. We are also impressed with their additional projects - civic involvement, teaching theatre classes at area high schools and colleges, conducting an internationally recognized Ibsen Festival, hosting an Apprentice Company for aspiring artists, creating a live weekly summer radio show, etc.  Now the reality part - all this takes place in a rural community of approximately 780 people in SE Minnesota. We will continue to support and enjoy this theatre company. Commonweal professionals brought great theatre to over 25,000 folks in 2009, and we are confident this will continue into the future.

I am proud to support enterprises that are comprised of people who are driven to enhance other peoples lives by giving of themselves. The Commonweal Theatre does this in two ways: First through wholesome entertainment that enriches our understanding of our being, and secondly by transcending these traditions through an annual crop of eleven interns that will spend 11-months at the Commonweal.Learning not just acting, but the nuts and bolts of paying the bills, then go out into the world and replicate the Commonweal experience for others.My meager sponsorship of this wonderful organization allows me to vicariously enjoy the "good feeling" that comes with helping the Commonweal troupe in this endeavor.Dean H.

Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	31512	5	/users/profile/32384	mariamime	Former Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	-----" I was a new Christian and a student at the University of Costa Rica in the 80's when Eppic Ministries International came to my country to minister the gospel in mime at the university campus. Even though I was part of a small Christian mime team already , I had never seen anything like Eppic before. The professionalism, the serving spirit of the mimes, and The skits were so powerful that I went home after classes that day and the images were still vivid and fresh in my mind and heart at night. I decided to attend the next performances and got to know the mimes and the director Chris Erickson. The next year after Eppic visited, Chris offered a scholarship to our novice mime team. So seven Costaricans attended a month of training at the two headquarters houses in Minnesota. We had a great time of learning , and met people that still remain friends throughout the years. Eppic sent us to our country fully equipped with suitcases of materials to continue our evangelistic work in the campus and beyond. We became one of the best mime trained teams operating and serving in Costa Rica at the time, and due to our training and exposure to Eppic, many doors to ministry were opened in our country and in the USA for us in the years ahead. Today, we are in our 40's, but we still have a fresh memory of that visit to USA and the month of training we experienced with Eppic. For us, meeting Chris and Eppic, was a life changing experience. ----Maria Chacon, Costa Rica
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29963	7	/users/profile/30950	cj2	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	I loved working as a mime with EPPIC Ministries in Eden Prairie, MN, and Guatemala.  Chris Erickson runs a tight ship, and is funny and encouraging throughout the learning process.  I grew in my faith while taking part in EPPIC's mime program.
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29597	6	/users/profile/30608	martan	Donor	4	02/21/2010	As a member at Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, MN I was first introduced to Eppic with the mime presentations given to our Sunday school class. I believe it was 2nd or 3rd grade and I first noticed how intently the children were following what was going on. It's interesting though that I have to admit I had mime-a-fobia before, but there's something profound about this medium.  One does not focus on tone of voice nor are there language barriers. It's a international method of communication and I really think makes the observer feel the performers full emotions. It moved me to tears and I know changed some young hearts that Sunday morning. To me this ministry is both unique and effective!
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29579	6	/users/profile/30590	foodie2010	Board Member	5	02/20/2010	I am a former board member for EPPIC.  I have seen theh heart of this organization at work saving lives in the real sense of that phrase--bringing people of all races and nations to Christ.  the art of pantomime provides a unique opportunity to communicate in any language since it is visual.  these teams are dedicated servants of the Lord Jesus Christ and produce a professional and effective product very efficiently.  Many lives have been saved and transformed.
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29556	1	/users/profile/30570	slopez	Former Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	The first time I saw an EPPIC team perform I was so touched by the Lord - His love penetrated my heart, and so it was that I began to get involved as a volunteer.  I have seen and performed in the sketches perhaps 100's of times, and I am still affected by the Gospel message so clearly portrayed.  These sketches need to be performed all over the world in every nation, that all may see the power of God's love and be touched by Him personally.
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29159	12	/users/profile/30196	richard5	Donor	5	02/19/2010	Eppic uses the art of mime to tell Bible stories.  I have personally seen how Eppic connects with people in the USA and around the globe (e.g., Guatemala).  Regardless of language spoken, education level, geography or ethnicity, the artistic message of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection is compelling and can be life-changing if accepted and lived-out.
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	29120	7	/users/profile/30162	carolbuchanan	Donor	5	02/18/2010	I have seen the fruits of the ministry of Eppic globally as God has used mime to tell the story of His love.
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	27736	5	/users/profile/28819	tony-chihak	Donor	5	02/10/2010	I have witnessed the response of people coming to the Lord through the mime presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  They are able to touch the unreachable is a way they may of not responded by hearing the gospel...these are people that want to see a sermon rather than hear one.  God is using Eppic is a way that most ministries and organization can't be used and deliver the gospel message in...
Eppic Ministries International, Inc.	27666	6	/users/profile/28745	dennisgnextcomcom	Donor	5	02/10/2010	Through mime, Eppic is able to reach all people regardless of language spoken, education, geography or ethnicity. Their messages are compelling, emotional and life changing; truly a difference maker in a fallen world that needs love and basic truth.
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	118513		/users/profile/63797	MB Fehrenbacher	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/16/2012	As an urban designer and architect, I commend the Ordway Center for again providing our St. Paul, Minnesota community with its Summer Dance Series in 2012. This summer-long, weekly outdoor event is an exceptional example of community building. People from all over gather downtown in a public plaza and dance the night away to every sort of music type and ethnicity. All ages from the very, very young to teens and much, much older have a wonderful dance experience with free lesson prior to the featured live band performance. For-profit and nonprofit dance groups lead the lesson, building audience and patrons for their venues. Food, drinks, tables, chairs - every detail for a fun evening on a summer night has been well thought out - a splendid urban event that brings people together. Thank you, Ordway Center.
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59218		/users/profile/63797	MB Fehrenbacher	General Member of the Public	5	12/28/2010	The summer of 2010 the Ordway Theatre provided a vibrant, fun, evening outdoor dance series in a downtown plaza, featuring live music, dance demonstrations and dancing by all to follow - all free to whomever wished to attend.  Dances included the tango, country western / cajun, disco, ballroom, latin, etc.   People of all ages and cultural backgrounds  danced, watched while sipped beverages from outdoor seating / tables and enjoyed these wonderful summer events far into the evening. The following night the St. Paul Public Library featured an outdoor film of the same dance theme featured by the Ordway the night before.  As the Ordway dance series progressed, people increasingly dress the part and local dance clubs / organizations provided true inspiration for mastering each dance.  The Ordway Dance Series was successful on many levels - and - most importantly, as a great community builder for our lovely city, St. Paul, Minnesota.  Thanks you, Ordway!
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	61172		/users/profile/66748	AnnMarie Thomas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2011	In the spring of 2010, my Engineering Graphics and Design class collaborated with students/faculty from Macalester and the dance troupe Diavolo through the Ordway's Campus Connections program.  The Ordway staff created opportunities for my students that were beyond anything  I could have hoped for.  My students, mostly freshmen engineering students, were given the chance to design with and for dancers.  We received so much help and support from the Ordway that, despite the ambitious nature of the project, it was truly a great experience from start to finish.
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	60115		/users/profile/65256	JeremiahLee	General Member of the Public	5	01/14/2011	My first experience at the Ordway featured the most talented high schoolers in St. Paul. The Ordway also hosted a luncheon, for me and others in the African American community, desiring to better connect our artistic heritage. By outreaching to St. Pauls future artistic community, the Ordway assures its sustainability and remains a forward thinking organization.
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	60001		/users/profile/65111	Schostetter	Volunteer	5	01/13/2011	The Ordway is a fantastic organization! I was highly involved there last Spring, both as an intern and a participant in the Campus Connections Program. As an intern in the Education Department, I saw firsthand how much effort was put into providing schoolchildren with the opportunity to attend world-class performances. I saw lots of kids awed by the beautiful theater and cheering wildly for musicians and dancers they would have never been able to see otherwise. The Education Department also does an excellent job of supporting teachers by providing them with guides to weave the performance into their curriculum.I was simultaneously involved with a residency sponsored by the Ordway's Campus Connections program. The Ordway brought an amazing dance company, Diavolo Dance Theater, to collaborate with students at three local colleges to create a piece. I was one of three lead dancers chosen to coordinate the production. As a college student, working with a professional company developed my work ethic and technical skills, and coordinating so many dancers was a crash course in leadership. This was an immense project, and I am grateful to the Ordway for letting me be a part of it!
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59940		/users/profile/65019	Sarah Schmalenberger	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/12/2011	   I love taking my classes to the Ordway, to witness their minds and hearts open up to experience new vistas in the arts.  They write about their trip to the Ordway as profound moments in their college lives when they connected to something greater than themselves, and feel very grown up for having attended something they can discuss intelligently with their peers.     When Ordway artists come to our campus, I see our students beam with joy at receiving a special program related to a concert at the Ordway, tailor-made to their studies.   This organization is a cultural cornerstone of our community!
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59897		/users/profile/64955	Randy K.	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2011	A night at The Ordway is always a night to remember. I have seen a variety of shows there, both big and small, theater and concerts, and every time I leave with a contagious smile. If you go to a show be sure to take advantage of the pre and post show presentations if offered, they are always insightful!
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59887		/users/profile/64945	kochmadeline	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2011	The magic that surrounds me when I walk into the Ordway is unlike anything I've experienced at an arts center.  In the winter, Ordway shows like Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat always leave me feeling warm in the coldest of Minnesota weather - the lights outside in Rice Park make the evenings seem endless. In the summer, performances like Singing in the Rain or South Pacific give me an extra spring in my step and a smile on my face.  The energy and life that has been thriving at the Ordway center for decades always resonates with me for days and weeks beyond my visit. My friends, family members and colleagues all seem closer to me as we share the experience. The Ordway is one of the few gems that will always keep me coming back for more! 
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59830		/users/profile/64856	Kara L.	Client Served	4	01/11/2011	We love the summer activities at the Ordway.

Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59790		/users/profile/64785	Paul Dosh	General Member of the Public	5	01/11/2011	I teach political science at Macalester College and while teaching about South African politics, I brought my students to the Ordway Theater for a concert by anti-apartheid musician Vusi Mahasela.  The staff at the Ordway made this event a success by inviting us to meet with the artists and by accommodating our limited class budget.  Students recalled this event as a major highlight of the semester.  I plan to enhance my political science teaching again in the future through partnering with the Ordway.  
Ordway Center for The Performing Arts	59687		/users/profile/64629	Jon Kahle	General Member of the Public	5	01/09/2011	We have been attending events at the Ordway Theatre since our arrival in Minnesota in 1994; beginning with performances of the MInnesota Opera and most recently attending a contemporary dance program.  What I appreciate most about the Ordway is its diversity in programs.  One look at the brochure let's a potential audience member know that they are presenting a wide variety of artistic programming for a wide variety of audiences.  The outreach inherent in these program choices is palpable and much appreciated. Our children have especially enjoyed the holiday season musicals the past couple of years.  There seems to magic in the theatre at that time of year for our kids and for the adults.

Minnesota Assistance Council For Veterans	152431		/users/profile/179535	Richard42	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	Despite a challenging financial environment, MACV continues assisting vets facing crises.  If the vets is homeless, they provide both transitional and permanent housing;  if the vet has a home but is at risk of losing it, they provide financial support  and planning assistance to stabilize the situation; if the vet needs a job, they provide a program to ensure one is found; if counseling, legal advice, or medical help is needed, they direct the vet to those who can help.  Hundreds of vets are helped this way each year in Minnesota resulting in them becoming independent and productive members of the community.
Minnesota Assistance Council For Veterans	133780		/users/profile/179535	Richard42	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	I have served on the MACV board for 13 years.  Thousands of veterans in Minnesota have been helped deals with homelessness or other crises.  Whether it was covering the rent for a few months, providing housing and food as needed, job training, or other forms of aid, MACV was always there.  If a service could better be provided elsewhere, MACV helps make the necessary connections.  They have received awards as the best nonprofit helping vets in the country and from the governor for most effective use of grant dollars.

MACV is a unique organization, in that both, indivduals that are being helped and those helping-employed, are changed by the experience for the positive. I have witnessed numerous individuals that have had their lives profoundly impacted for the better by the programs and services that MACV offers to the veteran community it serves. In my professional interfacing with MACV, I see on a daily basis, how the individuals that work within MACV truly care about the veterans that they are helping, all the while performing their work with the utmost of professionalism, even under the emotional stress that comes with working with individuals in need, along with the continued stresses that come from being a non-profit always in need of more funding to allow for helping the continued increased number of veterans and their families in need of MACV services.

I provide backpacks filled with basic necessity items for MACV to distribute to veterans that they are working with.The level of passion and dedication that all of their employees have is completely beyond anything I have experienced at any other organization.  They do everything they can possibly do to help the veteran get back on their feet.  Part of their success comes from their ability to hold the veteran completely responsible for all of their actions and motivations, while at the same time, treating them with complete respect.This is an amazing organization that is actually out there everyday doing what we would all like to do - helping to create a world where the term "homeless veteran" no longer exists.

They all embody a profound commitment to serving veterans.  As a veteran myself it is very gratifying to know that there are people who value the contributions and sacrifices our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines make on behalf of our country.  The MACV staff makes the effort to help all veterans in MN that are homeless, or in crisis of being homeless.  The only thing that prevents them from helping all who seek their services is a shortage of funding.  I serve on another non-profit board so I can compare MACV's performance and say that they truly are great stewards of the donations they receive, making sure that each and every dollar is maximized in serving veterans in need.

It brings quality theatre to children from a variety of backgrounds.  Frequently with social issues that other theatre companies in the area won't tackle because they don't want to do anything that might be considered "messy".  They don't tackle the history of the Civil Rights Movement, The Holocaust, Slavery, etc.  Youth Performance Company never shies away from history, when there is something to be learned and taught from it.  I'm so grateful for the years that I spent as an actor there, and look forward to when my child is a little older, and will be able to really appreciate the quality theatre that is provided by this company.

Youth Performance Company	9052	12	/users/profile/10847	McMexican	Volunteer	5	08/12/2009	Youth Performance Company is a truly great nonprofit. I've never been involved with any other organization where I've received so much valuable guidance as a young person. I was fifteen when I did my first show there. I'm now twenty-one, and I don't know what my life would be like without YPC's involvement. I've had the opportunity not only to act in plays, but also to write, direct and stage manage various productions over the past six years - this has taught me countless things about theater, and also about myself as a person.
Youth Performance Company	9025	13	/users/profile/10813	feefoloupe	Volunteer	5	08/12/2009	Speaking as one of YPC's youth, I must say the warm and welcoming atmosphere they've created has truly made it a second family to me and many other kids like myself. I've seen and had friendships literally blossom there within minutes, and this excellent group dynamic has made for great shows and amazing off-stage experiences. I also applaud YPC for fostering both creativity AND responsibility in it's kids. Members of last year's Young Artists Council (a group of dedicated individuals invested in the present and future of YPC) have been faced with various challenges, from how to keep YPC active during the economic recession, to putting on a production (Mutant Squad) in the Fringe Festival, which by the way was written by two YAC members. Might I remind everyone that these are adolescents who are allowed a creative outlet through YPC, and simultaneously are given the responsibility of carrying the products of their creativity through into things like the Fringe Festival show. I know myself and others have been gifted with YPC, and my experiences there will not soon be forgotten. This is truly an excellent organization.
Youth Performance Company	9017	14	/users/profile/10807	Benzic	Volunteer	5	08/12/2009	Youth Performance Company has been nothing but a tremendous help in my life.  From my first bit of involvement theredoing lights on weekends for a show in seventh gradeI have been changed.  YPC provided me with a place to be myself and feel accepted, surrounded by people to whom I am vastly similar, while still praising and nurturing individuality and uniqueness.
Youth Performance Company	9010	12	/users/profile/10800	StevieJay	Volunteer	5	08/11/2009	At no other youth venue have I grown, not just as a performer, but as a person. Youth Performance Company fosters humility, courage, daring, bold-ness, modesty and skill without expecting a perfect caliber performance instantaneously, they teach while directing and unlike other performance companies, treat you like family.
Youth Performance Company	9009	14	/users/profile/10799	mplsrudeboy	Former staff	5	08/11/2009	Youth Performance Company is the best theater in Minnesota for youth to grow and develop their skills. I would recommend to all young actors.
Youth Performance Company	9005	14	/users/profile/10795	Koby	Volunteer	5	08/11/2009	This place changed my life.  There's not much more need to elaborate.  They inspired me to do what I love, and to excel at everything I try.  I have no idea where I'd be right now without YPC, but I'm sure it'd be a much darker place, with symbolism and stuff.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	62049		/users/profile/67816	Julia S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I have directed and performed at Lyric Arts, but for the past several years I've just been a very loyal and happy audience member.  This place is amazing -- the theater space itself is beautiful, intimate, and comfortable -- a great night out!  The quality of the shows is fantastic, people are often totally amazed to learn that it's "just" a community theater where the actors are not paid -- some of the shows are as good as anything you will see in Minneapolis!  Lyric Arts puts on a great variety of shows too, and the prices are very reasonable.  GREAT value, wonderful night out whether it's "date night" or "family night".  Two thumbs up!
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60580		/users/profile/65936	sflorman	Volunteer	5	01/21/2011	My wife and I have been attending shows at Lyric Arts since we first moved back into the area 16 years ago.  We've always been impressed by the quality of the performances we've seen.  Some three years ago, I tried out for, and was cast in, a show at Lyric Arts.  Since then, my children and I have participated in a number of shows at this fine organization.  I've had the chance to see how deep Lyric Arts is involved in the Anoka area community, and the wonderful experience they provide not only for audiences but also for the volunteer actors, families, stagehands, staff, ushers, and others who come together to make a show happen.  I would highly recommend Lyric Arts to anyone who is interested in a good play, a good concert, or in general a great time - as an actor, an audience member, or simply a member of the community.  I'm proud to be a part of the excitement at Lyric and look forward to participating for years to come.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60550		/users/profile/65891	Marian M.	Board Member	5	01/21/2011	Moving to the area in 1995, I knew no one. Lyric Arts provided a great place to gain a sense of community, while enjoying and participating in an art form near and dear to me. It was then, as it is now, truly a COMMUNITY theater. The board is comprised of active participants in the craft and/or the community, people who clearly represent the views of the community at large. This has allowed the theater to grow and morph as needed to continue to be an asset to the community. Now, 16 years later, my dearest friends are either from this group or have joined in the experience. This theater gave my children their wings and self confidence, even the introverted one! My life was irrevocably changed for the positive by the influence of this theater. 
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60549		/users/profile/65890	jrcoldinmn	Volunteer	5	01/21/2011	A beautiful organization that knows what it wants to be to the community and has matured beyond the whims of individuals by developing processes to separate functions. Yet with the cement of purpose that keeps its eye on the vision fostered in the original black box theater of yesteryear. It provides literally anyone, the opportunity to overcome any esteem issues, accomplish more that they thought was possible, and allow the audience to share the pride.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60486		/users/profile/65792	whimik	Volunteer	5	01/20/2011	My family has been involved in Lyric Arts since its inception. It is one of the greatest organizations we have ever been involved with. From a professinal standpoint they put on teh best performances I have ever seen, and are on par with any professional theater in Minnesota. From a personal standpoint I have met so many great and dedicated people and have become great friends with many  of them. Thank you Lyric Arts for all that you do!!!
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60452		/users/profile/65731	gould14145	Board Member	5	01/20/2011	My wife and I started by going to a few shows here and there.  It didn't take very long before we were attending more than we we're not.  Next thing you know I'm being asked as a local businessman to be on the board.  I was honored to be part of the theatre.  So I said yes of course.  As soon as you walk in the front door I feel like I'm with family.    
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60410		/users/profile/65679	Timothy K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2011	I've seen a few shows at this theater over the last year.  I find it amazing that a theater this size is able to put on so many consistently solid shows in a single season.  The staff has been very friendly and it's clear that everyone who works and volunteers there cares a great deal about this space.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60366		/users/profile/65623	Thomas	Board Member	5	01/19/2011	My wife and I have enjoyed this artistic gem since its infancy.  It has been very rewarding to watch it evolve and mature from a small pocket theatre to a year 'round theatre of professional quality.  The staff, volunteers and artistic participants continue to challenge themselves to elevate the quality of each production and to increase the outreach to the community. This extraordinary company brings classic and contemporary theatre to folks of all ages in an impressive and comfortable venue that allows the audience and intimate artistic experience. 
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60365		/users/profile/65620	David S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/19/2011	My family has long been going to the wonder that is Lyric Arts.  From the evolution of watching a step-sister as an actor to today when I have the joy to be able to attend all the great shows provided with my wife-to-be.  The staff is always a pleasure to work with and they don't hesitate to share their love of the theater with those that come.  I travel around the Midwest for work and people all over have heard of the great community oriented Lyric Arts and their support staff. I look forward to many more years of great shows and always will be telling friends I meet to come and share with me.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60360		/users/profile/65608	Debbie	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I started volunteering at Lyric Arts as an actor and fell in love with this theater! Their mission of building community and nurturing artists and audiences of all ages through the magic of live theater is lived out every day with quality productions everyone will enjoy and appreciate. Whether it is a comedy, drama, mystery, musical or a children's play,  the entire building becomes  energized as Lyric Arts works its magic with both volunteers and the guests in their "community". 
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60358		/users/profile/65606	arj143	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	Lyric Arts is an amazing place for both audiences and artists alike. It's a unique community theater that produces a full season of professional quality productions with all volunteer actors.  Some of my favorite moments as an actor and as an audience member in the past 10-years have occurred here.   And as the theater grows the opportunities to experience great theater and performances grow too from increasingly challenging work to a new concert series. The theater is amazing as well. It's a beautifully restored move theater with plenty of leg room and not a bad seat in the house. They even have a wine bar... how can you go wrong!

It is number one on our list when we make our charitable donations each year. Fresh Energy is one of the most forward thinking organizations when it comes to energy policy.  This is the go to organization if you want clear, easy to understand, science-based information about renewable, responsible and reliable sources of energy.  I appreciate how active they are in my local community but also across the state and even at the federal level.

They seem to have strong integrity and always provide an accurate picture of what is happening with climate change and what is not.  They also have many ideas on how we can change what we do in order to solve the problem.

Fresh Energy	36579	8	/users/profile/37369	maria5	Former staff	5	04/22/2010	Fresh Energy is one of the few nonprofits working exclusively on energy policy. They are pragmatic, smart, and most importantly they make things happen! (for example, MN's mercury laws and one of the toughest renewable energy standards in the nation).
Fresh Energy	36570	5	/users/profile/37361	JuliaJackson	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	Fresh energy is a crucial nonprofit in today's environment.

National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	93206		/users/profile/107006	Pete	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2011	NCSGAR is so essential because it helps individuals that desperately need help for themself and their affected family.  Many do not have insurance or the resources to acquire the solution.  One of their counselors made a counselling suggestion that was a need in our son's circumstances.NCSGAR bring individuals from desperate circumstaces to being productive and peaceful individuals who affect many other lives (family, employers and even other unfamiliar individuals.Besides our son, or neighbor has made a total recovery from alcohol dependance to a very happy and positive person.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	92468		/users/profile/106100	Jack B	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2011	NCSGAR has been a part of my life since 1991- I have witnessed firsthand the trials and tribulations the founder of NCSGAR had poured into his organization to make it successful.  Personally I have witnessed him help scores of individuals receive treatment and become successful mentors themselves for scores of other people seeking help from addiction as well.  I speak with sincerity about his commitment in helping others, because I have leaned on him not only as a friend over the years but as a life coach.  I for one owe him a large debt of gratitude of the years of our common bond of addiction. 
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91628		/users/profile/104903	Angela	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/22/2011	Drugs, alcohol - any substance of abuse - impacts individuals, economies and society with devastating effects.  Families are ruined, health effects are irreversible many times and needless heartaches become unbearable.  THERE IS A SOLUTION!  Through intervention and treatment, many drug addicts and alcoholics can return to life  to become fully functioning, competent, responsible members of society.  But treatment is essential to this recovery.  Without intervention, the alcoholic/addict continues the downward spiral into the abyss of chronic disease.  Through the help of this charitable non-profit, thousands of people have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.  The effective treatment options they offer have saved countless lives and families.   
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91523		/users/profile/104738	Lana  A.	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2011	I would like to thank the National Corporation for Substance Abuse Recovery for helping me get my husband back.  With the funding we received for substance abuse treatment, he was able to get the help that he desperatly needed.  We don't have the extra money or the insurance coverage for treatment.  He has successfully completed the program and is now a produtive part of society. We were able to pay back the money on a reasonable schedule, so now they can fund more people  in treatment.     Thank You so much,     Lana A.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91413		/users/profile/104576	Sharon K.	Client Served	5	06/20/2011	This organization helped me get on the right track when I needed it most. I was heading the wrong way and it helped me get the help, counseling and meetings to go to where I feel  very comfortable and can express myself and if have or need help or encouraging words they are there for me...   slk
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91309		/users/profile/104403	John B	Board Member	5	06/18/2011	Having firsthand experience of what alcohol, drug and gambling addiction can do to an individual and his or her family, I can value the cost of recovery!  The problem for many is the ability to afford proper Treatment.   National Corporation for Substance Abuse Recovery is there to help that individual who wants recovery but cannot afford the cost of treatment at that moment in his or her life.  This brings me to my favorite part about National Corporation for Substance Abuse Recovery- As I was taught in my program, there are no bail-outs for gaining recovery- All individuals who receive financial aid from National Corporation for Substance and Abuse Recovery are asked to repay that debt for their recovery, allowing NCSGAR the ability to send another individual thru treatment. 
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91291		/users/profile/104375	JSMinn	Donor	5	06/18/2011	I have witnessed the help that this organization provided for individuals that would not have had any alternative to receive the help that they needed because of their financial status.  With this help, they have been able to regain their ability to go forward with a better life and repay their obligation for the help they received.   This method of treatment and "giving back" is proving to be one of the best "recoveries" for addiction.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	91210		/users/profile/104254	bigal56	Client Served	5	06/17/2011	I highly recommend the National Corporation for Substance Abuse. Without their help in funding my treatment, I woudn't have been able to get the help i needed to beat my addictions.  A first class organization that really cares about the individuals that go through their programs. Thanks again for your help!       Mike A.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	90742		/users/profile/103607	Jackie Y.	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2011	This organization has assisted many with treatment and counseling that would not have received it from any other provider.  It is recognized as one of the most outstanding and beneficial services.  Many individuals cannot afford to receive help from the private sector because of the high cost for recovery and most will go untreated if they are not able to receive help from this organization.   I have personally seen individuals make complete recovery after having received treatment through this organization.  We need to continue to support them because of how substance abuse is destroying so many lives....young and old.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	90731		/users/profile/103592	ncsgar	Board Member	5	06/14/2011	I have been a volunteer member of the Board of Directors of this charity for almost 20 years. The thousands of clients that have been served during this period speaks very highly of the management and staff. The disease of chemical dependency and its adverse  influence on every community has reached epidemic levels. With the continued healthcare problems in this country, the numbers of individuals needing the support of this charity are significantly increasing. The methods employed by this organization to continually turn over donated funds to pay for client services is extremely unique and gives each donor a "huge" bang for the buck.
National Corporation For Substance Abuse Recovery	90697		/users/profile/103545	mal1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/14/2011	A great organization that provides a needed service in the community.  With government funding becoming less and less, organizations such as this provide access to much needed treatment and counseling for those individuals who cannot afford it on their own or that don't have other options.
Anna Marie's Alliance	40322	10	/users/profile/41250	pegkelley	Volunteer	5	05/24/2010	I volunteer at Anna Marie's only a couple hours a week as a child mentor. I am currently working on my Masters of Divinity at a seminary close to Anna Marie's. I have found the atmosphere for the kids staying there to be open and safe and fun. It normalizes their days so they can move toward healing and empowerment. They have creative activities that challenge and nurture the kids, the staff I have worked with have been amazing. I feel heard by them and appreciated every time I am there.    I have quite a bit of child psyche in my background and I find that the staff is psychologically savvy , which can allow for even more healing and health to be present in their work. Anna Marie's has been a true gift for me.
Anna Marie's Alliance	39249	6	/users/profile/40203	shana1	Donor	5	05/17/2010	Anna Marie's Alliance is a remarkable organization.  The services they provide for women in abusive relationships help these women and often their children on so many levels.  They not only provice them with a safe haven, but also help them to get back on their feet and continue to help them after leave.  I have known people that have needed to go to Anna Marie's and they spoke very highly of their experience.
Anna Marie's Alliance	39229	6	/users/profile/40183	seal	Donor	5	05/17/2010	It is so powerful to help women have a safe, happy holiday season after all they've been through. It makes us appreciate what we have even more. Providing gifts to women at Anna Marie's is one of the best things we do each year and we look forward to it!
Anna Marie's Alliance	38796	6	/users/profile/39699	alwaysbabygurl	Volunteer	4	05/13/2010	It is great to go visit the women after they leave the shelter and help them any way possible. This is a great thing for those women that still need a little bit of confidence once they leave the shelter. Just them having someone to talk to and have confidence says a lot.             Tell your story here and help others understand this charity
Anna Marie's Alliance	38692	6	/users/profile/39594	jenna3	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	My journey begins with a hope; a hope that all women who want to move forward in their life will have the opportunity to find and utilize tools that will assist them acheive their goals. Anna Marie's Alliance not only provides these opportunies to their clients, but they are constantly reinvesting in the volunteers as well. Volunteering is a funny thing in the more you give the more you get. Anna Marie's Alliance is an amazing organization that changes  and saves lives. I am proud to be a small part of the change in women's lives.
Anna Marie's Alliance	38619	6	/users/profile/39503	karen-marie	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	Anna Marie's is a safe house for battered women and their children, but it is so much more.  It is a place that gives these women time to come to grips with where their lives are going and how they are going to deal with it.  The staff assists the clients with finding housing, getting supplies to set up housekeeping (many come with the clothes on their backs), looking for employment, and giving them support with group or one on one counciling right there at the facility.  Many of the staff accompany the clients to get an order for protection & in some cases going to court for the abuse they have suffered at the hands of their spouse or significant other.  Sometimes that abuser can be another family member and coping with that can be debilitating.  They also offer after care (after they leave Anna Marie's) just for some guidance and help in getting signed up for programs that will help them to be independent.  In all cases the staff is very caring, knowledgable, and helpful in getting these women started over in their life.  It is a great place and a wonderful organization.l
Anna Marie's Alliance	38572	8	/users/profile/39456	solsweetjayne	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	My civic participation within this organization has become one of the high points in my life.  From the first day, the staff welcomed me with open arms and empowered me to help make a difference in the lives of their consumers.  I am always greeted with a smile- much like the consumers. I have learned different faucets og the organization and even interviewed for a position-but due to budget constraints wasn't able to make the move.  These women are actuating, and being the change that they want to see in the world! I'm proud to be affiliated!
Anna Marie's Alliance	38536	7	/users/profile/39415	shannon2	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	This charity is such an empowering one I can't put into words the sense of empowerment I feel every time I walk in their doors.  They have so many knowledgeable and helpful people working and volunteering for them it is unreal.  They gave me the opportunity to come in and perform massages for the clients which is not only needed by the clients but also by the staff.  I am thankful for what I see them doing to better and prepare the women for life outside of an abusive and controlling atmosphere.
Anna Marie's Alliance	38533	7	/users/profile/39412	jennifer-k	Volunteer	5	05/10/2010	As a computer tutor, my experience with the women is limited to our time in the lab. I really enjoy working with the women, though I often feel I can't help them enough. This is not a function of the shelter, but of the amount of time and energy I am able to devote to it. Some day I hope to be able to do more, because I really like the organization, and the women who I have helped. Anna Marie's provides such a critical service in our community, and they do it with respect for all the families who stay there. Computer skills are not necessarily one of the highest priorities for women at the shelter, so often they are really in need of basic needs. But I think Anna Marie's does their best to provide more than just the basics  in hopes of helping the women transition to a better place when they leave.
Anna Marie's Alliance	38530	9	/users/profile/39410	leladue	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/10/2010	I work at St. Cloud State University's Women's Center.  Anna Marie's provides great resources for our students who are dealing with domestic violence.  They are always available for consultation when I am working with a student and have been willing to come up with creative solutions to assist our students.  Anna Marie's has been a wonderful partner in our community and made a difference in the lives of students.

This organization works in partnership with many other organizations and always pushes to be the best at their work.  They speak out about justice issues and innovative ways to reduce domestic violence against women.

Fresh Energy is making a significant impact in changing the way people and policy makers think about climate change and energy use.
Fresh Energy	37272	7	/users/profile/38000	curt	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2010	Fresh Energy is a great organization, with a user-friendly web site that provides me with all the information I need to be an advocate for clean, alternative energies. I can read up on current policy, learn more by linking to their list of publications, receive suggestions on what I can do further the cause. Their newsletter is well-written and balanced in a way that allows longtime subscribers to stay interested without talking over the heads of newcomers.This organization has inspired me to take an active role in the pursuit of clean energy solutions, and I, in turn, have spread the word to my friends, family and colleagues.I feel good knowing an organization like Fresh Energy is working as hard as they do for the benefit of us all.
Fresh Energy	37176	8	/users/profile/37914	billy1	Volunteer	5	04/27/2010	The people at Fresh Energy are very knowledgeable, committed to the environment and doing things based upon science.  They seem to have strong integrity and always provide an accurate picture of what is happening with climate change and what is not.  They also have many ideas on how we can change what we do in order to solve the problem.  I was impressed how they tied it all together  energy, electricity, coal, oil, wind, cars, transportation, etc.
Fresh Energy	37166	5	/users/profile/37906	cskoog	Former staff	5	04/27/2010	Fresh Energy is hands-down the most effective organization I have worked for. Their clear and focused mission to change energy laws and practices to make them cleaner and more economically viable in the 21st century allows Fresh Energy to dig deep into an extremely complex issue. All staff work collaboratively to achieve a high level of productivity, and the end result is strong policy advocacy backed by a team of communications and media specialists. Fresh Energy stands out in the world of nonprofits due to its clear focus and commitment to excellency in all areas.
Fresh Energy	37112	4	/users/profile/37864	heamurp2411	Donor	5	04/27/2010	I love Fresh Energy!  They are THE organization I trust to provide research, advocacy and policy models which will help the US create a more modern, innovative, clean and efficient energy system.  I appreciate their focus on local as well as national issues and believe that their emphasis on research and education as well as taking action makes for a powerful approach to social change.
Fresh Energy	36702	6	/users/profile/37490	j-k	Client Served	5	04/23/2010	Fresh Energy is a great site and I highly recommend it. They promote green energy and green values and that is very important to me!
Fresh Energy	36664	6	/users/profile/37453	mark72029	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	I can't think of a more positive non-profit than Fresh Energy. The thing I think I respect the most about Fresh Energy is the employees. They truly practice what they preach, and are extremely dedicated and passionate about their great cause.
Fresh Energy	36579	8	/users/profile/37369	maria5	Former staff	5	04/22/2010	Fresh Energy is one of the few nonprofits working exclusively on energy policy. They are pragmatic, smart, and most importantly they make things happen! (for example, MN's mercury laws and one of the toughest renewable energy standards in the nation).
Fresh Energy	36570	5	/users/profile/37361	JuliaJackson	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	Fresh energy is a crucial nonprofit in today's environment. They are a team of organized and dedicated employees who are committed to doing the best work possible to make sure that our country can have a clean energy future! I now work for a different nonprofit and we frequently use Fresh Energy as a source of advice, expertise, and to partner on various issues.
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	248558		/users/profile/336296	Lovethisbreed	Client Served	5	07/15/2015	As an officer in a local keeshond rescue organization, we have turned to KSRF over the years when funding was low, needs were high, and a foster had an urgent need.  KSRF has always been there and provided us with the monetary support needed to care for our fosters.  We try to be independent and do our own fundraising, but sometimes it just isn't enough.  It helps us to be able to take in that new foster with special needs when no one else can help them. The funding criteria used by KSRF has always been published, known, and followed without exception.  Even when others may not have agreed with their criteria, they knew what it was and that it would be properly followed.  As in all issues being discussed in social media today, there are extreme opinions on both sides of the issue.  I hope the current dissention by a group of individuals currently in conflict over KSRF funding policies, do not irreparably harm everyone's ability to fundraise for this breed.   
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238707	3	/users/profile/324093	Katidid	Volunteer	5	03/01/2015	KSRF has been and still IS successfully aiding FOSTER parents of Keeshonden dogs all over the US from REPUTABLE rescue organizations. They have and will work hand and hand copacetically for the past 19+ years with these groups. BEWARE there are people and groups calling themselves "Rescue" or "experts" when in reality they may have been recipients of a rescue dog from a rescue org. That in itself doesn't mean they themselves KNOW or have DONE the actual rescuing. Many of the negative remarks here are from people who have a personal agenda for one group of Puppy Mill dogs. They have been secretive about where the numerous fundings are going and have tried on many occasions to by pass rules that have been set many years ago. The people I speak of are running an operation  unethically, unprofessionally and irresponsibly. Just because they "helped" to drive a dog a few miles or are sitting on the bleachers cheering others on doesn't make them a rescuer. Many are just parroting opinions set forth by others without actual KNOWLEDGE of what they are speaking of, they may have contributed to one of the many auctions run by KSRF but they certainly have never supported them for all the years they've been doing their great work. Many of these people just learned about KSRF within the last 18 months and still have no clue about the work they've done for the Keeshonden community, many are ruining the good name of these organizations that have worked tirelessly to build successful relationships with trusted organizations and vets over the past 20+ years.  ALL KSRF Financials are there for the public to see, no need to hide behind curtains. DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK. KSRF has and has always had a excellent record of integrity and support.
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238606	4	/users/profile/323953	KeesieSmiles	Donor	5	02/26/2015	Thank you, thank you, thank you KSRF!!! My  two sweet Keeshond babies were able to receive the medical care they needed (treatment for severe epilepsy and leg amputation due to a bad car accident) as soon as they came into rescue.  This allowed them to eventually be placed in their forever homes - with me! I too donated to the NY101  rescue and I am thankful that the funds are safe with KSRF - a reputable and registered 501c3 which is held accountable by federal and state laws.  
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238417	7	/users/profile/221647	Susan229	Donor	5	02/23/2015	The Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation (KSRF) is dedicated to providing financial assistance forthe medical expenses of rescued Keeshonden in foster care. KSRF's mission is to help rescuers around the country who take unwanted Keeshonden and give them a second chance at loving homes. KSRF relies on auctions, annual calendar sales and donations for their income. KSRF has been providing financial assistance to Keeshond rescue dogs in foster care for over 19 years. I have donated to KSRF auctions, purchased 70-80 calendars  each year for fundraising plus many of  our Keeshond rescue dogs have received  funding request approval since the establishment of the  'Sunshine Fund'.  KSRF is a great organization--they deserve support for their dedication to Keeshonden!
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238313	5	/users/profile/323495	Kimberly109	Donor	1	02/20/2015	It saddens me to had put my faith and MY MONEYS toward this non-profit..I was more than happy to make said donation to go towards the Keeshonds in the NY puppy mill also known as the NY101. For the breed I love more than life,if my feet could have been on the ground when these dogs where pulled I would have. I could not so I asked what ever could I do to help,,,I bought Kennals and fed-ex them on new yrs eve as I recall. I wrote checks to go toward these Rescued KEES with the understanding it was to be used for these Dogs,under this NY KEES PUPPY MILL DOGS...I was amazed at the THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of dollars we as a group where able to call upon KEES lovers from across the world.....Such a great cause,Such a Fantastic RESCUE.However,it is now CLEARLY EVIDENT  the aprox $30,000 dollars of charitable and tax deductible donations that where solicited on behalf of the NY KEES RESCUSE has never been deligated to actual cause where it stands now...Why is there no transparency or no addressing this grieveice??As a DONAR I believe I am justified to aggressively inquire as to why these donated funds have yet to be transferred toward the mission they where solicited for.This is not a PETTY thing to most of us,,,OUR DOGS ARE NOT PETTY TO US...I would certainly hope as I read the header to this page"GreatNonProfits" I could truly call this organization a great non-profit, sad to say I can not..And will no longer make or ask my friends & family to make any donations toward this organization....If there was a negative star Id gladly give a -10YOUR ONLY HURTING THE BREED YOU CLAIM TO CHAMPION....Nothing Sunshine about this.SHAME SHAME.KIMBERLY G.
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238226	8	/users/profile/323355	wcsdcelt	Donor	5	02/18/2015	KSRF has provided funding to all Keeshond rescuers throughout the USA for 19 years. The funds raised through auctions and calendar sales are used exclusively for the veterinary care of rescued keeshonden. With the help of KSRF funding, rescuers throughout the country have been able to rescue our beloved breed and provide the foster dogs with the veterinary care needed to get them healthy and into the safety of a loving adoptive home.  I am a long time Keeshond rescuer and supporter of KSRF and will continue to be. KSRF recognizes the fiduciary responsibility it has to its donors to protect the fund from fraudulent funding requests. KSRF  adheres to long established funding criteria to ensure the fund remains viable and able to continue its mission of helping Keeshond rescuers with veterinary expenses. Without KSRF's financial support, Keeshond rescue in many areas would cease due to rescuers ' financial constraints. If a 10 star rating were available, I would give KSRF all 10 stars. 
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238218	12	/users/profile/323350	Karla Z.	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2015	Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation has been helping thousands of Keeshonden for the last 19 years. The recent drama is just that, drama from a select few who aren't happy unless they are complaining about something.  It's a shame they are trying to damage the reputation of a wonderful foundation who is only there to help the dogs. Keep up the GREAT work KSRF!!  Karla Zimbelman
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238216	11	/users/profile/323344	Brenda75	Donor	5	02/18/2015	I have both donated to and received funds from KSRF over the last ten years. This is the only organization that I am aware of which focuses solely on veterinarian expenses to support rescuers who foster Keeshonden.  In all my dealings I have found the organization to be transparent, honest and to fulfill their stated objectives. As the owner of several Keeshonden, some from rescue groups, and an occasional foster person for rescue, I am very grateful for the work this organization does with integrity each day. 
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238191	6	/users/profile/323302	trulynightwing	Volunteer	1	02/18/2015	I have been helping to rescue Keeshonden for close to 20 years now and this is the first time I have seen such petty disregard for the dogs themselves so blatantly.  KSRO has control of a fund that has been designated to help pay for expenses related to a group of rescued dogs referred to as "the 101". But, for reasons they are not divulging, they are refusing to pay legitimate bills submitted to them in the requested manner and in a timely fashion.  I do not understand.  Why are they not fulfilling their end of the agreement?
Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation	238189	7	/users/profile/323300	Gregg B.	Donor	1	02/18/2015	I am a long time Keshond rescuer, currently having my 4th, 5th and 6th rescued Keeshonden. In the years past this organization set the standard in the non-profit world. That however has changed in recent years. Now, KSRF seemingly operates in a manner where transparency does not exist, expenditures of your donor dollars are arbitrarily applied or denied, and specifically earmarked funds for a particular large scale rescue effort have been secretly shifted. Legitimate costs have been covered for one of the specific rescued Keeshonden and denied for another Keeshond from the same specific rescue effort. No legitimate explanation offered, contradictory communications given and a complete lack of transparency seem to be business as usual these days. The general atmosphere fostered by KSRF as of late seems to be they aren't accountable to anyone.  Very disappointing to see the good name and prior great work undone in recent years. You have about $30k of funds specifically raised for these particular rescues. The money is not yours, it is theirs. You are failing to fulfill your mission and failing to manage their money. You should turn the money over to the non-profit they have specified. To my knowledge, at no time did the donors give you their donations. You've managed to pirate the funds and now deny communications.  Donors beware! On more than one occasion KSRF has said the same empty words regarding baseless allegations and that legitimate vet expenses being covered. The only thing apparently libelous is their statement that the allegation is libelous. Material fact: two NY 101 rescues in have had legitimate veterinary issues and required surgical treatments. One dog's treatment was covered completely and the other's has not been covered completely. This is since KSRF has taken control of the NY 101 funds. There is an obvious lack of consistency, lack of transparency and a very debilitating lack of communication. If the allegations are truly baseless and somehow convoluted, please share. If I'm mistaken or the facts as I know them are incorrect, I'll be the first to publicly apologize and rally all I know to once again support the Keeshond Sunshine Rescue Foundation. Somehow though, I don't think I'll be apologizing anytime soon because your statements thus far have been void of fact, loaded with contradiction and empty promises of a forthcoming full response.  2/18/15 - 0905: I had some info clarified for me regarding one of the dogs. I have edited my review accordingly as I said I would. - GB

Pawsitivity aka Pawsitivity Service Dogs	166524		/users/profile/221226	Jim_66	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2013	A year ago, I had never heard of Pawsitivity Service Dogs.   Through a friend, I heard about a kid named Henry that was in dire need of a service dog.   Sadly due to my own medical issues, I was unable to donate to Henry's quest for help.    All I could do was to pray for him, his family and that somehow God would help them.    It has been a humbling experience to read a mom's blog about her son's challenges and needs.Then Pawsitivity came into the picture, the hope they gave the family was amazing.  The folks at Pawsitivity have been able to allow Henry, through Bailey (the wonderful service dog Angel from Heaven) to be more like a child without Autism.   Just to be a normal happy go lucky little boy.   I can not imagine what it's like to have a special needs child, but this organization answered a much needed prayer for this family.
Pawsitivity aka Pawsitivity Service Dogs	166517		/users/profile/221213	Christy17	Client Served	5	08/29/2013	Pawsitivity worked with our family extensively before my son's service dog came to live with us. Bailey has made Henry able to calm more quickly and cope with transitions when we are out in the community. Thanks to Pawsitivity we feel more confident that Henry won't wander off without notice. Bailey has made such a wonderful companion and is extremely well trained.
Pawsitivity aka Pawsitivity Service Dogs	166508		/users/profile/221203	Julie Coleman	Board Member	5	08/29/2013	Pawsitivity Service Dogs works personally with each family to find and train exactly the right dog for their needs. The dogs can literally change their lives--not just of the handler, but of their family, friends, classmates, and other people around them. We are incredibly proud of the work that we do and happy that we are able to ease some of the burdens and strain that the handlers and their families deal with. And we're thrilled that the dogs go to loving, caring homes in which they get to spend time with people and be of service.

They also have a wonderful network of volunteers that are their biggest strength. Me and my husband is one the volunteers and we see how much this needed in our Minneapolis community!!
SEWA-AIFW Inc	142731		/users/profile/189179	Kamala P.	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I am impressed with how much SEWA is able to accomplish with very limited resources.  SEWA serves the vulnerable and under served population from South Asian descent. I have met many people who have benefited from the SEWA and they all appreciate the fact that SEWA is sensitive their cultural needs. They all felt that without SEWA services they would have been lost and completely confused as to what their rights and options are.  SEWA bridges the gap between the government services and the new immigrant population who is new to this culture and system.  I am glad that I have had the opportunity to serve this population through SEWA programs.

We had an experience to participate in older adults Holiday Lunch last year and program was exceptionally good. Short, nice, educational and well entertaining and organized. I happened to be the volunteer for this event and now I committed my self to be there for every program. I am also impressed how this organization offers health care service to the community.

When you are in trouble, it is such a relief to know that someone cares and wants to listen to and help you.SEWA-AIFW not only provides direct help, but also works as liaison to legal and health assistance for those that are not that familiar with the American environment, their rights, ...  Truly a remarkable organization in what it is trying to do and what it does with what funding we have.

Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	62049		/users/profile/67816	Julia S.	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I have directed and performed at Lyric Arts, but for the past several years I've just been a very loyal and happy audience member.  This place is amazing -- the theater space itself is beautiful, intimate, and comfortable -- a great night out!  The quality of the shows is fantastic, people are often totally amazed to learn that it's "just" a community theater where the actors are not paid -- some of the shows are as good as anything you will see in Minneapolis!  Lyric Arts puts on a great variety of shows too, and the prices are very reasonable.  GREAT value, wonderful night out whether it's "date night" or "family night".  Two thumbs up!
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60580		/users/profile/65936	sflorman	Volunteer	5	01/21/2011	My wife and I have been attending shows at Lyric Arts since we first moved back into the area 16 years ago.  We've always been impressed by the quality of the performances we've seen.  Some three years ago, I tried out for, and was cast in, a show at Lyric Arts.  Since then, my children and I have participated in a number of shows at this fine organization.  I've had the chance to see how deep Lyric Arts is involved in the Anoka area community, and the wonderful experience they provide not only for audiences but also for the volunteer actors, families, stagehands, staff, ushers, and others who come together to make a show happen.  I would highly recommend Lyric Arts to anyone who is interested in a good play, a good concert, or in general a great time - as an actor, an audience member, or simply a member of the community.  I'm proud to be a part of the excitement at Lyric and look forward to participating for years to come.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60550		/users/profile/65891	Marian M.	Board Member	5	01/21/2011	Moving to the area in 1995, I knew no one. Lyric Arts provided a great place to gain a sense of community, while enjoying and participating in an art form near and dear to me. It was then, as it is now, truly a COMMUNITY theater. The board is comprised of active participants in the craft and/or the community, people who clearly represent the views of the community at large. This has allowed the theater to grow and morph as needed to continue to be an asset to the community. Now, 16 years later, my dearest friends are either from this group or have joined in the experience. This theater gave my children their wings and self confidence, even the introverted one! My life was irrevocably changed for the positive by the influence of this theater. 
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60549		/users/profile/65890	jrcoldinmn	Volunteer	5	01/21/2011	A beautiful organization that knows what it wants to be to the community and has matured beyond the whims of individuals by developing processes to separate functions. Yet with the cement of purpose that keeps its eye on the vision fostered in the original black box theater of yesteryear. It provides literally anyone, the opportunity to overcome any esteem issues, accomplish more that they thought was possible, and allow the audience to share the pride.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60486		/users/profile/65792	whimik	Volunteer	5	01/20/2011	My family has been involved in Lyric Arts since its inception. It is one of the greatest organizations we have ever been involved with. From a professinal standpoint they put on teh best performances I have ever seen, and are on par with any professional theater in Minnesota. From a personal standpoint I have met so many great and dedicated people and have become great friends with many  of them. Thank you Lyric Arts for all that you do!!!

It didn't take very long before we were attending more than we we're not.  Next thing you know I'm being asked as a local businessman to be on the board.  I was honored to be part of the theatre.  So I said yes of course.  As soon as you walk in the front door I feel like I'm with family.    
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60410		/users/profile/65679	Timothy K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2011	I've seen a few shows at this theater over the last year.  I find it amazing that a theater this size is able to put on so many consistently solid shows in a single season.  The staff has been very friendly and it's clear that everyone who works and volunteers there cares a great deal about this space.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60366		/users/profile/65623	Thomas	Board Member	5	01/19/2011	My wife and I have enjoyed this artistic gem since its infancy.  It has been very rewarding to watch it evolve and mature from a small pocket theatre to a year 'round theatre of professional quality.  The staff, volunteers and artistic participants continue to challenge themselves to elevate the quality of each production and to increase the outreach to the community. This extraordinary company brings classic and contemporary theatre to folks of all ages in an impressive and comfortable venue that allows the audience and intimate artistic experience.

The staff is always a pleasure to work with and they don't hesitate to share their love of the theater with those that come.  I travel around the Midwest for work and people all over have heard of the great community oriented Lyric Arts and their support staff. I look forward to many more years of great shows and always will be telling friends I meet to come and share with me.
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60360		/users/profile/65608	Debbie	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I started volunteering at Lyric Arts as an actor and fell in love with this theater! Their mission of building community and nurturing artists and audiences of all ages through the magic of live theater is lived out every day with quality productions everyone will enjoy and appreciate. Whether it is a comedy, drama, mystery, musical or a children's play,  the entire building becomes  energized as Lyric Arts works its magic with both volunteers and the guests in their "community". 
Lyric Arts Company of Anoka Inc	60358		/users/profile/65606	arj143	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	Lyric Arts is an amazing place for both audiences and artists alike. It's a unique community theater that produces a full season of professional quality productions with all volunteer actors.  Some of my favorite moments as an actor and as an audience member in the past 10-years have occurred here.   And as the theater grows the opportunities to experience great theater and performances grow too from increasingly challenging work to a new concert series. The theater is amazing as well. It's a beautifully restored move theater with plenty of leg room and not a bad seat in the house. They even have a wine bar... how can you go wrong!
Minnesota Ballet	89307		/users/profile/30019	rinselma	Board Member	4	05/26/2011	This was one of the ballets' best seasons.  With a new production of Midsumer's Night Dream and some new company members, the company was elevated to the next level. The company's artistic level is very good for the resources that they have.
Minnesota Ballet	28974	1	/users/profile/30019	rinselma	Board Member	4	02/18/2010	I have been going to the Minnesota Ballet for a couple of years and they are wonderful.  Their new production of Nutcracker this year was innovative and an exquisite sight for the eyes.  What a perfect event to take the entire family to.The dancers are lovely, the costumes are beautiful, and the lighting/set design is visually stimulating.They also have a celebrity dance challenge every year that is so much fun and highly entertaining for the community.

Minnesota Ballet	32016	6	/users/profile/32830	margilyn	Board Member	4	03/01/2010	A transit from the east coast-I have been following Minnesota Ballet for 7 years. My own ballet experience is extensive, having been a professional dancer and Company owner myself for well over 35 years. I have watched this wonderfully talented company grow into a Ballet Company who has brought major ballets to our Northland area. I am now a proud board member. Minnesota Ballet brings the performing arts to children through school programs, educates our audience and has a school designed to train dancers and give children the opportunity to learn the classics and keep the performing arts alive.
Minnesota Ballet	31953	6	/users/profile/32774	john13	Donor	5	02/28/2010	I have been an audience member of the Ballet for twenty years and a contributor about that long also. I think that the productions are so excellent that I have helped fund several of them, especially the impressive new "Nutcracker" production. I think that helping to provide operating funds is so important to keep this ballet in the Northland that I have issued three major matching challenge campaigns, plus contributing yearly to the membership campaign at the highest membership level.
Minnesota Ballet	31912	6	/users/profile/32749	archivist1	Volunteer	5	02/28/2010	I have served as historian for the Minnesota Ballet for more than fifteen years, a labor of love that has given me an intimate knowledge of the Ballets role in preserving and advancing the art of ballet in the community, the region, state, and beyond. I have also been an audience member since 1987, and my daughter graduated from the Ballet's School and went on to dance professionally in Chicago.
Minnesota Ballet	30849	2	/users/profile/31794	lizholt	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	The Minnesota Ballet has a profound influence on children in our community.  Between their fabulous "family oriented" performances, their outreach to the schools, to their classes with scholarships for underprivileged children, I can't think of a better organization for making an impact on the arts.  I have had first hand experience with the ballet by serving on the board, having a child dance with them, and mentoring an underprivileged child taking lessons.  Bravo to the Minnesota Ballet.
Minnesota Ballet	30076	1	/users/profile/31069	harry1	Board Member	5	02/23/2010	The Minnesota Ballet is the premiere dance company in Northeastern Minnesota and Northern Wisconsin. It is quite a treat as a resident of Duluth to be able to attend such a high quality of dance just minutes from my home. The company has so much energy and talent and the School of the Minnesota Ballet has brought dance into many young people's lives. The company and it's school enriches the quality of living in this part of our state.
Minnesota Ballet	29689	1	/users/profile/30695	cdt1	Board Member	5	02/21/2010	During the past thirty-five years I have watched the ballet grow and mature into the outstanding professional company it is today.  It is quite unusual for a city of this size to have its own Ballet company, and I am always amazed at the impact it has on our community.  Not only does it provide an opportunity for the general public to see a live ballet performance and to inspire dreams, but it provide expert training to both young and adult students whether they are challenged individuals or those desiring to become professional dancers. The companys outreach program is another way that the Ballet impacts the community and brings the art to those who otherwise might never have the opportunity. I will never forget a special performance given for the areas 6th graders. The auditorium was filled with busy and boisterous students, but as soon as the performance started they all became very quiet and attentive.  They left with big smiles on their faces and wonderful memories.What impresses me most about the Minnesota Ballet is the continued hard work and dedication shown by the dancers, executive director, staff, board members and parents. It is their collaborative efforts and the support of the community that makes the company so successful and special.
Minnesota Ballet	29489	1	/users/profile/30504	karen3	Former Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	Our two daughters are graduates of the School of the Minnesota Ballet, beginning at age 5. The older one was a Minnesota Ballet company member for several years. My husband has helped with set construction and worked backstage. The Minnesota Ballet continues to be an inspiring part of our lives. The creativity, beauty and athleticism expressed during performances reflect the dedication of the talented dancers. We truly appreciate having such a fine ballet company in the Twin Ports.
Minnesota Ballet	29335	1	/users/profile/30364	ahwskip	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	I have been involved with the ballet almost since its inception.  I first became involved as a young student back when the ballet was known as the Duluth Civic Ballet. I currently am involved as board member, an adult student, a parent of a student, a volunteer and as an enthusiastic fan.  I have seen the ballet transform from its humble beginnings to what I consider to be one of the best regional ballets not only in the midwest but also in the country.  The school is excellent and provides first rate classical ballet instruction for children of all ages. The company is incredibly talented and provides our area with a level of dance and performances one would not necessarily expect for a city the size of Duluth.  It certainly contributes to the quality of life here in Duluth and I am thankful and proud of its continued existence.
Courage Center	55926		/users/profile/58188	Jennifer N.	Client Served	5	10/29/2010	Courage Center is filled with highly professional and deeply caring staff who understand the challenges faced by those with disabilities and work tirelessly to ensure that a person's disability doesn't get in the way of his/her ability to realize their dreams. My son started at Courage Center doing warm water swimming and therapy as a 6 year old. With the love, support, guidance and opportunities provided by Courage Center he has become a 19 year old internationally ranked athlete and just won a gold medal with Team USA at the World Wheelchair Rugby Championships. I can state unequivocally that he would not be where he is today as an athlete (and as a college student) if it hadn't been for Courage Center. His experience at Courage was life changing in a truly fundamental way - he is who he is because of Courage Center.

I am a volunteer instructor/trainer and my daughter volunteers as a Ski Buddy. My wife gets everyone where they need to be, when they need to be there. Our involvement with the program has provided a couple of things that I am not sure we could get anywhere else.It's a fun family volunteer activity that we all feel is valuable and contributes to the health and well being of others.It teaches my children the value of volunteerism. It helps my son to realize that, even with a diasbility, he can achieve whatever he wants to do in life.

Courage Center	55726		/users/profile/57948	Jeanne B	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	I have been attending Arthritis Stretch classes twice a week in the Golden Valley Courage Center Pool for several years.   Initially, I was not self-motivated to attend  because I had a slight fear of water and was apprehensive about entering what I envisioned  an  alien environment.  However,  my Rheumatologist insisted I do so and I soon realized he'd prescribed exactly what I needed.  The classes were excellent.  The instructors were highly skilled and empathetic and quickly helped me overcame my initial reservations.  Since then I have made great gains in strength and balance in the water and found good friends among my classmates.   Courage Center has provided one of the most positive therapies I've ever undertaken.

Intellectual Takeout	164409	1	/users/profile/218489	Marschall	Board Member	5	08/07/2013	It is hard to capture my enthusiasm for ITO in a few lines.  It is working in a vital area, and doing it with creativity and vigor.  The staff is simply superb.  Dwight and his team are the best educational non-profit people I have ever worked with, and are doing an incredibly good job.  These folks are really the best.  I am on 6 other boards.

Intellectual Takeout	160153	1	/users/profile/212399	fireproof	Board Member	5	06/10/2013	For several decades now, students in most liberal arts programs, even at the best colleges, have been receiving an incomplete education.  Incomplete because of an academic orthodoxy that eschews knowledge for critical thinking and skips most of the intellectual tradition of Western civilization in order to focus on topical studies from a fairly slanted social and political viewpoint.  Intellectual Takeout is one of the very few places where a student can go for big gulps of the great ideas, presented direct from primary sources and with thoughtful analysis and application to current issues.  Those of us no longer in college and less worried about the next term paper or final exam may benefit even more from ITO.  At our leisure, we can read background on subjects we want to know more about, contrast opposing and alternative viewpoints, and compare notes with other interested ITO users on social media.  As a director, I know that ITO has a huge following on Facebook and continues to reach more and more users.  But I have been most impressed with the examples of individuals who write to confess that ITO has opened their minds to contrary arguments  and maybe even changed their thinking in certain ways.  That is no small accomplishment.  
Intellectual Takeout	159562	2	/users/profile/211738	Peter Wood	Board Member	5	06/05/2013	Intellectual Take-Out fills an important niche in the ecology of American higher education.  Increasingly college and university courses tell only one side of stories that have many sides.  Or, if they tell more than one side, they treat the other sides as foils for presenting the preferred view.  ITO offers an antidote:  a rounded collection of views on the sorts of topics that students encounter in today's college curricula.   Students who turn to ITO are often surprised by the degree of disinterestedness shown by the editors.  ITO doesn't engage in activist advocacy.  Instead it presents the full spectrum of scholarship and public information on the topics it addresses.  ITO doesn't attempt to cover every topic.  Rather it has built its website a topic at a time, preferring depth and quality over mere range.  But gradually it has built up a very substantial collection of topics. My organization, the National Association of Scholars, has worked with ITO via its "Ask a Scholar" feature, and I've had many occasions to use the site myself.  It is far more reliable than, say, Wikipedia, in its treatment of controversial topics.  You don't get the censorship of views that transgress political correctness at ITO.  One result is that you see students who clearly disagree with some of the positions posted on ITO who become enthusiastic supporters of it.   Our universities today tend to be more partisan than ever before, and partisan on one side of the political spectrum.  ITO isn't a cure for that partisanship but it is a corrective for some of its worst excesses.  
Intellectual Takeout	158607	1	/users/profile/210446	tstauber	Board Member	5	05/23/2013	ITO was the brain child of a 20 something year old over a decade ago. Simply said, he wanted to understand all sides of topics of interest of the day. The question was posed, "How can you make an intelligent decision about anything if you don't understand all sides of the issues"? That simple, basic question, was the beginning of the trail to the IntellectualTakeout.org that we know today. Intellectual Takeout is an incredible tool for anyone that has even the slightest appetite for knowledge about issues that effect the world everyday. From "Global Warming" to the IRS targeting specific groups that perhaps do not see eye to eye with the current administration (regardless of the party affiliation). With the advent of Google, Wikipedia and other online information sources, the ability to be "informed" is easier than ever, but it's Intellectual Takeout which separates the "wheat from the chaff" on the information super-highway. Whether you have 5 min or 5 hours, Intellectual Takeout can give you a snapshot or an in-depth analysis of the most relevant topics of the day. I find myself often running to Intellectualtakeout.org to make sure I fully understand an issue that may be dominating the airwaves. It is the most useful site on the internet today to remain informed in this ever changing world.
Intellectual Takeout	153622	1	/users/profile/204444	darryleowens66	Board Member	5	04/08/2013	What makes ITO a stand-out is its belief in, and understanding of, the strong connection between culture and politics.  It's recognition that there are many top-notch organizations tackling politics and policy issues but few engaging the public in meaningful dialogue around the cultural, historical and moral issues impacting politics and policy is unique.  By presenting its ideas in a respectful, well-reasoned manner and encouraging participants to engage one another, ITO is able to build an understanding of, and a respect for, the principles necessary for free individuals and civil society to thrive.  ITO's innovative use of social media and marketing analytics to advance its message are what first attracted me to this small, highly effective organization.
Intellectual Takeout	151632	1	/users/profile/202455	rjyuma	Board Member	5	03/25/2013	Intellectual Takeout (ITO) fills a much-needed space in todays debate on the great issues facing us as a nation.  Unfortunately, many organizations and commentators substitute volume and vitriol for reason.  Not so Intellectual Takeout.  ITO challenges assumptions and invites reflection and critical thinking and analysis. The sound bite may be the preferred tool of the talking head but almost every issue is far more complicated than appears on the surface.  Intellectual Takeout is a great resource for those who truly want to understand the issues of the day and be informed participants in the debate.
Intellectual Takeout	150128	2	/users/profile/200166	PromoteProsperity	Board Member	5	02/26/2013	I firmly believe that education is the critical ingredient for a free and prosperous society and have dedicated my resources to institutions that support that notion without a political or financial bias.  In today's America (and world), we see polarization along political, economic, racial, religious, and ideal boundaries, yet few people would argue that what we aspire to is a system that provides the greatest prosperity for the masses.  I joined ITO as a board member in 2011 because it provides an unbiased forum to advance the debate of current events and their causes, effects, and implications.  People of all ages, economic classes, and backgrounds can participate in productive discussions and advance their understanding of the issues without the interference of political gamesmanship.  What a great organization built on educational integrity! 
Intellectual Takeout	149641	1	/users/profile/199508	Muffinm03335	Board Member	5	02/19/2013	Intellectual takeout offers sound information from good people. In an intellectual culture that has been weakened by abbreviated attention spans and a general preference for tabloids and vitriol, ITO enables my generation to engage in the civil political discourse that can strengthen our society. I am grateful for ITO.

The Playwrights' Center	60009		/users/profile/65124	k.hawk	Volunteer	5	01/13/2011	The Playwrights' Center is, in my opinion, one of the gems in the Minneapolis theatre community.  Not only do they help budding new playwrights workshop their plays, but they also keep local actors employed, host fabulous events (such as the Ruth Easton series and Playlabs), and provide a number of classes, lectures, and seminars to help educate and enlighten.  Their AMAZING staff works tirelessly to make sure that each artist that comes through their doors has a fantastic experience.  As one of their interns, I saw first-hand the amazing impact that PWC has on each playwright, actor, and designer that they embrace.  My life--and the lives of countless other theatre professionals--would not be the same without The Playwrights' Center.

The Playwrights' Center	59770		/users/profile/64746	Gwydions	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/10/2011	Of all of the organizations serving playwrights in the United States, the Playwrights Center is (to my mind) the most generous, creative, and innovative in its support. So many of its Fellows and Core Writers have gone on to contribute outstanding new work to the American theater; every playwright benefits in some way from the esteem and visibility they bring to the profession, too.

Since I first attended a fundraiser - where patrons could "buy a playwright" who composed an act in less than 20 minutes to be performed by the cities' top actors - I've been smitten. I couldn't and still can't believe such an incredible source of new thought and creative energy is right in my own backyard!

This is the place where new plays are created--and they are created in a manner entirely respectful to the artists at hand. I feel lucky to have the Center in my life and in my professional career.  I am supported by the incredible staff, inspired by the work of other playwrights, and motivated to keep writing for the American theatre in hopes that it can be the place where we all go to be infused with ideas and questions and exciting images and complexity.

Goodwill Industries Inc	153538		/users/profile/204336	masterroach727	Donor	2	04/08/2013	I donate to this charity all of the time.  I am bothered that when my aunt was dying of cancer, my uncle and her had no money because he was caring for her.  The Goodwill actually charged him $49.00 for the use of a wheel chair.  This makes me mad!!!  They needed the charity!  The charity was not there for them.  My uncle received a card from us after my aunt passed and the first thing he did was thank us and drove to the Goodwill to pay them the $49.00.  He couldn't even put that money towards her burial.  The only reason I donate items to this charity is because I have things to get rid of and this charity is the closest to where I live.
Goodwill Industries Inc	26650	6	/users/profile/27661	Brian	Board Member	5	01/30/2010	Goodwill/Easter Seals of Minnesota is one of the most remarkable non-profits I have been in contact with.  The organization continues to innovate and find new ways to execute its mission of assisting those with barriers to employment and education.  G/ES is well-managed, has a fully engaged board and volunteer base, and works diligently to maximize the return on donors' contributions.  I have been involved with G/ES for about 15 years, as a board member, a donor, and a volunteer.  And I will continue to support the organization because of its high quality work.
Goodwill Industries Inc	26364	4	/users/profile/27405	Fred	Board Member	5	01/27/2010	G/ES Minnesota's life-time commitment to the full employment and economic participation of our consumers is the reason I am actively involved with this organization, even though I live in Wisconsin. The organization's values and daily practices of G/ES staff are (a) to provide the best vocational services, experiences, and supports needed by a consumer to get a good job in an occupation they want and (b) to remain available to consumers after employed and as they wish to improve or advance in their careers. For them, it is not just about training or getting a client a job, it is about helping ensure they become viable economically self-sufficient members of our communities, whether in Minnesota or in Wisconsin. In 2006, I was privileged to lead a taskforce for National Easter Seals to identify a best-practices vocational services model that ES affiliates across the United States could adopt. The G/ES's best-practices features are core to the service model we recommended for adoption by ES nationally.
Goodwill Industries Inc	26314	1	/users/profile/27351	Nancy	Volunteer	5	01/27/2010	Goodwill Easter Seals delivers so much for the dollars they raise in selling the goods our community  donates.  They provide job readiness training, skill training and most importantly the tools and belief in an individual facing barriers to employment by helping the individual work through them.  In our society where work is so important to defining oneself, the mission of Goodwill develops thousands of contributing community members, one donation, one skill training at a time.  I have volunteered my time locally and  nationally for over 20 years to Goodwill because it gives all a hand up not a hand out.
Goodwill Industries Inc	26244	3	/users/profile/27278	Melanie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2010	Upon commencing my employment with Goodwill/Easter Seals I knew little of the wide array of services Goodwill/Easter Seals provides.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn of all of the training programs, Social Security services, GED training program, ARMHS services, services provided to non-custodial fathers, MFIP recipients, ex-offenders, etc.  Most recently we have established an actual mental health clinic on site!  After being here nearly 2 years I feel very blessed to work in a company that has so many services available to our participants within the company as well as ways to access resources in the community.  I feel very connected to my team of coworkers as well as the participants we serve every day.  I am fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a great group of participants and see them work towards their goals.  The success stories of our participants greatly inspire me and give me the drive to continue advocating for our participants as well as our organization.  Seeing where some of our participants come from and where they can get to with just a little assistance really makes me appreciate my situation in life and demonstrates to me that people can get to where they want to be with a little bit of determination.

Goodwill Industries Inc	26136	3	/users/profile/27174	j3mb	Volunteer	5	01/24/2010	Goodwill Easter Seals MN is a very progressive organization that fills a vital role in helping those with a variety of barriers to achieve independence.  In an environment of high unemployment and limited public funding, the organization continues to assist individuals in learning critical job skills to obtain and advance in jobs.  The organization's funding mechanism, where most of the funds come from sales in its own retail stores, is unique. Hearing the success stories of GES participants is both uplifting and gratifying and makes the volunteer experience incredibly worthwhile.

Further, the progressive nature of this organization allows clients the ability to be assisted in many different areas of service including Mental and Rehabilitative Health.  The mission of Goodwill has remained constant, yet, continues to serve a broader base of individuals as needs arise.  The administration and staff of G/ES is committed to identifying new client challenges and addressing each one in order to more efficiently and effectively serve as many people as possible.
Goodwill Industries Inc	26029	3	/users/profile/27056	clh1234	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/22/2010	Goodwill/Easter Seals has been a remarkable experience for me.  Not a single day has gone by that I haven't thouroughly enjoyed my job here at GES.  Each day brings a sense of overwhelming passion and pride and those postive experiences at work translate into even more positive experiences outside of work. The people we serve are extremely appreciative of our efforts and goodwill/easter seals encourages us to exhaust every effort possible in making sure each participants needs are fully met.  What I most enjoy is Goodwill/Easter Seals allows us to develop long lasting relationships with our participants. To be able to change lives the way we do is a rewarding experience that I feel very fortunate to call my job.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	37833	7	/users/profile/38548	dpbroc	Donor	5	05/03/2010	MEP has great people who are well situated at the legislature to effectively represent the general environmental community. They are not shrill, obnoxious and intolerant of other viewpoints, but rather try to help educate and facilitate decision making that allows for long range environmental stewardship. I think you get excellent
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	37095	4	/users/profile/37853	florence-hedeen	Volunteer	5	04/27/2010	The research and talking points provided to me and to the legislators was complete and succinct.  Our message wasn't to stop mining, but to insure environmental protection into the future.  I continue to receive a stream of email communications about opportunities to make a difference through the Minnesota Environmental Partnership.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	36974	6	/users/profile/37736	lynngi	Volunteer	5	04/26/2010	Excellent staff who stay on top of issues, working with the Legislature and building public support for environmental issues. What I found most impressive is both the depth of knowledge of every staff member, and their ability to use that knowledge to make environmental issues a top priority at the Capitol.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	36764	4	/users/profile/37546	Kathryn	Board Member	5	04/23/2010	The Minnesota Environmental Partnership is an indispensable organization for supporting and facilitating environmental leadership and policy action in the state. This organization is what helps make Minnesota the great, green state that it is.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	36608	4	/users/profile/37398	cathyp1	Board Member	5	04/22/2010	I served on the MEP board for many years, so I was able to see firsthand what a fine organization it is. Staff members are incredibly dedicated and creative. The ED is bright, politically savvy, and inspiring. I appreciate MEP most for its ability to bring people together to talk about environmental issues in a productive, respectful manner. MEP has had great success in moving forward environmental policy because it is able to build coalitions and work with all stripes of people. I was honored to be part of such an effective group.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	36600	4	/users/profile/37389	skawakami	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/22/2010	As one of the 80+ member groups of MEP, I can testify to MEP's efficacy, smart strategy, and tangible results. Their targeted focus helps leverage the power of all of the environmental groups in the state to get behind the same issue, at the same time to achieve results. MEP's staff is smart, savvy, and true experts of the field.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	35791	10	/users/profile/36587	connie3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/14/2010	For the past five years, I have variously been a volunteer, staff person, contractor and general fan of MEP. The organization does an amazing job of creating collaboration among its many member organizations, and manages to develop a consensus around legislative priorities each year (among other activities). This is impressive since there are so many varying interests in the environmental field. The staff is smart, effective and positive.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	35774	10	/users/profile/36573	coachangela	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/14/2010	As a reporter for an online newspaper, I find the daily newswatch to be extremely helpful. MEP pulls together environmental news from all over the state into logical categories for readers to investigate.I also keep a sharp eye out for volunteer opportunities through the MEP member groups. It's so helpful to have one umbrella organization that forms a powerful coalition to forward the cause of environmental progress and protection.
Minnesota Environmental Partnership	35482	7	/users/profile/36314	pharoh	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	Have been involved at the Capitol.  MEP keeps us informed about environmental bills so that we can talk to our legislators knowledgeably.  Also, tells us what is going on environmentally all over the state. MEP gets diverse groups to cooperate and work together, e.g. to try and get money back into the state budget to protect wetlands.
Sisters' Camelot	155503	2	/users/profile/206426	heartyeater,	Client Served	5	04/20/2013	Sister's Camelot does tons of good for my community distributing free organic food. Fresh Produce even! 
Sisters' Camelot	305673		/users/profile/396945	Majerash	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	They just pick up and give out organic food before it just gets tossed. Grass-roots organization that simply wants to share healthy produce!
Sisters' Camelot	290208	2	/users/profile/380503	Kathleen114	General Member of the Public	1	05/17/2016	Unfortunately, the first I have heard of this non-profit organization was when a volunteer came to my house soliciting for donations and the transaction was less than pleasant to say the least.  As it started off positive and the lady was pleasant as she showed me pictures and told me the good they were doing in the community.  As I was in my yard and did not have cash on me, I was honestly interested in finding out more as I had never heard of Sisters' Camelot and wanted to learn how I  could possibly support them with funds.  Well I asked her if she had a brochure and she explained the cost/value of handing out flyers.  Made sense, I thought, I totally understood the logic.  However, I live in a home in uptown that gets a lot of pedestrian traffic and come Spring, I literally have people come to my door at least twice a week fundraising.  I did make the mistake in mentioning that I wanted to just know that this is reputable by looking at a website... perhaps?  She then walked away upset and said that she was going to ask some of my neighbors who cared???  And, I probably needed the money more to fix my ass-broken yard?""  What!!!  Let's just say it went downhill from there.  I'm sure your organization does wonderful work.  However, I think that this woman who is currently representing your company by fundraising is a poor representation and I would seriously rethink having her fundraising by herself.... or better yet.. fund her some anger management courses.    On the bright side, I sure do know about your organization now...  
Sisters' Camelot	279866	2	/users/profile/369823	Somali_hero	Volunteer	5	02/11/2016	This organization has given free organic food to the Minneapolis area for over 19 years.  Working primarily with a volunteer staff, all of the cultures of Minneapolis  come through thebus on a regular basis.  This organization no longer focuses on canvasing.  Unlike other non profits in the area whose main focus is on profit and status.  This organization has given millions of pounds of free organic food to the poorest in the Twin Cities.  
Sisters' Camelot	279577	1	/users/profile/369580	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/09/2016	Sidters' Camelot is delivering ever-increasing volumes of food to neighborhoods around Lake/Nicollet, Franklin/Bloomington and at the community garden on S.

Sisters' Camelot	188961	2	/users/profile/246629	Bob Robertson	General Member of the Public	1	11/20/2013	Please, avoid giving to this organization at all costs. When their fundraising staff formed a union in the Spring of 2013 Sisters Camelot's managing collective responded by refusing to negotiate, and then firing a worker in retaliation. They later engaged the services of a right-wing union busting lawyer.
Sisters' Camelot	151657	1	/users/profile/202501	Shuge M.	Professional with expertise in this field	3	03/26/2013	the anti-union review here perpetuating baseless lies about one of the union members can be cleared up pretty well by watching this video from the union's public forum on march 26 video from sunday's open house.  right at about 30 minutes into it all the allegations against me are clearly explained and cleared up:http://bambuser.com/v/3467819
Sisters' Camelot	151324	4	/users/profile/201997	fullyhuman	General Member of the Public	5	03/19/2013	Hey - I saw the review below and felt a need to post.  The review below is uninformed, at best, and misleading at worst.  The "union" formed by the canvassers - who are independent contractors, by the way, and can't be "hired", "fired", or unionize under current federal and state law - is headed by a deadbeat dad in the community with a chip on his shoulder against the organization from past interpersonal conflicts.  I know his 5 year old son's mom personally and well, and I am well aware that a main reason he was interested in rejoining Sisters Camelot's canvas crew was to be able to *continue* to evade paying a dime of child support for his son due to their independent contractor status, versus facing inevitable wage garnishment as an employee elsewhere.   As well, the "union" chose to strike within an hour of serving their largely unreasonable and untutored "demands" - which they served first, never with an intent to negotiate in good faith.  Bad faith has been exercised on their part throughout, examples abound if requested.  Sisters' Camelot is a group of well-meaning, hard-working, doing-their-damndest folks who are presently being hit with either a massively immature and remarkably untutored wave of infighting and smear campaigning in the form of an a-legal "strike", or a well-executed effort by a resentful and egotistical man to try to cause this effective, important, community-strengthening organization to seemingly self-destruct.  Neither of these is a reason I would stop donating - in fact, I am more interested in contributing to their cause than I ever have been before.  
Sisters' Camelot	151290	3	/users/profile/201947	Jim_53	Donor	1	03/19/2013	Don't get me wrong. Sisters' Camelot does wonderful work - distributing free organic food in impoverished  neighborhoods in Minneapolis. You should consider them supporting, just not right now (now being March of 2013). Why not now, you ask? Sisters' Camelot hires door to door canvassers to raise money for their organization. For reasons to detailed to go into here, those canvassers have formed a union. Sisters' Camelot's response was, initially, to refused to negotiate and then to fire one of their canvassers for organizing a union. Any donations to Sisters' Camelot right now is a conscious decision to be involved in union busting. Please, if you want to support their work contact them and let them know that you'll support their organization once they rehire the fired canvassers and negotiate with the union. Note that below I state that I will definitely donate to this organization again. That is true - AFTER the strike is over.
Rainbow Rumpus	106433		/users/profile/143788	Carol Ottoson	Volunteer	5	02/14/2012	As a recently retired high school English teacher, I decided to seek volunteer opportunities.  Fortunately, I found Rainbow Rumpus.  I love this organization!  First of all, the magazine articles, stories, and downloadable books are excellent!  Children of LGBT-headed households are often forgotten in the highly politicized rhetoric surrounding LGBT issues.  Rainbow Rumpus provides stories about "families like theirs," which are really just wonderful stories about families.  I'm proud to be associated with an organization that has such a clear mission and so much passion and talent in delivering that mission.  Rainbow Rumpus is primarily run by a dedicated and passionate group of volunteers.  I've also worked closely with Laura Matanah, the executive director, and I have seen first-hand her passion, her forward thinking, and her ability to help keep Rainbow Rumpus true to its mission.  I have recently taken on the responsibility of Volunteer Coordinator, and I have  also seen the talent and dedication of the volunteers in all levels of the organization.  With so many volunteers involved, it means that any money donated to Rainbow Rumpus goes directly to the mission.  These are the kinds of organizations that I prefer to donate my money to.   Leaving the teaching profession after thirty-six years was a very difficult decision fo me;  however, now that I've joined Rainbow Rumpus I am grateful that I have the time to work for an organzition that I feel this passionately about.
Rainbow Rumpus	106413		/users/profile/143725	Kevin25	Donor	5	02/14/2012	Rainbow Rumpus is my favorite nonprofit, bar none. It provides amazing literature telling the stories of families, stories I wish I had access to when I was a child growing up in small town America with a queer mom. Not only do they do amazing work, but the dollars I give go to making this work happen! 
Rainbow Rumpus	106411		/users/profile/37361	JuliaJackson	Board Member	5	02/14/2012	Rainbow Rumpus is one of a kind in the way it serves the community of LGBT-headed households and the community at-large. Through the website Rainbow Rumpus publishes stories and media that reflect the lives of kids and teens growing up in LGBT-headed households. By seeing families like theirs and kids like them reflected in this way they can start to feel part of a larger community of people that are a part of loving families. I am constantly inspired by the positive impact of the website and the stories published there. Every kid deserves to feel like they are a part of the stories we all tell, and Rainbow Rumpus' unique on-line platform allows them to reach families no matter where they live.
Rainbow Rumpus	6212	9	/users/profile/8011	Susan	Client Served	5	07/06/2009	My daughter's first experience with Rainbow Rumpus was at Pride last year when she made a dragon puppet.  I signed our names to the mailing list and then on her birthday we received an email to check out their website for a birthday message.  She was so excited to see her name on the Rainbow Rumpus website and intrigued as we read the birthday messages to other kids around the country.  Since then we periodically check out the website to read the stories, look at pictures, read the comics, and talk about what it means to have gay parents.  Rainbow Rumpus has helped expose her to multitudes of stories about kids with LGBT parents and it's helped us with examples of how to educate her in defending herself to ignorant comments and how to be proud of who she is.  We are incredibly greatful for Rainbow Rumpus!
Rainbow Rumpus	6184	10	/users/profile/7983	greenmtngirl	Volunteer	5	07/06/2009	In over 90% of American counties, children are growing up with two moms or two dads. Many of these children may never hear a story about a family like theirs in child care or school--stories about children with two moms or two dads, or other parents who identify as gay, lesbian, bi, or trans, are simply not being published. For children who don't have a strong community of similar families in their area, this can be devastating.Rainbow Rumpus publishes professional children's stories, illustrations, comics, and other media that reflect the lives of these children, and makes this media available free to children and their families, neighbors, and teachers, in monthly online issues. We receive email, letters, and comments every month from children around the country (and even around the world) telling us how important this work is to them. The MN Council on Nonprofits awarded us their Dot Org award for our work, too.Every child deserves to read stories about families like their own. Every child needs to read stories about families that are different from theirs, too. Rainbow Rumpus makes this possible.I have volunteered for Rainbow Rumpus for three and a half years. I come back because I know how important the work is, and because the community in the organization is so strong. A core group of over 30 volunteers put the issue together every month; their enthusiasm and dedication are palpable. I learn from them all the time.
Rainbow Rumpus	6094	9	/users/profile/7903	hrivenburgh	Volunteer	5	07/05/2009	Rainbow Rumpus fills a hole in the lives of children of BGLQT families. It addresses difficult issues tactfully and age-appropriately, and is multicultural and often funny! It also provides an online community for elementary-aged youth, teens, and their parents.
Rainbow Rumpus	6084	9	/users/profile/7895	Cary Walski	Volunteer	5	07/04/2009	Rainbow Rumpus is the mirror that reflects the lives of children of LGBT families. I have been volunteering for Rainbow Rumpus for three years now, and what keeps me coming back month after month to work on each new issue is above all the heart-felt thanks we get from kids and young adults for producing media that reflects their lives. The magazine also has a simply amazing group of managers, volunteers and board members.Not only is the organization a unique and vital resource for our target audience, it's also a useful tool for straight parents who want to teach their children about diversity. Whether it's talking to your kids about what transgender means, or simply showing them that other families have two dads or two moms, Rainbow Rumpus has stories that illustrate and validate a myriad of life styles that very rarely are addressed in traditional media.As an ally who hopes someday to have children of her own, I look forward to reading these great stories to my kids.
Rainbow Rumpus	5816	10	/users/profile/7623	readerwomyn	Board Member	5	06/30/2009	Rainbow Rumpus is a unique online website with original stories, cartoon, and ability to create a community for youth with LGBT families.

Twin Cities Masters Chorale	28787	7	/users/profile/29847	billie-mac	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	Twin City Masters Chorale is a 48 voice mixed choir that sings classical Christian music. As a member of the group for four years, it is a high point of my week to rehearse wonderful music under the direction of Ken Fenton. We prepare well for the concerts mostly held in churches. What do I love? 1. The wonderful music we sing 2. The congenial, semi-professional and professional singers who make up the choir and produce a wonderful sound. 3. The opportunities we have to perform for the praise and glory of God. 4. Last but not least, our director who does an excellent job of selecting our music, directing us, and leading the organization.A TCMC concert will be a delightful and unforgettable experience. IT is a privilege and honor to be a part of this excellent group.

I can see her dedication and devotion to what she believes in and that is helping animals. If we all put as much of our heart into our work as Lyn does this would be a much better world. Thumbs up to you Lyn.

After a week or so of rehab, they were able to release the crow back to nature. They are a wonderful organization and I was so thankful they could help this bird.
CrossingBarriers	118959		/users/profile/161743	EPDebbie	Volunteer	5	07/20/2012	I have worked with Crossing Barriers on the issue of the achievement gap in our community.  CB works very collaboratively to identify and then begin to address the obstacles for students.  They are also very persistent in achieving their goal.  If resistance is found in implementing the plan, they are able to seek difference solutions always with the goal in mind.
CrossingBarriers	102872		/users/profile/136130	jlschilmoeller	General Member of the Public	5	01/04/2012	I worked with CrossingBarriers for my senior honors thesis at St. Catherine University which focused on organizations that promote social change in immigrant communities. CrossingBarriers is well-organized by passionate staff and board members. The staff act as positive mentors by providing students with the tools necessary to develop life-long leadership skills to address social issues in their communities. By encouraging students to actively participate in the community by talking at school board meetings, with police officers, parents, and other community members, CrossingBarriers works to build a community coalition capable of creating systemic change. I strongly support and respect the work of CrossingBarriers and hope the organization will continue to grow and empower even more young leaders in marginalized communities to become agents of change.

CrossingBarriers	99806		/users/profile/121095	Rare Adam	Volunteer	5	10/27/2011	I have been too many programs but Crossing Barriers had the most impact on me. It really made me feel a leader and see things in many different ways. I have gained so much knowledge through this program such as speaking in public, speaking out my voice, most importantly outreaching students in need. We engage students face to face; our goal is to make difference in our community, schools and much more. I am very happy that I was involved. The Wonderful thing about this program is that they train you to become a leader, and the make you do the work with the students. The mission of CB is to develop the leadership skills of youth and community member to improve education. So lets all please support and encourage them by given what you got, money, skills and knowledge.
CrossingBarriers	99692		/users/profile/120539	BobK57	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/24/2011	Crossing Barriers is an organization that is not afraid to challenge the status quo. It is an organization able to develop the facts necessary to demonstrate injustice. They get it. 
CrossingBarriers	99689		/users/profile/120532	Doug Margolis	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/24/2011	CrossingBarriers asked me to analyze and summarize data from Eden Prairie High School and the Eden Prairie School District in 2008.  They were involved in advocating for students and parents who complained of discrimination by the school. CrossingBarriers approach was to seek a meeting with school administrators to communicate students' and parents' experiences and attempt to work with the school district to develop effective strategies for ending discrimination and closing the achievement gap. My analyses used official school district data to demonstrate that the students and parents' complaints were part of systemic problems that needed to be addressed.  CrossingBarriers seemed to be an organization that worked collaboratively with school districts willing to address such systemic discrimination, and challenged the unwilling districts in every way possible. I was very impressed with the leadership of the organization and the role it played in engaging the community to close achievement gaps in education.
CrossingBarriers	99518		/users/profile/119888	Firaol Adam	Volunteer	5	10/20/2011	I am Student Leader At CrossingBarriers (CB).  The reason I am involve with CB for 3 years is because i have never been a program like CB where they train the students to be the leaders in their community and work on any issues you want and actually see some result. I am usually use to sitting in a program while the elders preach the whole time.  At CB I got to work on Bullying project that most Students in St. Paul school are facing today and they gave me a chance to lead the Youth Leadership Workshop. CB is one of great small Program that makes differences in youth life.
CrossingBarriers	99434		/users/profile/119485	Jaycie	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2011	i am a huge fan of Crossing Barriers.  They have been very active in Eden Prairie schools advocating for low-income students and families.  I have worked closely with the Executive Director Ladan and Board Member Rukia to develop an after-school tutoring program to help all kids who are struggling in school.  This program has the potential to make a significant difference in my district as well as other districts in the region.  Some have said the achievement gap is the greatest injustice that is facing our country. Thankfully, Crossing Barriers is in the trenches doing the hands on work to close the achievement gap as well as working to make changes at the policy level.   Great people doing excellent work on a significant challenge facing our Country.   I strongly encourage you to support Crossing Barriers.

Help the Helpless	107808		/users/profile/146381	Jennifer  Gustke	Donor	4	03/10/2012	        My husband and I have been sponsoring a child for about three and a half years now through Help the Helpless.  This organization is extremely efficient with funds received, and certainly does care for the children they sponsor, and even those they are waiting to sponsor.  	We did not know what to expect when we sponsored our child, but all we wanted was to help a child in need through a trust worthy organization, and we did not have much money.	When we began our sponsorship, we were delighted to see a picture of the dear child we were to help.  She was not smiling.  Since we have been sponsoring her we have received a video taken by a sponsor who was actually at St. Marys School and took video footage of the children.  Almost every child was smiling!        Help the Helpless is a great way to help a child in need!  The cost is $15 to help a child who has a handicap and $10 to help a child who does not have this extra special need.          We could send a check monthly, or have an automatic withdrawal taken out monthly.  Fr. Antony said himself that he personally handles extra funds for the child, and speaks with them personally.          It was one of the best blessings of our lives, and Im guessing that our dear childs life is also improved! 
Help the Helpless	107747		/users/profile/146300	Janet Lukesh	Volunteer	5	03/09/2012	I have worked as a volunteer with Help the Helpless for ten years and treasure  the chance to serve those who are considered the least, in the eyes of the world, and the greatest, in the eyes of God, an immense blessing.  I work with a small group of people  who make much greater sacrifices in time and effort than I, but  have the same dedication to funding the work of St. Mary's School for special needs children and orphans.  I think I can speak for all of us  when I say that we are all motivated by the same words of our Lord....."whatsoever you do unto these, the least of mine, you do unto me".
Help the Helpless	107714	1	/users/profile/146231	catherine anderson	Donor	5	03/08/2012	I'll start again because I hit the "enter" button and my review disappeared.    I have been a monthly donor for several years with Help the Helpless and I'm thoroughly satisfied and amazed at the significant progress this group of staff, voluneers and children have achieved.  I learned of this organization through a trusted television program.  I made contact and received a valuable packet of information.  The packet included a map of the specific geographic area where this needs exists, a brief history about the local peoples (their way of life, government, religious and cultural beliefs).  I learned how great the need is for help with the deaf/mute, with loss the loss of limbs (legs/arms), food, shelter and educational training.  For the most part these children are mentally sound but grossly lack advocates with their government and the poverty prevents assistance.  The founding Father Anthony and his staff and volunteers have established a truly wonderful vibrant, living and growing community.  Children are receiving education with meaningful skills.  Many are becoming teachers fully certified by the Indian government and graduates are sort after. These young adults are receiving salaries to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.  Others are being taught employable skills based on their highest abilities.  Finally, I receive udates from the field with written notes from the sponsored child.  This organization is top of the line.  The mission and its execution are beyond reproach.  Bless Father Anthony, his successors, staff, volunteers, children and donors.  THANK YOU for giving me this opportunity to share my experience and beilief in this outstanding group.
Help the Helpless	107709		/users/profile/146222	lifebgnzatconception	Donor	5	03/08/2012	I have sponsored a child through Help the Helpless. They have excellent schools and homes for those living in poverty who are also handicapped.  Just a few dollars goes a long way with this charity. I would highly recommend Help the Helpless as a very good way to help the poor in India.
Help the Helpless	107643		/users/profile/146012	Mary Rose Lalli	Donor	5	03/07/2012	I researched this organization and there is very little overhead so almost all the donations go to help the kids in India.  There is such a great need so this is the least that I can do.  I am making monthly donations and receive feedback from Help the Helpless and one specific child so I know that my money is being well spent.
Help the Helpless	106835		/users/profile/144463	Michigan Guy	Donor	5	02/21/2012	This charity is small and primarily staffed by volunteers, hence the lack of "transparency" that has dropped it's rating over the years. It's an orphanage/school run by the catholic church in rural India, and they take in many children and give them a good education and health support. They also have a good program in place to help disabled (including quite a few deaf) children, and work to get them able to communicate (for the deaf kids) and get them a marketable skill so that they can get jobs. No religious schooling is preached/allowed in India, if that's a concern of yours. All in all I'm very impressed with this organization and it's accomplishments towards helping the helpless.
Help the Helpless	101753	1	/users/profile/131239	Motherdiva	Donor	4	12/06/2011	I have donated to this organization for years and am in touch with the founder Father Anthony.  I have not been able so find out much information about how the money is handled but know they do good work and I have adopted 3 foster children through the years through this organization.  In general education is what they do.  I do not know what medical care or assistance or dental care, etc these impoverished children receive.  I also have been told that boys receive preferential treatment.  I do not know this and wish more knowledgeable people who have visited India and this school would jump in and review it.

Ethiopian Community In Minnesota	190107		/users/profile/244673	Helen2007	Client Served	5	12/07/2013	The Ethiopian community in mn helped me and my husband in several occasions. What is interesting is the fact that the community doesn;t have a lot of resources and yet helps a lot of individuals in housing and job search. Keep it up guys
Ethiopian Community In Minnesota	187639		/users/profile/244673	Helen2007	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2013	This community provided great support letter for my father. The gentleman who helped me was professional, compassionate and understanding. I highly recommend the community.
Ethiopian Community In Minnesota	188112		/users/profile/245368	Rekik	Volunteer	3	11/08/2013	I just volunteered for Ethiopian Community in Minnesota with my friend. We had so much fun contacting other fellow Ethiopians and reminding them to get involved in anyway they can. We had profoundingly positive reception from everyone we called too, it was inspiring. I will definetly volunteer again to get this organization going stronger than it already is. 
Ethiopian Community In Minnesota	187739		/users/profile/244810	Peace4All	Board Member	5	11/04/2013	I served as a board member of this Ethiopian Community about 10 years ago. After my term is over, I still volunteer annually, especially on the Ethiopian New Year. Although Ethiopian Community had had its challenges, things are turning around since  2012. In fact, the recent initiative of the Community to acquire its own building is a testament of the progress.

Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	202153		/users/profile/263792	gottadoit	Donor	5	06/07/2014	Having long been a donor to Goodwill and other conventional channels, I tried Hallie Q. Brown and was astonished to find out how much of an impact my donated clothing and household items had directly on families right near us. It is good to know that every dollar and every item and every pound of food goes directly to people who need it at a local, community based organisation.
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102172		/users/profile/132358	Kevin21	General Member of the Public	5	12/10/2011	I think the work that is going on here is great.   The leadership of HQB Center has created great awareness in the community. 
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102154		/users/profile/132292	WFMStPaul	Donor	5	12/10/2011	At Whole Foods Market, we really believe that not all calories are created equal, and are impressed by the work HQB is doing in not only bringing food to neighbors in need, but working to make sure that food is healthy and as nutrient dense as possible. From gathering surplus from area grocery stores, to working with farmers and community gardens, to hosting cooking classes and sharing recipes, the folks at HQB are contributing greatly the the overall health and vitality of our community.
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102116		/users/profile/132149	climbergirl	Donor	5	12/09/2011	I love to grow organic vegetables in my backyard garden, but often have too many tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, etc. that all ripen at once.  I love giving freshly grown organic produce to the Hallie Q. Brown Food Shelf where my harvest is used and appreciated.
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102115		/users/profile/132148	Pepper1	Volunteer	5	12/09/2011	I have been volunteering for HQB for years. They are wonderful people who really care about helping the community. Their food shelf has helped a countless number of people get back on their feet with dignity and thoughtful support. The work they do for their clients is invaluable!! 
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102098		/users/profile/132113	Robert A C.	Advisor	5	12/09/2011	The Hallie Q. Brown Foodshelf not only provides clients with sustenance, they also bring attention to nutrition and sustainable agriculture.  They look to increase awareness of good nourishment and our footprint on the earth.  It's commendable to see a community organization led with a focus on wellness and global consciousness.
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102096		/users/profile/132106	karthboi	Volunteer	5	12/09/2011	The Halle Q Brown food shelf has been housed in the lower level of the church that I attend for as long as I can remember.  During my last tenure on the church council the executive board challenged the council to promote stronger ties between the church and the food shelf.  We wanted to become more than a landlord and wanted HQB to feel like more than renters to the congregation.  I decided to take up this challenge and have been working closely with their development coordinator, Josh.  Josh is doing a great job with grass roots organizing, networking, and changing the expectations of the people served by the food shelf.  He has focused on making sure that food shelf users are treated with respect and dignity and given not only help with physical needs, but also help with cooking and serving healthy foods that can be made with easily acquired ingredients.  The experience has been very rewarding for me and has brought me closer to the community in which I worship and work.
Hallie Q Brown Community Center Incorporated	102085		/users/profile/132084	lmcmann	Donor	5	12/09/2011	The Hallie Q. Brown Center's food shelf doesn't just help people in need with food and clothing.  They have gone out of their way to make their community center part of the movement towards local and sustainable food for all.  By working with co-ops, natural foods stores and farmers, they have been able to get the best possible food for their clients and support changes towards a more sustainable planet.  Kudos to the HQB Center for being a leader!  From Mississippi Market Co-op
Think Eternity Ministries	290794	2	/users/profile/381130	Glenna P.	General Member of the Public	5	05/23/2016	Matt and Michelle are truly living a life of full surrender and obedience to Jesus every day.  They are modeling a true relationship with Christ as they minister in their individual Christian lifestyles  -   the Great Commandment,  " Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" - and the Great Commission,  "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."I have personally ministered with Matt's Godly mother, Tami, in the prayer room and out on the streets to the lost and brokenhearted - and share testimony to a son that was trained up with the fear and reverence of the Lord.
Think Eternity Ministries	290749	3	/users/profile/381084	vivianbrad	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/23/2016	Love the way Matt lifts up others so they can fulfill their destinies in Jesus.  He is a team player and loves God & people. He is a man of integrity who lives what he preaches. He has a generational blessing of pouring out love onto people in a spectacular way. He is a visionary with skill to put plans into action on the ground. He can be trusted to do what he promises and says what he means. He is a man of the Word with a servant heart and  a Joel 2: 29 spirit, " Even on my servants, both men & women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days." Great ministry to invest your prayers, time, finances & energy in coming along side.Blessings,Pastor Vivian
Think Eternity Ministries	290534	3	/users/profile/380885	Churchboy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/21/2016	Words cannot describe the love that Matt and Michelle have for the people they serve with their ministry.  They truly have the haseart of Jesus.  My wife and I have known their family for years and cannot say enough for their integrity, genuineness, selflessness, and giving hearts to bring and proclaim the love of Christ to the world.  We proudly support Think Eternity.
Think Eternity Ministries	290382	3	/users/profile/380700	Sam_45	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/19/2016	warren Buffet once speaking about the kind of people you want to hire once said, "you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you dont have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; its true. If you hire somebody without [integrity], you really want them to be dumb and lazy.  From my personal experience, What makes Matt and Michelle unique is that they have all three of those qualities.  Every dollar entrusted to Thinke goes into fostering and accelerating the gospel  honestly, creatively and passionately.

Think Eternity Ministries	290155	3	/users/profile/380438	jgibso07	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2016	Think Eternity Ministries is a wonderful non profit organization. There really are not enough words to describe the impact that they make. Not only are they making an impact to thousands across the nations but also to me on a personal level. I have been impacted greatly by this ministry/nonprofit organization.  I am an avid follower and prayer supporter of Matt and Michelle. I have seen God truly do the great and the mighty in and through this couple. They are filled with love, compassion, integrity, and joy. If you are not supporting this nonprofit organization in some fashion, I urge you to do so. My mentors have always told me, "Follow those who lead with passion, integrity, and vision." With those words in mind, I do the same with Think Eternity Ministries. Be blessed! Joshua Gibson
Think Eternity Ministries	290137	3	/users/profile/380419	Samuel12	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/17/2016	One of the things I love about Think Eternity is there dedicated passion to encourage and equip followers of Jesus with the tools and resources they need to mature as believers. Through medias like social media, speaking, events and more. Also, I know Matt and Michelle personally and can speak to their genuine love for Jesus and to their character and integrity in everything they do! Any partnership or investment into this NGO will be well worth it!

People for Parks	142163		/users/profile/188603	Linda161	Board Member	4	11/23/2012	People for Parks is an agile organization, by which I mean that it is relatively small and definitely grassroots, so it is able to act quickly when approached for "just a little help." Although grants range from large to almost tiny, each one helps a group or organization enhance Minneapolis parks. People for Parks has provided support, large and small, for everything from a playground that will be accessible for every child to planting shrubs to replace buckthorn in the bird sanctuary.
People for Parks	141697		/users/profile/188071	sylf	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	People For Parks is a grassroots organization committed to enhancing  Minneapolis parks.  Just in the past few years  funds raised by People For Parks has planted trees in some on the Minneapolis parks through People For Parks Arbor Day Project,  helped with the eradication of bucktorn through the purchase of equipment for the Minneapolis Parks forestry department and contributed money for the purchase of two chess tables at Logan Park amongst other projects.   Currently People For Parks is involved with the Falls For All Project at Wabun Park and the Martin Luther King Legacy project at King Park.   The People For Parks board works hand in hand with the Minneapolis Park Board to insure Minneapolis residents that the parks remain "the jewels" of our city.
People for Parks	141493		/users/profile/187826	halvop	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	People for Parks' help keep our Minneapolis parks beautiful and functional.  The financial support they have been able to offer has maintained the value of some of our treasures, such as the bandshell  and Women's Ordinary at Lake Harriet.  They have replaced trees that were lost to disease and protected others from the same fate.  They help small neighborhood groups improve their parks and keep communities strong.
People for Parks	133086	2	/users/profile/75712	Noreen	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	For over 2 years now, the board and staff of People for Parks has worked tirelessly with its Falls 4 All Committee to fundraise to build a universally accessible playground specially designed so that kids with disabilities can play side by side with their able-bodied peers. Now at 75% of its nearly million dollar goal, the organization continues in its fundraising efforts, with a deadline of early 2013 to complete the fundraising. True to its purpose, this has been a citizen-based effort, with numerous fundraisers, grant writing, and meetings with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board staff, all in an effort to make this much-needed playground (the FIRST of its kind in the Minneapolis Park System) a reality for the citizens of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Certainly People for Parks and its Falls 4 All Committee are to be commended for its dedication to this huge fundraising project for a universal access playground that will allow children and adults, both with and without disabilities, a place to challenge themselves, explore, interact and play, with independence and dignity, as a group or as individuals. 
People for Parks	69283		/users/profile/75712	Noreen	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	We are working with People for Parks to fundraise to improve the level of accessibility for a park reconstruction at the Wabun Picnic Area in Minnehaha Falls Park.  The People for Parks Board has been very supportive in donating their time and talent to our cause.  They have impressed me with their commitment to the improvement of the Minneapolis Park System and their fiscal responsibility.  
People for Parks	126407	1	/users/profile/171435	Art S.	Client Served	5	10/17/2012	Family, not "client" - This is the whole point:  the "role" category that I just clicked doesn't begin the describe the relationship that my organization has with People for Parks (PFP).  It's funny, too, we were welcomed into the family only seven months ago.  Again, this illustrates the point.  PFP lives its mission with the people and organizations it serves.   I am the treasurer of a neighborhood, grassroots organization that is committed to better connecting the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park (MLK) to the community and to promote Dr. King's legacy through activities and physical layout in the Park.  We are entirely volunteer run and lead.  When we approached PFP to be our fiscal agent, they literally took us under their wings and helped mus become established.  The board members collaborated with us in writing a memorandum of agreement that spelled out each organization's roles and responsibilities.  This was done in a mutually respectful manner.  The quality of the relationship that was established is rare.  Having done this several times on behalf of community groups I can testify that often the organization with the power simply dictates terms to the neighborhood group.  Here, PFP took steps to ensure communication was open and decision making had a two-way path.  PFP went above and beyond the specific requirements of "fiscal agent" in other ways that supported our group.  They identified potential funding sources, introduced us to individuals and organizations that could support our work and helped mus with logistics of individual fundraising and specific events.  It takes this special support and the efforts above and beyond the requirements of "client-provider" to make relationships successful.  PFP has done this for us.  MLK is pleased and proud to be part of the PFP family.
People for Parks	35560	5	/users/profile/36380	felicity	Volunteer	5	04/12/2010	People for Parks has a committed volunteer board dedicated to making the Minneapolis Parks experience a great experience for all. The bandshell plaza is a great improvement to Lake Harriet, as is the picnic shelter. Other projects include helping improve tennis courts across the city and inoculating Elm trees. This arbor day they will donate 100 trees to Jordan park in Minneapolis, adjacent to the Hmong International academy. Great people working hard.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	178207	1	/users/profile/38146	donna-kuhl	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	 What are some of the critical services offered by this conscientious  and well run organization? The answer is: food, clothing, shelter, financial counseling and, above all,  hope. That doesn't even cover it all.  Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud serves those in need in this community; those young and old and those of any faith background. As a volunteer, I see the staff dedicated to those whom they serve. I find it to be both inspiring and humbling. I choose to support them both with volunteer hours and financially as we can. It is time and money well spent.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	85553	1	/users/profile/38146	donna-kuhl	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	My exposure to Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud has become first hand since I took their tours and started volunteering. In my opinion, this organization truly lives its mission to serve those in need. The services provided are so many that I will mention just the tours I have taken: Emergency Services (food, clothing and financial counseling), The St. Cloud Children's Home and Life Transitions Services. The professional staff, the programs and the respect with which clients and students were treated impressed me greatly. I now volunteer  as needed at one of the St. Cloud locations and continue to be impressed with the commitment of those for whom I work.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	86683		/users/profile/97123	pat shaw	Client Served	5	04/21/2011	40 years ago, we got one of the best gifts we could ever recieve from Catholic Charities, our son.  13 years later, we also got a niece there also.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	86673		/users/profile/97111	ssink	Donor	5	04/21/2011	As far as I can tell, wherever there are people in need in my community, Catholic Charities is there to help. Whether it is homes for disabled adults or the Children's Home, programs for families in crisis, counseling or hunger relief, I don't know what would become of St. Cloud if Catholic Charities was not here. It is a wonderful organization filled with loving, dedicated people.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	86278		/users/profile/96527	Debbie	Advisor	5	04/19/2011	I have either attended or worked on the Catholic Charities Mardi Gras fundraising event for many years.

Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	86032		/users/profile/96167	Joe B.	Board Member	5	04/16/2011	I served on the Board of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud from 2005 through 2010. What amazed me over those years was the tremendous depth the organization has. They reach so many in need with emergency services (food, clothing, and financial help), mental health counseling, transitional housing for those struggling to become self sufficient, a residential treatment center serving children ages 8 to 18, homes for the mentally ill and physically impaired, and more. They are a well managed charity, serve people of all faiths, and adjust quickly to changing needs. 
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of St. Cloud	85569		/users/profile/95521	Andrea L.	Volunteer	3	04/13/2011	Over the years its been my privilege to see how Catholic Charities impacts lives in our area. I remember hearing a young woman share her story about how staff at the Children's Home helped her learn how to trust others and grow into a caring young woman. When I visted the food shelf, I learned how donations of food, clothing and household items help families in need. The volunteers take such care when talking with familes. Each person is treated with love and respect. Staff at Catholic Charities don't just talk the talk, they literally walk the walk in sharing the mission of Catholic Charities.

WATCH	122299		/users/profile/166539	riede077	Volunteer	5	09/14/2012	I learned about WATCH from taking a domestic violence class at the University of Minnesota. I was eager to become a volunteer because I loved the work that WATCH was doing. I volunteer once a week and have loved it. Everyone is devoted to the mission and are willing to communicate and explore new possibilities. I have learned a lot about the court system and how our domestic violence victims are treated, despite our best intentions. I am proud to be a volunteer and I believe WATCH is a program that does great things for women.
WATCH	121757	1	/users/profile/165668	susanrivard5873	Volunteer	5	08/31/2012	After I retired I got involved in several volunteer opportunities working to stop domestic violence. When I heard about WATCH I was intrigued with their work and started volunteering, and I love it! I am impressed with how the organization compiles, analyzes and USES the data the volunteers provide to advocate for change within the judicial system. As a result, many things have been changed to better protect the victim and hold offenders accountable. It really feels like what we do as volunteers makes a difference, and I like being part of something that works for systemic change. I also like learning about the judicial system and expanding my vocabulary to include legal terminology! And, finally, I worked in the non-profit sector all of my professional life, and rarely have I come across an organization that makes better use of every dollar. WATCH uses its resources wisely and makes every volunteer feel welcome and valued.  Susan Rivard
WATCH	121524		/users/profile/165359	Shanniel A.	Volunteer	5	08/28/2012	I volunteer with WATCH because I wanted to be more involved with the community. Currently I work with Hennepin County Human Services Public Health Department and service clients who actively receive public assistance. Usually, I'd service the clients, AFTER they have gone through their court dealings. Most utilize HSPHD to apply for assistance including but not limited to Rule 25, which you see a lot of with child protection cases. The combination of the two makes my job and volunteer experience so meaningful!
WATCH	121502		/users/profile/165312	Jen Johnson	Volunteer	5	08/27/2012	For 20 years, WATCH has been sending trained volunteers to monitor cases of violence against women and children in Hennepin County courtrooms. Based on the volunteers' feedback and studies conducted on these issues, WATCH has published reports, made recommendations for systemic change, and honored those who have made improvements in the justice system.  As a volunteer and board member, i have learned much about the courts and domestic violence issues, and i am honored to play a part in WATCH's accomplishments.
WATCH	121264		/users/profile/164992	JMP11	Volunteer	5	08/22/2012	I had just graduated from paralegal school when one of my friends referred me to WATCH.  I thought it would be a great opportunity to gain experience in the legal field, but it became more than that.  When I go to volunteer, I feel like I am making a difference by monitoring and taking notes of what I see.  Court monitors are the eyes and the ears of the public.  WATCH strives to make the justice system more fair and effective in handling cases of violence against women and children. Anyone interested in our justice system should definitely look into volunteering at WATCH.  
WATCH	121223		/users/profile/164941	tmflaten	Volunteer	5	08/22/2012	I am very proud to be a volunteer with WATCH. I have always been passionate about ending violence against women and this organization was a great way to combine both my interests and my career. As a law student, I really enjoy the courtroom exposure. I am able to see what a "good" judge who is being respectful and explaining things clearly looks like. I am also able to witness courtroom decorum and interactions between lawyers. I believe in this organization and I have seen the effect it can have on the community. I will continue to volunteer for WATCH for as long as I am able. It is a wonderful community of like-minded individuals who want to make a change in the world for the better. 
WATCH	121095		/users/profile/164777	Thompson A.	Board Member	4	08/20/2012	I was matched to WATCH MN through a board search firm. I had received at least 3 other non profit's profiles that matched my profile, but WATCH is the one that caught my eye on paper. It was the only non profit with the unique value proposition of monitoring the judicial system with a focus on domestic abuse. WATCH clearly had a systems approach to change that involved bringing everyone in the judicial system together to make data driven decisions. Data is the second thing that caught my eye. WATCH is not an organization responding to individual cases that have a sensationalist appeal. WATCH looks at the big picture by collecting and analyzing data from the front lines of the judicial system - in the courts. It is for these reasons that I joined the WATCH board of directors in 2009. I am now the board chair and am proud to be serving this organization. The only reason I do not give it five starts is because its direct impact is mainly in Hennepin county and needs to spread across the country. Also, for a 20 year old organization, its name is not well known enough, but we are working on that. Two of the impacts on Hennepin County that WATCH has had that I am most proud of occurred before I joined the board. One was the use of WATCH data and analysis to make strangulation a felony offense. In the past, strangulation was not considered a serious offense although the majority of domestic abuse cases that ended in death or serious injury started with strangulation. The second is WATCH's role in extended from 12 hours to 24 hours the amount of time officers have to arrest domestic abusers. Often times 12 hours was not enough time to locate the abusers and they would get off scott free without even having to explain their actions. I hope this narrative helps all of you out there understand more about what WATCH does and why you should support us.
JSAW	198119		/users/profile/258803	NateRobertson29	Client Served	5	04/16/2014	JSAW IS THE BEST! Jonny, Ian, Noah, and all the other dudes that work at Help Boardshop are probably some of the nicest guys I have ever met. They are completely changing the image of action sports! Support them all you can!!
JSAW	198003		/users/profile/245597	RonStebenne	Board Member	5	04/16/2014	I'm a 17 year veteran youth minister with an action sports background.  I understand how ministry and action sports can be mixed with great results.  JSAW really gets it.  Jonny Nelson has an outstanding background in non-profit management, community engagement, and youth ministry.  This makes for a wonderful mix of expertise to change lives.  In particular, the skateboard culture had been seen as having poor role models for youth.  Jonny and JSAW have created a cultural shift in the action sports industry by providing positive role models that are helping youth make better decisions, overcome life challenges, and have hope for a future through faith.  I give JSAW and Jonny three thumbs up for their great non-profit.
JSAW	188267		/users/profile/245597	RonStebenne	Board Member	5	11/10/2013	I gave JSAW 5 stars but they deserve 10 stars.  The heart and soul of this organization is based on love and caring for others, particularly those young folks oftentimes shunned by others. JSAW brings a positive light and a message of hope to a generation of action sports youth at a time when they need to feel they belong and can trust in great mentors to guide them through life's challenges.
JSAW	188826		/users/profile/246443	akesti2	Client Served	5	11/19/2013	I found out about JSAW when I was seeking a positive role model for my young son who showed an interest in snowboarding.  They were a Godsend for us! These guys take a genuine interest in youth living in a culture where there aren't many who sacrificially reach out and give generously.  Thanks, JSAW, for being a light and an inspiration for our young people!

Their passion is clear as day, their attention to detail is rare for the industry and their ability to anticipate the needs of their constituents has firmly established them as a leader in the Action Sports Ministry arena. They love people, love to shred and love Jesus. I look forward to a long future supporting their work and partnering with their staff!

Starkey Hearing Foundation	310659		/users/profile/402000	Bob241	General Member of the Public	1	10/14/2016	I went thru their process of getting hearing aids. I'm 70 years old and my income is way below the poverty level. I called Starkey and they said I did qualify for their Hear Now Program. They sent an application with a list of things I had to return with the application. Past six months of my bank statement, proof of my income from Social Security and the hearing test from a doctor that participated in the Hear Now Program. They told me I had to find the doctor on my on, they would not tell me one in my state. I searched for days and finally a doctor said they did participate in the Hear Now Program and made a appoint for me and told me I had to have my doctor to do a referral to them. I had everything I needed except for the doctor part of the application and the hearing test. Well 10-13-2016 at 10:00 AM I was there for my test knowing I was getting closer to "HEARING" (again). They took me back to do the exam and I showed them the application from Starkey. The lady left and brought back the doctor who promptly told me they did not do the Hear Now Program, and didn't know of a doctor in all of South Carolina that participated in the the Hear Now Program.  All along me sitting there looking at a big chart of things that could cause hearing loss, the chart was from "STARKEY". Anyway the doctor still wanted to do the hearing test which would do no good. They I would be stupid enough to pay them for a hearing test.This was all a lot of crap. I should have known something was wrong when they wouldn't tell me a doctor to see. They are not who they say they are. All the pictures showing them helping people. Just try to get some help from them and see what its all about.
Starkey Hearing Foundation	270835	1	/users/profile/359574	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/02/2015	 The rumors and inaccuracies about the company making money off the foundation and the tax benefits to donors are simply mind boggling. First, the company does not make money off the foundation. In fact, there is a whole section of the factory where paid employees strip donated hearing aids of parts that can be used for re- builds. As for the tax benefits for donors, the donors do not receive anything in return, so the charitable donation is legitimate. Get your stories straight, folks.

Starkey Hearing Foundation	244592	3	/users/profile/331531	AngelFire444	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/04/2015	The Starkey Hearing Foundation consistently goes above and beyond to help people in disadvantaged countries receive the gift of hearing when they otherwise would never have had the chance to hear.  They perform miracles regularly and you can see it in the faces of those who receive these gifts.  The mission not only helps people with their hearing, but often goes out of their way to support impoverished  communities with other projects such as digging wells, building schools, and finding medical care in places where these resources were not available before. To help spread the word about the good they are doing, they have started filming documentaries of their mission trips which you can view parts of on their website at https://starkeyhearingfoundation.org/ Starkey Hearing Foundation also operates the Hear Now program in the United States.  Any individual who meets the income qualifications and is seriously in need of hearing help can get the help they need right here in this country.  Bill Austin says that finances should not be an obstacle to hearing, and he backs this up by giving away the gift of hearing to so many people all around the world.  More than 1.6 million hearing aids have already been given away, and more mission trips are scheduled all the time.   This is truly a worthy foundation that is out there empowering people to live better lives through the gift of hearing.  It is disappointing to see other commenters who have not worked with this foundation report rumors disparaging this foundation as if they are valid reasons not to work with them.  I am a hearing professional who has helped people through Hear Now, who has helped people donate old hearing aids to be recycled through the foundation and who aspires to go on a mission trip with them some day.  In my experience, none of the negative things the first two commenters had to say about SHF is true in any way.  They have been nothing but ethical and helpful every time that I deal with them, and they never give tax advice or turn donations in to profits.   I've worked with Bill Austin personally, and his passion is the mission work.  Bill uses Starkey as a vehicle to be able to accomplish 2 things.  1- Research and produce the absolute highest quality hearing aids that do the best job in the market to help people hear right here in the United States.  2- Funnel the profits into his mission trips to bring the gift of hearing all over the world.  The man is an inspiration, and the world would be better off if there were more people like him, and more charities like the Starkey Hearing Foundation. For more information on this wonderful charity, please check out the Charity Navigator website here:  http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12176#.VXCClFJu2lI
Starkey Hearing Foundation	244582	2	/users/profile/331511	FredericRondeau1	Volunteer	5	06/04/2015	Amazing Organization that continuously donates over 100,000 Hearing Aids per year Worldwide! Do the work, build the dream, let the results speak for themselves! SO THE WORLD MAY HEAR
Starkey Hearing Foundation	212568	7	/users/profile/275603	balancedbee	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/28/2014	They use donations to fund their for-profit business, Starkey Hearing Technologies. This should be considered a marketing arm of Starkey and NOT a charity. If he were being charitable, Bill Austin would purchase the best hearing aids available for these folks - not just hearing aids from his own company. I've heard rumors they charge the Foundation higher-than-market prices. 
Starkey Hearing Foundation	95877	10	/users/profile/111557	miles26point2	Professional with expertise in this field	2	08/17/2011	A major source of revenue for this organization is in the form of "donations" from people who receive hearing aids from them.  The people receiving the hearing aids are told that they may deduct the amount of the donation from their taxes without consideration of the value of the hearing aids.  This is tax fraud because the situation is a perfect example of a quid pro quo donation, in which the fair market value of what was received in exchange for the donation needs to be subtracted from the amount of the donation.  They are well aware of what they are doing and the consequences of these actions and continue to operate in this manner.  Also, take a look at how much money this organization is "donating" to other unrelated foundations.  For example, the Elton John Aids Foundation has received approximately $1 million from them over the years that he has "volunteered" to play at their fundraisers.  Also, under another conflict of interest situation, the majority of the expenses are for the purchase of hearing aids from the company that started the foundation, and not simply at the compan's cost, but a higher value, resulting in increased profit for the company.
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	281382		/users/profile/371426	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2016	I've participated in programming of the Friends for many years, and continue to be so impressed by the variety and quality of their offerings, most of which are free.  Programs are spread throughout the St. Paul area, including at all the branch libraries.  I'm also a fan of their very effective communications with members.  Happy to support them!
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	281352		/users/profile/371394	Writer	Donor	5	03/01/2016	As a regular donor to The Friends, I continue to be impressed at the many creative and engaging programs they produce. I would give them 100 stars if that were possible!
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	275651	1	/users/profile/365294	Writer	Donor	5	01/05/2016	I don't have the means to be a big donor but I am very careful with my charitable giving. That's one reason I feel good about giving to The Friends. Whether it's a puppet show or business materials and training for underrepresented people, or something as large in scope as remodeling the libraries, I know that The Friends will use my dollars, and those of all its donors, wisely and well. In addition, The Friends orchestrate amazing programs that bring authors out to libraries and other public venues -- often at little or no cost to attendees. One of my favorite Friends programs is the Minnesota Book Awards, which floundered and almost went under until The Friends took it over. I make it a point to read many of the nominees and award winners. In fact I have one waiting for me at my favorite St. Paul Public Library!I can't think of one negative thing to say about this amazing organization. When I give to other organizations, I measure their effectiveness against The Friends!
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	275646	2	/users/profile/365289	Writer	Donor	5	01/05/2016	The Friends is a truly remarkable organization. It is such an effective steward of private funds. It accomplishes so much on so little. It is one of the most highly respected organizations in Saint Paul. Everyone I know feels the same. I have never heard one bit of criticism about them. 
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	275643	2	/users/profile/365286	Writer	Donor	5	01/05/2016	I'm so impressed with the Friends of the Saint Paul Library.  They raise significant funds for the Saint Paul Libraries (with low overhead) to support wonderful programs and facilities.  I bring my kids to the Saturday programs at Central (the puppet theater is fantastic!) and enjoy the music and movies throughout the year.  
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	275633	2	/users/profile/365274	Writer	Donor	5	01/05/2016	I've been a member of The Friends for over ten years.  I've found it to be one of the most effective, entrepreneurial nonprofits I've come in contact with.  It provides millions of dollars to the Saint Paul Public Library through its successful public advocacy and through comprehensive fundraising efforts.  It's a true model of a highly functional, effective nonprofit.
Friends of the St Paul Public Library	172870	2	/users/profile/228867	mrsohara	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I've been a member of The Friends and an advocate for the Saint Paul Public Library for 20 years. The annual advocacy process is thoughtful, strategic, and effective. We've been successful at getting the Mayor and City Council to restore cuts to library funding or increase the budget for hours, books and materials year after year because The Friends works so well with library leadership, community volunteers and their elected officials, often leveraging its appeal by offering matching private funds for library enhancements. Never outrageous in its request. The Friends are committed and innovative; they're savvy achievers, and with the weight of their supporters, a powerful support organization for one of the best libraries in the country.

We attend dozens of charity events each year and found these to be both unique and well managed. As an agency executive, I can say the marketing materials, website and on-site representation of sponsors were extraordinary and I am recommending the organization to several of our clients as a medium for product promotion and a splendid venue to entertain important clients. We walked the entire event and think it has something to offer everyone.

They were very helpful and very welcoming and this is a can't miss event of the  Minnesota Summer.

Common Hope	97110	2	/users/profile/113586	Edinabob	Donor	5	09/02/2011	I have worked with Common Hope as a donor and volunteer for over 15 years.  The organization is extremely efficient, stretching every dollar and hour donated to get the very most out of their donations.  The focus on helping people help themselves through education, housing, and health care truly lifts their communities out of poverty.  I have gotten to know the people they serve, and have seen entire communities develop the skills, resources, and motivation to reach a better standard of living.

I'm on the board for another, smaller organization building schools and working on education projects in Guatemala and Common Hope was very helpful to us in obtaining Community Giving funds.  In learning more about their history, I've been impressed with their growth and look to them as a model of how to grow past the initial "founders" stage of a non-profit life-cycle.  They selflessly give to make Guatemala and the world a better place.

Common Hope	34890	7	/users/profile/35749	gipsie	Donor	5	04/07/2010	Several years ago I traveled to Guatemala to visit my sponsered child. I remember the family was dressed up and everything was spotless (as much as a house with a dirt floor and sugar cane for walls could be). This program really is helping people to take charge of their lives to get out of poverty if they can have the chance. I was very impressed and wanted to donate more after visiting their location in Guatemala. Positive experience!
Common Hope	34836	5	/users/profile/35700	Debra D.	Volunteer	5	04/06/2010	I recently worked as a short term volunteer with Common Hope in Guatemala. I became particularly interested in their mission and decided to help in construction. I also got the opportunity to work with children and help them build airplanes in San Miguel. I found the experience thoroughly rewarding and very enjoyable. During my time working with Common Hope I have been inspired by the efforts that are being made to improve lives and educate families. I have been proud to be able to contribute to such a hard working team. From my time in Guatemala I have gained knowledge, experience, new skills, many happy memories, and a number of great friends.

What she says about us applies to TIUFTT too, because they have helped make it possible for us to do this very kind of thing for our veterans and service members.THANK YOU Tee It Up For The Troops: "My husband is a wounded warrior...he lost a leg in Afghanistan and struggled with a lot before we got in touch with PawPADs a couple years ago. We were eventually partnered with Barkley just over six months later. Barkley is a dog who was rescued from a shelter and trained in a prison...Barkley has changed our lives. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does for my husband. Barkley has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his struggles and hard times but his successes too...Barkley can turn on the lights and pick things up but the best thing he does is watch out for and take care of my husband...This is a nonprofit that is not only changing lives but changing the world while helping wounded warriors like my husband..."Thanks again, Tee It Up For The Troops, for making this possible!

The recent golf tournament they held was well run from check-in to check-out.  The goal of the tournament was to have eighty golfers, and they had eighty-five.  The function afterwards (including silent auction,  live auction and donation request) were handled very well by a professional auctioneer.  In the end, it was a successful event. We are thankful for the support of Tee It Up For The Troops.

From humble beginnings at the request of a soldeir serving in Iraq for his family and friends to do something for the soldiers and the families back home, a grass roots effort was created in 2005. In five years TIUFTT has raised over $2,000,000.00 without any national media exposure. It is the american citizen telling the veteran you are appreciated-THANK YOU.
Tee It Up for the Troops Inc	32723	1	/users/profile/33542	alexplechash	Board Member	5	03/08/2010	There has been no other veteran-oriented non-profit or charitable organization with which I have been involved, or that I am aware of, that is more dedicated and visionary than this one.  The events organized are as well-run and inspirational as any I've seen.It is also among the lowest expense ratio 501(c)3 charitable organizations around which means almost all the money collected by this organization goes directly to support veteran's causes.Tee It Up For the Troops, Inc. was created in 2005 to help support the fallen and disable members of our Armed Forces and their families.  The NATIONAL DAY OF GOLF was subsequently formed and has since produced hundreds of golf outings throughout the country where proceeds benefit veterans of all branches and conflicts.This organization is led by a core of dedicated veterans and volunteers.  It's mission is to respect and remember the service of those that have given so freely to protect our great nation.  It is guided by its charter to garner broad public and corporate support for the needs of veterans and their families through structured patriotically oriented events at both private and public golf courses; stand alone fundraising events, sponsorships and direct donations.
Bridges Of Hope	284603		/users/profile/374660	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	04/04/2016	My family was in need of help. We were told this was a great place to go. Instead of getting help we were made to feel like we were in the wrong for falling on hard times.  Like we had done something wrong to deserve it. We were told to sell our belongings to get the money we needed. So it wasn't bad enough that we had gotten to the point that we needed to ask for this help, no, we were made to feel like we bad people for having to ask.
Bridges Of Hope	88027		/users/profile/98861	Lynda	Donor	5	04/29/2011	Bridges of Hope is here to assist families who are stressed. They are a phone call away when you are in crisis. Their compassion is expressed by their staff and supporters. As a donor, I know my dollars are being used effectively to meet the needs of our community. In my role as a service provider, I rely on Bridges to have the latest information on what services are available. I appreciate being asked to be an advisor because I know that Bridges is always looking for ways to improve the work they do. 
Bridges Of Hope	87981		/users/profile/98811	Patrick	Board Member	5	04/29/2011	Bridges of Hope is a faith based non-profit in the Brainerd lakes area.  I have been involved with Bridges of Hope since the idea stage.  What drew me to Bridges was the concept of joining (Bridging) the faith community with the service community.  Pastors were struggling with knowing how to assist members of their congregation when they came to them with needs for mental health counseling, parenting support, financial difficulties, etc.  These types of services are plentiful in our area but families struggle to access them.  Bridges of Hope is that lifeline for families.  We come along side them and connect them with the supports they need to be healthy and thrive as a family or individual.  
Bridges Of Hope	87979		/users/profile/98807	Tami	Donor	4	04/29/2011	Bridges of Hope is an excellent organization serving the Brainerd Lakes Area . BoH was developed by local people who wanted to connect people in need to the full array of resources that could help. BoH has the flexibility to work with a variety of resources in the community from public agencies, non-profits and area churches. This flexibility and coordination has made a tremendous impact in coordinating area resources for people in their time of greatest need.

A simple call to Bridges of Hope can put into motion a variety of supports to aide a person through any domestic crisis.  The counselors are respectful and caring, and will work with clients to formulate a plan that maintains dignity. I have had the privilege of working with some of the families they serve, and they have been completely satisfied with the services they receive!
Bridges Of Hope	87184		/users/profile/97799	Maren	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2011	Bridges of Hope is a very valuable organization in our community!  I am a social worker in the community and work with children and families.  They have provided many resources such as gas cards, rent deposits, utility help, clothing, housing resources and much more.  One of the most valuable resources they provide is setting up counseling services for families.  Many therapists in the community are booked a month in advance.  Bridges is able to reserve appointments so families can get in sooner!  I love this and so do the families!
World Wide Village Incorporated	286716	1	/users/profile/376786	Kim_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Inspired by Rosalinawww.worldwidevillage.org     While they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, some moments are not caught on camera, yet are permanently ingrained in our minds.  These moments are often the most special and are one of the reasons giving to World Wide Village is so meaningful to me.       What inspires me to give to World Wide Village?   The answer is simplethe people we serve.  People with real names, real faces and real stories you might have a hard time believing.  People I have come to love.   This short story is just one example of a thousand stories that I could share about why I choose to give to World Wide Village.       It was 2013 when my husband and I first traveled to Haiti to help with medical missions in a rural village.  Our experiences in Haiti were life changing and we committed to leading medical trips twice a year going forward. During our third trip we had the opportunity to meet Youventa Alseme, one of our sponsored children who was 4-years-old at the time.  After school finished for the day, Youventa walked across the small gravel road to our makeshift clinic just to give us a shy hello (actually Bonswa in Haitian Creole).       After meeting Youventa, I really wanted to connect with her family to see how we could best support them.  Youventa had a 10-year-old neighbor named Rosalina who offered to walk us to her home.     My friend and I set off to meet Youventas family with a Haitian translator, Rosalina, Rosalinas sister named Anchilove, Rosalinas younger cousin and Youventa.   In Haiti I always wear very sturdy shoes because of the poor walking conditions.  We often walk through sharp gravel, rough grasses, occasional broken glass and garbage.  As we were walking I noticed that Rosalina and Youventa were the only two girls with shoes.  Anchilove and Rosalinas younger cousin were barefoot and carefully stepping on the rough path.       The memories of the next moment will forever be etched on my heart as I watched a girl at the tender age of ten demonstrate so much love and self-sacrifice.  I remember watching as Anchilove walked barefoot holding onto Rosalinas hand.  I remember hearing Anchiloves soft cry as she stepped on a thorn in the rough path.I remember watching Rosalina bend down and gently remove the thorn from her sisters small foot.I remember watching Rosalina selflessly remove her own shoes and offer them to her younger cousin as she lifted Anchilove onto her back. I remember watching Rosalina carry Anchilove while she walked barefoot through the thorns.  These moments are what inspire me to give to World Wide Village and the work they are doing in Haiti.  Girls like Rosalina deserve the opportunity to receive an education.  Girls like Rosalina deserve medical care in their community.  Girls like Rosalina deserve to live in a community where housing and jobs are available for their parents.   Girls like Rosalina deserve to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ.  This is the mission of World Wide Village and the reason I am inspired to give.   This is #MyGivingStory.  
World Wide Village Incorporated	286715		/users/profile/376785	Chrissy_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Some ask, why Haiti? I ask, why not Haiti?I have now made four trips to Haiti in partnership with http://worldwidevillage.org. After each trip, my heart is filled with more aches, more love, more worry, and more joy. I now find myself asking what more can I do? When can I return? Why am I still stateside?There are several organizations in Haiti and I am sure that they are all doing wonderful things. However, I love that I get to work alongside the Haitian and American staff of World Wide Village. One of the many things that I love and appreciate about the World Wide Village organization is that instead of telling the people of Haiti how to fix their country, they are in Haiti asking the people What can we help you with? How can we help you build back better?This organization has a positive presence within the communities they work alongside and are there to help with the everyday needs of the families and children.This trip was different than any of the past 3 trips. I was forced to slow down and to spend abundant time with the children in Williamson. There was no project to think about, no tools to pack, no measurements to figure out, no plan B or C or D to create. There were children who wanted attention. There where children who wanted their pictures taken. There were children who wanted to have a dance party. There were children who wanted to hold hands. There were children who wanted to braid our hair. There were children who wanted to give hugs. There were children who wanted to be children. There were children who simply wanted to be loved. Its crazy to think that with the amount of technology and gizmos and gadgets we have access to in the states, we still crave and miss out on so much of what life is all about.Love. Life is about loving others.Life is about loving ourselves. Life is about loving our God with all that we can. Life is about sharing the love of God with others.I believe that God partnered me with World Wide Village and brought me to Haiti to experience a love like no other. Time and time againwe drove past the people in the marketwe walked past the families in the villages.we played with the children in the schoolyards.we spoke with the translators.we worked alongside the construction team.we trusted the drivers to safely get us from place to place. This trip was different than any of the past 3 trips.Yes, I am different than those who live in Haiti. The color of my skin.The language that I speak.The life that I live.The world that I wake up to.What is not different?The God who created us all.The love that we long to feel.The sense of belonging that we hope to find.I believe that God partnered me with World Wide Village and brought me to Haiti to experience a love like no other. This trip was different that any of the past 3 trips.My heart aches for those whom we could not help.My heart aches for those whom experience violence.My heart aches for those whom go to bed with nothing in their stomach.My heart aches for those whom go day after day without their family.God has placed an ache into my heartIt is because of the memories of this trip and past trips that I look forward to many more experiences in Haiti with World Wide Village.
World Wide Village Incorporated	190339	2	/users/profile/248499	CynthiaAnn	Volunteer	5	12/10/2013	I have been working with World Wide Village (WWV) for one year this week. I have been living on the ground in Haiti at the WWV guesthouse since May 5th, 2013 working full-time with Randy and Pat Mortensen and this incredible organization.  I have witnessed some of the most amazing things in my life during my time working with the efforts of WWV and the absolute life changing differences they are making in the lives and hearts of the Haitian people they touch everyday. I am blessed to have great leaders with Integrity such as Randy and Pat to work with and learn from while combining our talents and hard work to make a difference in Haiti. I would recommend this organization for an internship, missions team trip or a wonderful Non-Profit to donate too. I am and will continue to work for them for all of 2014 as a full-time volunteer in Haiti, raising my own personal support and I feel blessed every single day that I do what I do.  
World Wide Village Incorporated	190333	5	/users/profile/248493	Gkids5	Donor	1	12/10/2013	My wife and I were associated with Worldwide Village for several years and we made numerous trips to Haiti with them supporting the mission through prayer and financial donations.  Being new to mission work we have some fond memories of trips to Haiti with the Mortensons.  We found them to be intelligent, affable, forward thinking and admired their expressed desire to help the Haitian people. Even though we started seeing inconsistency and lack of leadership discipline it was easy to get caught up in all the excitement and expectation of a new project.  Numerous times we donated money to a new project but it always seemed to fizzle over time and the next big idea became the new priority.    I also agreed to become a WWV board member. It became apparent to me over time that a board position really didnt mean anything and that it was only a figurehead position.  As a board member I had no responsibility to attend board meetings or work on a board committee. Nevertheless my name along with others were posted on the WWV website as supposed devoted board members.   I was also involved in another idea by WWV to start an electrical supply business in Haiti. The Ezer Sales Company was formed as an LLC under the Worldwide Village 501c3 umbrella as a business as mission enterprise. My brother and I having spent our careers in the electric supply business used our business connections to get exclusive sales rights for Haiti, which also gave us access to electrical products and logistics from a Miami location. We developed a business plan, established a separate bank account, financials and back office functions for the company.  The plan was to equally donate the company profits back to support the mission work of WWV and Haiti Teen Challenge.For over two years we rotated turns traveling to Haiti to work with our sales person, calling on customers, developing new relationships and generating business opportunities. We had committed $55,000 of our own financial resources to make the "business as mission" strategy work. Ezer Sales was getting established and sales revenue was growing. Things were moving in a positive direction until late 2011 when an employee of WWV informed us confidentially that the monthly Ezer financial statements we were receiving from WWV were not accurate. We discovered that over $30,000 dollars of cash had been taken out of the company and only a few hundred dollars was left in the bank account.   Randy & Pat explained to us why they had to do it and that they had emergency needs come up etc. etc.  Instead of including us they decided to hide their decision and give us falsified financials.  We walk away from the WWV because we do not want to be associated with an organization that lacks integrity and respect for their ministry partners.  Needless to say it was a spiritual low point for us but thanks to Gods grace and a lot of prayer I can say I have forgiven them but I do not respect them. We serve a loving and patient God but sometimes he has to hit us between the eyes to get our attention.  A good friend described it best for me.  Youve been taken to school.  Our situations with WWV taught us to do our due diligence and research the ministry organizations we financially support.  
World Wide Village Incorporated	190027	2	/users/profile/248098	bamajr	Volunteer	5	12/06/2013	I'm currently a volunteer and have been a volunteer with World Wide Village since early this year. The organization's leadership has consistently shown their commitment to the Spiritual Development and Community Enrichment, through Education, to the people of Haiti.
World Wide Village Incorporated	189664	16	/users/profile/247582	tl7inhaiti	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/01/2013	Before I begin, I would like to share that I find it painful to stand up to wrong-doing when you care about the people involved.  We do believe that standing up to it is the correct thing to do. We found out there is no Board of Directors.  If you look into this you will find they have been dishonest about many things.  History: We worked with World Wide Village for approximately two years. In this time we were the half-time "in country directors" in Haiti.  We saw over and over again that the leadership of World Wide Village could not focus in on one task and do it well. We were asked for our advice, but when we suggested focusing on one thing and doing one thing well, we were ignored. Instead, whenever a new idea or new money was offered, they would switch gears and do whatever would grab the new money. At one point World Wide Village was about education, then it was about healthcare, then it was about agriculture, then it was about hearing aides, then it was about mission teams and evangelical Christianity, then it was about building houses.  Every time the wind blows a new direction a new project is started.  The problem is, very little is accomplished and a lot of money is being wasted. Many things have been started and abandoned mid-stream.  In 2009 and 2010 we raised $69,000 for malnourished kids.  As of the writing of this review Randy Mortensen and World Wide Village have spent 26K of that money and have an outstanding bill of $8,600. Please see this post for more details: http://livesayhaiti.blogspot.com/2013/11/not-to-speak-is-to-speak-not-to-act-is.html  ---- the promises made in Haiti are broken and donors are told designated funds are for the items they designate them for -- that is not true.  World Wide Village is not a trustworthy organization. There is not a deep abiding love for Haiti, the goal has less to do with helping Haiti and more to do with being a recongnized NGO (non government organization) As I look at the 990 I can see massive creativity used with the numbers.  I would highly warn anyone thinking about working for or with World Wide Village to do a lot of research. Their turnover rate among volunteers, board, and staff speaks volumes. 
Pink Purse Incorporated	42493	10	/users/profile/43197	natjlee	Board Member	5	06/01/2010	Our tag line is "giving women confidence they can carry". We believe in the power of women helping women in their time of need.  The project reaches out to women at times in thier live when they need encouragement and also to know someone cares about what they are going through. Our care is displayed with a simple handbag (of thier choosing) filled with toiletries, a encouraging note and a short impactful and uplifting message.  This is delivered by one of our board members or volunteers.  Our message is simple we care about you and we know you can make it!  The organization seeks to encourage every women we connect with.

Pink Purse Incorporated	41605	9	/users/profile/42424	india-slack32	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	This organization has been one of the most profound women's organization I have had the priveledge to be a part of. This started as an outreach project for our church, and it turned into something far more than I could ever imagine. I'm not even a purse person, but when I saw first hand how a purse, and not just a purse but to see the women we distribute the purses to light up just to know that someone ginuinely cares about them is such an awesome sight. The Pink Purse Project is definetly  a non-profit organization that I am glad to be a part of.
Pink Purse Incorporated	41406	8	/users/profile/42237	mrsguerra-baker	Volunteer	4	05/28/2010	The following mission statement sums up exactly what the Pink Purse Project does.. the women that are involved a exceptional , caring and motivated beyond measure.. I have been homeless before, and I would have wanted an organiztion just like this to help me and not just lip service, but put into my hands something tangible what I could not provide for myself at the time..when you have children you tend to put yourself on the back burner till there needs are met..Mission StatementThe vision of the Pink Purse Project is to empower women to become effective, assertive and confident by building self-esteem and teaching women how to cultivate and leverage their individual skills and abilities to positively impact their life.

Summit Academy OIC	58491		/users/profile/62298	Maxeye	General Member of the Public	1	12/05/2010	Look at the stats...  They enroll 452 students and graduate 136.  This retention is attrocious!  They place 82% of the graduates on less than living wage jobs and these jobs aren't sustained in their field.  Plus, where is the aid money going from the 316 students that don't graduate?  Question the leadership and the board and see it for what it is.

Summit Academy OIC	25512	4	/users/profile/26518	joannehager	Client Served	5	01/13/2010	I was a pre-apprentice carpentry student at Summit Academy from February 2008 until June 2008.My life and the life of my family changed greatly after my graduation. I became a union laborer, initially being hired by Northland Concrete and Masonry. I have since worked at M.A. Mortenson and wrapped up 2009 working again with NCM. I now have a purpose and a future. I feel VITAL and I'm SO grateful!I would never have been given this opportunity without the help of Summit Academy. They gave me the confidence and training I needed to take into the field and the needed referral to enter the building trades. I was prepared and ready for the job I was applying for. The instructors were so encouraging and helpful and so devoted to seeing their students succeed. I live in North Minneapolis and I think we are so lucky to have SAOIC in our community.Going from getting Medical Assistance and food stamps to having medical insurance (including dental and vision)for me and my entire family paid by my employer and union AND to look forward to having a pension now instead of retiring on minimum social security...my future is SO different from when I walked through their doors during orientation.
Emma Norton Services	234967		/users/profile/308469	MNbuckeye	Board Member	5	12/05/2014	I've worked with shelter organizations for more than 20 years, helping families who, for whatever reason, are in need of temporary housing.  With nearly 100 years in the business, Emma Norton Services and Emma's Place continue to provide housing and supportive services -- so desperately needed in our community --  in an encouraging and caring atmosphere.  As Treasurer of the Board for four years, I always marvel at how the staff can stretch every penny to provide programming and other services that nurture the goals of wellness and self-sufficiency for each of its residents.  Your donation to Emma Norton Services will support their efforts and will be greatly appreciated.
Emma Norton Services	157174		/users/profile/208428	ATaff	Donor	5	05/06/2013	My mom has a severe and persistent mental illness and if my family did not have the resources it does my mom would need a place like Emma Norton Services.  ENS is a place I would trust to care for my mom and as a result it's an organization I support for the great work they do to to help people who are homeless with mental illness and addiction - a need that is seriously underfunded in our country.
Emma Norton Services	157113		/users/profile/208349	SueLo	Board Member	5	05/04/2013	I have been volunteering with Emma Norton for several years and this year joined the Board to increase my involvement.  I believe the programs and support for mental health, chemical dependency, and general life management are very important in helping residents on their journey.  And I've been witnessing the results since I first learned about the organization.
Emma Norton Services	157102		/users/profile/208339	Margaret35	Volunteer	5	05/04/2013	I participated in the Mega Lounge Makeover (2nd floor) this year at the Emma Norton Residence. Our team of designers and volunteers banded together to creatively give residents a more modernized and cheerful space in which to relax. Throughout the project, residents offered help and suggestions while marveling at the changes. I could tell from each interaction how truly thankful everyone was. My time spent moving furniture, painting, and hanging pictures has made a far more bigger impact than I could have imagined. Residents started advocating for a 3rd floor lounge makeover before we were finished; seeing their enthusiasm and excitement was incredibly rewarding.

Wildlife Rehabilitation & Release	143000	1	/users/profile/189428	celticedge	Client Served	5	11/26/2012	This group has helped me many times.  They have educated me in whether an animal is truely orphaned or not...they also give me information about rabies which can concern my livestock.
Wildlife Rehabilitation & Release	126255	1	/users/profile/171309	squirrels	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	WRR supports in home rehabilitation programs that serve both injured and orphan wildlife.  Orphans that by other standards would be euthanized because they couldn't receive 24 hour care and feedings.  These orphans are fed/cared by the same pair of eyes that notices the smallest change which can and does impact the rehabilitation and release of that animal.  WRR strives with each animal brought  in to assess whether it is really orphaned because we know... it isn't how many animals that are admitted...it's how many orphans are prevented.  They offer education to licensed rehabilitators and the community. 
Wildlife Rehabilitation & Release	104770	1	/users/profile/140571	handmap9	Volunteer	5	01/27/2012	WRR has been there for the public and for all of us rehabilitators. I highly recommend them.

Northwoods Humane Society	188299		/users/profile/245655	M. Nemec	Volunteer	5	11/11/2013	I have been a volunteer at Northwoods since January 2001.  I've enjoyed helping in many ways, including dog walking, cat socialization, adoption counseling, fundraising, public relations, fostering kittens, grant writing and serving on the Board of Directors for 5 years.  Both of my beloved cats, Penny & Tilly, are alumni from Northwoods!  I've also donated money to the shelter whenever I can.  I've always loved that EVERY animal is spayed or neutered before adoption.  This is wonderful, but costly and imperative in the mission of animal welfare and pet overpopulation!   Northwoods has very few staff and is mostly volunteers.  Donations are used to pay for everything from the light bill to computer ink to gasoline for transporting animals to vet appointments for exams and spay & neuter surgeries!   Staff and Volunteers work incredibly hard to ensure that each dog, cat, puppy or kitten are cared for while they await their "fur-ever" home.  RESCUE, REHABILITATE, REHOME...
Northwoods Humane Society	137043		/users/profile/182998	Miranda S.	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	I have been a volunteer with Northwoods Humane Society since 2007. I have put in many hundreds of hours in many different capacities as a volunteer. I have found that NHS has always been a place where caring for animals is paramount. The staff's commitment to helping the public find solutions to their animal challenges- whether it be taking in unwanted animals, providing information and opportunities for low-cost pet care, or helping people find new, wonderful pets to add to their families is amazing and admirable. From a veterinary standpoint, cleanliness and illness management are kept to high standards every day. From the perspective of a potential adopter, NHS provides a simple process for finding a new pet and it is easy to feel at ease after seeing how well kept the facilities are and how helpful the staff and volunteers are. I enjoy my time spent volunteering with so many great, committed people, and recommend NHS to everyone I know who is interested in finding a new pet.
Northwoods Humane Society	110432		/users/profile/150340	LauraMegan	Volunteer	5	04/21/2012	I started volunteering at Northwoods Humane Society after I was laid off from work, I had driven past twice a day for 2 years and kept thinking I should try to find some time to volunteer there. In 2011 I started as a dog walker and have loved every walk I went on. Since beginning, I have been given the opportunity to volunteer in multiple roles and learn many skills and aspects of the shelter's operations. Staff at the shelter even remembered my visit (which was 2 years prior) and welcomed me back (in this new role) with welcome arms. The acceptance and kindness I have felt while being at the Northwoods has meant so very much to me.  The support I have received from staff and fellow volunteers is equal to a family. This shelter does amazing work and is a vital organization in our small community. 
Northwoods Humane Society	54755		/users/profile/56538	ice64girl	Client Served	5	10/14/2010	I adopted a female Chihuahua about 11 years ago and a male Chihuahua 4 years ago from this shelter and was very satisfied with the adoption. The shelter is beyond clean and run very well and the staff's dedication to animals is mind-boggling. I have been very happy with my little angel dogs and would most certainly adopt another animal from this shelter in a heartbeat. The shelter manager has had years of dedication to this shelter right from the beginning and you'll not find another person more dedicated to finding homes for these dogs and cats than her. She has a genuine love for pets and works hard for this organization. I only wish we had a shelter as well run as this one is in LaSalle County Illinois. A++++
Lupus Foundation Of Minnesota	243144		/users/profile/329791	t.hoff123	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2015	Great organization! The social worker was really there for us. The rest of the dedicated staff were there to provide support  and they advocate for the lupus community. Small, efficient, top notch nin-profit...not one of those big rip-off charities..these people are there for you and really work hard and roll up their sleeves and care.

They work hard and are committed to supporting people in crisis. I don't understand the review below,  their financial reviews on charity review sites show the majority of their expenses go to serving those suffering.

Aeon	319844		/users/profile/411701	Matt1976	Volunteer	1	12/05/2016	Let me tell you all something I live in one of their buildings, and AEON is lying to all of you. I'm about to get evicted because I can't pay my rent. I don't live on the section 8 side either. All they do is threaten you with UD They do not fix things in your Apartment when they are broke. I seriously doubt that they spend the money the Government gives them to do upgrades to the building every year. Their have been over `10 Deaths in the Apartment Building that I live in and I have lived their for 7.5 years. I was on RSDI and they got on me about having to do something productive 25 hours a week. That was a addemum attached to the lease. So went I went to do something Productive I went to MCTC for a semester and a half they made me drop out because I was going to school full time and they said that was interfering with my lease. I then got a part time job because I was on RSDI and now I'm off RSDI because I went over what I could make a month by 80.00 and now I can't pay my rent and other bills. They haven't done nothing but screwed me over. OH and I should tell you there are others who they have screwed over.
Aeon	146935		/users/profile/193998	Kristin1111	Volunteer	5	12/18/2012	I volunteer with my husband and my daughers.  I found this organization online several years ago when I was looking for an opportunity where I could combine my love of cooking with my desire to help others.  AEON was absolutely the answer.  Several times a year my family along with a few friends purchase, cook and serve to the same AEON property.  I love that we are able to serve to the same property every time as we have become very close to the residents.  It has been a wonderful experience, and the residents are so humble and thankful.  I would HIGHLY recommend this organization to anyone looking for a volunteer opportunity!
Aeon	132338		/users/profile/177968	Erin_24	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I started volunteering with Aeon when my company participated in a clean-up day around their properties. It was nice to connect with my coworkers in a setting outside of work and get some fresh air while helping others. Then, I helped serve meals at Aeon apartment complexes. I love the Share-A-Meal program because the volunteers and tenants have fun while doing it, and I pick up some cooking tips along the way! I also attended several fundraising events put on by Connect, a young professionals group in alignment with Aeons mission. The Connect members get creative in finding ways to support the organization. Finally, I volunteered to teach computer skills at one of the apartments monthly. I realized that it doesnt seem like much to share a couple hours of my time and some computer know-how that I might take for granted, but it can mean a lot to the residents. In all of these experiences with Aeon, the staff has been incredibly dedicated and resourceful, the residents are thoughtful and appreciative, and Im proud to be a part of it.
Aeon	129632		/users/profile/175011	Gille Raina	Donor	5	10/26/2012	In 2003 we were introduced to AEON, an organization working to create and sustain affordable housing. This was a mission we both strongly supported. How could anyone hold a job, get a good education, and raise a family without home? We both agreed we must be a part of AEON. We have toured building projects, attended first shovel events, listened to residents' stories, and met the outstanding, dedicated staff. We have introduced AEON to many of our friends and business associates. Many have become active. Our only frustration is not being able to provide more funding. We believe AEON is strengthening individual lives and our community. It deserves your support.Marsha Gille & Roger Raina15 South First Street A1419Minneapolis, MN 55401-1823
Aeon	128110		/users/profile/173244	Denise31	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	My family and I have volunteered with Aeon for many years. It is such a rewarding experience. We bring our children with us. We serve meals to the same people in the same building. They people have become like family to us. We love to prep and cook and serve and eat and visit with the people who have become friends of ours. It is something we share with our friends. There is a small group of us that plan, buy, make and serve these great people about 5 times a year. The organization is amazing to work with. It is easy yo volunteer and you really feel that they really care about the residents and the volunteers. I really enjoy being able to bring my children. They are always excited to join us. They serve food and sit and talk with the people. The people there are excited to see them grow. I would highly recommend this organization to anyone who is looking for a life changing ongoing volunteer program to work with. 
Kids Home International	147914		/users/profile/195730	Brian56	Volunteer	5	01/10/2013	I have worked in the area of child safeguarding for many years. As a volunteer I have been involved with many projects supporting children's rights in several countries in East Africa and I count myself very fortunate to have had the privilege of visiting Kids Home International upon two occasions. The first time I visited was in December 2011 when the home was being run from a small rented house. In December 2012 I was able to return to Kericho to visit Kids Home International once again, now residing in a new building just outside of town which is able to accommodate many more children in need of their support.What I can say about the success of this project is hardly related to the physical changes which have taken place but more to do with the amazing staff who have run the home now for over 10 years. The dedication and commitment they show on a daily basis to caring for dozens of vulnerable children (on top of their own family commitments) is extremely commendable. It only takes a few minutes for any visitor to feel the great sense of warmth and belonging that exists within the walls of KHI. The compassion and understanding that the staff show towards the children is overwhelmingly inspiring.  I was lucky enough to be able to volunteer my time and some resources towards the needs of the home over Christmas.  KHI is also a model of transparency and every shilling donated is not only well accounted for but goes directly towards the priority needs of the children, again a huge credit to the staff who follow a strict code of 'watoto kwanza' (children first) in everything they do. Kids Home International is a fantastic place to work or volunteer, or even to visit. So many other children's projects could learn a great deal from them about how we should take care of the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. There is a great deal of work still to be undertaken at KHI and it has the capacity now to serve so many more needy children in the town of Kericho. I would recommend to anyone reading this who has a desire to reach out and help in a project that is deserving of their support to contact KHI and make a donation. If you find yourself in the vicinity of Kericho, Kenya, go and do more than that. Go and make a real difference. Or at least go and meet the staff and learn how real differences are made.
Kids Home International	147913		/users/profile/195729	Vikki P.	Volunteer	5	01/10/2013	I first visited Kids Home International in July 2011 while volunteering for a community organisation in Kericho, western Kenya. During my 3 month stay in Kericho, I spent a few days each week helping out at the home and entertaining the kids. It's hard to put into words how much the kids and staff in KHI touched my heart. The kids have been through so much in their young lives and yet they have found their smiles and are full of fun. The staff are incredibly dedicated and so supportive of the kids; the fact that the home has such a happy and loving environment is down to the staffs' positive attitutes and devotion to each and every child.  Many children in Western Kenya become orphans due to HIV/AIDS, whilst others suffer neglect and/or abuse at the hands of their carers. KHI offers these children a home and family in which to grow, to be loved, become educated and feel supported. I can't praise the staff at KHI enough for the help they give the kids in their care. They work tirelessly day and night, acting as mothers and aunties to 30+ children, helping them deal with and move on from their early childhood traumas.  In December 2012 the KHI family moved into a new home which had been purpose built and donated to them. I was lucky enough to be able to spend Christmas 2012 with the kids in their new home and reconnect with the staff. The home is big enough to support 100 children - to enable them to care for that many kids, they need essentials such as beds, tables, chairs, clothes, food, etc., in addition to school equipment to create their in-built nursery school. I would not hesitate to support KHI and their work and Christmas allowed me to do just that and raise funds with family and friends to help purchase a few things they needed.  Volunteering with KHI and being able to support them a little has brought me a lot of happiness but more importantly has helped put smiles on small faces and that's worth more than anything!

Kids Home is a lovely , spiritual and homely environment that provides Tender love and care to the orphaned and vulnereable children from Kericho County and beyond. The kids are brought up to love , respect and share all they can with one another thanks to the dedicated members of staff who care about the children like thir own...Despite the challenge of inadequate resources and the large number of kids they care for, the kids get the educational,emotional, physical  and spiritual support that promotes their support their stability to face life even after leaving the home...Now that I am living in the UK , am saddened that i cannot see the kids everyday....Although i work with kids in my current job (and thanks to Kids Home for helping me develop my career in working with children) , Kids Home International children are just special...I cannot wait to see them again when we visit next summer...Everyone whose been here falls in love with it.....x

We invited them due to our interest in them as a non-profit organization.  The occasion far exceeded our expectation.  The clear honesty and integrity as well as obvious live as well as passion for what they do led those there that day to become supporters of this great ministry!  
Kids Home International	94072		/users/profile/108633	Kevin C.	Volunteer	3	07/20/2011	Kids Home international is not only a shelter to destitute kids but a home to them all. In my stay at KHI, i understood better Helen Keller's words that "Face your deficiencies and acknowledge them; but do not letthem master you. Let them teach you patience, sweetness,insight. When we do the best we can, we never know whatmiracle is wrought in our life, or in the life of another". With patience and hopefulness KHI has lived through a difficult time, not more than once, and in all that the children still felt warm, appreciated and loved. financial strains could not be an obstacle to the love the staff of the HOME give the children, whom they took in as their own, care for and hoped for, sacrificed their comfort to let them have it, inspired to a fruitful life and above all, gave them the knowledge of the word of God, as their constant shield and source of hope and more so gave them education, the wealth they posses fully as their own. I remember a time they were almost kicked out of the place they have rented for having not paid the rent for a whole two years (this landlord must have been really patient with them), but alas! God opened a way. Many occasions they have gone to the extremes of borrowing friends finances to support this kids. With  better place to live, spacious home with enough playing ground would be good for these deserving kids. KHI are doing a great Job and its my prayer that they get donors to make it better for the kids.

They are always looking and asking for feedback and take on challenging topics in an effective and thoughtful manner.

Wolves Woods & Wildlife	271315	3	/users/profile/360129	tpaul	General Member of the Public	1	11/06/2015	The reason this so called business keeps evolving and changing is because they keep breeding  the animals so when they reach maturity they can be destroyed, skinned and sold. The owner has sworn to this under oath in a court of law. To try to cloak this shady business under the guise of a non-profit educational experience makes me sick!
Wolves Woods & Wildlife	259926	5	/users/profile/348456	Donotfeed	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/27/2015	I would do a zero star if possible. This "charity" is nothing but a sham 501c3 to cover for a for profit business. The owner breeds wolves, fishers, foxes, prairie dogs, and any animal she can. She then displays the animals, gets donations, has volunteers etc, and charges to "pet" or photograph the baby animals. Come winter, she kills and skins the animals and sells the bones, meat, hides, teeth, nails, you name it. DO NOT DONATE TO THIS FAKE AND DISGUSTING  charity. The animals are kept in small dirty cages with no water, and cats and chickens roaming about. If a cat or chicken happens to get in the wolf cage, opps, stupid cat. 
Wolves Woods & Wildlife	254836	6	/users/profile/343201	StevenLand	General Member of the Public	1	09/03/2015	We should not be providing funds to entities that skin animals.

My girlfriend is a volunteer so my exposure to the experience is frequent and I see changes every time I visit.  They work really hard to ensure the experience keeps changing. The experience keeps evolving and it's worth your time as an individual or as a family, to pay them a visit.
Global Citizens Network	203753		/users/profile/265800	Siysila	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	April 2014 will forever remain enshrined in my mind because of the trip I took to La Push, WA with GCN. I had inwardly known that the organization was reputable for walking its talk of providing unique immersion experiences with local communities around the world so what unfolded was not only remarkable but exceeded what words could describe. How can you clearly describe the hospitality, the outpouring of generosity in spirit and in deeds of the Quileute People? From the time we entered the village, it felt as if we were in a different world altogether. Time slowed down to a rhythm that mimic the music of waves and the winds howling through the rain forest that surrounds La Push. To me it was the must surreal experience I've ever had since emigrating to this country.  Our amazing team leader provided guided reflections of our experience and tactfully helped us to unplug and leave our different lives behind so that we could be in the moment and savor the experience. The magic of GCN was nearly palpable! The team became one family, sleeping, cooking and eating together as one. It was as if we were just another family in the village of La Push! The elders visited and had dinner with us and  we returned the visits too! They invited us into their homes, shared intimate stories of their lives and in some instances enjoined us to pray with them for peace, health and the fulfillment of our wishes.   One evening, I visited with the two elders and told stories. I sang a song in Nso and the elder sang a Quileute song too. We held hands and prayed for our brother who was going through a tough time. At some point, one elder said that it felt to him as if we had always known each other. It felt to me too.  The next day our team visited the elder of elders and made music together. He shared the Quileute lore with us and invited us to sing in the sacred circle of healing later in the evening. The tribe joined in in our song. With our voices and our drums we became one people under the sun. There were no "whys, hows, whats or whens!" Just a people in the moment, communing but yet saying nothing.  It wasn't the projects we did but the partnerships, the relationships and friendships that emerged that we celebrated at the end and continue to cherish.  I have a family in La Push now thanks to GCN. 
Global Citizens Network	182655		/users/profile/239527	urbain	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	The many trips I have taken with Global Citizen Network (GCN) as a volunteer team leader have been AWESOME!!  While visiting rural communities in Nepal, Kenya, US, Jamaica, Mexico, and  Ecuador I have gained firsthand knowledge and perspective  about the cultures, the people, and governments in the developing world.  Observing the personal transformations of GCN team participants through active engagement in community development projects is a very moving experience.  What's most powerful to me is GCN's mission: "Global Citizens Network seeks to share and promote the values of peace, justice, tolerance, cross-cultural understanding and global cooperation by providing opportunities for cross-cultural expeditions with indigenous peoples around the world."    I have lived the power, the challenge, and the joy of being a GCN volunteer involved in projects related to health, education, social issues, and employment with community members.  An enduring experience!  Since the community members themselves are required to select the local projects that GCN teams partake in,  we attentively observe their decision-making processes. Powerful!  Community members also volunteer and participate in the agreed-upon projects. Challenging!  GCN becomes a catalyst in promoting self-reliance through cooperation when working as a community team. Meaningful!  For two or three weeks the community and GCN volunteers become a core  "dream team" inspiring broader community participation.  Joyful!Thank you GCN!Leonor
Global Citizens Network	182586		/users/profile/239449	mpdetherage	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	GCN encourages us to "discover the world of differences we all have in common" and does an outstanding job balancing the needs of global volunteers and the communities served.  They lay a solid foundation for experiences that honor the common bond of humanity.  I traveled with GCN twice to Northern Brazil 2010/2011 (mostly working with and learning from the indigenous Xukuru nation as we partnered on their schools and community center) and last July to LaPush, Washington to share experiences with the indigenous Quileute nation, working on clearing out their tsunami trail.  I would highly recommend GCN, for it's careful consideration of volunteers, leaders, community projects, and structure.  My life is forever changed by my journeys with GCN and I'm looking forward to the next opportunity to serve in partnership.      
Global Citizens Network	182341		/users/profile/239153	ninaexploradora	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	I traveled with GCN to Ecuador with my cousins and it was an amazing experience.  This trip afford us the time to grow as a family and connect deeply.  We learned so much about one another through our interactions with the community.  The people of Tumbatu were so welcoming and it is obvious how much effort GCN puts into the relationships with the communities where they partner.  This trip inspired me to slow down, understand how non-Westerners do development and the true meaning of solidarity.  
Global Citizens Network	179563		/users/profile/236153	MBoss	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I had an amazing experience with Global Citizens Network when I went to Chirapa, Peru in December 2012. I had always traveled solo before to Latin America so team travel was new to me. I met incredible people from the states as well as the community and fell in love with team travel. Having a rich experience on a team to process and reflect was critical to our success in working effectively with the community on a project driven by their PTA. I have new life-long friends after this experience! 
Store to Door	25398	10	/users/profile/26389	yogiberra1	Volunteer	5	01/10/2010	I have been a volunteer at Store to Door for approximately 10 years. I have been able to see first hand how this unique service enables senior citizens to be able to continue to live in their homes knowing that the grocery products that they want and need will be delivered in a timely fashion and at a reasonable cost.Personal experience has taught me that this kind of service is not available in most other locations .  As a result, older adults are often forced to move to care facilities which are not only expensive but often not aligned with what their preference would be.
Store to Door	25351	4	/users/profile/26333	groceryguru	Volunteer	5	01/08/2010	I have been a Volunteer Order Taker with Store To Door for over 5 years, and I can't think of anything I do that is more gratifying.  Every week my clients tell me how much they rely on Store To Door, and how they don't know what they would do without this service. For me, spending 2-3 hours on the phone every Wednesday is such a simple way to make a big difference in the lives of others.
Store to Door	25306	4	/users/profile/26282	pajamawearingordertaker	Volunteer	5	01/07/2010	I have been mostly an order taker and also a shopper for Store-to-Door for the past 6 years. As I always tell people as an order taker its one of the few volunteer jobs I can do in pajamas! Seriously I was drawn to Store-to-Door after caring for my mother during her chronic illness. I was able to shop for her, but was comforted to know there was an organization like Store-to-Door that existed if she had not been able. Store-to-Door not only helps the elderly maintain their indpendence it also gives caregivers a much needed break from one of their caregiver activities. I can't recommend this organization enough for both its mission to its customer and as a volunteer I am proud to be a part of providing this service.
Store to Door	25304	4	/users/profile/26280	S2Dordertaker	Volunteer	5	01/07/2010	I have been a volunteer order taker now for Store to Door (S2D) for over 2 years now. I originally saw a piece on TV about them. I checked them out, one of the most important things for me was how much of budget was spent on the actual services and clients. Well it was on the order of $0.85 on the dollar. I started with 4 clients and worked my way up at one point to 12, I currently call 8 seniors. I think it takes so little time to do this, and to know you can make a real difference in their quality of life well that just adds to the joy of doing it!
Store to Door	24425	4	/users/profile/25489	6amshopper	Volunteer	5	12/17/2009	I have been a volunteer shopper with Store to Door for three months and find the experience very worthwhile. I learned about Store to Door from another volunteer and was impressed with its mission.  My father died earlier this year and was able to stay in his own home until that time.  I came to realize how important this was to him and his self-esteem. If my volunteering with Store to Door can enable others to continue living in their homes, then I'm more than happy to do it.  Besides the satisfaction is provides in giving something back to the community, I find I learn a lot about what products are available in the stores we shop. It can be very challenging to find some of the items requested and the sense of accomplishment is also a reward.  This volunteer experience has made me a better shopper for my own personal needs.  What a plus!I'm a strong believer in what Store to Door does and am a donor as well.
AdoptAClassroom.org	280459		/users/profile/370342	Diana98	Client Served	5	02/17/2016	This organization works to match donors with classrooms. Adopt-A-Classroom has helped to bring many extra resources into my classroom.
AdoptAClassroom.org	220412	1	/users/profile/284061	relaible	Advisor	5	10/06/2014	I work with a lower economic level school in Cali Colombia. We have been fortunate to receive the generosity of many thoughtful people. We feel that one of most important factors is to inform the donor with specific information about their donation. I would recommend to anyone who is generous is to verify their funds use, unfortunately there are unscrupulous person who set up scams.
AdoptAClassroom.org	145805		/users/profile/192376	Anna40	Donor	1	12/03/2012	I donated to four different classrooms but none of the classrooms spent the funds I donated.  I contacted Adopt a Classroom several times and was basically told to wait it out and eventually they would be used. I also only received communication from 2 of the 4 teachers that I donated to. This charity claims that what separates it from other classroom charities is the relationship between the donor and classroom - they aim to make it long term so that classrooms get adopted year after year by the same sponsor. There's no communication and no accountability. I decided to give this charity a chance after spending 5 years donating to DonorsChoose (which is much better run).  I'll stick with DonorsChoose. I hate seeing my donated money trapped in limbo not being used.
AdoptAClassroom.org	124619	2	/users/profile/169540	Hilda the philanthropist	Donor	5	10/05/2012	I have donated to Adopt a Classroom since 2009. Through this terrific organization, I have donated to teachers in different states, serving elementary, middle, and high school. The teachers have all communicated with me afterwards to express their gratitude and several have told me how easy it is for them access the funds and purchase needed school supplies. Please note: Some teachers are inundated with e-mails and may overlook the e-mail from Adopt a Classroom informing them that they have received a donation (or perhaps the e-mail was diverted to the teachers junk folder). In the rare instances when I noticed that 3 months had passed since I donated, but I had not received an impact statement or thank you from the teacher, I contacted the school and/or the teacher directly to let them know that I had donated through Adopt a Classroom and that they had funds pending. In each case, the teacher was simply not aware that they had received a donation. I am very pleased with Adopt a Classroom and am confident that every dollar donated to a teacher makes its way to his/her classroom.
AdoptAClassroom.org	100855	2	/users/profile/125315	cchrone	Donor	1	11/20/2011	I have donated $213.20.  $100 on 9/21/2009 and $113.20 on 12/30/2009.  After waiting a few months from the September donation, I sent Adopt-A-Classroom an e-mail asking why my donation had not been used.  they said the teacher never used the money, and gave me the option to pick a different school to move the donation to.  I did that, and added the second $100 so now 1 school has received $200 from me, and I also did the remaining donation to the actual Adopt-A-Classroom overhead fees.  After that, I waited until the following september (2010) and when I went in, I saw that not only was nothing bought by the classroom, it only showed that I've donated $100 total, and still nothing has been bought.  I've contacted Adopt-A-Classroom numerous times. Many times I received a response that they would look into it, and get back to me, and other times I have received absolutely no response.  I have copies of all e-mail correspondance. I have spent over $200 and so far have seen none of it used.  I understand that some of this is not the charity's fault, as I've been donating to schools in the bush of Alaska, so the teachers may not have a way to use it right away, but it's been almost 2 years, and the charity has done nothing to correct this.  
Sexual Violence Center	93276		/users/profile/107120	Christina M.	Volunteer	5	07/01/2011	I have been a volunteer at the Sexual Violence Center for over a year now.  During my time, I have answered crisis line calls on overnight shifts, as well as met clients at the hospital during an evidentiary exam.  I've also been a peer counselor for mostly the Spanish-speaking clientele that come through our doors.  By far the best experience I've had working at SVC has been facilitating a support group for high school girls.  I had an amazing group of teens who had really been through a lot.  During those three months, we built trust with each other and slowly worked our way through painful experiences.  We talked about self-care and coping--ways to deal with the pain that are positive and self-loving.  At the end of our time together, I could see the growth and healing that had begun in these girls, and it was such a powerful experience for me!

Client Served	5	07/01/2011	I'm a survivor of childhood sexual violence and about 7 yrs ago I called them seeking counseling when I was disabled by severe PTSD symptoms. They were extremely supportive and helpful in every way, providing me with free one to one counseling for many weeks. With their help I was able to reach a place in my healing process I'd never thought possible before. They helped me to feel empowered by seeking counseling and that I wasn't weak to need help. I can honestly say that they helped to change my life; I'm now back in college and have been actively volunteering as a mentor to "at-risk" young women and with other women survivors as a peer counselor.

Eckankar	102691	1	/users/profile/119055	pawsathome	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/29/2011	www.eckankar.org   - - Programs: Teaches individuals spiritual tools and exercises to enhance one's spiritual beliefs, through a series of discourses and Satsang (group coursework). The path is an "active" vs "passive" teaching. The path is about "personal" growth - not about how to "fix other people"  nor "to help one interfere with someone else's karma." Members and attendees can attend classes, worship services, seminars, spiritual discussion classes, listen to tapes or watch DVDs and videos. Members train to have direct experiences in spiritual learning,  in and "out of" body through "soul travel".  ECKANKAR from my understanding, was founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965. He had researched a number of "secret" spiritual teachings from the Far East, and organized religious paths, at a very deep level, and brought their common ground together in one place, forming ECKANKAR.  Paul was an amazing man who authored something like 35 books in a period of about six years! (in the days before computers - this was all by typewriter!) Most of the books are still in print today.  The teachings include knowledge brought out by an unbroken line of spiritual teachers "Masters" dating back supposedly to the beginning of recorded history.  Members "respect" whoever holds the title of Living ECK Master, but do not "worship the personality". There have been three modern day Masters, including Paul Twitchell, to date since 1965.  Presently, today, ECKANKAR operates a Community HU Program, working with other spiritual paths and organized religions, and public locations such as long term care homes, hospitals, yoga or nutritional  stores, etc. sharing the "HU" (pronounced "Hyuooo") - which is an ancient name for God and chanted. The word is found dating back centuries in many religious paths: Christianity as Hallelujah, Judism, and even in the word "human" (god-man).  The HU is used for really anything you want to have help with -- from a spiritual exercise, to when you are feeling lonely, healing a broken heart,  help with grieving, bringing peace, calmness, and an experience of Divine Love. The ECKANKAR website goes into  a lot more depth as well as has an online bookstore. If you look on the website, there is a link to a page with a sample 5-minute MP3 of the HU chant.  ECKANKAR today has members in almost every country in the world. While ECKANKAR holds publicly "open" meetings, the organization does NOT seek out new members. "Evangelism" is not part of its mandate. People who are Spiritual Seekers - perhaps having spiritual experiences they don't understand, or a feeling or longing that there 'has to be more to life than what they are being told', or maybe they are just curious, or maybe they have had a loved one pass over  - and now they are getting "visited" ....all are some of the reasons people come check out ECKANKAR...it helps them to find answers and have more spiritual experiences to answer their questions.  It has a large spiritual center located in Chanhassen, MN, in the US. If you did your search under ECKANKAR, you may have noticed it pulled up many Satsang Societies as well. In each state, there is a Satsang Society, which is a state registered nonprofit religious organization which oversees ECKANKAR programs within the state.   [Contributed by a legal consultant on ecclesiastic law. I am also a 42 year member of ECKANKAR. For me, through doing the spiritual exercises I've learned through studying and following this path for so many years, I can't imagine living any other way.  Experiences I have had: Warnings of pending danger by an Inner voice; seeing "golden hands on my steering wheel" - steering my car out of what likely would have been a fatal crash (car going over the edge of the road and down on to another freeway below); asking for and being shown something I could use to help me align my focus in my career in a more effective way - and this year I launch a seminar series based on what I was shown; have written music, poetry, shown how to do unique art projects; received Inner guidance on things to check on for legal cases I am working on; been awakened in the middle of the night to turn on a particular tv channel -- and it would turn out 'that channel' would have a speaker on talking specifically about something I needed in information for legal cases; being shown experiences before they unfolded so i would recognize these when they happened and be able to handle better; shown Akashic Records; been able to "see" and be shown character flaws and how to fix these. Many things are sped up -- I've seen a lot of things on the Inner that when I can "see" them in a detached way, I can just fix these and stop the outer world emotional pain for myself. The spiritual growth and path are constantly changing, growing, evolving. Every day holds something "new".]

It has been a blessing to know that a simple cake is bringing together our families and allowing our youth to know someone cares about them and wants to celebrate their BIRTH!  Veronica has always been super flexible, understanding, and great to work with.  Since we serve a diverse community, it is extremely helpful that she has been able to communicate in English & Spanish.  WE LOVE CAKE ON WHEELS!  Thank you!

The task on hand was to make and decorate 800 mini cupcakes for foster kids.  Vero managed to have them all baked by the time the decorators arrived!! She was so organized that between the four of us the task was rapidly accomplished.  She is a pleasure to work with,  friendly, passionate about providing happiness to others, caring, overall an all around  wonderful person.

They facilitate the tree plantings in the community they serve making cities more beautiful but also the whole planet a better place. The activities are fun and family friendly. It not unusual to see little kids carrying small buckets of water to water the tree they just helped planting. The staff is excited and passionate about planting. It's a win-win. They trees that they plant will be there for generations to enjoy
Tree Trust	83240	1	/users/profile/91994	Gordon H.	Volunteer	5	03/25/2011	I have volunteered at many tree planting projects over the years with Tree Trust, but I believe the plantings where you work with school children may be my favorites.  Every year Tree Trust works with selected schools to plant trees on school grounds.  But the greatest thing is that the kids at the schools get to do the planting, with a little help from teachers, parents and other adult volunteers like myself. On planting day, kids at the schools are bursting with energy. Each classroom is assigned a tree or two to plant.  You can just feel the enthusiasm as kids dig, water and mulch their tree.  They take great pride and ownership of their tree, and younger kids often give their tree a name.  I like to tell the kids to always remember their tree, and to come back and visit as they reach future milestones in their lives, such as high school graduation.  Tree Trust makes it a great day with excellent planning, organization and cheerfulness on planting day.

Hughes Foundation	42226	6	/users/profile/42954	becky1976	Donor	5	05/31/2010	Jerry was born on February 24, 1974 to an unwed mother. She was sixteen and had a family who loved them both and supported them in all ways possible. Through middle-school and high-school Jerry always had a job, delivering newspapers, working at a local restaurant and rouging seed corn in the summer. He has a great work ethic. Jerrys love for people has shown thru his many friends and mission trips. Graduating high-school and college brought him to live and work in Minneapolis, MN. He has been there for many people, from mentoring to underprivileged children to inviting a homeless man into his home for a meal.On April 14, 2004 Jerry was diagnosed with HIV. Instead of crumbling into despair, fear and even death, Jerry chose life. Through education on HIV/Aids around the world and encouragement from many supporters, the Hughes Foundation was born. Jerrys love for all people and his strong faith has made it possible.The Hughes Foundation is about hope, healing, prevention and life. Hope for many people with HIV/AIDS who otherwise would live or die in despair. Healing of the spirit with words of encouragement and unconditional love. Prevention through education on the facts about HIV/AIDS. And the most important, life, that even one life on this earth is worthy of living a happy, healthy and productive life.

Since the beginning, Jerry and the Hughes Foundation team have boldly pushed the bounds of what is possible, forming lasting partnerships with community and government leaders from India, Namibia, and the US. The foundation has grown immensely, and it continues to affect large-scale change while also remained focused on individual and community healing. I have been glad to support Hughes Foundation financially for 3 years because I believe in Jerry's humble leadership and bold vision. I am honored to support an evolving organization that shares hope with the world.
Hughes Foundation	39244	9	/users/profile/40195	tomkubinski	Board Member	0	05/17/2010	I met Jerry many years ago and found a man who really understands what it takes to make a difference in the world (especially when things do not make sense), a new found energy, a desire to take the focus off myself and to work together with him so that I/we may help others in need.His passion and commitment is so strong that one can not help but be swept up by it.  His story is one that really puts it all in proper perspective as well.  It not only touches those who are infected, but allows those who are not, a better understanding of what it is all about, what it is like to deal with every day and so much more.The Hughes Foundation is an excellent tool that helps all this to come together.So, I joined as a board member to really put things in motion and boy, did we put things in motion!!!We were able to solidify many different camps for a variety of different individuals and their needs.  Ones that normally would have been cast aside and forgotten.  Most not knowing that others cared and could help.  Those who were left out on the streets with no where to go, no hope, no sense of belonging and some that felt they had no reason to go on living.To save one life with giving them hope was a true testiment to one type of success.  To be able to provide education on prevention, how to deal with it, giving them a place to go, belong are all other types of success.Yet, Jerry is only one man and needs a lot of assistance from volunteers, board members, sponsors, grants and individual donations.  It is with these additional tools that the Hughes Foundation can continue to make differences all around the world and here too in the USA.  One of the most common questions we received, was what can I do to help.  The best response I could give, was please donate now so that the Hughes Foundation can continue to make a difference, open up other tools that it is trying to bring to life to help those in need.
Hughes Foundation	39013	4	/users/profile/39944	butterfly1	Volunteer	0	05/14/2010	I met Jerry several months ago and upon meeting him I knew there was something special about him.  He shared his story with me, his work with the foundation, and his passion and compassion for ministering to people affected by HIV/AIDS.  As I was listening to him I knew this was his mission and purpose in life and I absolutley wanted to be involved in any way I could be. I have been volunteering with him for several months and have been awe-struck at the impact that he and his Foundation has had on the lives of others. Point blank, Jerry and this Foundation are saving lives and giving people hope---in a time where our world desperately needs it. Jerry courageously walks, loves and ministers to people and places where others are afraid to go. His steadfast faith and determination to help others inspires me and encourages me daily to live a life without fear and to give back to others in need. I'm so proud to be a part of something that is so much bigger than me.

Students Today Leaders Forever	131893		/users/profile/177491	Dawn35	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2012	Pay It Forward came into our lives in late December 2007. Our daughter was a freshman in high school at the time. I remember she came home from school very excited telling us about this multi-city community service bus tour her teacher had spoke to her class about. Her excitement was infectious, I told her I would have to check my work schedule and see if I could take off and let her know if I could go.   Imagine my shock when she said I couldnt go!  Yeah, I was that Mom, the one who took off work to chaperone every field trip! Now, I was being told I couldnt go and to make matters worse none of her friends were going. I looked at my husband and gave him one of my are we nuts? looks as we agreed to let her go.  Over the next few days communication was once a day, for a few minutes, she seemed tired but was having a great time. She had a new Pay It forward family and she learned how to bus surf and they seemed to be speaking a different language. What I wasnt prepared for was when I put my little girl on that coach bus, that she would come home to us a strong service conscientious young woman.  As she reminisced and discussed the Tour with us, I was proud and touched on how she had grown and how through this Tour and serving others her self confidence had developed and how grateful she was for the little things, like a hot shower and a comfy bed.  Over the next few years my daughter would help recruit, market and advocate Pay It Forward tours at her school. She would speak about making hammocks for monkeys and how appreciative the zookeepers were. The impact of the smiles on the senior citizens faces showing how grateful they were for their company. And when all of the trees (600) were planted, they knew they were not only helping the environment but saving a very small staff time and effort.  Fast forward, it is now 2011, my daughter is a senior in high school and I am very proud to say she has participated in a Tour each year of school and was a bus leader on one of the Tours. We recently hosted a bus sleepover which represented 4 different schools and 20 Pay It Forward family members were able to attend.  My daughter was a Cheerleader for all four years of high school and Varsity Captain for three years. She is not your typical cheerleader and the fact that Pay It Forward takes the time to teach kids about abolishing stereotypes is very uplifting. Your life lessons through group activities are so rewarding and appreciated. As a parent, I have witnessed the growth and self-confidence these Tours have helped build and the friendships that may never have happened.  Recently and through tears, I had the pleasure of witnessing this exchange with a member of my daughters cheer squad joined the Tour this year, she said, For two years I kind of made fun of you, I didnt understand why you were so passionate about Pay It Forward, now I get it and I am so sorry, it has changed my life forever, thank you! With that exchange they both hugged.  My daughter turned and looked at me just smiled! I am so very proud, yeah I am that Mom!!
Students Today Leaders Forever	131832	1	/users/profile/177421	Jon_5	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Students Today Leaders Forever has positively impacted my life more than anything else. From STLF i have learned so much about myself, other people, and the community through the relationships made, the service I have done, and the reflection activities. STLF has changed my life in so many different ways; all for the better! I am so lucky to have had this experience. There are so many great things that I want to say about STLF, but no words are great enough to express my feelings toward this Organization. STLF is one of those organization that in order to fully understand it you have to experience it for yourself. STLF has taught me how amazing youth is, there attitudes toward service, there strive to be thoughtful, and compassion for others. The relationships that I have made through STLF are unlike any others; the trust built in just a few days is extraordinary! Everyone can change the world, but not everyone knows they can--this is what STLF teaches! STLF is the most impacting and empowering organization that I have ever known. 
Students Today Leaders Forever	131524	2	/users/profile/177085	Kelse064	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Students Today Leaders Forever and the Pay It Forward Tour was possibly the most life-changing  experience that I have ever had. I have been on several, and since led Pay It Forward tours, and even though I have been disconnected from the organization for quite some time, I will NEVER forget the impact that it had on my life. I was fortunate to have had my first Pay It Foward Tour as a freshman in college, and it resulted in a new sense of self-confidence, and community on the large University of Minnesota campus. The service that I did on my PIF tours has resulted in new perspective on the world, and new meaning to service, and the importance of service. The friends that I made in STLF will be life-long. I cannot express how much this organization has done for my life.

Children here are not talked down to - the youngest of toddlers are not spoken to in baby talk. Each child is respected, taught grace, and challenged to attempt "work" with real materials. There are no plastic tea sets here! My daughter started at 2.5 making snack for herself, "walking the line" and observing the older children in her class (Montessori classrooms are mixed age). She is now 5 and writing full sentence stories in cursive and has an amazing understanding of math and the quantities of numbers. Staff are excellent, parents are warm and friendly.

Client Served	5	09/25/2013	My deaf/hard of hearing grandchildren attended this school and have done extremely well both academically and socially.  They have cochlear implants and enrolled in this school to be able to receive the benefits of an oral education.  The teachers and staff are dedicated and make learning fun.  The purpose of the school is to teach dhh children to learn to listen and talk, not to sign.  We are fortunate to have this school as an option!  There are not enough quality schools for the dhh who wish to learn to talk.  For those who do not want this approach, they should choose a school that conforms with their ideals.  My grandchildren learned and use American Sign Language at home.  To further expand their potential they learned to listen and talk at Northern Voices.  What a blessing this school is!  They are now mainstreamed in public school and doing so well, due in large part to the foundation and nurturing they received at Northern Voices.  
Northern Voices	150355	1	/users/profile/200499	Kelly74	Client Served	5	03/01/2013	I also completely disagree with the individual who rated this school poorly. My son is hard of hearing, and has been attending this school for 5 months. The progress he has made has been unbelievable. The school is very upfront noting that it is a school for ORAL education. There are other schools if you want your child to be taught in ASL. Whoever wrote that review was obviously not paying attention to ANYTHING on the school's website or in parent meetings. Do your research before you condemn them for something they of course would not be offering.
Northern Voices	57141		/users/profile/60026	Mary Ann	Client Served	5	11/16/2010	I beg to differ with the individual who calls this school hostile.  Of course they do not teach sign.  Who would want to have their child miss out on everything this hearing world has to offer.  Any hearing parent, who agrees to a coclhear implant, is initiating the process of keeping their flesh and blood from drifting to the deaf community.  I am  so grateful for this wonderful school and dedicate staff, because of them I can communicate with my granddaughter.  I shead tears of joy when this little girl said Hi Grandma for the first time.  It could have been tears of frustration and pain if her parents had only allowed her sign as a means of communication.  Because  of technology, no child has to ever experience a world of confusion, and frustration because they have not been provided the opportunity to learn to hear.  Hats off to Northern Voices and their important role  of teaching  these little CoClhear children to listen and eventually to speak.  Keep it up!!!  
Northern Voices	36737	4	/users/profile/37527	johnjonesiv	General Member of the Public	1	04/23/2010	This school is a hostile environment due to banning sign language and forcing oralism on the poor children.

360 Communities	208840	3	/users/profile/271589	John258	Volunteer	5	08/06/2014	I am a member of the Minnesota Army National Guard.  One of my additional duties is serving as a sexual assault victim advocate for my units.  I was looking for a way to gain experience is providing advocacy services, and it was suggested that I look for ways to volunteer in this capacity in my community.  360 Communities is located in my county, so I looked there first.  The path to volunteering with 360 was very easy to complete.  I attended a 40 hour training session, where I expanded my knowledge of advocacy services.  They also did a background check on me.  Once training was complete and my background check was verified, I was able to start my volunteer service.  I have responded to 6 calls for sexual assault victim advocate.  I find the work very fulfilling and it has definitely met my needs for increased experience as a victim advocate.

They do a tremendous job and have been fantastic to work with. They truly care about the victims that come into their system and are working very hard on outreach programs to expand their services to more victims. They also truly appreciate my service and have made me feel very accepted into their "community".      Mine has been a wonderful and fulfilling volunteer experience where I truly feel that I am contributing something useful and needed, and would highly recommend this organization to anyone seeking to "make a difference" through community service!

The early years were a nightmare that that they helped me endure.  Not only did they help me endure it, but they showed me the path to a new life and a new future.  In the past six years, as a domestic abuse survivor, I still stay in touch with them several times a year.  They initiate the contact just to see how I am doing, what is going on in my life, how my children are doing, and to show their support.  How many organizations stay in touch with former clients this long?  I am not just a number or a former client to them.  I am a friend, a mother, a daughter, a person.   I consider them to be extended members of my family.  They are the reason I am here today to write this review.  I put my faith and trust in them, and I am now exceeding goals that I had set years ago and never thought I could achieve.  All throughout this time, they had my back and encouraged me every step of the way. Regaining self-confidence and a feeling of self-worth is never an easy process.  God bless them for helping me do just that.  
360 Communities	57211	1	/users/profile/60134	Karen S.	Client Served	1	11/17/2010	360 Communities falls far short of expectations for survivors of domestic violence. While this agency professes to empower survivors of violence to attain self-sufficiency, this is merely lip service when a woman attempts to rise above her past and become an accepted member of society. My personal experience with 360 Communities' Lewis House began when I attended their battered women's support group. During my tenure as a "victim" of abuse, the staff turnover was so frequent that one barely had time to develop a clinical gestalt with advocates and support group leaders before they were fired, downsized, or otherwise transferred to other positions. One particular advocate was not even allowed to say goodbye to the women she served. Years later, when I had successfully overcome my personal issues with domestic violence I felt a strong desire to give back to my community in the area of domestic violence. I applied as a volunteer at 360 Communities Lewis House, and was told that survivors of abuse made excellent volunteers, and that I could begin training at the next possible opportunity. I agreed to attend additional training in sexual assault services, even though the training was a heavy burden on me because I was also attending college and working toward my Bachelor's degree in Human Services. Understandably, volunteers must undergo a background check, and I was honest about my past as a survivor of abuse, in which I had pled guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct in self-defense when I was still in an abusive relationship. I was told that this would not be a problem, so I continued with my training. When I was about half-way through with my training I was told that I was not eligible to volunteer. This was done via e-mail; I was not even given the courtesy of a personal conversation. When I finally saw the email several days later, I asked about my training and was told that I could indeed complete my certification in Sexual Assault Services. This too was a lie. When I arrived for training my training log had been removed from the folder, and when I asked about it the trainer stated that she didn't know what I was talking about. I called the volunteer coordinator and was told that I would no longer be able to attend training. During my early training with 360 Communities I was told that this organization does not distinguish between volunteers, clients, or board members; we are simly all "neighbors" and should be treated as such. This is a very noble goal, and one that 360 Communities should pay more attention to actually doing, rather than just paying lip service. It appears that 360 Communities would rather keep women trapped in the cycle of abuse rather than regard them as contributing members of society.

With a highly engaged operational team and excellent leadership, Wayside House has continued to succeed during difficult financial times, mostly due to the character, commitment, and talent within the organization.  Wayside House believes that all women are wonderful and can succeed regardless of the challenges.  Wayside doesn't simply provide one-stop treatment, it offers a long-term approach to helping women get back into the world, with new hope and tools to survive.
Wayside House, Inc.	64822		/users/profile/70869	steele	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I've only been volunteering at Wayside for a short time, but I've learned a great deal about how many lives the organization touches on a daily basis.  They aren't just helping the women that arrive there for treatment, they are helping the families who love and miss these women who have been handcuffed by addiction.  They bring out the best in women who didn't realize that they had a "best."  Wayside helps the community by attempting to tackle one of the toughest issues that face this nation by eliminating the perpetual addiction cycle. Outside of this, Wayside has incredible opportunities for volunteers.  Volunteers can be as involved as they have personal capacity for, without pressure, and all ideas are welcomed to the table.  Sharing talents among women who have not had the opportunity to learn life skills is an honorable task, and I'm glad to be able to help Wayside accomplish their mission.

Its costs are low and it makes a difference in the lives of the women it serves - it should be seriously considered by anyone looking for a place to serve or support.
Wayside House, Inc.	39843	4	/users/profile/40801	roons01	Client Served	5	05/21/2010	I came to Wayside a broken woman, with no apparent hope that I could overcome my drug addiction.  After my son was seriously injured, and became a quadraplegic, I turned to drugs and alcohol to dull the emotional pain.  In a very short time, I was addicted to crack cocaine and would do just about anything to get my drug. One day it just became too much and I asked for help.  I was placed at Wayside House, Inc. for a 90 day treatment program.  I had never been to treatment before, so I was unsure what to expect.  My first impression was that of gratitudefor the way I was treated by the staff.  I was treated with dignity and respect, two things I didn't feel I even deserved.  I met my counselor, who explained to me that we would not just treat my addiction but the circumstances that led me to it.  I had become a shell of a person due to my addiction, I had no emotions and really no feelings whatsoever.  But as soon as we started my counseling sessions and dug into what really affected me, whether it was 10 days or 10 years ago, I began to think that maybe there was hope.  The 90 days I spent at Wayside were the most enlightening of my life.  I was given tools so that I can handle life's ups and downs, no matter how tragic, without drugs or alcohol.   Today I am sober 15 months and living and loving life.  I am still active in the Wayside programs such as alumni committee, recovery groups, etc. Quite simply, Wayside saved my life and I am grateful forever to all the staff. And I know, even today, that they are there for me should I struggle.  It's an awesome program and a godsend for those of us who truly believed there was no hope.

The church shell was already built when PPM joined the local effort in completing this structure. The church in Belize City was already driving the 45 minutes out to the village of La Democracia and holding church services on the basketball court as well as holding meetings in home with key leaders and families in the community. A couple things stood out:1. The local Christian effort was already at work. We were simply partnering with on ongoing effort.2. PPM listens to the local pastors and leadership. There is no PPM agenda, except to assist and support the local church and her efforts.3. There is a high emphasis on the local church and community serving together with the mission team. 4. PPM raises up, trains, and employs local leadership for meals, service project direction, and even to help lead their mission groups.5. PPM not only allows, but encourages long term partnerships between North American Churches and the local church they desire to serve. This emphasis is on relationships over the idea of checking off a country to serve in or a project to complete. PPM seems to be leading a new moment and philosophy in short term missions organizations in this respect. In serving with PPM over the last ten years, here are some additional items I appreciate:1. PPM's model (developed by the local pastors and leaders) is not to build a camp and run groups through their compound. In 2015, PPM serves about 50 unique communities each year in Belize only. One community may only see one mission team a year. PPM serves over ten countries currently.2. The culture of Praying Pelican Missions is one of the pursuit of excellence and to learn, implement, and model best practices if need be. This usually takes more time, money, resources, and development of relationships then a tradition camp style mission effort. My degree is in education. I am currently on the Board of Directors for Praying Pelican Missions and serve as the Vice President of Operations for Praying Pelican Missions.    
Praying Pelican Missions	248648	3	/users/profile/336409	Merv M.	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	We are planning our forth short term mission trip with Praying Pelicans. Here's why I feel that Praying Pelican's is the most effect mission group that I have ever served with. 1, Their missions serve indiginous churches and pastors. The Indigenous  pastor knows the needs of their community better than any missionary could. 2, Praying Pelicans understands our goals in serving in Belize. 3, They plan  and execute well. 4, The pastors and churches that they serve have been carefully selected. 5,We have a very strong return rate year after year due to the positive experience that our volunteers have had. 
Praying Pelican Missions	148493	10	/users/profile/197669	benworship	Client Served	5	01/24/2013	My relationship with PPM started over four years ago during a less than inspiring and captivating Plenary Session during a conference that led me to seek refuge out on the Mezzanine where I saw a Praying Pelican Missions table and the one and only Jon Nelson. Jon and PPM were the first mission organization who took the time to listen and hear what I had to say and what my particular church and ministry was looking for and not just spew a sales pitch back at me. By the end of that first conversation, I decided that somehow I was taking my team on a mission trip THAT year with PPM. Well, four years later, I have led 3 mission trips with PPM and am currently planning our fourth.  The level of professionalism and the lengths to which everyone at PPM goes to in order to make the experience worthwhile and meaningful continues to amaze me. I have had the pleasure of having Christopher Fry lead 2 of my trips and he is going to lead our trip this year as well. While every trip consultant/leader is awesome, I can not say enough good things about Christoper! When I need information or help or just want to talk about ministry and mission, he is always there to answer my questions and go the extra mile in order to make sure I have everything I need.    When he finally has to sleep to take a day off, the rest of the PPM staff is equally as helpful and awesome. I feel like I am on a first-name basis with a great number of the staff and they have become more than an organization that plans an annual mission trip for my church; they are my partners in ministry, they are my friends and they are my family. Praying Pelican allows you to stop focusing on the minutia of leading mission trips and allows you to place it back where it belongs; on serving a lost and dying world and presenting them with love, compassion and mercy through Jesus Christ.

Client Served	5	09/25/2013	My deaf/hard of hearing grandchildren attended this school and have done extremely well both academically and socially.  They have cochlear implants and enrolled in this school to be able to receive the benefits of an oral education.  The teachers and staff are dedicated and make learning fun.  The purpose of the school is to teach dhh children to learn to listen and talk, not to sign.  We are fortunate to have this school as an option!  There are not enough quality schools for the dhh who wish to learn to talk.  For those who do not want this approach, they should choose a school that conforms with their ideals.  My grandchildren learned and use American Sign Language at home.  To further expand their potential they learned to listen and talk at Northern Voices.  What a blessing this school is!  They are now mainstreamed in public school and doing so well, due in large part to the foundation and nurturing they received at Northern Voices.  
Northern Voices	150355	1	/users/profile/200499	Kelly74	Client Served	5	03/01/2013	I also completely disagree with the individual who rated this school poorly. My son is hard of hearing, and has been attending this school for 5 months. The progress he has made has been unbelievable. The school is very upfront noting that it is a school for ORAL education. There are other schools if you want your child to be taught in ASL. Whoever wrote that review was obviously not paying attention to ANYTHING on the school's website or in parent meetings. Do your research before you condemn them for something they of course would not be offering.
Northern Voices	57141		/users/profile/60026	Mary Ann	Client Served	5	11/16/2010	I beg to differ with the individual who calls this school hostile.  Of course they do not teach sign.  Who would want to have their child miss out on everything this hearing world has to offer.  Any hearing parent, who agrees to a coclhear implant, is initiating the process of keeping their flesh and blood from drifting to the deaf community.  I am  so grateful for this wonderful school and dedicate staff, because of them I can communicate with my granddaughter.  I shead tears of joy when this little girl said Hi Grandma for the first time.  It could have been tears of frustration and pain if her parents had only allowed her sign as a means of communication.  Because  of technology, no child has to ever experience a world of confusion, and frustration because they have not been provided the opportunity to learn to hear.  Hats off to Northern Voices and their important role  of teaching  these little CoClhear children to listen and eventually to speak.  Keep it up!!!

Bilingual education with American Sign Language and English is the way to go - its what every other school in Minnesota does.

In a very short turn around time they supplied our volunteer Girl Scout troop leaders with hundreds of detailed maps throughout southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin that improved the experience and quality of the cookie program for our girls and leaders.  They used our data sets to help girls make smart choices about which streets had a high potential for sales.  The girls also had a safer experience thanks to the detailed maps.  The maps also were an excellent and fun tool to learn about map-reading and location-finding.1000 Friends staff were extremely bright and responsive to our short turn around.  Their consulting rate was affordable and their results were of very high quality.  We look forward to working with them again.

Yet this is exactly what keeps the fires burning at 1000 Friends of Minnesota. This organization leads one of the most complex and challenging discussions of our time by attempting to promote healthy, growing, economically viable communities while at the same time arguing for thoughtful and careful land use and planning policies at all levels of government. 1000 Friends of MN knows how important jobs and economic growth are but they also know that careless development taints our waters, degrades our air quality, wastes huge tracts of land and places unnecessary fiscal burdens on all of us. They need our support in the face of expanded public infrastructure and deferred maintenance on bridges, sewers and all the other public costs associated with growing inefficiently. The staff at 1000 Friends works to bring these complex public choices into the open so that we can discuss them in the full light of day with as many facts as the system can stand to digest. We know for too long public coffers have been squandered by poor planning and careless development.1000 Friends works tirelessly to advance the understanding that all communities, our region, our counties and our state must make better public investment choices and plan better for a bright future for all.As the past Executive Director of this organization I know how dedicated the staff and the board are to this important mission. Lets keep this important organization vital and strong so the state of MN can remain vital and strong.

As a 2009 summer intern in the Lakes Region Office, I quickly discovered the special culture of devotion and enthusiasm within the 1000 Friends of Minnesota circle. The staff, Board of Directors, members, volunteers, and communities working for and with 1000 Friends of Minnesota are passionate about their state and its environment. With growth pressures on the rise, this nonprofit is advocating for exactly what Minnesotas unique culture and landscape need: better growth solutions. 1000 Friends of Minnesota develops and implements creative programs and services to help communities find a balance between development and preservation, while celebrating the states unique sense of place.During my time with 1000 Friends of Minnesota, I worked with Lakes Region Program Director Phil Hunsicker in Brainerd, MN. My time was sponsored by a fellowship from the College of Saint Benedict that required me to serve a nonprofit with civic engagement components. I worked with Phil to jump start a Voices for the Lakes essay contest, develop conservation design scorecard outreach and education materials, and participate in meetings ranging from those of lake associations to community planning events. The summer was filled with learning opportunities, challenges, and successes. Looking back, Phil and his colleagues became my mentors, role models, and friends. I am blown away by all they accomplish on a daily basis, and cannot adequately express my gratitude for the inspiration they have provided me. My experience with 1000 Friends of Minnesota was formative in confirming the belief that you can do what you love and love what you doall while having a positive, substantive impact on the world around you. I wholeheartedly review this nonprofit as one of utmost value to the state of Minnesota.

This charity uses very questionable accounting and funding transactions to appear to be reasonably efficient.  It is part of 'charity network' which pass donations between themselves, thereby double-, or more - counting as program expenses.  Nice racket though reprehensible.   If you want to pay for travel and entertainment for charity employees, this could be the charity for you.

I have volunteered on and off for almost 15 years and it's doors are open to those in most need.  There are few requirements to enter, no drugs, no alcohol and a prayer before eating it's that simple.  Everything that you donate goes to those who need it most.  I have been blessed to work with Mary Jo and her staff and look forward to the day when we won't need to feed the hungry, or clothe the poor or shelter the homeless (the shelter is actually at Mary's Place across the street for families).   Until that day comes, Mary Jo and her team will keep a candle burning.  God BlessJohnny

Sharing and Caring Hands, Inc.	123269	9	/users/profile/167887	Mary101	Client Served	1	09/26/2012	I think Mary Jo Copeland the founder of Caring and Sharing Hands in Minneapolis Minnesota is trying to reach sainthood. Which I pray she will never even be thought of to get after the way she treated my sister and her 21 month old daughter.My sister and her daughter had traveled all the wayto Minnesota from Arizona for a funeral. On the way here they had gotten a flat which they were able to get the tire plugged so they could finish their trip here to Minneapolis. Well needless to say after the funeral and they were getting ready to go home, we checked the tires and seen that they needed to be replaced as the would have blown on her way home, and no one here was with much money to help her, so she used her gas money to get back home to get new tires on the car. With her having no money to get back home to Arizona we were told to go to Caring and Sharing Hands by someone who was recently helped with travel expenses of $150. She said, they would help with travel expenses for her to get back home especially since they were in town for a funeral. We were told to look up the website so we could see first hand that she assists with travel expenses. We looked it up and thought this is wonderful, thank goodness there is someone who can help. I went to caring and Sharing Hands with my sister and when she got up to talk with Mary Jo, Mary Jo was rude... telling her "Tell me what you want? What are you asking for?" When my sister started to reply Mary Jo stopped her and said "We dont do that here."handing her a piece of paper which she tehn ripped out of my sisters hands. My sister tried to explain to her that she had a 21 month old with her and they drove up here and all Mary Jo kept saying to her was "We dont do that here." and told her she could leave. She was willing to leave my sister stranded here in Minnesota when she needed to get back home to get back to her life and take care of things, like finish packing for a move. We had to ask around and try to find people who had some spare money to borrow just so we could make sure that my sister and her daughter got back home. I will never tell someone to go to Caring and Sharing Hands for help, after I seen first hand how my sister was treatedand how rude Mary Jo was to her. From this experience and I have heard it from other people Mary Jo Copeland is a fake and only wants people to see the good thinsg she does, but I know quite a few people who have not so good experiences with her. Its too bad that there are so many people who need help and they are willing to let this person belittle them to get any kind of help. I will tell people of other places to go for assistance as I find them cause after this experience I have made it my goal to find better help for people than someone who acts fake with her help. Mary Jo Copeland is not acting as a woman of god, all she cares about is doing things to make her look good.

Vision Loss Resources	153976	1	/users/profile/204801	lcsdhj	Board Member	5	04/10/2013	I have been associated with VLR and it Predecessor  organization for over 25 years. I have watched the organization grow without losing it's focus on the client. Many of the sight impaired people I have met are graduates of VLR and without exception are self supporting, active members of society. I attribute this in part to the training received at VLR.
Vision Loss Resources	95854	1	/users/profile/111515	mnknitwit	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I volunteer for Vision Loss Resources and find it very rewarding. I have completed the guided sight training and work with clients with low or no vision. I teach knitting and other hand crafts. The clients are able to make beautiful items to give back to the community. They are so thankful for the help that is given. I have been rewarded in ways that are not monetary. I find this an enjoyable place to volunteer and the rewards of helping those that truely want help. This is not busy work. This is enjoyment at it's finest.

I have also completed sighted guide training. The people and clients of this organization are very friendly and helpful. I cannot count the numbers of times I have been thanked for my help. If you have specific areas that you would like to volunteer your expertise, the staff there is very willing to accommodate. There are also many volunteer opportunities and hours (one time to all the time) available with this organization. Volunteering with VLR is a wonderful experience for me and I hope it will be for you!

From presentations on eclectic topics to study groups loosely organized around a topic of interest, MISF will involve you and pique your curiosity.   If  you have a topic you want to pursue in depth, you can get help from MISF to review and critique your work and to assist with obtaining and managing grants.
Minnesota Independent Scholars Forum	151347		/users/profile/202047	EmilyP	Board Member	5	03/20/2013	The Minnesota Independent Scholars Forum offers amazingly diverse programming, there really is something for everyone. I enjoy learning about new subjects and this group does a wonderful job in supporting people pursuing independent investigations. I found the group shortly after moving to the Twin Cities and appreciate the intellectual component it adds to my life. It challenges me to think differently with interesting presentations providing expert views and facts I had never considered before. Sometimes topics of which I previously knew nothing are covered and I leave feeling better informed but concerned with what else I dont know! The Minnesota Independent Scholars Forum is a group I am easily able to justify supporting. 
Minnesota Independent Scholars Forum	131705		/users/profile/177282	mjwool	Board Member	4	10/31/2012	Minnesota Independent Scholars Forum (MISF) exists to promote independent scholarship, specifically in Minnesota and the Twin Cities area.  Scholarship that is "independent" is scholarship that does not owe its existence to any entity other than the scholar himself. As such, MISF is uniquely suited to satisfy an ever-present societal need:  an outlet (forum) for scholarship wherever it may exist, independent of academic credentials and affiliation. The continual realization of this need, and MISF's unique fitness to satisfy it, induces me to both take advantage of its opportunities for my own sake and to enthusiastically recommend them to others.
Giants Of The Earth Heritage Center	195762		/users/profile/256008	Rebecca99	General Member of the Public	5	03/18/2014	As part of renewing my Giants of the Earth membership, I arranged for DNA tests for my husband Leonard Splittstoesser and myself.   I was the first of my family to take the test,  Once Johnathan Storlie explained that I would learn EVEN more about my paternal lineage if one of my six brothers took the test - and that I would learn STILL more if my father, then 99, would take the test,  I proceeded to convince my brother and my father to take the test.  That's how my 65 year old brother and my 100 year old father got involved Throughout this process, I found Johnathan to be a very expert and patient interpreter of the meaning of the complex information, I arranged a special session for my brother and my husband, being that their results had just come back and they were clueless about what it all meant.   They were asking questions that I couldn't answer.  Unfortunately for Johnathan, a weekday was not an option since my brother could only come to Spring Grove on a Saturday.  But Johnathan, fortunately, was willing to meet with us outside his normal hours.   We met one Saturday afternoon.  DNA was never so interesting!  I am thankful to Johnathan that he sacrificed some of his Saturday time to explain the DNA results to my husband Leonard, my brother John, and myself.  My results were newly augmented because we now had my brother and my father's results. Thanks to Giants of the Earth - and Johnathan Storlie - for making interpretation possible.  The experience far exceeds ordering a test online and then being completely on your own to make sense of it.

Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	125702		/users/profile/170934	jfprod	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	The Minnesota Sinfonia is the only professional orchestra in the state to offer all of its performances free of admission charges, welcoming children to all performances, and allocating over 50% of its performances to children and their education. According to independent audits and reviews, the Sinfonia allocates over 80% of expenditures to the artistic product. And the quality is superb! Regularly performing to packed houses, often filled with children, the audience makeup is one of the most diverse of any in the classic music field. Anonymous surveys show that approximately 40% of respondents have household incomes below $35,000, and rarely attend other classical music concerts. The orchestra's Music in the Schools works, which is a curriculum based program that relates music content to required academics (and all based on state academic standards)  is taken to 18-20 inner-city  public schools and over 10,000 children every year - all at no cost to the students or the schools. The Sinfonia raises the money, and then gives this program without charge as part of its commitment to the community and its children. 
Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	112919		/users/profile/153676	jayfishman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/24/2012	Working with the Sinfonia is one of my greatest joys. The players are terrific, and many are amongst my closest friends. What a gift to be able to work with such amazing talents. And, to see and hear the reactions of the children to our Music in the Schools program is phenomenal. It is such a thrill to see them clap and ooh and ah when we play music by Tchaikowsky, Beethoven, Mozart and countless other great composers. It gives me hope for the future! Jay Fishman, conductor
Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	112507		/users/profile/153135	Mira L.	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	The Minnesota Sinfonia is a great Professional Orchestra that plays traditional, challenging, and often unique works of music - free to the public for families and children to enjoy and appreciate.  These free concerts will often have great soloists accompanying the orchestra for an added benefit of sharing a chance for the public to hear these great artists.  There is also fantastic programs for the advancement of music education with 'Music in the Schools' and 'Young Artist Competitions' as well as sponsorships for creating new works of music.  The Sinfonia was able to work through the hard economic times, showing its strength and commitment to the arts, and is now growing and expanding programs and services, continuing the focus of free to the public, and including the children actively in the programs.  The Sinfonia is unique and a wonderful asset to Minnesota.  It has been a pleasure working with them closely the past 7 years.
Border Collie Rescue Of Minnesota	300575	1	/users/profile/391447	Bill119	General Member of the Public	1	08/15/2016	This place is a scam.

They have about 300 dogs listed and at the end of summer half of the photos are of dogs standing in snow. There is no way that a private specialty shelter in Minnesota has 300 Border Collies for adoption and also refuses to place them. This is about extorting cash for the application process.

Food Allergy Support Group of  Minnesota	89077		/users/profile/100958	Elizabeth R.	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	     I became involved with the FASGMN (Food Allergy Support Group of Minnesota) after my daughter was diagnosed with multiple food allergies at 1 year. Her allergist recommended this group and I was so glad he did. Although our allergist attempted to discuss areas to increase our knowledge in for care of a child with food allergies, my husband and I really started to become more comfortable with the care we provided once we became members of FASGMN. FASGMN promotes advocacy, and as parents of a child with a disability, this is the area that we discovered needed constant attention in order to assure our daughter's safety.  I first became involved in the Buddy program at FASGMN, which helped me begin to understand the varying areas that needed attention, including planning for activities that didn't involve just meals.       The FASGMN website provided our family with a wealth of knowlege that promoted advocacy for our child's daycare, our family, and our community. I began to feel more confident in caring for our daughter because of my involvement in FASGMN and then this is when I applied to be a Board member. Since my membership in the board, I have become actively involved in the YES Group, which is a wonderfully supportive group which works to promote relationships amongst children with food allergies. Through this groups activities, the children build bonds over their common personal experiences of dealing with food allergies. For example, the children have had group activities that focused on dealing with food allegies in their school and at their friends' birthday parties. I think this organizations work is invaluable to the food allergy community in Minnesota.

Children long to grow up in healthy, normal ways so they can enjoy life to the fullest.  FASGMN provides the information and strategies to parents, teachers and caregivers so that kids are able to lead happier, healthier and more normal lives while dealing with severe food allergies.  Thank Heavens they do what they do!
Food Allergy Support Group of  Minnesota	88773		/users/profile/100209	cnewell	Board Member	5	05/16/2011	My son has mulitple severe food allergies.  We discovered FASGMN after our son had an anaphylactic reaction at 4 months old.  We finally had a diagnosis as to what was medically wrong with our child, but we were left to figure out the rest ourselves.  That's where FASGMN comes in...they teach you how to live with food allergies.  Along with great services like support group meeting, food-free family events and the annual resource fair, they also connect you to other families with food allergies so you don't feel so alone in your journey.  I have learned a lot from this organization and am very grateful for the support.

Tough audience, but the experienced actors were up to the challenge.  Despite the unusual setting, the audience members reaction were not that different from folks @ the Guthrie.  Some clearly did not want to be there, most were entertained by the wonderful actors, and a few appeared genuinely moved by the story "on stage".  Highest quality theater and about as accessible as you can imagine - that's what TTT is all about.

First and foremost, I believe that everyone could and should give back to the community in which they live. In regards to the reason I volunteer here at BHS, I am not in a position to rescue, adopt, or foster one of these great companions. Since I cannot provide a 'forever-home', I give back by volunteering, doing what I can. If you are like me and can't adopt, foster, rescue, or provide that 'forever-home', please consider donating your time. Or get in touch with the BHS to see what they need to keep going. You might be surprised how far your donation can go.

Ruby is a mix of husky and probably yellow lab - a big girl but a great combination.  The facility was clean and the dogs had large kennels in which to live.  They have great outdoor facilities as well so the dogs could get exercise and fresh air.    Most importantly,  Ruby was well socialized with both humans and other dogs during her time at the shelter, and consequently very easy to bring into our home and neighborhood - this was very important to us.  This is a "no kill" shelter and keeps the animals for life!

Sante Inc	92497		/users/profile/45689	jim12	Volunteer	5	06/28/2011	28 June 2011         St. Paul, MNSince I last posted a year ago, La Clinica de la Mariposa, supported by the non-profit, Sant, Inc., continues to grow.  Student intern teams now include students from the massage therapy program at Northwestern Health Sciences University (NW) (Bloomington, MN).  Since June, 2010, fourteen chiropractic interns, four massage interns, and four professional massage therapists have served.  All teams, October, February and June, have been supervised by eight MN-licensed doctors of chiropractic   I am waiting for the June, 2011, patient-visit data to be delivered by the third-week supervisor, but I will not be surprised if La Clinica (and its team of eight chiropractic-interns and four massage therapists) breaks a patient-visit record.  Support continues from MN United Way and from NW, but other donors would, of course be most welcome.  We are currently gathering funding for two new portable chiropractic tables with pelvic-drops and a carrying bag ($1000 each table).  We also would welcome support sent directly to the Al Traina La Clinica Fund at NW (2501 West 84th St, Bloomington, MN  55431) to support student intern travel, room, and board.  Students often have to borrow money to fund their participation.Jim Hulbert, PhDBioethics faculty, NW
Sante Inc	44767	10	/users/profile/45689	jim12	Board Member	5	06/21/2010	21 June 2010    NW Basic Sciences DeptFor ten years, this project has been an ethical, courageous, and successful venture into providing primary health screening and care to people in several underserved communities in Costa Rica.  In contrast to single-treatment "mission trips," La Clinica takes detailed health histories and maintains Minnesota-quality health records on each of its now-5000 (and growing) patient population.   Leaders of La Clinica de la Marisposa have been succesul in involving US and Costa Rican health care training institutions in collaborative and "integrative" (chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, and medical) care before the buzz word began to buzz.   Currently, upper-level chiropractic students from Northwestern Health Sciences University in Bloomington, MN, work with patients side-by-side with physical therapy and medical students from professional training programs in Costa Rica.   There are three structured visits planned per year of three weeks' duration, each involving from 200 to 400 patient-visits total across three communities.  Students and patients benefit; students have said, "I traveled to Costa Rica a student intern, and I came back a doctor."   Virtually all donations are spent on durables: treatment tables, lasers and other treatment equipment; and non-durables: clinic supplies, childrens' toys, and transportation to clinic communities.  Some donations, such as dental supplies, are directly donated by MN dentists.  Selected US volunteer students have been paying $1200 to $1500 to participate, some borrowing the money to make the experience a reality. Scholarship funding would allow more studednts to consider participation.         La Clinica de la Mariposa (Sant, Inc.), is a small, focused, well-managed, and ethical project that continues to make a difference in the lives of all who associate with it.

We were invited to assist  while the doctors and chiropractic students from the United States came to Costa Rica, on their own time and expense to treat patients in the poorest of poor barrios.  Many of these patients have had unattended chiropractic problems for decades and looking at the faces of these people before and then after treatment was like night and day.

Every minute they are in the sanctuary (and many hours they aren't) is dedicated to improving the lives of some very interesting parrots. The volunteers care about each other as well. The level of knowledge among this group of people is vast, because they have dealt with so many parrots, not only different species, but also difficult behavior and medical cases. The birds at MAARS are obviously loved. Their welfare and quality of life are the top concerns of the organization, and it shows. They also advocate adoption over breeding, educate the public and veterinary students about avian care through classes and outreach, and are becoming known for their "Painting Parrots."

They get fresh food, plentiful toys and a variety of stimulating interactions and activities (Yes, our parrots can and do paint!) so they can thrive.

Bisexual Organizing Project	198357	1	/users/profile/259068	Mary252	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/19/2014	The Bisexual Organizing Project is where I really learned the basics about operating a nonprofit organization. Through my involvement planning and organizing their events, working with BOP's board, and working with the community it serves, I learned enough about fiduciary responsibility to serve on a Public School Board. I am presently the lead of one of a handful of programs within public schools that explicitly ensure that the needs of LGBTQ students, staff, and families are met within the school district. The Bisexual Organizing Project helped me get where I am today and I'm confident in my giving back to BOP.
Bisexual Organizing Project	148388	3	/users/profile/196570	Lauren Beach	Board Member	5	01/22/2013	My involvement with Bisexual Organizing Project changed my life. In 2008, I went to BOP's annual conference, the Bisexual Empowerment Conference: A Uniting Supportive Experience (BECAUSE). BECAUSE for me truly lived up to its name -- it was the very first place I ever felt empowered in my bisexual identity. This was life-changing for me, because I realized that in over 5 years of being a GLBTQA activist before attending BECAUSE 2008, I had never before had the lived experience of being empowered in my sexual identity. I was so inspired by this experience, I immediately joined the BOP board and the BECAUSE 2009 organizing committee. Rather than being a bi-identified queer activist, I became a bi-identified bi activist, who strives to work in collaboration with queer communities.  From 2010-2013, I served as Board Chair/Chairperson of BOP. While serving as Chairperson, I was working on completing a dual J.D./Genetics Ph.D. program. I found myself taking transactional law classes, so that I could build the knowledge necessary to make a non-profit thrive on a governance and fundraising level. I was very fortunate that an accountant, Jim Larsen, also developed an interest in the BOP board while I was in my leadership role. Jim's expertise and knowledge of financial practices and strategic planning led the BOP board to create a five year strategic plan, helping the entire organization make a major leap forward.  I am confident now that we have created an accountable, sustainable, goal-oriented non-profit dedicated to serving, organizing, and building the bi/pan/fluid/queer/unlabeled and allied communities, that will only continue to grow in the future. I am very proud of the work we have all done together building BOP and BECAUSE, and I look forward to collaborating with organizational partners to help us collectively grow inclusive, diverse GLBTQQIIAA movements.

I know of no other US based bi group currently, which is being so active in it's support of new and existing members of the community, interaction and cross-strand working with allies and continuing to grow and evolve in terms of what a bisexual organization can truly be.  The rest of the global bisexual community should take note as their are some extremely good lessons to be learned from how BOP operates and conducts itself, and I look forward to seeing how the continue to grow and develop in the future.
North Country R I D E	149083	1	/users/profile/198629	Achill	Client Served	5	02/07/2013	My sister has been riding at North Country RIDE for the past 6 years. She has growen in her confidence and communication skills greatly over this time period and I must contribute this change to the experiences she has had at NCR. The program encourages ability not disability and the instructors and volunteers have a true passion for what they do, always showing respect and sincerity to the clients.
North Country R I D E	148663	2	/users/profile/198011	cmonson	Volunteer	5	01/29/2013	I have been involved with North Country RIDE since 2009.  I have volunteered as a teachers assistance, bookkeeping, and serve on the board of directors.  I had started volunteering here to gain confidence around horses, with the hopes in owning one again.  I was able to achieve this goal in 2011.  I am also a special olypmics coach. I would recommend that others volunteer for enrichment opportunities.
North Country R I D E	127478	2	/users/profile/172534	Ranchosia	Volunteer	4	10/20/2012	I have been involved with NCR for the past 4 years. Helping people with Special Needs learn to ride and enjoy equine facilitated activities has become my passion. Over the past several years NCR has gone through a revitalation period. The Board of Directors created a strategic plan and evaluates, updates and revises the plan on a frequent basis. The instructors are all top notch and know their jobs well.i believe NCR has a very important place in our community and with their expanding services to at risk youth, people with mental health issues, veterans and school field trips along with all the other people they serve with special needs, they have a very bright future.
Rebuilding Together - Twin Cities	57544		/users/profile/60854	Jenn M.	Volunteer	5	11/22/2010	I tend to volunteer for environmental organizations because that is my professional field.  I was recruited to work on a planting project a few years ago that was a RTTC project and they passed out a questionniare about volunteering in a home repair capacity.  I am also very handy around the house and I had been looking for an organization that had a more immediate impact on people in my community. Environmetal work, especially planting, has a long return. RTTC seemed like a perfect fit so I filled out the  questionniare and later was recruited for the Safe At Home program. 
Rebuilding Together - Twin Cities	57243		/users/profile/60180	bforeman	Board Member	5	11/17/2010	One of the easiest decisions I ever made was getting involved with Rebuilding Together-Twin Cities.  The mission is very appealing and rewarding; providing direct help and assistance to people in need so they may stay in their homes and lead productive lives.  Our work covers a variety of demographics and communities but all have a common need - to be warm and safe.  As our populations are aging so is the housing and even in good economic times this is a challenge for many people.Rebuilding Together brings all the pieces together.  Donors, sponsors, volunteers and people in need.
Rebuilding Together - Twin Cities	57235		/users/profile/60169	Mariette	Volunteer	5	11/17/2010	I have volunteered for Rebuilding Together Twin Cities since April of 2008.  It has become a very important part of my life because I can help people directly in their homes, and I know that I am helping them live with more safety and security.  I do several things with RTTC, depending on their needs.  Everything I do has both helped the organization and helped me gain new skills and confidence after my recent job loss.  Specifically, I work with Safe at Home, where we install grab bars, railings, smoke and CO alarms, window and door locks, etc- anything that will help older adults or those living with a disability be safer in their home.  I went from just watching others do the instalation to being able to do it myself.  I also work with the home repair program, where we do extensive repairs on homes.  It really helps the families because due to circumstances beyond their control, they cant afford or do the repairs themselves.  I have gained a lot of skills (I installed a faucet!), and have also been given some leadership roles with the program.  I also help out in other ways, such as data entry, preparation and cleanup after projects (I specialize in cleaning paint brushes).   I love working with RTTC and will continue to do so for many years to come.   They are particularly good at making sure that I feel appreciated, which is excellent because thats the paymenta volunteer receives.  
Mano A Mano International Partners	138230	1	/users/profile/184280	lldallavalle	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Mano a Mano has a management structure uses volunteer time in a manner that is productive and fun.  The founders, staff and volunteers have an infectious attitude towards their mission and rightly so.  It's an honor to be part of an organization that works with the Bolivian government to build 130-plus medical clinics, build miles of roads to help farmers bring crops to market, and other projects which go directly to making the lives of those living in rural Bolivia better.
Mano A Mano International Partners	137591	2	/users/profile/183581	Raymond J	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I first came in contact with Mano a Mano while I was studying Spanish in Cochabamba, Bolivia.  Because of what I saw and heard at the Mano a Mano headquarters in Bolivia, I volunteered every Saturday for the 6 months I was in Bolivia, unpacking medical equipment and medicines.  I was incredibly touched by the dedication, compassion, and commitment of the Bolivians who worked with or volunteered for Mano a Mano.  I was equally impressed by what they were doing to lower infant mortality as well as bring health care to people who had little to no access to  medical help.  When I returned to Minnesota I discovered a similar spirit among the staff and volunteers affiliated with Mano a Mano there.  The spirit of the founders, Segundo and Joan Velasquez, is reflected and magnified by the staff and volunteers in St. Paul.  Mano a Mano not only touches the lives of the poor of Bolivia, it energizes and elevates those who are fortunate enough to be affiliated with this incredible organization.
Mano A Mano International Partners	134764	1	/users/profile/180638	Patricia O.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	As a public health professional with experience in international health and development  I can say firmly that Mano A Mano International Partners is extraordinary, perhaps even unique. The organization's strength comes from its truly bilateral collaborative framework. Funds are raised both inside and outside Bolivia, but virtually all of the organization's staff are themselves Bolivians. I believe this accounts for Mano a Mano's record of fierce dedication and staggering accomplishment over the past decade and a half. The organization's co-founder, Segundo Velasquez, has been nominated this year for a prestigious Opus Foundation prize and is one of three candidates for the grand prize of $1 million. While it would be well-deserved if Segundo won, he is one among the organization's many "unsung heroes" who have transformed rural health care, education and transportation in Bolivia. 
Langenfeld Foundation	196175	3	/users/profile/256472	MaverickMiller	General Member of the Public	5	03/22/2014	I have followed The Langenfeld Foundation since their beginning in 2006.  They have impressed me like no other charity group.  They have grown steadily and significantly. They expanded in 2009 to create the Wounded Warriors Outreach, and then again in 2013  with Schools For Africa to help children. They are an inspiring non-profit organization that deserves all the support they can get.  I fully expect them to continue growing to greater help the less fortunate, and am excited to see what new program they do next.
Langenfeld Foundation	57095	1	/users/profile/59966	a donor	Donor	5	11/16/2010	I think this organization is GREAT.  They are doing things that no one else is providing.  They help people with disabilities, including our wounded warriors returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are a very worthy charity.
Langenfeld Foundation	22783	1	/users/profile/23778	TheRedHulk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/17/2009	This is an outstanding charity organization that is doing things for people with disabilities that have only been dreamed of before.  They are a very worthwhile cause.
Laboure Society	323149		/users/profile/417372	walemire	Advisor	5	02/14/2017	This review responds to the September review set forth above from a past Labour donor.  First, we at Labour are deeply grateful for the donor's investment in vocations. Our mission would not be possible without support like his/hers. Second, a very important clarification is necessary.  A donor's gift to a Laboure "aspirant class" ( a class of 15-20 men and women raising funds as a collective class for vocations) is never "wasted".  The aspirants working through the Labour program do not raise money for themselves, they raise money as a class with all donations being designated for the class in honor of an aspirant. For instance, a check would be made out to The Laboure Society in honor of a particular aspirant. This model preserves the charitable deduction for the donor (Labour is a 501c3 non profit organization) and avoids income tax implications for the aspirant. At the end of the 6 month class, the total amount raised by the class is divided into awards for each aspirant. That money is held in reserve for the aspirant by Labour, the aspirant never "receives" any funds.  At that point, Laboure pays the aspirants' lenders directly with a minimum monthly payment over the course of 36 months. In the 37th month the loan is paid off in full. So, if the aspirant discerns out of a community within those 36 months the money that was awarded is held in reserve for other aspirant needs to remove their student loan impediment. It is extremely important for donors to understand that any donation to the Labour General Fund or to an aspirant class will always be applied to the mission of delivering future priests and religious to the Catholic Church. Donations to the Labour aspirants are NEVER wasted. The whole program is specifically designed to avoid that outcome. Any questions about this review can be directed to Bill LeMire at the Labour Society at 651-295-2548. Please pray for our aspirants who seek nothing other than to devote their lives to Christ.  May it please God! 
Laboure Society	302735		/users/profile/393897		Donor	1	09/07/2016	Pros - You will be helping Aspirants to enter the priesthood and the religious life.Cons  Laboure Society only helps individuals with their student loans excluding their other debts which will delay their entering. There is no assurance from those Aspirants that they will finish their respective formations. There is no binding contract between the said organization and the Aspirants. In other words, if an individual decided to leave, they are not required to pay back. In the process, the money that we the benefactors donated are gone to waste.
Laboure Society	277087		/users/profile/227410	ssierra	Volunteer	5	01/18/2016	The Labour Society exists to provide financial assistance and spiritual support to individuals who must resolve student loans in order to pursue a vocation to the priesthood and/or religious life in the Catholic Church.They have assisted hundreds in pursuing their vocation, a vocation that without the help of Labour they would never have been able to live out. I have volunteered for Labour for nearly 6 years, and I am so humbled and proud to be a part of their beautiful work. 
National Foster Parent Association, Inc.	114301		/users/profile/155535	T. LaShaun W.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2012	The National Foster Parent Association (NFPA) is near and dear to me. I love interacting with the wonderful members, foster parents who are dedicated to the children in their care and even former foster parents who are still interested in making a difference in children's lives in other ways. And let's not forget the association's individual and agency supporters who are impacting our children's lives through grassroots efforts to improve child welfare policies or legislation on a continuous basis.  
National Foster Parent Association, Inc.	114200		/users/profile/155407	Irene Clements	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	The National Foster Parent Association (NFPA) is the link between foster parents and national advocacy efforts, their source of information from both the state and national levels, their source for interesting and helpful resources and services available across the country, their "voice" in the federal arena, their a education and training resource through an annual conference as well as partnerships with training companies and individuals from across the country, their source for getting information related to specific needs or concerns, and so much more and all accomplished by a Board of Directors that are all volunteers.  NFPA contracts for part-time office assistance and bookkeeping, but all other work is accomplished by the dedicated volunteers who are committed to helping foster parents be the best they can be for the children who must enter the foster care system.  NFPA's Mission is "To support foster parents in achieving safety, permanence and well-being for children and youth in care."
National Foster Parent Association, Inc.	111478	1	/users/profile/151784	dseger	Advisor	4	05/06/2012	The National Foster Parent Association (NFPA) really is the "national voice of foster parents".  This is the most efficient non-profit organization that I have been involved with.  The entire Board of Directors are volunteers and work hard to move the organization forward.  With a minimal paid staff, you can be assured that membership dues and donations are used for implementing the mission of NFPA.  As a former foster/adoptive parent and former NFPA board member, I'm very happy that I can continue to do my part to support foster families.
The Sanctuary Animal Refuge and Hospice	8929	9	/users/profile/10708	dreambody	Board Member	5	08/10/2009	This Organization is driven by the passion of the founder to compassionately help the animals that are unable to help themselves.  I have not ever seen a passionate, giving founder.
The Sanctuary Animal Refuge and Hospice	8928	9	/users/profile/10707	Jerry Bell	Donor	5	08/10/2009	I completely support the ideals of the founder of The Sanctuary.  As a volunteer at a local animal shelter and with a breed specific rescue in Mpls., as well as the owner of multiple rescue dogs, I can see the value of and need for a sanctuary.  When you work in the field, even as a volunteer, you are constantly bombarded by the neglect, and cruelty that the human race inflicts upon animals.  This sanctuary and it's founder takes a small step toward correction of this human failing.  Please support The Santuary Animal Refuge and Hospice so that we can take another step toward recovering our humanity, and give the animals the respect and care that they deserve.
The Sanctuary Animal Refuge and Hospice	2603	14	/users/profile/4155	redsmama2001	Volunteer	5	01/27/2009	I have had the pleasure of working with the Sanctuary in helping to raise funds for their cause.  I cannot recommend another rescue more highly than The Sanctuary Animal Refuge and Hospice.  They have 2 fund raisers annually and with a very limited group to pull from they continue to do everything possible so that the animals they assist will receive the medical care that is needed.  They are always looking for more volunteers and DJ (founder) is amazing.
Befriender Ministry - A Listeningpresence	188216		/users/profile/245526	Today	Board Member	5	11/09/2013	Everyone desires to be heard!   Ive been associated with BeFriender Ministry for 20 years, as a BeFriender, a Leader and presently as a Board Member.  The National Office educates people in the art of Listening.  BeFrienders hear peoples stories, acknowledge their words, they do not judge, fix or do for others.  They are a listening presence to  others on their journey, not only hearing their stories, but allowing them to hear their words.   The skills BeFrienders learn, are practiced throughout our lives, we receive much more than we give!
Befriender Ministry - A Listeningpresence	188207		/users/profile/245510	Jandersen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2013	The experience of participating in BeFriender Ministry has changed my life. The skills I learned through their training and continued education, and the structured opportunities to reflect on my work, has been transformational. The listening skills are relevant in my daily life--with family, friends, & co-workers, as well as with  the people I have ministered to In BeFriender Ministry. I have grown so much through years of involvement with BeFriender Minisrty. 
Befriender Ministry - A Listeningpresence	187869		/users/profile/244986	Nordic One	Board Member	5	11/05/2013	For more than 8 years I have been involved with the BeFrienders program, first as a trained leader in a large parish, and currently as a board member of the BeFriender National Office.   In my role as a program leader,  I have gained new insights and understandings when presenting training sessions for new volunteers.  Making Meaning times with commissioned BeFrienders had a profound effect on me.  The wisdom shared has broadened my perspective and deepened my spirituality.   Over time I have watched as people have been changed by their involvement with BeFrienders.  The invisible bond that connects each person grows stronger as prayers are offered for each other and confidential stories are shared.   It is a gift to be able to participate in the BeFriender Ministry.  The strength and longevity of this program are a testament to the way lives can be changed by listening.  I am deeply grateful for the BeFriender Ministry, because I have experienced the nonjudgmental care that it gives.

We have participated in several of their volunteer opportunities as well and highly enjoyed it.  This is a great team doing great work!

Great River School Inc	73252		/users/profile/80062	Robyn Aiken	Volunteer	4	02/22/2011	A highlight of Great River School is their Key Experiences for all the kids. Every year each grade group A1, A2 & A3, gets out of the classroom learning environment and into a "worldly" experience learning key points along the way. Whether it is a wilderness trek, working on a farm, climbing the Grand Tetons, rebuilding LA from the aftermath of Katrina or biking 100 miles in a week (my kids participated on all of these), lodging is mostly in a camp ground in tents. As a parent, I saw a need to help the school with managing their camping equipment because these key experiences have been huge in expanding my kids view in the world. Tents needed to be washed & repaired, and the staff needed assistance in getting the packing list developed and equipment ready to go.  So, I put a call for help out to the other parents and was pleasantly surprised to see how many others cared so much about these trips. Many parents came together to help clean, organize and repack all of the gear. I love knowing that this is such an involved community and a true sense of willingness to ensure the school is supported to continue these experiences for our kids. 
Great River School Inc	69771		/users/profile/76256	cschanilec	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	I know Great River School as a substitute teacher, lego coach for 7th and 8th graders, and because my daughter attends.  I am completely sold on the management, staff and structure. I say this as a high school teacher, being able to compare this school to numerous others. This is a great school that engages and pushes students to reach their full potential. My daughter is at times overwhelmed by homework but still says on a daily basis that she had a wonderful time at school. With the fall trip, the students connect in a way that makes them feel safe and free to be themselves--no small accomplishment in 7th graders! I would highly recommend this school to anyone else.
Great River School Inc	69673		/users/profile/76141	abel0030	Volunteer	4	02/16/2011	Great River School has been a great place for our daughter to attend her junior high years.  She shares her sense of community and citizenship with us daily.  The school definitely encourages her to think about how she relates to the world and all the potential roles that she might fill if she so chooses to make a difference.  She struggles to stay organized, but cares deeply about what she is learning and always strives to learn more.  I cannot ask for a more engaging environment for our youth.

Alot of the clients are single women with children trying to make a better life for themselves and the lives of their children.

Food Allergy Support Group of  Minnesota	89077		/users/profile/100958	Elizabeth R.	Board Member	5	05/24/2011	     I became involved with the FASGMN (Food Allergy Support Group of Minnesota) after my daughter was diagnosed with multiple food allergies at 1 year. Her allergist recommended this group and I was so glad he did. Although our allergist attempted to discuss areas to increase our knowledge in for care of a child with food allergies, my husband and I really started to become more comfortable with the care we provided once we became members of FASGMN. FASGMN promotes advocacy, and as parents of a child with a disability, this is the area that we discovered needed constant attention in order to assure our daughter's safety.  I first became involved in the Buddy program at FASGMN, which helped me begin to understand the varying areas that needed attention, including planning for activities that didn't involve just meals.       The FASGMN website provided our family with a wealth of knowlege that promoted advocacy for our child's daycare, our family, and our community. I began to feel more confident in caring for our daughter because of my involvement in FASGMN and then this is when I applied to be a Board member. Since my membership in the board, I have become actively involved in the YES Group, which is a wonderfully supportive group which works to promote relationships amongst children with food allergies. Through this groups activities, the children build bonds over their common personal experiences of dealing with food allergies. For example, the children have had group activities that focused on dealing with food allegies in their school and at their friends' birthday parties. I think this organizations work is invaluable to the food allergy community in Minnesota. 
Food Allergy Support Group of  Minnesota	88945		/users/profile/100654	Nancy Sabin	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/19/2011	With the increase in severe food allergies in recent years, the educational information and services provided by The Food Allergy Support Group of Minnesota (FASGMN) are life-saving.  Children long to grow up in healthy, normal ways so they can enjoy life to the fullest.  FASGMN provides the information and strategies to parents, teachers and caregivers so that kids are able to lead happier, healthier and more normal lives while dealing with severe food allergies.  Thank Heavens they do what they do!
Food Allergy Support Group of  Minnesota	88773		/users/profile/100209	cnewell	Board Member	5	05/16/2011	My son has mulitple severe food allergies.  We discovered FASGMN after our son had an anaphylactic reaction at 4 months old.  We finally had a diagnosis as to what was medically wrong with our child, but we were left to figure out the rest ourselves.  That's where FASGMN comes in...they teach you how to live with food allergies.  Along with great services like support group meeting, food-free family events and the annual resource fair, they also connect you to other families with food allergies so you don't feel so alone in your journey.  I have learned a lot from this organization and am very grateful for the support.
St Catherine University	42351	6	/users/profile/43070	nancy22	Client Served	5	05/31/2010	My mother graduated in 1950, and I graduated in 1978, and my daughter will graduate in 2013 - a "TripliKate".  In each instance, we made an independent decision to go to St. Kate's, not just because a parent or grandparent had gone.  All three generations are made up of independent, intelligent women, and all have thrived in the encouraging, supportive atmosphere.  My mom was a chemistry major, when women didn't go into sciences, and did research at a major university.  I was an elementary education major, and because of St. Kate's reputation, was able to get a job when there were 100s of applicants and very few openings.  And now my daughter is going because it increases her chances to get into veterinary school.  The reputation of St. Kate's is impeccable, but the atmosphere makes you feel like you have come home.  Attending St. Kate's was the best decision all three of us made.  Nancy McIntire
St Catherine University	40426	8	/users/profile/41341	ginacarlson	Client Served	4	05/25/2010	I first stepped onto the campus of St. Kate's in 2001 as a senior in high school. Coming from a small town in Minnesota, I was apprehensive of the city - but found St. Kate's to be the perfect place for me.During all of my time as a student, I found professors to be passionate and helpful. I worked on campus in the Development Office, and the guidance I received from the other employees led me into my current career; I still keep in touch with many of those employees to this day.The mission at St. Kate's talks about educating women to lead and influence. During all of my experiences there, I felt that we were learning to live out that mission - encouraged to speak up, pursue our dreams and passions, and I know that they strive to continue this into the future. The mentoring I received and the amazing education is something I will cherish my entire lifetime.

Over the fifty years I have had several other homes.  But no matter where I was, in my head and in my heart St. Catherine's was always a firm point of reference.  The lessons I learned on Campus and in the Chapel -- especially the words in the Chapel, "Behold, I Make All Things New" -- have served my life well through all the years.Eileen Raidl Gordon  1960
Randy Shaver Cancer Research And Community Fund	318481		/users/profile/409660	givealittle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/07/2016	My experience with this non-profit has only been beyond exceptional.  First and foremost, $.90+  for every $1 I donate is given to cancer research or to organizations in the Minnesota community to help patients with cancer and their families.  How GREAT is that?  I don't know ANY organization that gives away 90%+ of the money they receive.  How do I know this?  Well, I'm the CPA and the one who gets a first hand look at the money received and the money donated.   Beyond just the money, Roseann Shaver is certainly more than qualified to run this Organization, and has done a darn good job at it I may add.  If anyone has a need regarding cancer (i.e. an individual, family member, friend, etc.) she will go to great lengths to help you out (whether it's contacting doctors, making connections to others that can help, etc.).  She is very passionate about the mission of the Organization.  Isn't that what anyone would want from the executive director?  Her passion is behind what she believes in.  I know when I give them my money and time, I know it's being put to a good use.   It's not just Roseann who is passionate, her husband or her sons.  It's the volunteers who are also passionately involved.  They are simply amazing and caring.  They make these great fundraisers happen.  It's also the community members and their own fundraisers they put on to benefit this non profit - (from a bridge tournament that assisted living residents put on to youths involved in activities or sports)   Individuals outside this organization raise money to donate to them because they believe in the foundation and know the good it does for the cancer community. Donors have generous hearts.  We all want to know our hard earned money is going for a good cause.  With this non profit, it is.  Just ask the researchers who have received the grant money to further their research in the cancer field, or the community programs that have received funds to send youths with cancer to camp, prepare and deliver meals for cancer patients or the grief support groups, to name a few.   To quickly address the person not very happy with the organization, if you want to know where the money goes, go look at the 990.  It's open to the public.  It's a hard form to understand, it was designed by attorneys and extremely complex, but in the return there is an area regarding donations.  HIINT, start in the back of the return where all the forms with information are.  The first few pages is merely a summary of the detail behind them. There is nothing this Organization is hiding or not sharing with the donors.  They do provide receipts for donations over $250.  A quick word about cash under $250.  I'll give an example - If you give cash at church as they pass the basket around, they don't provide receipts either.  It's too difficult and there is no proof as to how much you gave since there is no person with receipts handing them out at the time of giving.  Now, if you want a receipt, my suggestion is to write a check.  I know, how old school, but there you have proof for IRS and now you can take it on your personal return.  Problem solved. Get to know this organization.  You won't be disappointed in the heart behind the mission.   
Randy Shaver Cancer Research And Community Fund	318280	1	/users/profile/409429	CancerStinks	Donor	5	11/04/2016	The Randy Shaver Cancer Research and Community Fund gives more than 90% of the money donated to cancer research and the community. With that low of an overhead it is the best use of my donation! The team that volunteers and works for the foundation truly care and our passionate about what they do. If you are looking to donate and actually make a difference with your money this is the charity to pick.
Randy Shaver Cancer Research And Community Fund	188374	1	/users/profile/245785	PhilanthSarah	Donor	1	11/12/2013	If you are looking for a non profit to donate to, steer clear of the Randy Shaver Cancer Research Fund and celebrity golf tournament! This shoddy organization is run by Roseann Shaver who's only qualification is that she married a local news personality. The organization is terribly disorganized. The fundraising events are a total debacle and chaotic. More concerning than the poorly organized events is the concern over organizational integrity. No receipts given for cash donations (or otherwise), on going criticism over questionable ethics, and lack of transparency. If you're looking to make a difference with a solid organization, keep looking.
Circle of Hope, Duluth	319584		/users/profile/411252	cluoma,	Volunteer	5	11/29/2016	I have been volunteering and donating to Circle of hope for a few years now, this organization has been life changing for me!

To date over $127,000.00 has been paid out for patients breast cancer medical bills and daily living expenses. This as they go through treatment. The organization help patients through their journey with educational and feel good materials. They have many sport teams, private pink parties, and special programs. Circle of Hope give out chemo caps to cancer centers and so much more. They are an engaging and energizing organization to supporters, survivors and patients.
Circle of Hope, Duluth	123843		/users/profile/168582	Colleen14	Volunteer	5	09/29/2012	When I first heard about Circle of Hope, I was 5 years cancer free and I wanted to help other cancer patients cope with their cancer.  Circle of Hope came into my life as a way to give back.   Circle of Hope has been a organization who treat its clients with complete confidentiality, even the Board Members do not know the name of the recipient, only the secretary has that  information. I know we have made a difference in the lives of who we have helped, by the letters of expressed gratitude.  Circle of Hope is an organization that a makes a difference in the live of others.  
Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	125702		/users/profile/170934	jfprod	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	The Minnesota Sinfonia is the only professional orchestra in the state to offer all of its performances free of admission charges, welcoming children to all performances, and allocating over 50% of its performances to children and their education. According to independent audits and reviews, the Sinfonia allocates over 80% of expenditures to the artistic product. And the quality is superb! Regularly performing to packed houses, often filled with children, the audience makeup is one of the most diverse of any in the classic music field. Anonymous surveys show that approximately 40% of respondents have household incomes below $35,000, and rarely attend other classical music concerts. The orchestra's Music in the Schools works, which is a curriculum based program that relates music content to required academics (and all based on state academic standards)  is taken to 18-20 inner-city  public schools and over 10,000 children every year - all at no cost to the students or the schools. The Sinfonia raises the money, and then gives this program without charge as part of its commitment to the community and its children. 
Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	112919		/users/profile/153676	jayfishman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/24/2012	Working with the Sinfonia is one of my greatest joys. The players are terrific, and many are amongst my closest friends. What a gift to be able to work with such amazing talents. And, to see and hear the reactions of the children to our Music in the Schools program is phenomenal. It is such a thrill to see them clap and ooh and ah when we play music by Tchaikowsky, Beethoven, Mozart and countless other great composers. It gives me hope for the future! Jay Fishman, conductor
Friends of the Minnesota Sinfonia	112507		/users/profile/153135	Mira L.	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	The Minnesota Sinfonia is a great Professional Orchestra that plays traditional, challenging, and often unique works of music - free to the public for families and children to enjoy and appreciate.  These free concerts will often have great soloists accompanying the orchestra for an added benefit of sharing a chance for the public to hear these great artists.  There is also fantastic programs for the advancement of music education with 'Music in the Schools' and 'Young Artist Competitions' as well as sponsorships for creating new works of music.  The Sinfonia was able to work through the hard economic times, showing its strength and commitment to the arts, and is now growing and expanding programs and services, continuing the focus of free to the public, and including the children actively in the programs.  The Sinfonia is unique and a wonderful asset to Minnesota.  It has been a pleasure working with them closely the past 7 years.
Animal Folks Mn	233481	1	/users/profile/297305	Connor J.	Volunteer	5	11/12/2014	I believe Animal Folks/Animal Folks Minnesota was formed in late 2007.  It's amazing what this organization has accomplished since then.  AF/AFMN was instrumental in getting Minnesota legislation passed regulating large dog and cat breeding facilities.  I admire this organization's vision for the future...to 'prevent' animal cruelty.  AF/AFMN is committed to improving animal welfare through educational and legal approaches.  The present cultural attitude toward animal neglect and cruelty is entrenched and I'm impressed with this group's perseverance in fighting this problem through many avenues...legislative, educational, public awareness and enforcement of current laws. I'm a donor and volunteer for AF/AFMN and will continue to be both because this is a dedicated group with a vision I believe in.  This is an organization which produces results with limited funds.  Please donate to AF/AFMN.
Animal Folks Mn	218895	4	/users/profile/282496	cece.erickson	Donor	5	10/01/2014	Animal Folks is a welcome addition to the Animal Welfare Community as an umbrella organization that benefits the entire animal welfare community.  Their success additionally brings a host of benefits to other advocacy groups and the community at large.  In concert and working with various individuals, public and private institutions they succeed in their mission because they are persistent in an analytical, intelligent, business like manner.  Their research and investigative work is professional, thorough and presented well.  Ann Olson, Founder and Director is a skilled communicator and negotiator and a small hardworking Board brings a wealth of talent, expertise and experience to the table.  Challenges are viewed as opportunities to learn and educate in a respectful way to create the systemic change they seek.  As donors we find them effective and accountable in their work; and focused and devoted to their mission.  Additionally, there is a positive spirit and synergy that attracts volunteers and key individuals to their cause.    Having been involved in humane and rescue work for years on many levels it is refreshing to see real progress on the horizon and rewarding to experience Prevention rather than Reaction.  Giving should be entered into in just the same way as investing.  Giving is investing. Rockefeller Certainly we all want to maximize our gifts and make sure they find their way to where they are needed, designated, and well spent; and we feel gifting Animal Folks is a wise investment and business decision, as well as one from the heart.   Giving is also receiving and we have greatly appreciated the opportunity to support Animal Folks. Cynthia and Steven Erickson
Animal Folks Mn	213170	2	/users/profile/276323	pormston	Volunteer	5	09/03/2014	I first heard of Animal Folks 5 years ago when it was a relatively new nonprofit with a mission for stopping the abuse of animals in Minnesota.  Their range included responding to complaints against puppy mill breeders as well as private party abusers and assisting with law enforcement and prosecutors for a successful conviction. Animal Folks also worked with others in getting a Puppy Mill Breeder Law approved in 2014, and now the work continues in making sure the law is enforced. I found someone who is as passionate as I am in punishing those who harm animals and getting those animals into a safe environment and this is Ann Olson and Animal Folks!  But they need money to fight the fight! Animal cruelty is an ugly reality of life, and I hope my testimonial encourages others to support this noble and unique cause! Patricia Ormston

Animal Folks	215061		/users/profile/278391	Cheryl106	Donor	5	09/14/2014	I am familiar with Animal Folks on many levels: as a donor, a volunteer, and a past Board Member. This organization is highly effective despite being woefully underfunded. Animal Folks actions and influence are felt on both the local and state levels - having worked with local law enforcement agencies to create training manuals to recognize and rectify animal abuse situations; working in tandem with the Governor's office to pass legislation to promote more humane breeding practices for companion animals; monitoring the trafficking in and out of the state by commercial breeding facilities to ensure healthy animals raised humanely are being sold to consumers. It is a small organization with big results! Please consider making a donation.
Animal Folks	211102		/users/profile/64082	Troon62	Donor	5	08/18/2014	I had the good fortune of meeting Ann Olson, founder of Animal Folks, shortly after the organization's inception. A native Minnesotan, aware of the fact that our state's animal protection laws are among the weakest in the nation, I recognized that Ann, her passion for the cause, her organizational ability, and her willingness to change hearts and minds at our state legislature, could play an important role in giving our state's domesticated animals a far better future. In the intervening years, Ann has proven to be a "bulldog" at finally seeing laws passed that provide far greater protections for the poor dogs trapped in the nightmarish world of the numerous puppy mills that exist here. She and her team, while limited in terms of financial resources, are accomplishing so much. They do so because they are professionals imbued with an ethic of integrity and very careful stewardship of the funding they receive. I cannot endorse the organization more fully.
Metropolitan Symphony Orchestral Association	205311		/users/profile/267454	jonclewis83	Board Member	5	07/07/2014	The Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra plays free concerts throughout the Twin Cities area.  I started as a board member with the MSO in 1996.  I began playing in the MSO's percussion section a year later, and now serve as its Principal Percussionist and its Executive Director.  We play challenging music at a professional level, even though our musicians are not paid to play.  In fact, our musicians donate money  to the MSO, as well as their time and talent.  Our last season started with Rite of Spring and ended with Beethoven's Eroica, with Shostakovich 5 and Mahler's Resurrection Symphony in between.   Minnesota Public Radio broadcast our Mahler concert, which was heard live by 1600 people, and on the radio and through the internet by many thousands more.  In our upcoming season, every one of our concerts will feature a piece by a living Minnesota composer.  By playing this music for free, we provide a great opportunity for everyone to hear this great repertoire.  
Metropolitan Symphony Orchestral Association	205307		/users/profile/267448	KarenAnder	Volunteer	5	07/07/2014	I have volunteered with and donated to MSO for over 30 years, ever since the orchestra was founded. The musicians all give their time rehearsing and performing high-quality classical music to audiences for free. MSO's small staff works on an honorarium basis, including Music Director William Schrickel, who is a member of the Minnesota Orchestra. We are very fortunate to have this first-class volunteer symphony orchestra in the Twin Cities, and rest assured your donation will be put to good use!
Metropolitan Symphony Orchestral Association	179919		/users/profile/236567	Pamela53	General Member of the Public	2	10/19/2013	The MSO has made some programming choices that show a lack of sensitivity to Christian venues and to children IMO. The most recent was a performance of the Stravinsky Rite of Spring (which is about the pagan sacrifice of a maiden) in a Lutheran church during the afternoon.  This is a piece one would think of as best suited to a secular venue in the evening.    
Forget-Me-Not Foundation of Itasca County	74764		/users/profile/81684	adzs	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/24/2011	As a DSP, I have worked for clients who have enjoyed the benefits of FORGET-ME-NOT FOUNDATION.  It has been an honor to see my clients and others reap the freedoms only one can by being "free" if only for a short time while sitting in the saddle of one of the many beautiful horses FMNF has to offer. The smiles, laughs and all around great times will not only last in my clients hearts, but mine as well. I urge anyone who has spare time to inquire about volunteering for this foundation, as in provides a wealth of personal satisfaction for the people it serves and would for you as well.

Merrick Community Services	193760		/users/profile/253098	gentiane8	Client Served	1	02/04/2014	I am a senior citizen in the City of St. Paul. Four to five years ago, I requested help with snow shoveling from the Merrick Community Center.  The first year it went well, but in the 2nd half of the second season,  help from the same person became unreliable. Eventually a new person was assigned which lasted for about two months, and then another for one event. the third year help was sporadic and unreliable. At that time I emailed the Director of Merrick about my concerns about the situation, but received no response. This year was typical of my contact with Merrick.  Early in the season I received a call from J.A., Merrick Senior Chores, who told me that interviews with Contractors were being held, and that more help would be available. Shortly after that a female called me and said that she and her family had been assigned to me for temporary help with snow removal, that help never came. Then S. from Merrick Chores called me to say that Someone was coming right over to shovel snow, and she gave me her phone to call her if there was any problem. The Someone never showed up. When I called S. from Merrick , she did not respond to my phone call.  In December of 2014, a man named J. came to my door with a Paper from Merrick for me to sign, and said he had been assigned to me for snow shoveling.  J. came twice to my house when I was home, gave me a work receipt for payment. I sent the payment to Merrick, J. came to my house a third time,  when I wasn't home and did the work, but did not leave a receipt.  I called Merrick, and left a message for J.A. to  ask for a receipt so I could make a payment to Merrick, but she never responded to my message.  More than a month ago, I made several phone calls to J.A. to let her know that J. had never shown up again, and I asked to  call me and let me know what was going on.  To this date, Feb. 4th, 2014, J.A. from Merrick Chore Service has never returned my phone calls. Last week I called the Merrick Office and I spoke to a Staff member, and I asked that she tell the Director  of my concerns about Merrick Chore Services. I also inquired of her why my contacts with past calls to Merrick have not received a response. She said that the response given by Staff, was that they had been unable to reach me. I have a phone feature that is a answering machine. In recent past there has never been a  message on it from any Merrick staff responding to me. So I am very skeptical about that answer.

Animal Sanctuary of the St Croix Valley	241521	4	/users/profile/328098	donnybrk	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2015	A very different and much needed facility.  The animals are obviously well-nourished and happy.  Their disabilities would make it difficult if not impossible for them to be placed in a human home, and this home is better for them anyway.  Their special needs are the center of attention here, and staff members are well trained to meet those needs.  This is a very impressive place, deserving of whatever support you can give it.
Animal Sanctuary of the St Croix Valley	241391	4	/users/profile/327929	Farah R.	Client Served	5	04/20/2015	Animal rescue, is about rescuing animals.....not pandering to human egos and emotions. I work with foreign animal rescue and we have had the great fortune to cross paths with Lisa and home for life. We have dogs that are unadoptable due to physical and emotional issues, HFL has housed a number of them. Without Lisa and HFL and organizations like hers these animals would be in dire straights. I spent 4 days at HFL volunteering and watching the operation. One thing is very very clear.....it is about the animals...they recieve the very best of care and attention and love. Lisa runs a tight ship, but she has to, she has many many responsibilities and worrying about individuals who do not have the same vision as hers should not be one of them.  HFL is run on donations, as are most animal rescues,  as one who has seen terrible animal neglect many times, I am a full supporter of HFL and their vision.......we share the same one.....nothing else should matter except the care of these animals that would stand no chance in this cruel world without the selfless dedication of a few.  Farah RavonVafa Animal Shelter - US Rep
Animal Sanctuary of the St Croix Valley	241197	4	/users/profile/327691	demeier50	Donor	5	04/15/2015	Home for Life is a beautifully managed sanctuary that saves cats and dogs who have behavior issues and/or disabilities that would make adoption very difficult.  The Home for Life animals would have been euthanized at traditional shelters. Instead they are given loving care at Home for Life, which has been managed effectively for decades. Cats and dogs live in rooms not cages. Dogs live in compatible pairs, and cats live communally. Each dog room has a little outdoor yard and in addition, the dogs are given time to run in huge yards. I wanted to make a donation to an outstanding No Kill sanctuary that takes in animals from across the nation and that has a long track record of excellence.  I looked online but found that there are very few sanctuaries that measure up to those criteria.  I made my donation to Home for Life after reading the website carefully and talking to the Director.  While I live across the country, and have not visited Home for Life, it was enough for me to see their photos and videos of their disabled dogs and cats who live such happy lives - it literally brings me tears of joy. I believe that donors can feel confident that their gifts are used efficiently and effectively to provide excellent care at Home for Life for animals who would otherwise be killed at traditional shelters. I think its sad that many people who give to the national humane groups think their money goes to save dog and cats.  Anyone who reads the No Kill literature -especially Nathan Winograds Friendly Fire - would never give another dime to those groups.  And it is also sad when people donate to traditional shelters, which resort to convenience killing. Animals like the cats and dogs at Home for Life are quickly euthanized at all too many shelters in America; it is estimated that 4 million dogs and cats are put down every year and the animals like those at Home for Life dont have a chance at traditional shelters.   If you believe that all cats and dogs want to live, whether or not they are adoptable, and that they should be loved and cared for at a beautiful place,  please take a look at the Home for Life website. 
Twin Cities Rise	189832	3	/users/profile/247830	Nana64	Client Served	1	12/04/2013	I would not recommend this program to anyone. Once enrolled participants have to sign a contract which requires that they pay large sums of money. They have only helped a few people to find jobs. People can get help and find jobs without this program. They present themselves as a caring group of people....until you join the program or have to work for them. This is a hostile work environment for anyone who is honest with management. This organization completely misrepresents who they are and what they are truly about. The Empowerment Course is a scam. The information in this class can be gotten any where on line or in any self help book. This organization does not practice what it preaches. It's hard to find bad reviews about them because management makes employees sign a confidentiality agreement not to discuss what actually goes on in this organization. Stay away from this program. Don't get sucked into paying unnecessary monies. I hope the City of Minneapolis and St. Paul will close this program down.

Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota	86276		/users/profile/96524	tashafox	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I originally contacted Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota back in 2008 to find ways to get involved with the prevention of child abuse.  Two years later, I facilitate a parent support group in my facility-backed by and chartered by Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota-called Circle of Parents. The Circle groups are spread throughout the state of Minnesota and offer parents an opportunity to network with other parents and learn new ways to raise their children. PCAMN stresses the importance of the parent voice and offers many opportunities within their programs to provide opportunities to parents so they may be heard. The work PCAMN does within the state of Minnesota is amazing! The staff are incredible and the organization offers so much amazing information that without them, our state would suffer.  They have offered me growth, not only in my personal life but in my professional life as well. I am a survivor against child abuse and am a parent who made the choice to break the cycle of abuse.  I am proud to volunteer with PCAMN and I support their work 150%.
Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota	86267		/users/profile/96512	Connie S.	Advisor	5	04/19/2011	I am recently retired as Executive Director of Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota. You might think that makes me a bit jaded, but not really. I chose to work at PCAMN after a long career in social services with children who were victims of abuse, neglect and severe emotional problems. I saw the desperate need for prevention to improve the lives of our children. As a survivor myself, I am painfully aware of what it is like to experience trauma and a toxic environment at an early age. For me it resulted in lifelong issues with obesity and now diabetes.      Joining PCAMN and working on the prevention of early adverse experiences was the best thing I could have done. We must all begin to look at the long term and work today to make tomorrow better for all of us - starting with our children. PCAMN does this. THrough public awareness, family support, and advocachy, PCAMN helps thousands of people each year to make their lives better.  Your support means everything to this critical work on behalf of our communities and families. Thank you.

Our family came to Elk River from Up-North, (North of Bemidji) for the auditory-oral education and medicine for our born profoundly deaf daughter. It has been eight years since she was implanted with a Cochlear Implant, and a total of sixteen surgeries. She is a very rambunctious tween now, who surprises people when they find she is profoundly deaf, because of how well-spoken she is. Her confidence, and our deep appreciation for Lions community support have led our family to becoming a Lions Club family. Our semi-monthly meetings include our two daughters, my husband and myself and a room full of civic-minded individuals who work hard to build up our community.  It feels great to give back!

Wildlife Science Center	142586	3	/users/profile/182998	Miranda S.	Client Served	5	11/26/2012	Quite a few years ago, my husband and I attended a wine tasting benefit for the Wildlife Science Center. We had recently moved to the Forest Lake area and attended the wine tasting just for something fun to do. While we were there we bid on and won a day-camp pass for the Science Center which we gave to my stepson. He had a great time at camp, and I'm still thankful we were able to get him away from his video games for a few good lessons from mother nature! I have visited the Center on some of their event days and think the work they do is more difficult than the usual humane work that is done due to the variety of creatures that they have in their care. It deserves praise; and I always enjoy learning something new from them when I attend their events!
Wildlife Science Center	126522	3	/users/profile/136141	Michele A.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	There have been countless times I have heard squeals of delight from visiting high school students. Other times, I have witnessed the subdued awe of young adults seeing rare behavior. The gasp of amazement when a raptor decides to look at an individual taking a photo. I have watched adults and children alike transfixed on a pack of wolves eating natural foods. I have been part of the presentations the staff gives. Tell me what you remember of your high school science courses, because honestly all I can remember is hours of tedious note taking, not the subject. The Wildlife Science Center is so much more than the animals that call it home. The education they bring to people from all walks of life and ages is important to the roles of humans within the environment.  
International Association Of Ministries Inc	83522		/users/profile/92549	greg	Advisor	5	03/28/2011	I've traveled to Nepal, have seen the ministry first hand, and have had the privilege of serving as an advisor for the last several years. It is consistently impacting the lives of wonderful yet otherwise hopeless people for Jesus Christ. The ministry is fiscally responsible and good stewards of resources it's entrusted with. The ministry's founders are seasoned with over 30 years experience and love these people with compassion and competence. An aspect of the model that I personally appreciate is that the ministry incorporates self sufficiency into it's work, exploring ways for those who are benefited by the ministry to produce income (raising animals, selling goods, etc).
International Association Of Ministries Inc	83460		/users/profile/92465	amanda_turnquist	General Member of the Public	5	03/28/2011	Mike and Pat Picone are genuine people with an incredible passion to reach the people of Nepal and India and to care for the needs of the handicapped community.  The organization is run with integrity and excellence, and the relationships they are developing with the disabled community are ones of virtue and love.  I have known the Picones for a few years and am inspired by their work and compassion both in the local community as well as in their international outreaches. NLIM is changing lives and providing a lifeline to people who are overlooked and without resources and hope. They are reaching people without an ability to care for themselves due to their disabilities and giving them community, family, and a sense of purpose and life.  This is a wonderful organization and I would encourage anyone with a desire to develop community, provide for people with disabilities, and/or improve the lives of people living in physical and spiritual poverty to get involved NLIM.

OSIRIS ORGANIZATION	223928		/users/profile/287681	rilladc2	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	The Osiris Organization is great! I started off volunteering for the Osiris Organization when I graduated college, so I can get experience in computers. Since then the Osiris Organization has found me employment and has helped me make a difference in my community.
OSIRIS ORGANIZATION	193512		/users/profile/252746	bouninc	Client Served	5	01/30/2014	Osiris has been in my corner for over 14 years now. I came to the organization needing help with life issues, education direction, and entrepreneurial guidance. First, they helped me utilize a better decision making process while also leading me to build strong relationships with my immediate family. Second, I was given the opportunity to intern at a Web Services firm through Osiris to learn the field in which I have established my career. Third, I've gained their support fully in operating my own business which lead me to become a profitable enterprise. Osiris' programs continue to impact my life today because learning never ends. Without their support, my life would be a burden on the community. I'm so thankful for their dedication to me. That's how I'm able to become the best I can be.  
Mankato Area Arts Council	108410		/users/profile/147570	MN-RMF	Donor	5	03/28/2012	As a donor and long-time volunteer, I have found the Carnegie Art Center a wonderful, visual arts resource for exhibiting, taking classes, and finding arts resources.    The Carnegie is in one of the most beautiful, historic landmarks in southcentral MN and is the largest visual arts gallery in the area.     Each month, two new exhibits of new and emerging visual artists are presented.   The large, annual regional art exhibit done in cooperation with the Prairie Lakes Regional Arts Council is in May/June each year. The juried exhibit is open to everyone who wants to submit art to be considered for the show.  Usually there are almost 100 pieces of original art work presented in this exhibit alone!
Mankato Area Arts Council	83334		/users/profile/92277	RMF5	Volunteer	5	03/26/2011	The Carnegie Art Center has three, large galleries in a beautiful, historic building.  Exhibits change monthly.  The quality and professionalism of the exhibit presentation is fantastic and a great service to beginning and professional visual artists!     The Carnegie now has a Facebook page that is always up to date (Carnegie Art Center Mankato) and a new webpage in progress: "thecarnegiemankato.com"

Vail Place Inc	118550	1	/users/profile/160956	Illya	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	Vail Place is a club house for people living with mental illness. Members gather to make friends, build community, get help finding work and housing and share the responsibilities with the staff of taking care of the building.  Its a place where they feel safe and are able to be themselves without judgment from others.Volunteering for the organization was one of the bright spots of my week!   My job was to take members grocery shopping with the organizations van and then drop them off at their homes.  This helped simplify what can be a time consuming and logistically challenging errand, especially to those using public transportation; to one that was fun, efficient and also allowed people to buy more groceries at one time.I always felt so welcome at Vail Place that I would attend their morning meeting, go shopping and then come back and socialize and have lunch.  The staff and members work together to make this a great place to come to.
Se Luz Ministries Incorporated	189812		/users/profile/247801	MelissaLock	Donor	5	12/03/2013	I have had the privilege of hearing Kali, Se Luz founder, share stories of what is happening through this organization.  Through the seemingly simple idea of welcoming and gathering kids to serve together in their own community, Se Luz creates a virtuous cycle that empowers kids, gives them a sense of purpose and belonging and plants seeds of what is possible throughout the community. 
Se Luz Ministries Incorporated	189396		/users/profile/247239	Karen227	Donor	5	11/27/2013	I have been a donor to Se Luz since day one. I have followed the progress of my donations, and I am so pleased with the results that I have seen. Starting with a handful of young men looking to an alternative from the street gang lifestyle to becoming more than 50 and growing, serving their communities. The work they do is professional grade and the whole time they are building and bettering their communities, they are also bettering themselves. They are learning to empower themselves to create a better lifestyle as they work on becoming valuable members of the community.  If you check out their website, you can see the proof of their accomplishments for yourself. Se Luz is a different type of organization, but I am proud to support this effort and I will continue to do so.
Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota	86276		/users/profile/96524	tashafox	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I originally contacted Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota back in 2008 to find ways to get involved with the prevention of child abuse.  Two years later, I facilitate a parent support group in my facility-backed by and chartered by Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota-called Circle of Parents. The Circle groups are spread throughout the state of Minnesota and offer parents an opportunity to network with other parents and learn new ways to raise their children. PCAMN stresses the importance of the parent voice and offers many opportunities within their programs to provide opportunities to parents so they may be heard. The work PCAMN does within the state of Minnesota is amazing! The staff are incredible and the organization offers so much amazing information that without them, our state would suffer.  They have offered me growth, not only in my personal life but in my professional life as well. I am a survivor against child abuse and am a parent who made the choice to break the cycle of abuse.  I am proud to volunteer with PCAMN and I support their work 150%.
Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota	86267		/users/profile/96512	Connie S.	Advisor	5	04/19/2011	I am recently retired as Executive Director of Prevent Child Abuse Minnesota. You might think that makes me a bit jaded, but not really. I chose to work at PCAMN after a long career in social services with children who were victims of abuse, neglect and severe emotional problems. I saw the desperate need for prevention to improve the lives of our children. As a survivor myself, I am painfully aware of what it is like to experience trauma and a toxic environment at an early age. For me it resulted in lifelong issues with obesity and now diabetes.      Joining PCAMN and working on the prevention of early adverse experiences was the best thing I could have done. We must all begin to look at the long term and work today to make tomorrow better for all of us - starting with our children. PCAMN does this. THrough public awareness, family support, and advocachy, PCAMN helps thousands of people each year to make their lives better.  Your support means everything to this critical work on behalf of our communities and families. Thank you.

The majority of the profits are used for local charities and the prices at the store are reasonable unlike the other thrift stores that are pricing used, donated items like they were new
Shalom Thrift Shop Inc	150259		/users/profile/200386	Lynn V.	Volunteer	5	02/28/2013	Prices are reasonable and every dollar collected is given back to the community to help those in need.  Totally operated by volunteers thru the area churches.
Heartland Animal Rescue Team	274741		/users/profile/364215	Writer	Client Served	1	12/20/2015	I wish there were another option. The people involved have become too callous. They do not care about the animals. I hope that someone will come up with an alternative. I would not donate to them and would only adopt so that I could rescue the animals from them. The money is not going to where it should.
Heartland Animal Rescue Team	50323	2	/users/profile/50912	concerned2	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/13/2010	This is a very high kill shelter. They adopt out less than 30%. My experience is not a positive one at all. Over a years time I went in three times to view animals for adoption. I tried to adopt one mother cat that was just brought in with a liter of kittens. The mother was never put up for adoption after her kittens were weaned. (Or none were put up for adoption ever) They killed the dog I was interested in adopting because it had a lump on its neck. I offered to have it looked at by a vet and pay for everything but they would not do it and kill the dog instead. The dog was never looked at by a licensed veterinarian. I wanted to contact and address the board of directors but was unable to reach any board member. The shelter does not put you through and there is no way to contact the board. I want to attend a board meeting but they will not even let me know where the meetings are held.
BASIC NEEDS INC OF SOUTH WASHINGTON COUNTY	185162	1	/users/profile/242123	trendyjendy	Board Member	5	10/30/2013	Basic Needs, Inc. helps hundreds of families each year by providing free or significantly reduced goods for those in need. The dedication of the staff is truly remarkable, as they all work tirelessly to make sure this service stays afloat. I am proud to be a member of this board and participate in such a worthy organization.
BASIC NEEDS INC OF SOUTH WASHINGTON COUNTY	144347	1	/users/profile/58474	Majel	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	Stone Soup is nearing 16 years of serving those in need.  The economic downturn brings more families through our doors.  Many families lacking the resources to obtain basic needs or adequate clothing and are referred to Stone Soup by local community and Social Service agencies, and churches.   Households with limited or fixed incomes shop at Stone Soup, and benefit from the fine quality of donated gently used items.  Every month over 1,700 shoppers come to find basic needs at affordable prices.  One of the special we offer is all the clothes you can fit in a grocery bag for $8.00 some days for much less.  Those referred to us who are unable to afford the store's low prices are given what they need, at no coast.   During 2011 goods valued at $147,294 were given to 960 individuals: 63 seniors, 438 children, and 459 adults, (of these 74 were homeless).  As of November 14th donated processed inventory (currently over $128,078 - 55%) was given to 1005 individuals: 65 seniors, 457 children, 483 adults, community churches, agencies, plus there were 17,987 walk-in customer sales. On special days as customers entered the store there are bins and shelves filled with a variety of free usable items.  Children love this, usually finding toys they can take home.   Stone Soup maintains the delivery of supplemental assistance including: free bread contributed by Panera Bread on Tuesday and Saturday, and donated produce during summer months.  The store provides brush-up training for the Washington County Senior Work Program, and for Minnesota WorkForce participants.  Youth and Adults perform court ordered community service in our store often returning as volunteers because they liked what they did so much.  In addition from 2004 thru 2011 we recycled 17,732 bags of clothing & 13,643 pounds of leather and shoes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 During 2011 the help of 90 Community Service persons and 42 volunteers provided 7,488 hours, to make the store ready for service, and to process donated quality products for return to the community. We always need volunteers to help keep the store organized.  Choices include assisting with: receiving donated items on  our dock, donation pick-ups, sorting, sizing and hanging clothes, testing donated electrical items, cleaning glassware, setting-up eye catching displays, or helping with customer service Stone Soup is often asked how we pay expenses.  Our biggest fixed costs are rent and wages.  Stone Soup has added 1,666 sq. ft. of sorting space required to accommodate the growth and processing of donations.  Store sales help meet a portion of this.   The balance of our costs requires us to raise funds by applying for foundations grants, or by holding events like our ANNUAL SOUP-ER BOWL.  NEXT YEAR (2013) IT WILL BE HELD SATURDAY, APRIL 27TH, FROM 9:00 AM TO 6:30 PM AT: PARK GROVE BOWL, 1020 HASTINGS AVE, ST. PAUL PARK, MN.  Information and entry forms WILL BE ON OUR WEB SITE.  Keep the people we serve in mind as you sort through your closets getting ready for seasons.  We always need attire, furniture, and household goods.  You may bring donated items to Stone Soup, Monday thru Friday 9am to 5pm, or Saturdays 9am to 3pm.  Free furniture pickup is available every other week by appointment.  If you have questions, or wish a free furniture pick-up call 651-458-9786. Stone Soup meets the Charities Review Council standards, and has their seal of approval.

CARVER SCOTT COUNTY HUMANE SOCIETY INC	233054		/users/profile/296718	Passionate.Cat.Lady	Volunteer	5	11/06/2014	I started volunteering in the spring of 2013.  Starting with the Pet Adoption Days then later I was asked to help with some committees.  During the course of volunteering [for the first time] I found it very easy to ask people to support me when asking on behalf of the animals in need.  I have grown as a person as a result.   CSHS has enabled me to truly make an impact on helping animals in need which has been very near and dear to me since childhood.  Pooling resources enables us to make the greatest impact in our mission.  I highly recommend anyone to help any way they can: financially, fostering, volunteering... it is well worth your time when working with CSHS.
CARVER SCOTT COUNTY HUMANE SOCIETY INC	188992		/users/profile/246676	MinMN	Volunteer	5	11/21/2013	I have volunteered for 21 years with the CSHS. They are run by a small handful of dedicated volunteers and make a big difference in the lives of abandoned, abused animals that come their way.   Funding is always a problem, as it is totally donation based.  Foster homes are always needed, as CSHS does not have a permanent shelter, just land on which to build a future one.   Volunteers are in short supply. 
Veterans Campground on Big Marine Lake	243176	1	/users/profile/329821	citruslime	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2015	Veterans Campground is a great place for veterans and their families, and only a 30 minute drive from downtown St. Paul.  The campground has 167 RV sites, 24 cabins, and 15 tent sites.  Lots to do--boating, tubing, skiing, fishing, hiking trails, volleyball, picnics, horse shoes, basket ball, etc.  Very friendly place.

Veterans Campground is a contributing partner in helping military veterans reintegrate back to family and civilian live, and bringing veterans all the way home.
Canvas Health Inc	318633		/users/profile/409859	cicipaz	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2016	This agency serves many adults, children, and families in the east metro area that live with severe and persistent mental illness. The providers are compassionate, truly care for the people they serve, and strongly believe in the values of the organization. Otherwise, why would they choose to work in such a challenging field for low pay, as compared to for-profit mental health agencies? There is a huge need for quality community mental health services in the area, and Canvas seeks to help meet this growing need, even as the need has become so great that they cannot keep up, especially in providing care for children and families, as wait lists continue to grow. Money donated to this organization could be helpful in allowing them to hire more clinicians and expand the existing successful programs. Many lives have been changed by and depend on the support that Canvas Health provides, please consider donating to this life changing organization. Thank you! 
Canvas Health Inc	261757		/users/profile/350383	Ltg0520	Client Served	1	10/05/2015	My experience with this company has been awful. The providers do not show up for scheduled appointments. The providers and staff do not care about the needs of the patients. You are made to feel like an inconvenience in their day. Sadly, my son is still in need of help. Please do not donate to this organization. Spend your money at a place that truly cares for their patients. 
Cook County Higher Education	149063		/users/profile/198602	Jim_49	Donor	5	02/07/2013	Can't overstate the importance of Higher Ed to Cook County. It is our answer to not having, or having any hope for, a community college. It connects folks in the community who need training and education with the opportunities that are available, many of them online. It responds quickly and comprehensively to requests by local employers for training programs. It provides a wide array of business training for owners, managers and employees of county businesses. It is a gathering spot for the community.  I should add that although it was not listed as a category, I work for Higher Ed, coordinating business training. 
Cook County Higher Education	149033		/users/profile/198546	Carolyn46	Volunteer	5	02/06/2013	In the far northern Arrowhead region of Minnesota, there are few higher education opportunities which makes such learning difficult and costly for families.  Were it not for Cook County Higher Education  building and program, there would be almost none.  The nearest college is about 100 miles away, and commuting that distance would be impossible on a regular basis.  How do high school graduates better themselves in the areas of nursing, technology, and general higher ed classes in Grand Marais and the surrounding area?  Only through the Cook County Higher Education.  This is a desperately needed resource for the town, community, and nearby towns.  It is absolutely essential to the educational aspirations of the local population. 
FERGUS FALLS 544 EDUCATION FOUNDATION	89270		/users/profile/23861	rschara	Board Member	5	05/26/2011	I see how the Foundation provides the extras, not only within the school itself, but within the entire community. Because education isn't just for school days, the Foundation helps support a huge summer reading program that aims to make kids better readers during the summer...or at least read. The 544 Education Foundation would welcome ideas and initiative suggestions.
FERGUS FALLS 544 EDUCATION FOUNDATION	22850	3	/users/profile/23861	rschara	Board Member	5	11/18/2009	The 544 Foundation provides a tax-deductible way for Fergus Falls Public School supporters to give back to their alma mater. The Foundation provides funding for various causes within the schools, items or programs or events that otherwise would likely go unfunded. The 544 Foundation can help support many activities and educational efforts that don't have support groups or booster clubs. It's a great organization.

She was so happy here and we were impressed with the way the staff interacted with her.  The place was clean and well taken care of as was Mom.  This would be a wonderful place for any elderly person to call home as they will get the care they need and deserve.
Little Sisters Of The Poor Of St Paul	258466	1	/users/profile/346961	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/19/2015	Little Sisters Of The Poor is an amazing nursing home. I am a volunteer here and I couldn't ask for a better place to be. Also with that being said my grandma had lived here. She had been in some pretty screwed up nursing homes in her lifetime but she was happy living here. She has passed away but in her last moments she couldn't have been any happier. She was surrounded by staff and family in her last moments. This nursing home is for the elderly poor and they pay little to nothing out of pocket while they live here. I couldn't be happier with them. If you are looking for a nursing home this is my most recommended one for anyone.

As a result, my sister has promoted awareness of and encouraged donations to this hard-working group.

Bridges To Learning Inc	229915		/users/profile/293566	lkpitner	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I've been helping Bridges to Learning for over a year.  My husband has visited the school.  They are truly doing great things for these beautiful children.  All started by the dedication of a Lutheran woman who fell in love with these children through teaching to them.  She started raising money and things happened.  It has been 10 years since it all began, and things are amazing, but definitely could do more.  They would like to open other schools in other areas in need, but as with all non-profits, they are funding what they have very well, but would need more to grow.
Bridges To Learning Inc	210611		/users/profile/273383	Lilypits	Volunteer	4	08/13/2014	An amazing thing happens to the students of Anh Linh school.  My husband visited the school, and we are now sponsoring a boy.  Wonderful people in Vietnam, many living in destroyed lands.

Innovation is the key to their approach. There is no school doing more to revolutionize how the poor are educated. If this grand educational experiment is even remotely successful, deep systemic change within the fabric of Dominican culture is assured!  Stay tuned to see how a small Christian school in the rural town of Jarabacoa will spark a Revolution.  
Doulos Discovery Ministries	154426		/users/profile/205255	Calann	Donor	5	04/12/2013	My husband and I have been supporters of Doulos Discovery Ministries since the beginning.  We have supported students as well as staff/teachers and hosted many work teams over the past ten years. We also have been privileged to be a part of the support for the new elementary building. During these past ten years, we have seen students achieve success far beyond their wildest dreams.  We have seen teachers catch the spirit of the joy of teaching. We have heard laughter and the sounds of those first "ah ha" moments when a new idea has dawned on them. Their curriculum of experiential learning embeds in them the lessons presented as they not only READ about learning, but they TOUCH, HEAR, TASTE and SMELL those lessons. Sensory learning is the best way to remember lessons presented.  We have also had the joy of seeing many of these students advance and succeed in colleges. My husband and I feel we have been given a wonderful gift to have been part of this program and feel that our investment will affect the lives of many for eternity 
PROP SHOP OF EDEN PRAIRIE	21277	1	/users/profile/22398	Sandy	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2009	What a great place to shop!  My 10 year old daughter and I can ALWAYS find something (mostly clothes - but shoes and household too).  Friendly staff and very clean.  Bonus! The proceeds help out others in need.
PROP SHOP OF EDEN PRAIRIE	3804	1	/users/profile/5577	amy	Volunteer	5	04/22/2009	A great local nonprofit resale shop.  The PROP Shop accepted donations of gently used clothing, household items and furniture.  These donations are either given away free of charge to clients in need or sold in the shop as a means of meeting operational expenses.  Staffed mostly by volunteers, it's a friendly, warm place to shop, volunteer, or to get a helping hand.

Wirth Center for the Performing Arts	102266		/users/profile/132832	jomiller.hhs	Client Served	5	12/13/2011	In December of 2010, I wanted to find the right piano teacher for my son so that he would remain engaged and enthusiastic about his lessons and his progress from day one.  I could not have been more impressed with the process of enrollment.  We met with their Assistant Director (Jeanine) for a mutual interview - so we could get to know the school and so they could get to know us and help identify the right teacher for our child and family.  The fact that they have multiple teachers with varied styles was a great plus for us -- I heard too many stories from other parents where the child and the teacher didn't click and, therefore, the lessons, practices and interest in music dwindled.  CMMS found the perfect teacher for our son (and for us) - Chris Goeing.   Our son's progress in playing piano this past year has been absolutely amazing and his ability to read music has been astounding.  More important to me - he likes piano, he loves learning about music, he respects, wants to please and (thoroughly) enjoys his teacher and he is very proud to be a CMMS student.   And I am a proud Mom of a CMMS student!  I am very thankful that this organization exists in our community. 
Wirth Center for the Performing Arts	28941	6	/users/profile/29986	thew	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	As a student at the Central Minnesota Music School (CMMS), I had the opportunity to study with one of the finest piano teachers in the Midwest and arguably the country.  I studied piano with Dr. Wirth for nine years and attended the Young Artist World Piano Festival, a summer intensive organized by CMMS, for six years in a row.  I later returned as a counselor for the Festival for four years in a row.My experience has been both joyful and intense.  As a CMMS student, I was held to a very high standard of artistry, and was constantly challenged to excel in my music.  At the same time, I can honestly say that I never felt pressure to perform for the sake of my teacher's reputation or that of the school.  Playing piano was never about being "the best".  It was just about being the pianist I wanted to be.  There is no requirement to win competitions, only to work hard and realize your own potential.  The combination of humility and excellence is what makes CMMS one in a million.
Kaleidoscope Place	9563	1	/users/profile/11379	Karen	Former staff	5	08/26/2009	I've been involved with Kaleidoscope for over 9 years now.  Over those years I have accomplished, and matured allot.

Albert Lea Art Center	193117		/users/profile/252234	ArtLinkletter	General Member of the Public	1	01/25/2014	It used to be better, but for the past few years, this place has gone downhill considerably. 1. They painted their galleries gray, which casts a death-like pall on everything. Some areas near the entrance have received a much-needed and attractive paint spruce-up, with a children's mural on the south side wall and decorative paint details on the other.  2. Exhibits sometimes do not consist of art, but of mass produced kitsch. One exhibit featured a canoe, a bunch of belt buckles and some duck decoys. Another consisted of old clothes. I might expect kitschy collections to be displayed at the 4H building at the fair or at a hobby show, but not at an art center.  3. Exhibits, which used to change monthly, are now up for two or three months. Exhibit rooms sometimes stand empty.  I see the same familiar names on paintings whenever they do hang a new show. What happened to the person who used to book a dozen new and original shows each year? What happened to dozens of artists from all over MN and Iowa who used to want to display their art there? What happened to the Art in the Park festival that they used to have each summer? Is this art center on life support? 4. The place is often not open during posted hours. So if a person were to drive from another town to visit this art center, he or she might be disappointed to find doors locked or galleries either empty or filled with stuff, rather than art.  5. Some merchandise in the gift shop looks shop worn, as if it's been there for years.  6. Whoever decorates the windows in front and in the hallway must bring old stuff from home or from dumpster dives because it looks very tacky and tired.  7. The people who work there do not seem friendly or welcoming to me. On the contrary, they seem to be doing their own thing in the office, holding court behind a closed door, or they are not visible to a visitor.  8. As a previous reviewer said, their hallway needs some art. I think there was some photography on the south wall, but nothing opposite. There is a row of nails on the north side, but if they can't fill their galleries, how can they fill their hallways?  9. The most interesting room at the center is the first little gallery you come to, on the south side of the hall. It is decorated colorfully and always filled with art, but that appears to be some kind of private gallery that's not affiliated with the Art Center or always open to the general public.  10. The last financial report on this site shows a yearly income of 58K. It's hard to see where this non-profit is putting their money and energy. This place, which once had vitality, looks like everyone has run out of steam.      
Albert Lea Art Center	29369	6	/users/profile/30395	writerstacy	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	The Albert Lea Art Center is a wonderful experience every time I visit there!  There are several different kinds of mediums every month I go.  The free open houses are planned well, and always enjoyable!  The gift shop has man different kinds of art on consignment, hard to find art supplies, jewelry, and books written by local authors!  It's a one-stop shopping experience!  I fully reccomend making an extra effort to visit this wonderful Art Center!  It will be well worth your trip!

The Carnegie is in one of the most beautiful, historic landmarks in southcentral MN and is the largest visual arts gallery in the area.     Each month, two new exhibits of new and emerging visual artists are presented.   The large, annual regional art exhibit done in cooperation with the Prairie Lakes Regional Arts Council is in May/June each year. The juried exhibit is open to everyone who wants to submit art to be considered for the show.  Usually there are almost 100 pieces of original art work presented in this exhibit alone!

I came to the organization needing help with life issues, education direction, and entrepreneurial guidance. First, they helped me utilize a better decision making process while also leading me to build strong relationships with my immediate family. Second, I was given the opportunity to intern at a Web Services firm through Osiris to learn the field in which I have established my career. Third, I've gained their support fully in operating my own business which lead me to become a profitable enterprise. Osiris' programs continue to impact my life today because learning never ends. Without their support, my life would be a burden on the community. I'm so thankful for their dedication to me. That's how I'm able to become the best I can be.  
Neighborhood House	187684	1	/users/profile/244720	Good to Great	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/03/2013	This organization was the best human service organization in the Twin Cities according to the United Way Board Chair in 2007.  Since that time, the Board replaced the successful CEO who turned around the organization with a novice in nonprofit management who has failed abysmally. Since that time, the organization has consistently run deficits in recent years resulting in significant cutbacks to the organization's program and thus, their mission.  They ended a mutual support program for Latino women that had minimal costs as the group used space in the facility & only require a part-time facilitator.  The group allowed immigrant women to mentor new arrivals & supported them on their journey into U.S.  The testimony of these women were featured at annual meetings, inspired the design of the new facility and were essential in gaining City and State support for the new facility before City Committees and the State Legislature.  After the building was built, the women and their program were cast aside by the new CEO and the Board of Directors. 
Neighborhood House	61186	1	/users/profile/66764	tabycatlady	Donor	5	01/26/2011	I worked for Neighborhood House for over 10 years and then I volunteered and became a donor.  This organization is one of the best of its kind in the United States.  It is a warm and welcoming place for the people it serves, the employees and volunteers.  It helps people by providing food  and other basic services, has a wonderful youth department with homework help and a college access program, an amazing English and GED program and this is only a small portion of the opportunities Neighborhood House has to sever the people of the Twin Cities.

People Serving People, Inc.	57290	1	/users/profile/60445	lizzie	Volunteer	5	11/18/2010	From the first moment I walked into PSP as a volunteer, I was hooked on that place.  I went in with a group of kids who had done a fundraiser for PSP.  We were given a tour of the building and all of the facilities, and told of the programs and assistance they offer.  That comprehensive tour, along with the ability of the PSP staff member to connect us to the place was what really engaged us and kept us coming back.  Since then myself and my family have been back to paint murals, and do other jobs numerous times.  PSP has such respect and care for the families who are staying there, and it is clear that providing these things really makes a difference in the lives of the people who temporarily call PSP home. And their programs to train and help employ people coming out of PSP are innovative and vital to those who wish to move past their current state, and into the next part of their life journey...providing a basis for a stable home for their families. I cannot even imagine how many people they have helped! I LOVE PSP, and I feel like there is a light and warmth and and positive spirit that emanates from that building down there on the corner.  The city would NOT be the same without it.
International Association Of Ministries Inc	83522		/users/profile/92549	greg	Advisor	5	03/28/2011	I've traveled to Nepal, have seen the ministry first hand, and have had the privilege of serving as an advisor for the last several years. It is consistently impacting the lives of wonderful yet otherwise hopeless people for Jesus Christ. The ministry is fiscally responsible and good stewards of resources it's entrusted with. The ministry's founders are seasoned with over 30 years experience and love these people with compassion and competence. An aspect of the model that I personally appreciate is that the ministry incorporates self sufficiency into it's work, exploring ways for those who are benefited by the ministry to produce income (raising animals, selling goods, etc).
International Association Of Ministries Inc	83460		/users/profile/92465	amanda_turnquist	General Member of the Public	5	03/28/2011	Mike and Pat Picone are genuine people with an incredible passion to reach the people of Nepal and India and to care for the needs of the handicapped community.  The organization is run with integrity and excellence, and the relationships they are developing with the disabled community are ones of virtue and love.  I have known the Picones for a few years and am inspired by their work and compassion both in the local community as well as in their international outreaches. NLIM is changing lives and providing a lifeline to people who are overlooked and without resources and hope. They are reaching people without an ability to care for themselves due to their disabilities and giving them community, family, and a sense of purpose and life.  This is a wonderful organization and I would encourage anyone with a desire to develop community, provide for people with disabilities, and/or improve the lives of people living in physical and spiritual poverty to get involved NLIM.

She was born in a time when there were few, if any, possibilities for her to live a happy, safe, and fulfilling life.   She would have done amazing things had Laura Baker been in her life.   I am happy to serve on a board that helps to offer life changing choices to a population that is often pushed out of sight and treated as unimportant.   Every life is a gift and I believe that God has given us special needs people in the world to remind us that none of are perfect and he wants us to care for those who are unable to care, and make a happy life for themselves. God Bless all those who serve at Laura Baker!
International Association Of Lions Clubs	319985		/users/profile/378456	Writer	Board Member	5	12/09/2016	We wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for the Lions' contributions to the University of Minnesota, ENT Lions Center. Our family came to Elk River from Up-North, (North of Bemidji) for the auditory-oral education and medicine for our born profoundly deaf daughter. It has been eight years since she was implanted with a Cochlear Implant, and a total of sixteen surgeries. She is a very rambunctious tween now, who surprises people when they find she is profoundly deaf, because of how well-spoken she is. Her confidence, and our deep appreciation for Lions community support have led our family to becoming a Lions Club family. Our semi-monthly meetings include our two daughters, my husband and myself and a room full of civic-minded individuals who work hard to build up our community.  It feels great to give back!

Project Life	100642		/users/profile/123721	marthaklein	Board Member	5	11/14/2011	I used to to think it was enough to say a few prayers, write a small check once in a while and wish organizations like this well.  It really wasn't about me and my life.  I would never have an abortion myself and really it wasn't much of my business if someone did.  But I have come to realize and know through working with Project Life that this is not just their story, it's my story, it's your story.  It is about us and what and who we have become and what we think as a society and a culture.  The problem is not really that abortion is legal, it's really not about abortion at all.  It's really about relationships and respect and how we learn and live out our relationships on the front end.  It's really about unwanted preganancies and how we get there to begin with.  It's about supply and demand, if we don't have unwanted preganacies, if girls aren't scared and confused when they find themselves unmarried and pregnant, then we don't have abortion, it's not needed.  I believe in the near future there will be a day when people say "abortion, people really did that?"  Help Project Life take a step closer to that day, one day at a time, one heart at a time, one donation at a time.  It's really OUR story, you and I.

Books on Wings focuses on providing books to at-risk youths...books that help further their education, and  open their minds to the possibilities that exist for them.

For Pete S Sake	286802		/users/profile/376872	Jennifer_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	We donate monthly to For Pete's Sake.  They have personally touched and helped my family at one of the worst times in our lives. I had a 2 year old and a new born and my husband (26 years old) was diagnosed with cancer. Chemo started and radiation would follow. FPS gave our family hope. They sent us on a trip to Florida. They gave us the break we needed to get away and be a normal family for a week. We escaped cancer for a week and it was amazing. FPS Is amazing!  Not a moment goes by that we aren't thankful for what thy dos for us and what they continue to do for other families dealing with cancer. My donation to FPS could never repay them for he experience and memories that gave my family, but donating is the least I can do. I could give you a million reasons why I donate to FPS.  They continue to give families hope and renewal to keep fighting their cancer battles.  That is priceless in my book.

What she says about us applies to For Pete's Sake too, because they have helped make it possible for us to do this very kind of thing for our veterans and service members. THANK YOU For Pete's Sake:  "My husband is a wounded warrior...he lost a leg in Afghanistan and struggled with a lot before we got in touch with PawPADs a couple years ago. We were eventually partnered with Barkley just over six months later. Barkley is a dog who was rescued from a shelter and trained in a prison...Barkley has changed our lives. There is not a piece of medical equipment on the planet that can do what this dog does for my husband. Barkley has given him a best friend and companion to share not only his struggles and hard times but his successes too...Barkley can turn on the lights and pick things up but the best thing he does is watch out for and take care of my husband...This is a nonprofit that is not only changing lives but changing the world while helping wounded warriors like my husband..." Thanks again, For Pete's Sake, for making this possible!

I clean houses so I have to go to lots of different places for my job. they have different buses that can get me to each house that I have to go to in northfield. I get to ride the route bus and sometimes the dial a ride bus if the route bus cant make it to my stop. I also use the route bus to go shopping.

THREE RIVERS COMMUNITY ACTION INC	232492	2	/users/profile/296032	watch	General Member of the Public	1	11/01/2014	Called  into toll free reservation line for hiawathaland transit 4 days ahead for scheduled pickup date and time for one way at $1.25.  After arriving early at stop and waiting over half hour in temps below 50 degrees, this public transit shuttle never showed. Heard comments from other citizens in northfield, mn that they no longer rely on it for getting to work or appointments and will not refer the service to anyone anymore. City of northfield relinquished jurisdiction over this public transit shuttle bus in 2012. It is detrimental to providing reliable services especially for seniors and citizens in poor health on limited incomes in northfield, mn. Many people are now switching to taxis in the area to get them where they need to go.

Our children have been attending since it opened and it has been far exceeding expectations.  Depth of character is promoted with their "Faith, Knowledge and Virtue" mission.  My kids were formed with a drive to learn because it was exciting and because it is virtuous. They strive to be "the best version of themselves" because they know that is what God wants; and Providence provides the means to make it happen.  The school is a gift in more ways than one. It was started and sustained by Christ filled donors. It will always be a part of my family. It's influence will become widely known as an example of what makes our country great!  Please help to sustain the school so other children can grow in faith and wisdom as well! May God reward your generosity!

Vermilion River Camp Inc	162983	1	/users/profile/216351	MadInMinnesota	General Member of the Public	1	07/18/2013	This "camp" doesn't even deserve one star.  I know someone, who was referred by a friend, who participated in the work camp.  He was to pay $400/mo to live there and Vermilion River Camp Inc was supposed to provide shelter, food and pay him at the end of 3 months for his work at the camp.  They claimed to be a non-profit organization to help people who have issues with alcoholism.  They charged my friend an excessive amount of money for gas and told him if things didn't work out, they would make sure they brought him back home.  So, they took him to the Boundary Waters area, approximately 4 hours from his home, and put him to work.  There was no telephone, radio or swimming pool, which were amenities that were promised.  The food was nothing more than moldy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and frozen meals that were picked up out of a dumpster from a school.  My friend has a severe alcohol problem, but he was able to obtain alcohol while on the property.  He also requested to return home or to be able to go into town for required medical supplies and Pastor Ed refused to let the camp leaders take him.  The response was "He should have thought about that before he came here".  It seems like they are bringing vulnerable adults to this secluded area to work and they are not living up to their end of the bargain or properly caring for the residents who agreed to live and work at the camp.  It is shameful that an organization who boasts itself as a Christian organization would treat anyone like this!  They need to be regulated and I would suggest never donating a dime to this organization!    
Pilgrim Center For Reconciliation	59375		/users/profile/64082	Troon62	Donor	5	01/03/2011	Since learning of this remarkable organization two years ago, my wife and I have contributed frequently. Its two founders and leading lights, Rev. Dr. Arthur Rouner, Jr. and his wife, Molly, travel twice yearly to Rwanda, Burundi, and Kenya, where they bring the healing message of reconciliation to Africans who have suffered horribly during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and in the course of other violent tribal conflicts. They are two of the most selfless individuals we have had the privilege of knowing. They quite literally and regularly change hardened hearts and provide deeply aggrieved people with newfound hope for a better life.  In addition to their African work, they also minister to Native Americans living on reservations, many mired in a world of poverty and despair. I cannot commend their honorable work highly enough.

They had received an old,old dog a couple years ago and his foster "mom" named him Otto. Through a mutual friend, the organization I work for learned about Otto and decided to adopt him...senior pets are hard to find homes for you know. We took Otto in and gave him a home with our other dogs. he was doted over by our own volunteers and got plenty of love and sunshine for his remaining time. We had his love and adoration for a year and a half before he crossed over the bridge. Thank you SCHS for sending such a wonderful "blessing" to us! 
The Works	8955	12	/users/profile/10742	Anita	Board Member	5	08/10/2009	The Works is a hands-on, minds-on museum that brings science, engineering, and mathematics to life for young people ages 5 to 15.   Open to the public since 1995, The Works stimulates its young visitors with unique exhibits and customized, in-depth educational programs that demystify technology, inspire interest and promote confidence in learning.    The Works is the only engineering based museum in the Twin Cities region, with exhibits and programs that reflect a broad range of technologies  including mechanical, structural, electronic, chemical and imaging technologies  plus the science and mathematics behind them.   Educational programs at The Works fulfill math and science curriculum standards as they introduce children, teachers and families to the world of technology.  Special programs target girls and students from ethnic backgrounds not yet well represented in technology-based professions.  A sliding fee scale makes The Works affordable for children from lower income families and for all schools. As an engineer I believe that the best way to get kids excited about math and science is through hands-on activities.  The Works' exhibits, camps and workshops are very effective at drawing kids in and getting them involved.  I have volunteered during school visits and summer camps.  It is pure delight to watch the kids light up when they discover the science behind every-day things or experience the thrill of making something with their own hands that really works! As a mother with children (9 & 12), I can state that my kids think The Works is a fabulous place.  We visit the museum often and their summer camps are always at the very top of our list.  I am thrilled at the amount of information the kids learn at the camps, but more important, how they retain this knowledge and are excited to apply it to other things once they get home.   This early-on experience with "real engineering" has given my kids a good basis for understanding why all the math and science taught in school is important.STEM education is important.  I am concerned by the high number of kids who are not meeting college readiness scores in math and science.   The Works is making a difference by sparking an interest in engineering within our youth.   I would like to nomintate them for a Youth Thrive Award

We hoped that one day the two delicious varieties of apples, a blonde and a redhead, would help feed bear and wildlife who visit this unique sanctuary, which is an annual safe haven for hundreds of wild bears who return there year after year.I highly recommend people visit in the Spring to see these gorgeous cubs running free, climbing trees , clowning around and charming souls.  May 28th was opening day and there were not yet a great number of bears as for many of them the journey is long to get there (also there are less tourists at this time of year).  Perhaps a week after opening day would be perfect.  I'll return whenever i'm in Minnesota, in season.Bless the bears,Cindy Barg

The few I have experienced and the stories I have heard are atrocious.  I have and am still suffering some issues related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by a 2 day hospital stay.  This was in the last half of 2011. I was taken off three medications that need to be reduced gradually.  Instead, I was pulled off cold turkey to continue the withdrawal symptoms at home.  My life and personality haven changed.  These medications I took were needed for a spinal cord tumor and subsequent surgery. I was given prescriptions and did not abuse my medications.  The final notes on my stay did not (according to three of my family members) coincide with instructions they were given.  My family also kept telling the physicians that I needed my medication.
Minneapolis Urban League	10769	10	/users/profile/12672	Don Allen	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/23/2009	IBNN Editors Note: Residents of Minneapolis should read closely the messages sent out in the local Black press that attempt to position this organization as one on the move up, when in fact troubles continue to linger. IBNN has written favorable stories and not-so favorable stories about the Minneapolis Urban League (MUL).  Since the Minneapolis Urban League is a membership organization, under the color of law, how will the MUL handle the possible over-throw of the current board to protect the memberships $16 million dollar investment on the corner of Penn and Plymouth Avenue North? If you recall  it was the Minneapolis Urban League management who decided to release great employees in favor of routing dollars to  ACORN home foreclosure counseling, among other things.  So far the National Urban League has not returned one call to IBNN in over a yearUnder the Minnesota Law  We (members in good standing) have the sole responsibility to seek out competent board members and management to continue the organizations ongoing commitment to the community.Originally posted in The Minneapolis StoryAt 5:15 p.m., today, Thursday, 9-17-09, Minneapolis Urban League Branch President Scott Gray announced, in closed session, the new austerity: 10% salary reduction across the board; termination of ten employees within 30 days; and an indication that the staff of the Urban League Street Academy would go on part time employee status (thus losing their benefits).Ever since the sell-outs kicked Nellie Stone Johnson and me (Ron Edwards) out 20 years ago, when I was the President of the Urban League with 118 employees, they have cannibalized the organization, reducing it from the 118 employees then to what will be less than 20 employees now.We show how this got started in Chapter 14 of The Minneapolis Story.

622 Education Foundation Inc	21267	1	/users/profile/22389	Carole48	Volunteer	5	11/03/2009	As a former school district employee, I became interested in the 622 Education Foundation when it was developed in 1996.  Their goal is to make educational opportunities available for all students in the North St. Paul-Maplewood-Oakdale public schools.  The Foundation has awarded more than $100,000 in grants to staff members who submitted grants to provide innovative opportunities for students.  They provide $22,000 per year to schools in the district for an Angel Fund.  This is a fund through which principals can assist students with food, clothing, medical care, supplies, etc., so that those students do not miss educational opportunities because of their families' financial situations.  Finally, the 622 Education Foundation recognizes excellent students who graduate in the top 10% of their class at a special dinner where they also recognize a selected teacher and parents, and they receive a scholarship.I will continue to support the 622 Education Foundation's excellent work with my time, talents and financial contributions.  In this difficult economic time, we need to do as much as possible to give students and staff our support.Carole Anderson

LYRA	28834	1	/users/profile/29893	theresa1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/18/2010	Students from Franklin Music Magnet, in St. Paul, Minnesota, had the distinct privilege of attending the Lyra Baroque Ensemble field trip to Landmark Center during the past school year. Students were engaged in hands-on activities, exploring harpsichords and gamelans. Following the workshop activities, we were treated to a concert from the Lyra Baroque Ensemble. Students were totally mesmerized by the sound. The acoustics  in the hall were stunning, and the students benefited greatly from the live performance experience, hearing the sound of the authentic Baroque instruments. The question and answer session following the performance provided a wonderful opportunity to deepen the students' knowledge of the period music. Being a musician myself, I appreciate the caliber of the Lyra musicians, and would recommend Lyra for any school or community partnership projects. I hope that I can collaborate with Lyra again through my work as a music teacher in the St. Paul Public Schools.Sincerely,Theresa J.

Alpha Kappa Psi Scholarship Fund	90293		/users/profile/102933	gopher_11	Donor	5	06/09/2011	I was a recipient of a scholarship from the Alpha Kappa Psi scholarship fund in 1993.  I went on to be involved in various levels with Alpha Kappa Psi, the Carlson School of Management, and the University of Minnesota.   I think this is a worthy charity to donate money to, because it promotes and offers opportunities to students in business of all socio-economic backgrounds.  There are multiple scholarships awarded each year, and almost 100% of the money invested goes toward scholarships. Consider this charity if you would like to see a student get an opportunity to be a part of the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management.  You can find out more at: http://www.akpsischolarships.com

Jade Foundation	40034	9	/users/profile/40969	jadewebmaster	Volunteer	5	05/22/2010	I have been a volunteer with the Jade Foundation for exactly 10 years this month, and what an amazing, fulfilling, joyful experience it continues to be! The Jade Foundation was created in 1999 by MN's then-First Lady Terry Ventura, named for her and Gov. Jesse Ventura's daughter Jade. Its mission is to provide funding to other small nonprofits in Minnesota that help children with disabilities and/or in other difficult life circumstances. I signed up as a volunteer because I was very eager to join with Terry, the Board members, and other volunteers to help raise money and visibility for kids in our state with special needs, and it has truly been one of the very best jobs I have ever had -- paid or volunteer! In the course of talking with grant recipients, I have heard so many profoundly wonderful and heartwarming reports about how their Jade Foundation grant has made a positive difference for the young people they serve. As just a few examples: several therapeutic horseback riding organizations have been able to open their facilities to more kids who need the services; a middle school in Stewartville was able to get a wheelchair-accessible restroom and lounge area built for their students; a clinic that serves the American Indian community in Minneapolis could buy a new vision-screening machine for very young children; an arts organization for people with disabilities could help kids with disabilities throughout the state participate in the arts; a mental health organization could start a support program for its clients; five high school students in tough circumstances got college scholarships, and a therapeutic preschool for kids with behavior disorders was able to keep providing necessary services! I can never say enough about how wonderful it is to have a role in helping to make these grants possible by raising money: I led a team for the Jade Foundation in the Headwaters Foundation's Walk for Justice from 2002-2007, and for the past 2 years, my spouse and I have used our run in the Twin Cities Marathon to raise money for the Jade Foundation; I also helped organize a couple of fundraising concerts in 2008 and 2009. And, of course I love sharing the news of how our grants have helped on our website! You should also know that the Jade Foundation is a volunteer-only organization. We have no paid staff at all, and very few other expenses. That means when you donate to us, your whole donation will go toward helping MN's kids with special needs through future grants!

Powder Puff Clown Club Of St Paul Inc	92261	1	/users/profile/105751	Tah-Dah	Board Member	5	06/27/2011	You can say we just "clown around", but it is so much more! We have been around almost 50 years starting out as a small group of women who wanted to clown but were not allowed in the other clubs simply because they were women. We now accept anyone 18 and over who wants to help us spread joy and healing through laughter. We attend many parades throughout the year from Forest Lake's 4th of July to St. Paul's Winter Carnival. We also perform at nursing homes and special events. We also entertain at charity events throughout MN and nearby WI including St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital Give Thanks. Walk, Sarah's Daisy Dash and Wishes & More. When I joined the group 7 or 8 years ago, I never thought I would get so much out of it. Seeing the joy in the wide-eyed child when they first see you, fills your heart and takes away the stress in your life. Seeing the little laugh from a "young-at-heart" kid sitting in his wheelchair watching you perform at his nursing home if a true gift. I know my favorite experience was the Earl Brown Parade in Brooklyn Park. A little girl came out in the street to hug me and when I talked to her, her mom darted my way. At first I thought I did something wrong as she was "challenged", but her mom wanted to translate as her little girl was deaf. I stopped our hug and had the litle girl stand in front of me and in sign language I told her how great a hugger she was and how beautiful she was and that she made my day. Her eyes and smile were the biggest I have ever seen and the tears filled her mom's eyes as we talked. I do not think I will ever forget that moment. Another moment was A parade in White Bear Lake when this little girl about 4 or 5 came out with a picture she colored for the clowns. Her little sweet voice said "Thank you" and Cleo handed it to me. I keep that gift from her to this day! What an Artist!It is a little bit of work and you drive all over the cities thru road construction, rain, snow, heat and below freezing temps, but the smiles, the joy and the laughter makes all those little things go away. Becoming a clown was the best decision I ever made!

Chaska Valley Family Theatre Inc	158628		/users/profile/210446	tstauber	Volunteer	5	05/23/2013	My family and I became involved with Chaska Valley Family Theatre 13 years ago and it has been one of the best things our family has ever done. We have had the opportunity to be on stage together, be backstage together, rehearse and play together. The cast and crew for each of the 3-4 shows per year change but the experience of having something we are all working toward . . . to entertain our friends and neighbors creates a tremendous sense of satisfaction for everyone involved. I ask myself, how many children get the opportunity to dare themselves to put on a costume and play alongside their parents and their parents adult friends? And how many adults dare to dream alongside their children. Growing facial hair or singing at the top of your lungs for the enjoyment of yourself and others . . . Too often people feel the need to make their children participate in a variety of different activities that neither include their siblings or their parents. They learn about self-needs above others. With Chaska Valley Family Theatre, our family has been blessed to learn about living and acting with others of all ages and to do it with our family. Laughing together, crying together but mostly spending quality time together and performing for others. Old or young, big or small, orange or blue . . .it doesn't matter. At CVFT, everyone is family. We are oh so grateful.

St Elizabeth Ann Seton School	122189		/users/profile/166370	Jon Calkins	Client Served	5	09/11/2012	St Elizabeth Ann Seton School is a faith based school that teaches the worldly teachings the public schools have to offer, e.g. Math, English, Social Studies, Health, Science, etc.  The differences between this school and the public schools is that this school teaches that God is not secondary to our worldly wants and desires.  The Pledge of Allegiance is taught and recited daily.  Respect, Love, Listening, Integrity, Faith and Trust are a few of the values each student is encouraged to discover and embrace.  I love this school and I think I would be a much better person had I had the opportunity to learn in such an environment.
Bbe Area Food Shelf Inc	274349		/users/profile/363739	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	12/13/2015	My late grandmother- Teddy Clark was one of the food shelf founders.  She saw a need in the community and made it happen.  As I child, I remember many afternoons going to the food shelf to help volunteer.  Teddy was known for helping out the workers that came up from the south to work in the fields.   There's even a story about a young family who came to the food pantry and when she found out they were sleeping in their car- she insisted they stay at her house.   She never locked the door as she would tell me- if they need it bad enough to steal, they need it more than me.  Please consider donating to this great charity and continue Teddy's tradition of helping those that need it most.  God Bless you!

WINDMILL ANIMAL RESCUE	96800	1	/users/profile/113105	Trevor2	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2011	I happened to come across Windmill Animal Rescue while I was doing a search on PetFinder. The shelter turned out to be nothing like I have ever seen. The shelter is considered a "cage free" shelter for all intensive purposes. I walked into an environment full of Cats and other animals, though the cats were the only animals roaming the facility it was a wonderful way to get to know the animals before you considered trying to adopt or sponsor them. Then, as I met some of the employees of Windmill, I was surprised further by their willingness to help find the right pet for you. They have so much experience with these animals that they are familiar with tendencies, likes and dislikes, and behavior patterns. I was able to get a formal introduction by name to each cat and a description of it they were child friendly, cat friendly, or dog friendly. The experience completely changed my perceptions on a how a shelter should be and their adoption process does wonders to eliminate rush purchases or "presents" of pets.

Customized Options Nonprofit	210805	5	/users/profile/273599	lizpete	Volunteer	1	08/15/2014	Beginning in 2012-Mar 2014, I worked first as a volunteer for Customized Options as a grant writer, and then as Treasurer and bookkeeper.  I had seen a presentation by Barb at ARC Minnesota yearly convention the year before, and was so impressed with her creativity and energy.  She had great ideas for getting work for people with disabilities (esp. autism) and several of her clients had mini-enterprises.  So I volunteered my time. At first, when filling out grant applications I could not get budgets and P&L's from the business and found myself at midnight the night before the final date helping her "make up" a budget and P&L from last year's 990.  When they asked me if I could serve as Treasurer, and later, financial officer, I jumped at the chance thinking that organizing this area of their business would make it possible for me to be more successful winning a grant.   This shifted to exploring grants for Board improvement as finding Board members was a consistent problem.  It seemed to me that Board structure was also a problem.  This organization is led by the Executive Director.  She has always been one of 3 - 5 Board members and maintained almost total control of the organization.  Budgets, plans and other Board functions rarely were discussed and I do not remember any votes on Budgets.  There were numerous reasons for not creating budgets.  The routine for producing a budget was never clearly outlined and the Treasurer (me) found herself accused of not producing reports that could lead to a budget when reports were regularly produced but results skewed due to the irregularlities of Minnesota State waiver funding policies.  So the Treasurer was advised to wait until the billings for the missing service agreements had been done (dependent on receiving the service agreements from the State) so the entries could be made into the software and the financials more correctly reflective of the income. There were arguments about who was at fault for these problems and the Board seemed to conclude that I was at fault.  On the other hand, I am not clear at all what else I should or could have done.  On the other hand, I urged them to create a budget based on a report I would make which gave projections for income in 2014.  Of course these projections might or might not be correct.  But it seemed to me that a budget of some kind should have been written by the Board in November 2013 and updated whenever new information about 2014 income would be available.  This was the advice I got from the bookkeeper advising me. Therefore I remained unsuccessful organizing the financial records.  I did file the reports, and I set up an online storage system which made it easy to file receipts, timecards, personnel records, and other financial information.   When I first started, few receipts were being recorded for expenditures.  While I worked as financial officer or bookkeeper, I was able to increase the amount of receipts recorded and entered in the software to almost 100%.  However in November 2013 the receipts dropped off to almost nothing.  The office was no longer faxing me receipts, and I was left to guess from bank records, VISA statements, and some bills that often did not come to me.  I made some attempts to get receipts sent to me again but failed. Closing out books was delayed due to confusion about how to enter work which was done but could not be billed due to missing service agreements due to problems with State Changes late November early December.  I asked for guidance but did not get direction until late February and then closed the books early March after most billings had been billed and paid.  I could have done it after the first billing (before payments were received) but didn't realize that.   Some of the problems I encountered were:   1) lack of time to talk with me.  (I tried to get the E.D. to commit to 45 minutes every two weeks at a time convenient to her but she refused.)  So questions I had often remained unanswered and oversight by the director was nonexistent.  I was on my own, a complete beginner in the financial world, although I did seek and receive advice from a contracted bookkeeper who was very helpful.   2) constant problems with staff.  This happens to organizations who depend on low-paid staff for direct care service, but our staff were extremely low-paid.  Our profit margin was quite small and we had problems training and overseeing the almost 50 staff we had with 2 supervisors. 3) director would get into long conversations about misbehaving staff, cute things our clients did, success our staff had, and anything else that was pleasant for us to talk with but would not work in an organized way to communicate with me.  At times she would not return my phone calls although this can be attributed to challenges she had with her own son.  But it left me on my own.   4) There were times that almost nothing I sent her was dealt with and later found in huge, disorganized piles of paper.  Things were late, held up, not dealt with at all at certain points.  I am not blaming the director; her plate was definitely overfull. 5) Director structured the organization so she was responsible for almost everything in the organization.  As time went on, she did find one trusted employee who was able to take over some of the administration, but it was minimal.  At that point, she began taking work away from me and giving it to him rather than using it to organize the business.   6) I had wanted to apply for an infrastructure grant that would help with Board members and Board responsibilities/structure first of all.  My biggest concern was that the entire organization was loaded onto the back of one person who was responsible, basically, for everything and who had a son who was subject to life-threatening illnesses and the severe autistic behavior issues.  Her income was low, she was a single parent, and the whole thing seemed to be hanging by a thread.  Her cousin was the Board Chairman and basically underwrote whatever she directed.  The Board consisted of almost always only employees of the organization (admin.) and one very interested parent of a client who finally resigned.  So I thought some support from the community would be very important, and the first step would be to get the Board doing its work with an option for a Chairman who was dedicated to the organization rather than mostly to the E.D..   Then the Board could decide to meet (apart from the E.D.'s directions) to create yearly budgets and make decisions independently from the E.D., while still accepting advice from the E.D.  This would remove a lot of responsibility from the E.D.   I guess my greatest concern was that the E.D. was not just an Executive Director but had control of the Board as well.  There was no dissension, no discussion.  At the end, I argued for what I thought the organization needed (yearly budgets, receipts/records of expenditures, and other things that the auditor may well want from us later on) and the focus was placed on the fact that I was late with the closing (on advice of the E.D., but this was not considered) and, since all the work had been removed from my responsibility, I had nothing left but to resign.   There was a small attempt to thank me for hard work (I had put in many hours of unpaid work) but at the end The Board Chairman (the E.D.'s cousin) and the E.D. both appeared very angry at me and have never communicated with me since.  This was personally a very big defeat for me.  My accuracy was high, I managed some extremely complex problems successfully, and there was no recognition of this fact.  I believe it was a highly complex bookkeeping system and neither the E.D. nor the office manager could understand it.  However I was simply following directions from the bookkeeper they hired to direct me who assured me my work was good.  In fact, she hired me to do some work for her a couple months later paying twice what I was paid as bookkeeper.  (I was paid only $14 / hour.)  I gave up a couple years of my own business to do this, because I believed in Customized Options and I believed in this E.D..   It was my mistake to believe I had the power to turn around the lack of organization and the structural problems which are keeping this business from moving forward.     
Maple Grove Lutheran Foundation	320259		/users/profile/412579	dstamas	Board Member	5	12/18/2016	Although the Foundation is supported by and is connected with Maple Grove Lutheran Church, it is a separate entity from the church and is not actually a religious organization, but is philanthropic in nature, supporting various local and global organizations including military support services, food shelves, disaster relief,  homeless youth, and other organizations providing aid to those in need.  The Foundation started as a memorial to two young men, members of the church, whose lives ended way too soon.  Jason and Blake's memories live on as the Foundation carries out its mission of encouraging and empowering the church in the spirit of Christian giving.   It also holds other fundraisers each year, including the annual golf tournament.

New Discoveries Montessori Academy	266960		/users/profile/355720	sundblad6	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2015	We have 4 children.   Ages 12,8,6 & 3.  Currently the older 3 children have been students at New Discoveries since 2013.  Next year, our youngest will be attending as well.   New Discoveries  is truly a unique school & we have been amazed by the schools Montessori teaching  methods with each of our children.  We moved to Hutchinson, so our children could attend this school.   Our oldest really struggled before in the traditional school methods at the old school.  We have seen tremendous growth with our oldest by switching schools. New Discoveries has been a blessing to our family.  We have seen so many positive results by switching to this school.  Our children have a new drive to learn & love going to school now.   This school is very family oriented.  We as parents have a better understanding by communicating with the school &  attending their Family Discovery Learning nights each month.   I would highly recommend this school.

Gift Of Adoption Fund Inc	148372		/users/profile/196536	Deborah53	Volunteer	5	01/22/2013	The GIft of Adoption provides families with funds to help defray the cost of adoption. As most qualified candidates have found, adopting a child is very expensive. Sometimes prohibitively so. This organization helps families by awarding $5000 "scholarships" to families trying to adopt children. The volunteers and the board of directors for this organization are devoted to this cause and work tirelessly raising funds so that more and more families can afford to adopt more children. WIth so many children in need of a "forever" home, I've have found this opportunity fulfilling. None of the people I've met get paid for their work or expertise, yet they give of themselves and their resources continuously.

This group helps children from all over the state of MN.  They are friendly, caring, and responsible.  When we went up to find out more about the Bridge the energy was bright and alive and Chelsea Miller was extremely helpful and appreciative.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association	125497	1	/users/profile/170698	Mich2849	Donor	2	10/15/2012	This organization employees 14 people.  Very little of their donations go for research.  The ED is paid more than other nonprofits who raise millions, i.e.  Union Gospel Mission.  The ED of UGM makes less than the ED for this nonprofit.  When I donate, I donate ONLY to research!  You can also donate to programs that help support those who have ALS, i.e. the Courage Center program.  Donate to the Courage Center and direct it to the ALS program.  It is important to find a cure and more dollars need to go to research!

ROSEVILLE STRING ENSEMBLE	57463		/users/profile/60721	Linda O.	Board Member	5	11/19/2010	This small community orchestra has achieved incredible things in its 11 years of existence through the energy and passion of its amateur players, its conductors and its volunteers. I believe the connections we create within the group and with the audience shine through in our performances, and form the foundation for our success.The orchestra suffers from being a relatively obscure musical group in a metropolitan area blessed with dozens of professional and amateur orchestras. We create high-quality music that's well-targeted to our suburban audience and accessible to many people, and we deserve to be better-known. We could use more "friends" to help us spread the word and help us gain more financial support!

At first, he attended a one week session at camp because it was " FUN".  Since then, he has grown to recognize that camp is an opportunity to grow in his faith, learn life skills, and meet lifelong friends.  As a parent, I could not be prouder that with all the opporutunities that are available to kids, my son chooses to spend his summer at CYC where he can surround himself with positive role models who share his desire to grow in faith and become better people.  Keep up the great work !!!!

Volunteers are a mix of open-minded women from all ages and backgrounds. Training only took about 10 minutes before I was reading letters and filling orders for education, self-help, spirituality, fiction, parenting, and every other kind of resource. Since starting, I've learned a lot about prisons, the women in them, the worth of a book, and the power of connection.

Working along side the residents, staff and community partners has been exceptional.  Seeing the challenges, triumphs and everyday-joys these single mothers experience has been eye-opening and inspirational.  The amazing, female residents work double-duty to ensure better opportunities in the lives of their children.  In turn, they improve the quality of life in the communities around them and they reduce the need for assistance through tax-paid programs.

This group facilitates a broad spectrum of creative experiences for people with limited accessibility and will use their resources well.
Braveheart Rescue Corporation	40891	1	/users/profile/41778	thomas6	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/27/2010	Braveheart Rescue, Inc. is the most productive animal rescue organization I have seen.  While no IRS report is on file yet, virtually every cent goes to saving lives.  What doesn't go directly to them goes to paying their overhead costs.On a shoestring budget and with the help of dedicated volunteers, Brandi Tracy, the president, takes in and rehabilitates dogs that have been scheduled to die in other shelters.Her specialty is working with dangerous dogs that need intensive care.  In the five acres of fenced-in beautiful wooded surroundings, these dogs heal and learn to trust humans and to be healthy dogs.This is not just a rescue but a shelter, healing center, and, for some, a permanent sanctuary.
Barebones Productions	130889		/users/profile/176400	Mark Safford	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	Barebones has been creating spirited puppet shows for the last 20 years . There is delightful mix of whimsey intention and amazing volunteer vigor displayed by participants in this beautiful spectacle driven art form surreal and as Max Sparber refered to it as a kind of absinth dream. Gorgeous moments blend in a myriad of different shows from aerialists pouring ingredients up into the sky or ravenous Giant Baby heads swallowing people ,twenty foot swans pecking each other to death in a spell of fear or Flaming swan boat on the Mississippi. My life is so much richer for these moments and those who have shared them.

Surprisingly, I was also given a job opening notice for which I will apply.  Four needs met in fourteen minutes. . . must be some kind of a record!

The state dept of education, MN, has cited this school on two occasions for using unlicensed staff posing as licensed teachers, two staff acting as teachers were aids.

Artspace Projects Inc	31661	9	/users/profile/32528	dhenna	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2010	In the 1980s my wife and I were both heavily involved in the arts scene in Saint Paul, MN in several ways.  I first learned of Artspace through her job with the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council and discovered an organization that was transforming warehouse space downtown into work and living spaces for visual artists.  I became even more aware of this when I started working for the Saint Paul Department of Planning and Economic Development where one of my colleagues was assigned to helping develop artist spaces.  Later, I managed the Saint Paul portion of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Home Tour, and helped place a new artist housing project created by this organization  as a unique stop on the tour.  All the while, I was acting in the evenings at Park Square Theatre which consulted with Artspace several times as it gradually expanded its performing space to different venues.  I'm amazed and very pleased this organization -- which started as simply a way to help artists through the technical maze of rehabilitating spaces into viable studios and homes -- is now working on a national scale to provide infrastructure for the arts and revitalization for many communities.

I had an accident in my home, and broke my shoulder, and was off work for eight months. My short term disability was utilized (which was not very much to live on), and barely was able to keep my head above water.  I was in a very low place in my life. I was really struggling to meet my medical  bills, and particularly my rent, and my situation was becoming alarmingly dismal. had called all my creditors and they extended some grace time, but my time was drastically diminishing. I have very wonderful and supportive friends, and one particular person continually urged me to contact the Beacon Foundation. I have so much pride, and I did not want to reach out and seek outside help, because I consider myself a very independent woman. But at the urging of Beacon Foundation volunteers, I reluctantly asked for help.  I did submit my application, and thankfully received the help which I so desperately was seeking. I was able to accommodate by basic bills, and bring my utilities current. I cannot express my appreciation in words, and will be eternally grateful for the great impact Beacon Foundation has made on my life. With the help you provided, I could breathe, and able to  concentrate on getting back to health and healing. Thank you for all provided the funding and the excellent guidance of those who represent the Beacon Foundation.

Geek Partnership Society	145863		/users/profile/192458	wmamurphy	Board Member	5	12/04/2012	Twin Cities: When these geeks do yoga, it's loud and often in costumeSt. Paul Pioneer Press 11/1/2012Remember those nerdy kids who were miserable in gym class? Well, they've grown up and started their own gym class. Called Geek Physique, it's a Twin Cities-based club that aims to pry the techy/sci-fi/comic book/gamer/fantasy community away from their computer screens and virtual worlds with fitness activities that have a geeky spin. Imagine taking that viral YouTube video of the kid practicing his light saber moves and reinterpreting it as a workout. That would be Geek Physique. A subset of the Twin Cities-based Geek Partnership Society, Geek Physique is organized through Meetup.com and boasts about 450 members. The club tries to put on event every three days, according to organizer Kerry McCartney of St. Paul. Club activities have included Nerf dart tag and archery sessions with targets featuring sci-fi characters like the villainous Daleks from Dr. Who or the irritating Jar Jar Binks from the Star Wars franchise. There have been belly dancing classes with sci-fi theme music and Klingon Batl'leth training, using foam rubber versions of the fearsome edged weapons featured in the Star Trek universe. There's also been disc golf. "It's kind of geeky in itself, so we don't put much of a spin on that," McCartney said. But one of the most popular Geek Physique offerings has been Yoga Quest, a mashup of role playing, fan fiction and yoga. Yoga Quest sessions start with a script written by club member Jenny Milos of Woodbury, inspired by geeky themes that can range from Harry Potter to Monty Python to Xena: Warrior Princess. During the class, McCartney, typically dressed in costume, narrates the script while Minneapolis yoga instructor Justine Mastin leads the exercisers through yoga poses inspired by the characters. "We have a tribute to Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' coming out," McCartney said. "I'll be wearing a turtle neck and a corduroy jacket and doing my worst Carl Sagan imitation." Mastin said she got the idea for Yoga Quest while attending the Twin Cities' CONvergence science fiction convention a couple of years ago and wondered how to make yoga more palatable to sci-fi fans. "Geeks need yoga," she said. But according to Milos, many geeks are happy to grapple with dungeons and dragons, but they wouldn't be caught dead in a regular yoga class. "Geeks get bored very, very quickly," McCartney said. Then Mastin wondered what would happen if you took yoga poses out of the studio and set them in the middle of a Tolkien novel. "What if you are in Middle-earth and you are the tree?" Mastin said. The result is a form of yoga that punctures the solemn serenity of the typical yoga class. For example, vocal participation has become a tradition in Yoga Quest, with participants mooing during the cow pose, meowing in cat pose, barking in downward dog and for some reason, quacking during the crescent moon pose. "A lot of yoga studios don't like you to kid around," McCartney said. "We take the yoga seriously, but we don't take anything else particularly seriously." Costumes are welcome at Yoga Quest sessions, which are held in part of a converted warehouse space in Northeast Minneapolis. About 30 self-proclaimed geeks showed up for a recent session that featured a screening of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" choreographed to yoga poses. There were a lot more fishnet stockings than your average yoga class. There was also a woman in a "Ghostbusters" outfit, a man in a satin leopard print toga and a woman dressed as animated character Rainbow Brite. "This is an excuse to do yoga and be a dork at the same time," said Jesse Van Gunst, who came to the Rocky Horror yoga show wearing a toy chain saw attached to his hand in tribute to the "Evil Dead" film franchise. "Most other yoga classes are 'om'-y or boring, where this is more ridiculous and more animal sounds," said Kearn Kirkwood, a computer programmer. "It makes exercising entertaining and it ends up being yoga in which you laugh during the entire thing."

We screen the new adoptive parents and try to match the adoptive animal to the families as not all animals are good for all types of  families.  Within the past year we have become active on Petfinders and on FB.  We have decreased our time "in house" by 50% due to social media awareness.  We have also increased our adoption rate overall by +30% allowing us to help more of our 4 legged charges.  We are 100% volunteer run and operated and live by the generosity of our community.  Any and all improvements to date(13 years) are donated material and volunteer labor.

I am 32 years old and a single mom to four young children - ages 8, 7 and 6 year old twins. The father of my 4 children and I came to Glorybound over 7 years ago - I was pregnant with my twins at the time... I walked through Glorybound's doors not even really knowing much about their ministry - it was a Friday evening; there were families and children bustling around everywhere! Sharon was cooking a turkey dinner for the families and it smelled so good! I was taken back at first, by the warmth and kindness of everyone around me - I had just walked in, unannounced  - and yet, everyone was so inviting! Sharon asked us all to stay for dinner after doing an intake with my family. We felt awkward and embarrassed, but Sharon and her husband John put us right at ease.We went home that night with 2 bags of groceries and hygiene items, as well as a buscard for Daniel (children's father) to get to his new job.We were shown so much love ! And by complete strangers! We bagan to regularly attend Glorybound on Friday nights. Because we didn't have a car, Glorybound picked us all up every week - and continued to pick us up - even when we moved clear across town! Over the years, Glorybound has been a family to me! They helped continually with food, milk vouchers, hygiene items, bus cards, holiday assistance and transportation. And most importantly - they nourished our souls with the Word of God. Sharon, John (rest in Peace) and their son Jeff are GENUINE Christian people!I love this ministry and don't know where I'd be without it!

Child Care Resource And Referral Inc	93581		/users/profile/107744	Patty T.	Board Member	5	07/07/2011	As a board member for the past 3 years and as a public health who visits families with young children, I have been impressed with the function of all aspects of this organization  as they search and apply for new opportunities to serve Olmsted County better. About two years ago, they applied and were granted the opportunity to start an Early Headstart program in our city. The timeline for the grant and then the startup of this program was very short but the staff worked diligently and served many low income families with it. As a public health nurse in this county, I have watched children and their parents' lives be transformed by attending Early Headstart. Also when southeastern Minnesota flooded two summers ago, this organization quickly applied for a flood recovery grant to assist their daycare providers in the stricken area so that they could return to providing daycare as quickly as possible. Their Crisis Nursery services are timely and excellent in their prompt response to requests for childcare. Some of my families have used them with rather short notice.

Arrive Ministries	292859		/users/profile/383418	RJbrown	Volunteer	3	06/13/2016	Arrive Ministries, formally World Relief MN, is an organization of passionate individuals who apply their expertise to helping resettle refugees in MN. Many of the staff consider it their life purpose to work there, and this is very evident in the strong efforts they take to keep donors aware of their successes as well as their needs. Several staff members have served in other countries and visited refugee camps, so they can empathize well with the refugees they meet. They also serve as liaisons and advocates between the refugees and the Minnesotans who might feel concern over internationals moving into their neighborhoods. They successfully walk the sometimes-difficult line of helping enough to get refugees on their feet and over-assisting; the results is that refugees are not dependent on Arrive and have all the tools they need for live in MN. If I were a refugee coming to MN, after facing much trauma and displacement, I would be so blessed to be in their hands. As a donor and as a volunteer I feel appreciated when the executive director makes personal connections with me over social media, with hand-written notes, and conversations and greetings at events. I trust them as experts in their field to advise me as I volunteer and to use my donations where needed most. Arrive ministries is doing a great job serving the refugee community and those who volunteer with its members.

Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative	271893	1	/users/profile/360803	bashstpaul	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2015	Beacon Interfaith, formerly Plymouth Church Neighborhood Foundation, builds and operates low income housing in Minnesota.  The original name of the organization came from Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis where it was started as a mission project of the church to help the people in the neighborhood of the church.  After a few years the members decided to leverage their expertise and experience in their many fields of employment to create and operate non-profit housing for low income people.What makes Beacon unique in the field of non-profit low income housing, aside from their dedication to providing safe housing and services that meet the individual needs of people to help them to reintegrate into community with positive impact on the surrounding neighborhoods, is their Congregational Partnership model of creating housing.  Without neglecting any opportunity to work with any interested party, Beacon concentrates on working with congregations to maximize the strengths and capabilities of faith congregations to create housing that meets the needs of the communities served by those congregations.  There are many ways to contribute your hard earned money to meet the needs of low income people, but very few that have done such a superb job of putting your contributions to such effective use.

You know, when your child tells you they see spirits and you wonder if it's all true, since you don't see a thing.  Well this kind of vision comes from the perspective of a child  when trusting the heart, which lives in the Spirit of the Lake People (Sioux).  Returning to our souls around the world is an awakening vision and dreams for all of us.  Saving the Dakota languages will help bring about evolutionary treasures (wopida or the gift) .  If we rescue the languages it's just one step in rescuing other important treasures of the Great Sioux Nations. Today this language is the fastest growing indigenous language in the world, because inside our hearts we know something is real and important, to where treasures are buried. Let us uncover together to explore the vast richness of the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota heavenly knowledge today! your devoted servant, White Buffalo Calf Woman your Twin Deer Mother Prays for your return!

There really isn't an outlet for Hmong youth to express their creative side in an environment that understands their situation. CHAT provides the space for this.

Men As Peacemakers	169753		/users/profile/224980	Joel13	Volunteer	5	09/14/2013	Following the Women's Movement and concern for the magnitude of USA issue with domestic violence, this group has supported mentoring sports, mentoring in schools to assure men grow up to think of shared power and fairness.Work with sentencing circles (community alternative to courtroom) sentencing for participants in domestic violence.I was able to join two groups of young shoplifters as they had a choice between a sentence or joined a circle to enhance their awareness of shoplifting's effects in the workplace, schools and their futures. Men As Peacemakers has an ongoing need for community members who have been affected by shoplifting: this includes clerks, business owners and indeed, all of us. Give Peacemakers a call to help out for this short intervention. If parents are not able or available to youth, mentoring needs to come from us.

Gitchi-Gami Trail Association Inc	220550		/users/profile/284212	amck	Board Member	5	10/07/2014	I joined the Gitchi-Gami Trail Association as a life member when I first learned of its existence. I have long felt that a paved trail along Lake Superior's North Shore would be an important addition to the wonderful recreational opportunities in the area, as well as a boon to tourism, and a critical means of safe travel along the busy Highway 61 corridor. Now that several segments are in place, it's great to see how many people use it for walking, biking, roller-skiing, and blading. The trail won't be finished in my lifetime, but I look forward to its incemental progress and hope that it will continue to receive support.

Joy Project	44681	6	/users/profile/45592	pooh-bear	Client Served	5	06/21/2010	I started going to the Joy Project's free support group after I developed an eating disorder. The facilitators and group members were full of amazing advice on how to go about getting the right treatment and they supported me when some of the medical providers I saw didn't. The website, joyproject.org also provided very useful information that I could not have found at any of the other eating disorder help sites.As my eating disorder worsened I developed full-blown PTSD so that my life was a complete nightmare. Because of this, I could not begin recovery unless I got inpatient or residential treatment. I was rejected by one treatment center because my physical status wasn't considered dangerous (yet). Then I was sent to a psych ward and (incorrectly) told I had OCD, not an eating disorder. All of this could have been enough for me to give up and just lose more weight until I was sick enough for them, BUT the Joy Project was there to help me through this scary and humiliating situation until I found a treatment center that took my condition seriously. I have since recovered and now serve as a volunteer with the Joy Project, where we are reaching more and more people like me.
The Family Partnership	247207		/users/profile/334706	AnnSomers	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/02/2015	I am wowed by the innovative and cutting-edge work of The Family Partnership in changing lives in our community.  The Family Partnership often works behind the scenes so may not be the headlines, but they have  impact in every major story affecting children and families today: the gaping achievement gap; child protection tragedies and anti-sex trafficking advances; immigration; affordable health care and mental health concerns; Gay Marriage and Transgender awareness. Staff and supporters have worked with communities for decades, sometimes generations on these critical issues that are so essential to creating healthy lives.   AND The Family Partnership has just been chosen as one of ten human service organizations in the United States to take part in Change in Mind: Applying Neurosciences to Revitalize Communities, an exciting new initiative of the Alliance for Strong Families and Communities. Change in Mind is a three-year initiative of the, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the Norlien Foundation. It will demonstrate the larger, more impactful role of the nonprofit sector as educator, convener, advocate, and true influencer of getting appropriate systems aligned to the science. The initiative will identify, support, and evaluate the processes that the 15 organizations in the U.S. and Canada will use to align the science with the goal of influencing systems to impact outcomes across the life course. This work will help to infuse, align, and accelerate established neuro-science research into practice and policies to benefit children and families in Minnesota and be shared with the Alliance for learning across US and Canada. Data for this review was derived from The Family Partnership staff news and press release (award).

Opportunity Matters Inc	4950	8	/users/profile/6703	kengossett	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2009	St. Cloud Areas Opportunity Manor Inc. was established in 1980 by its parent company, Opportunity Training Center (OTC), to meet St. Clouds emerging housing needs for people with disabilities. During its first 13 years in business, Opportunity Manor Incorporated provided these services to 24 people served at two 12-bed Intermediate Care Facilities in the St. Cloud Area of Stearns and Sherburne Counties. A shift toward smaller residential settings, introduced by the government in 1994, provided the necessary incentive for Opportunity Manor to expand its programs by adding four 4-bed facilities in Stearns and Benton County during 1994 -1995.Opportunity Manor could now afford to be more proactive in its residential growth management, and scope of services, so it decided to expand by offering day programming to its existing residential clients and clients from the larger community. Opportunity Manor decided to reach out to a growing community of seniors experiencing physical and mental changes due to dementia-related diseases. One of Opportunity Manors greatest resources is its staff; a staff well suited to assist seniors with changing physical capabilities often associated with dementia. The staff is also highly effective at designing personalized programming and assessing client abilities. OMI determined that it could best serve this population and region by offering a day program for seniors with mild to moderate memory loss. The program, named Golden Opportunities, opened for business in July, 2006.Further progress took place in the fall of 2006. OMI opened Christensen House, a four-bed waiver home in St. Joseph, MN in October 2006 which was named after the late CEO, Jim Christensen.  The organization is now operating at their preferred capacity, serving 70 individuals at 17 sites. Program DiversificationWith the stabilization of the residential services, Opportunity Manor Inc. could begin to diversify and seek opportunities to serve more people living in the community.  Identifying an unmet need, the organization created a new transitional learning and day programming. In 2005, a new 7,500 square foot facility opened in Sartell to house Opportunity Manors administrative offices and Pathway to Opportunities (PTO).  PTO opens up a world of opportunities to people with disabilities by teaching independence through Transitional Learning; teaching techniques that simulate natural environments and emphasize peer learning, and opportunities to demonstrate newly learned skills in a normal environment to lock in confidence.  PTO clears the way to personal independence by designing programming to meet an individuals learning needs.  The curriculum is outcome based and includes varying skill paths including: social skills, challenging behaviors, money management, effective communication, job readiness, employment responsibilities, community integration and much more. Once only a dream, this program now serves 22 clients with plans for continued growth in 2009. In June 2006, Golden Opportunities, a day program for seniors experiencing early to moderate memory loss and dementia related illness was created.  Golden Opportunities connects people with memory loss-related needs to the services and caring support necessary to help them live at home as long as possible. Families of the loved ones experiencing these unique mental (and often physical) challenges will find their partnership with Golden Opportunities gives them full or part time relief from their day time care responsibilities.  The program currently serves 5 people with the capacity to grow to serve 20 families.  Opportunity Manors entrepreneurial skills, combined with their respected human service competencies, were identified as strengths when the board and staff participated in a two year capacity building program through the Central Minnesota Initiative Foundations, Healthy Organization Program, (HOP).  The two-step process, started in late 2005, strengthened the boards governing process, reaffirmed the mission and vision, and created a 5 year strategic plan. Additionally, this capacity building process encouraged staff to look at new opportunities to build the organizations capacity such as launching services for individuals with memory loss issues and working with the senior population who may not have a developmental disability.In January of 2008 OMI developed its Volunteer program to enrich the lives of our clients and build relationships with our community. The volunteer program has numerous volunteers from the local community as well as the surrounding schools and colleges working one on one with the clients to improve their daily living and independence skills.  Some of the opportunities people volunteer for range from activities assistant to mentoring to direct care. The program has grown dramatically in the last year and continues to provide our clients with outside interaction and brings an element of happiness to their lives on a regular basis.  A group of volunteers had 10 garden boxes made for the sites and the main office.  Another volunteer made shirt covers for the clients that saved the company over $300 if they had to be purchased.  In the first year, over 40 volunteers have contributed over 2000 service hours at an estimated value of $42,000 of service to consumers of OMI.Mission and GoalsOpportunity Manor Incorporated exists so that the people with mental and/or physical challenges can live independent, fulfilling, and healthy lives in the community. To that end the people served by OMI will:    Maximize their independence in terms of self-care, mobility, and decision-making, taking into account their personal goals, safety and level of confidence.    Experience personal fulfillment and acceptance through:    A. An enjoyable home life    B. Rewarding work experiences    C. Satisfying recreation    D. Connections with the larger community         E. Have the competencies and support necessary to secure and maintain employment should that be the clients goal.    Receive the support from families, caregivers, employers and friends to be accepted as contributing members of society.    Achieve growth over 5 years in the number of individuals served through all OMI programming.Collaborations:Opportunity Manors growth over the years is directly related to networking and collaborating with a wide variety of social service programs, civic organizations, city councils, related businesses, granters and neighbors.

Lundstrum Performing Arts	107288		/users/profile/145275	mdavidovich85	Professional with expertise in this field	2	02/29/2012	This past January, I unfortunately had to end my business relationship as an acting teacher with the Lundstrum Center for the Performing Arts.  In my experience there, the managing director and the artistic director have made decisions that have compromised the quality of the programs and also have proven to run a disorganized business. Ultimately, it was through a very poorly handled renegotiation of my contract that made my decision to leave final, but there have been many factors that have made it difficult to work with the Lundstrum Center and their goal of being an innovative and supportive training ground for musical theatre performance: - Business matters had been passed around between the artistic director, the managing director, and the business manager, never being clear about who is the point of contact or ultimately responsible for these matters.- The artistic director offered little support for the strengthening of the acting component of students training; the dancing component seemed to always supersede.- The semester showcase was ultimately a poor example of the students work and forced teachers to work on product and not process. - My classroom space was occasionally used as costume storage, for the showcase, making it difficult to have a consistent and comfortable space.- The use of microphones during the showcase not only is an insult to my voice and speech work with the students, it sends the wrong message to students who are learning how to use their voice in the theatre.- I have had little support from the artistic director in dealing with behavior issues and attendance issues.- An overall sense of disorganization, disrespect, and an unclear goals from the leadership staff.  The students there are a joy to be around and work with, but its not fair that their potential is diminished by certain individuals.  I have sent this same information to the Board of Directors in the hope that they reevaluate their leadership staff at the Lundstrum Center.

American Baptist Homes Of The Midwest	193520		/users/profile/167285	Gary11	Client Served	1	01/30/2014	I'm currently a resident at the Franklin Park Home in Denver and while the nursing staff is good I have been subjected to terrible treatment by the administrator. I was briefly at another care facility for rehabilitation after hospitalization. I had a roommate that smeared poop on the walls and ate it. Again, this was at this other facility. There was exposed to all kids of germs through that whole episode. I was hospitalized several times. Because I reported this terrible facility I am treated like I can't be trusted to not report Franklin Park. i feel it is mentally abusive and it certainly is drain on me and has impacted my care on some more rare occasions. My health is certainly impacted to some degree because of the stress. I am treated as though there is something wrong with me because I made this report to the Colorado State Health Department about another unrelated facility, Sable Care Center. The administrator, with other staff present, stated that the only reason I was treated with such suspicion was because I reported the other facility. It had dozens of complaints against it by other residents. The current treatment at Franklin Park is humiliating and demeaning. All this has happened because of the Administrator's paranoia. I have asked repeatedly to not be treated this way, but the administrator insists that because of this report she will not change any of this treatment. NOW I CAN'T EAT ANYTHIG BECAUSE THEY WON'T GIVE ME THE RIGHT FOOD AFTER SURGERY

We are a family struggling financially to keep our child in the WACS system. He has been with WACS for 7years but last year my wife lost her job. We asked to be put on the list for financial aid from the "adopt a student" fundraiser and the business office told us "no" because we were not making regular monthly payments (although we do pay what we can and make full use of the SCRIP program). In addition to this WACS is raising it's tuition next year by approx $900. We will not be able to afford to send our child. This is very sad as we are both Cotter Alums and fully intended on raising our child in the WACS system. I think this is WACS administrations way of "weeding out" the "poor families".

WIRED 4 LIFE	63954	1	/users/profile/68883	Harlan W.	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	Wired4Life is one of the few organizations that cares so much about their mission that they willingly reach out to other nonprofits to offer assistance. When our organization was searching for information regarding help for a man whose dog needed a pacemaker, Dawn Huberty the founder of Wired4Life found our answer and didn't hesitate to share. They have since become one of our most steadfast health partners.  Thanks Dawn, Harlan, For Paws Hospice

Ave Maria Academy	19493	8	/users/profile/20703	Faith12	Volunteer	5	10/23/2009	This school is amazing! Small class sizes, great academics, above average test scores and a wonderful family feel.  The best decision my husband and I made was to send our children to Cedarcrest Academy. The academic and spiritual formation that our children are receiving is incredible. The mission of this school is not just words on a piece of paper...they are striving to achieve it every day with every child. The school encourages parent participation in both children's events and adult events. We have a lot of fun families...families that I would love my children to grow up around. The teachers are incredible too. They want to be there and they want to teach and inspire our kids to be the best they can be. It is a great school!

Minnesota Shopping Center Association	81415		/users/profile/89118	taahirkhan	Donor	5	03/08/2011	Men's Back to School FashionDont go gold - If you are a rapper or just love to bling then go ahead, but if this so called gold is big and looks fake odds are it probably is. Leave it behind and find something that is not as gawdy like a stainless steel necklace with a steel tribal cross.It's Not Too Late for Summer - Summer is almost over but accessory trends tend to run a little late in the year. If you are still wearing a surfer necklace that you bought for the lake or beach, rock it out! Hemp and corded necklaces look good all year long.Go Neutral but Unique - There are multiple accessories that are very neutral, but can still be very unique. The cross necklace is probably the best example of this overlooked, yet simple and effective accessory. It is pretty much accepted that the cross necklace is one of the most common pieces of jewelry around, however with new tribal designs and many masculine variations to choose from you can still have a very unique and attractive look. All of this while adding a neutral and the accepting look off amiliarity.http://www.yalla2shop.com/

I have visited many history museums and some military museums elsewhere in the country, and this is clearly one of the best in terms of how the storylines are written, quality of exhibit layouts, and  artifacts displayed.   I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about the military and Minnesota's role in it.
Minnesota Family Council	133161	2	/users/profile/178863	Travis3	General Member of the Public	1	11/03/2012	This organization is a disgrace to their own cause. Earlier today I received a phone call from them. I asked the volunteer if she could help me to understand something. She agreed. When I asked my question she hung up on me. I then posted a comment about my experience on their Facebook page.  Within 20 minutes they had deleted my comment and blocked me from reposting. The comment is as follows: "You have set up your page in such a way that it is not possible to write an individual post so I will post my comment here instead. If you believe as I do that marriage is a sacred religious institution than why would you want the government to have anything to do with it? When government passes laws respecting the institution of marriage it cheapens marriage and makes it a legal tool. We need to get government out of marriage, not further extend their reach into our lives and religions. Why is government involved in marriage in the first place? I received a phone call from your volunteer earlier today and asked her this question. She hung up on me! I was very polite to her so she had no reason to do so. If you and your volunteers are incapable of having an open conversation about your position than what does that say about your position? "

Sunny Hollow Montessori	10706	2	/users/profile/12604	pmidden	Board Member	5	09/22/2009	Sunny Hollow is a wonderful school that adheres to the ideals and objectives originally developed by Maria Montessori and carried on through AMI.  Children at Sunny Hollow are not taught so much as given the opportunity to learn.  Sunny Hollow has environments for children from age 33 months through 12 years old.  Both my children have attended Sunny Hollow and they have learned to function on their own and have learned how to help other children achieve their goals at the same time.  The Montessori experience helps children understand the big picture of what they are doing.  As a result I had to change how I talk to my children, I no longer need to slowly give them one step or one piece of the picture at a time.  I can speak them as if they are older than they really are, tell them what our objectives are, and give them multi-step instructions to get there without overwhelming them.
Make-A-Wish Foundation Of Minnesota	251610		/users/profile/339572	Giampaolo	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	Make a Wish's mission says it all: "We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy". You will believe that the first time you look at the smile of a child who discovers that his/her wish has been granted or is at the airport waiting to board the plane that will bring him/her to their chosen destination. Priceless! In addition to that, Make A Wish is a great place to volunteer: the staff is awesome and friendly, other volunteers are great, and there are many volunteer roles that fit almost anyone's interests. It is definitively a great place to volunteer with a wonderful mission! Highly recommended

Starbase Minnesota Inc	8958	7	/users/profile/10742	Anita	Volunteer	5	08/10/2009	This was a wonderful camp  probably the best STEM program Ive seen.    I would definitely vote this as a Best Practice for STEM camps.   Here's why:i.  The kids were totally transformed into a very different environment.   Everything from parking in a lot next to giant military planes, to entering the lobby with space murals on the walls and an astronaut suspended overhead, to the classrooms decorated in space motif  there was definitely a were not in Kansas feel to the camp.   Right away you knew that something very different was possible.ii.  The kids were made instantly a part of the flight culture.   Everyone had a new nickname or call sign.   This assumption that they were already in and therefore already possessing the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform was amazing.   My son was no longer the kid who hated to do math, he was now Dark Wing the astronaut-in-training, who needed to do math because that is what is needed for the mission.  They held to these call names until the last day, when their civilian identities were unveiled.iii.  The teachers wore flight uniforms that looked like they came right from NASA.   This set the teachers apart as someone special, which of course, they are.iv.  Inquiry learning:   Start with a problem  how to build a rocket.   Ask  what do we need to know?   Divide the work into different chunks and go for it!   This is how science and math should be taught!!!    There is no right or wrong, only problems, facts, observations, assumptions and opinions.   The Starbase instruction helps kids to recognize these buckets and what to do with each.   I really believe that most problems come about from people not understanding the difference between these things.v.  The camp was subdivided into groups and each group had a different piece of the mission.   Wow  this is just like the real world!   The kids needed to not only come to a conclusion, but present their conclusion to the other groups.   Very clever!   There was also a nice balance between teamwork and individual work.vi.  Great curriculum:   The teachers were knowledgeable and used a nice mix of lecture, inquiry, video clips, experimentation, etc., etc.vii.  Scientist/Engineer show-and-tell:   Its important for kids to see how everything they have learned is applied in the real world every day.  I thought it was great to have engineers/scientists come to the camp on Wednesday for a bit of shop talk with the kids.  Who would have thought that what you need to know about pressure, force and thrust for space flight is the same stuff that you need to know to make Cheerios?viii.  Graduation ceremony was a big thing, again emphasizing that the kids had learned something special. That was the "parent perspective".  Here is the impact this experience had on my child.   a.  He has always liked space, but never really believed me when I told him that he needed to know a lot of math to be an astronaut or even an astronomer.   Now he knows first-hand what is needed.  He use to complain all the time about how he hated math.   Now he talks about how much he loves math, even though it is sometimes hard.   When he encounters a problem he use to whine about it.   Now all I have to do is say:  Dark Wing  think like a scientist and his whole attitude changes.   This is pretty profound!b.  He is counting down to the year 2035 and has already figured out that he is the perfect age to train for being the first human to set foot on Mars.

Community Involvement Programs	228196	4	/users/profile/291892	DisgustedbyCIP	Client Served	1	10/28/2014	In the face of severe mental illness and homelessness I was offered housing and mental health services via Community Involvement Programs. Between 2007 and 2013 I experienced serious and flagrant violations of my personal, psychiatric and basic human rights. The Executive Director permitted inaccurate record keeping, verbal abuse by staff, primarily the Director of Mental Health Services and her subordinate assistant. This assistant, who has no medical or mental health training, oversees the mental health services of housing recipients and withdrew all my supports without explanation.  Despite the involvement of the mental health ombudsman I was unable to access my records, and the ones I did get were filled with inaccuracies, lacked signatures, contained records of another individual, and in one document my therapist verified that her signature had been forged. Powerful organization, however. Not one of my documented complaints was acted on. Mentally ill persons lack the currency necessary to access real protection. Keep your loved ones away from this organization.
Sos Rescue Relief Inc	113496	4	/users/profile/154438	Mizt340	Volunteer	5	06/01/2012	This organization is a new approach to the adoption of rescued animals. The Adopt a Pet store was started by two passionate animals lovers and embodies the very best in animal adoptions. Their facility is set up as a welcoming and homey atmosphere where someone wishing to obtain a new "family member" can stop by and see the prospective pets.  The main objective is to offer a place for rescue groups to display available animals in a comfortable and spotlessly clean setting.  The owners are extremely knowledgable about the health and wellness of the pets offered and the animals are vet checked, in good health and  ready for their new homes.  This is the very best place to find that new "baby" for your family without going to a pet store and encouraging the cruel breeding of animal mills without regard to the health of the animals.

Acronym HTM they do a lot of ministry on a shoestring budget.Providing clean clothing is important-it takes $8.00 to wash and dry a load of clothing in the inner city-the poor just don't have that kind of money. A hot meal provides not only nutrition but also social contact. A service that includes and provides the homeless an avenue is so important. Due to their situation they are cut off from socialization and feel rejected. Coming to services help them to reconnect  and gives them the feeling of belonging. HTM Food Shelves provide food to the hungry without income guidelines. Those who do not qualify for food stamps need help more than ever. Most households only need food 1 or 2 months and are back on their feet. Most important to help these working people so they don't fall because of a car breaking down or a health bill.Get involved - you will enjoy it.

Hmr Hmong Mn Radio	142671		/users/profile/173050	cp2012	General Member of the Public	3	11/26/2012	This is a review on behalf of my parents. They listen to this station all day, everyday. They do not speak English very well so they get their news from this radio station. They cover a range of things from News story headlines, health issues facing the Hmong community, political awareness, and of course play Hmong music; both traditional to new music. It started that my parents would annoy me by blasting this station throughout the house but now, I've come to like it and listen to it too. Some translations could be better, some things to get lost in translation but for the most part, it's informative and fun.
Resources For The Enrichment Of African Lives	110037		/users/profile/149869	ckyle50	Board Member	5	04/17/2012	I met Tsehai Wodajo 5 years ago and immediately admired her deep commitment and the good work she was doing in the this organization that she had founded.  The more I learned about their sponsorship of education and leadership development for girls and young women in Ethiopia, the more I knew I wanted to support.  I not only became a sponsor... I applied to become a board member!  Now I sponsor 2 girls - and am serving a term as the president of the board.  There is no other organization that I know of where 98% of the funds go directly to Ethiopia, where the community is set up to choose the girls whoe get sponsored (the brightest and least likely to stay in schoold due to poverty), that also hires mentors for the girls, and the training and development for the girls as community leaders includes their families!  We are now in 9 sites and support 135 girls - and are working with the sites to become self-sufficient as well (our goal is self-sufficency in 7 years).

A small local staff in Asuncion and no staff in U.S.   All funds raised are devoted to housing, medical and educational needs of the poor from local slums and indigenous  tribes.

This program brings horses and people together, people living with disabilities, people I would never imagined could get on a horse let alone ride one. Within one week, or two, they are able to sit up, gain balance, trust, learn social skills, be potty trained, it goes on and on. Give and give big to this program, they need it now more than ever.

FRIENDS OF AMANI US INC.	99236	2	/users/profile/118767	CTG123	Volunteer	5	10/12/2011	I was a health volunteer at amani for 6 months and can honestly say that this organization changes the lives of hundreds of children. The children come to Amani from the street and are tired, hungry, sometimes drugged, weary of adults, and filthy...clothes that had once been white now gray and black with dirt, finger nails crusted with mud, skin with scrapes and bruises and covered in a layer of filth, and minds filled with horrific memories of things that I could never even imagine.  After a few days at Amani these same children actually begin to look like normal kids again.  They have clean clothes, skin, nails, a full belly and  most importantly, smiles on their faces and caring, loving people surrounding them.    While having clean clothing, a bed, and love are essential, it will benefit the kids only in the moment.  In addition to the necessary comforts the children also need tools that they can use to provide themselves with a future that does not involve life on the street.  This is done through education.  Amani puts every child living there through school, whether it be at Amani, so that the children can catch up with their age group after no schooling, or sending them to outside school during the day.  After primary school, the children can then go on to secondary school, and this is where donors can truly make a huge impact on an individual life.  While public schools are much cheaper, there are days where the children show up to class and no teacher ever comes, the education is just not as sufficient. Private schools are much more expensive but truly give the child a thorough and intriguing educational experience.  Additionally, Amani generally wants a child to live either in boarding school or with a family member by the time they are in secondary school, because this allows the child to have a more "normal" part of childhood, and allows for new children to come in off the streets. There are situations where children who were top students get reunited with family and no longer attend school or start to do poorly in school.  Ideally, these children would be sent to a boarding school, but, again, the cost is major limiting factor.     This is an area where donations and individual sponsors have the potential to drastically change the life of one child.  If a child is given a good education they then have the tool they need to keep themselves off the streets for the rest of their life.      When I ask some of the kids what they want to do when they grow up or what they want to study some common answers are , "circus" "futbol" "teacher" "doctor" but the responses that really touch me the most are "help kids who grew up like I did" "help kids like the ones at amani" "social work to help kids like me".

When I joined many in the community said they think the group is propped up by the FBI. I am starting to believe it may be true. They don't have the community's best interests in mind, only trying to further their own careers and get some free publicity in the process. They are not inclusive of women and treat them like second class citizens. Horrible and shameful group of immature, uneducated children (who happen to be in their 30s). Their name says it all- STAY AWAY!
PEQUANA PLAYHOUSE	7272	12	/users/profile/9134	twissa	Board Member	5	07/24/2009	Pequana Playhouse does an amazing job when you consider the small population base from which to draw for performers, crews, audiences, and administrative activities, not to mention the fact that directors and accompanists are paid almost nothing and everyone else nothing at all.Pequana was born in 1982-83 in a tiny town in northern Minnesota (six hours to drive to or from Minneapolis/Saint Paul). It's nearly as far north as you can get and still be in the United States. Not many people live there, but it has been possible to assemble casts of 50 people for ambitious works such as "The Music Man", "Fiddler on the Roof", "The Miracle worker", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "The Sound of Music", and more.Audiences comment frequently on the skill and talent of the performers and crews. I've heard people from metropolitan areas remark that the show they saw here rivaled professional performances they had seen at home.I'm proud to be able to say that I've been a supporter and of Pequana for more than 25 years; I was present at its birth.

In that role, I had no idea how small the budget for this energetic and involved organization was! As a board member, I am committed to ensure that every dollar donated is made mighty!
Little Voyageurs Montessori School Inc	22802	5	/users/profile/23802	MontessoriMom	General Member of the Public	5	11/17/2009	After an unhappy experience at a for-profit Montessori elsewhere, I researched all the Montessoris and preschools in the NE Mpls/St. Anthony/Columbia Heights/Fridley area.  I was delighted when I found LVMS 10 years ago for my first child, and it was the obvious choice for my second child 2 years ago.  "The children" are the most important focus at LVMS.  As a result, the children's interests and skills blossom, they behave in a polite and considerate manner, and are cared about as individuals.   LVMS is also extremely flexible with additional hours that care may be needed - down to the quarter hour, before and/or after class, and it can change daily as my needs change.  That's something I didn't find when I searched other Montessoris.I feel completely confident in the guidance and care my children receive at LVMS.

Jewish Community Action	21457	1	/users/profile/22588	Steven	Board Member	5	11/04/2009	Jewish Community Action (JCA) is a 13 year old independent organization that works on social justice issues in Minnesota and uses community organizing techniques to engage Jews.  The group works with synagogues throughout the state, with non-affiliated Jews, and with Jewish youth.  JCA also works in alliance with other minority groups, including Latino, Somali and Ethiopian immigrants.  JCA's work has focused on immigrant rights, housing and racial justice issues in Minnesota.I've been a board member for many years and consistently impressed that this is a healthy and well-functioning organization.  JCA enjoys the support of rabbis, synagogue social justice committees, and some 700 members.In addition to serving on the board, I've been involved personally in work on immigrant rights.  JCA helped raise immigrant rights issues in the Minnesota Jewish community and successfully defended the rights of undocumented workers in several policy battles.  Most recently JCA was a leader in organizing to redress the unjust treatment of Latino workers in Postville and is a major proponent of the Hechsher Tzedek initiative.  I've valued and been inspired by JCA's staff and their dedication to social justice.
