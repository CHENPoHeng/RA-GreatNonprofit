Extreme Missionary Adventures	300211		/users/profile/391053	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/11/2016	I have known about XMA for over a decade, but I had never taken any trips with them.  I had prayed for their people and looked in awe at the lives they touched, but I had never partnered with them on a trip.  Finally, in June of 2016, I was able to experience a short term mission trip with this excellent organization.  I was thankful for their top notch staff, Ronnie and Tera Dennis.  The Dennis' were fully equipped to handle any logistical questions as well as a few health concerns that impacted our trip.  I also appreciated XMA's philosophy of ministry.  I like how they partner with local churches.  XMA does a wonderful job of partnering with Godly local pastors that can utilize mission groups to further their kingdom work.  Finally, I agree with XMA's strategy to help disciple new believers in the villages.  It is not enough to share the gospel and leave.  XMA does the biblical work of continuing relationships with villages in order to see them grow in the faith.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend XMA and their staff when considering a partnership with a mission organization.

I was on the VBS team and he was on the Extreme team hiking up in the mountains to a remote village.  La Balsa is located on the Mame river surrounded by mountains. On the recent trip with XMA God allowed me to go down the same mountain and see the memorial for  Mr Larry.  The experience brought alive all the stories of that adventure. I enjoyed ministering to the people of La Balsa on the 12th anniversary of Mr. Larry's flight. On my recent trip, we were able to do VBS and women's ministry in 10 Villages/towns. Never once did I feel in danger and Randy White had all our needs met. Thank you, XMA for a wonderful opportunity " to know Him and make Him known."

Extreme Missionary Adventures	299227	1	/users/profile/390133	Jennifer565	Volunteer	5	08/04/2016	I did my 1st mission with XMA in 2015.  We did vacation bible school with children in Honduras.  The trip was AMAZING.  God did a work in my life through serving others.  I also went to Honduras in 2016 with XMA.  We again did vacation bible school with the children but also added a womens ministry team.  We saw 3 salvations through this team.  XMA is very accommodating and made sure that all details of our trip were handled.  I felt very safe and secure with every aspect of our trip.  Our trip leader, Randy White is an amazing man of God.  He goes over and beyond not only for his team members but for the people of Honduras.  His compassion for the people there is so heart felt and genuine.  We were asked on the last night at the mission house to share a defining moment but we all found it very hard to share only one defining moment because our whole week was full of amazing moments.  XMA is a very God centered organization and 90% of all donations goes straight back into the mission field.  For anyone who has done any research on the percentage of money that goes straight back in to the mission field with other nonprofit organizations knows the rarity of such a big percentage of donations going right back into missions instead of office/corporate use.  Not only do the teams/people who go on missions through XMA respect this nonprofit organization and the work that they do but the people in the countries where the missions take place highly respect the members/team leaders of XMA also.  The love and relationships built between Randy White and the people of Honduras is always amazing to see.  I will do mission work through XMA as long as God allows and highly recommend XMA to anyone who is looking to go on a God centered mission trip.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	297941		/users/profile/347067	CMcKelvey	Volunteer	5	07/25/2016	In June of 2016, our team traveled to Honduras under the leadership of Ronnie and Tera Dennis.  Ronnie and Tera are first class leaders and were prepared to handle every "curve ball" that was thrown in our direction.  Through the expertise of XMA and their contacts within Honduras, our team was able to effectively share the gospel, promote XMA's RevitalEYES program, and worship with the Honduran people. Praise God for XMA, the Dennis's, and the Godly leaders in Honduras!

Extreme Missionary Adventures	293970		/users/profile/384660	Writer	Volunteer	5	06/27/2016	I went on my first foreign mission trip earlier this month under the leadership of both "Lucy" and Randy.  The trip far exceeded my expectations!  Although weather changed our plans a few times, we were still able to plant seeds in 6 different areas.  I hope to be able to return next summer to plant more seeds!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	290557		/users/profile/380920	Jackson R.	Volunteer	5	05/22/2016	I recently returned from a trip into the Peruvian jungle led by Randy White, and what a blessing it was!   We were able to share the love of Christ with remote villages by distributing bibles, witnessing to the villagers, and showing videos that explain who Jesus is.  Sensing the presence of God in the middle of the jungle is an extraordinary experience!  I highly recommend XMA!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	285285		/users/profile/375266	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/08/2016	Traveled with a dental team to the village of Pane, Honduras. Was my first foreign mission trip with XMA and it was a life changing experience. I would highly recommend XMA to anyone who truly wants to make a difference in the lives of those who are suffering in third world countries.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	282766		/users/profile/372931	Susy A.	Volunteer	5	03/18/2016	XMA is a great Godly organization! My son began going to Honduras with Bro. Randy White in 2003. He went to Olanchita several times. Each trip blesses people there, but the volunteers who go on these short term mission trips are changed forever! I live in Hackberry, LA. Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Ike in 2008 devastated our community. Bro Randy White brought countless XMA volunteers to help our community throughout the recovery from both storms. I saw God's love in action from the recipient side of mission work. They built a new home for my husband and me in 2009. I am still overwhelmed! That very year I went to Peru with Bro. Randy, and March 28th I'll be going to Pane',Honduras for the 5th time! I have seen what these people grow and how XMA plants, waters, and harvests! XMA is  God's hands and feet to people all over the world, even in a little community in southwest Louisiana.

The commitment level and dedication to detail by their staff and their volunteers, while  in a very rugged environment, is second to none. This is a very Christ-like network that  is markedly hands-on.  I have colleagues all over the world who have used their services effectively, and they too have had the same very positive experiences.  - Preston W,  (International Field worker in Central America and South Asia)

Extreme Missionary Adventures	276840	3	/users/profile/366661	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/17/2016	Just returned January 13th from my second XMA trip to Honduras lead by Randy White. We were six guys in total working on construction, teaching local leaders, serving and interacting with villagers in some very remote villages. I think we helped change some lives and were changed ourselves in the process by the experience.  We certainly bonded as brothers and friends and experienced some unique cultural relationships being invited into the native relationships XMA and indigenous friends already share. Go!! I would recommend XMA to anyone looking for an adventure with a purpose! :) 
Extreme Missionary Adventures	276488	3	/users/profile/366270	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/13/2016	Returned yesterday from a week of pastor training and ministering in Olanchito, Honduras with XMA.  This is my second trip to Honduras and will return every year in Jan with XMA, The trip was well planned and organized from the beginning to the end. Our team was well informed of everything needed for the trip ahead of time. Once we assembled at the airport our team leader Randy White provided excellent guidance until we returned home. If you are looking for a truly rewarding adventure and a way to allow God's word to become more than words on paper XMA can provide an excellent opportunity for you and your group.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	265896	1	/users/profile/354644	dbrewer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	God provided me the opportunity this year to go on a mission trip to Nicaragua. It was my first mission trip outside of the United States and it could not have been a better experience. From the time we arrived at the airport until we left a week later, Terry and Denise Parks provided for all our needs. Our transalators, Alex and Jairo, where awesome. God opened my eyes to so many things during that week. Seeing so many people from the villages coming to watch a film about Jesus each night was amazing. Nicaragua is a beautiful place and we met some amazing people along the way. I'm praying for the opportunity to return there again next year. Thanks again to Terry and his team and to XMA for the amazing trip. To God be the glory. 
Extreme Missionary Adventures	259242	2	/users/profile/347759	Tgeorge80	Volunteer	5	09/24/2015	The XMA Experience with Terry Parks and the team was life changing. It allowed me to see the unreached world that is lost. And when you speak the word of Jesus Christ, they are eager to listen and learn. Its a win/win for everyone. Life changing - on both sides of the coin. By far the most memorable experience in my life. Trevor George - Nashville TN
Extreme Missionary Adventures	258564	2	/users/profile/347065	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/20/2015	I have traveled with XMA 5 times now and they run a first class operation. They are always organized and provide a great opportunity to share the gospel in remote areas of the world!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	258325	2	/users/profile/346815	terabethdennis	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	I just completed my 6th trip with XMA. I highly reccommend this nonprofit. I will be traveling with them in the very near future! Thank you XMA for your integrity! You guys ROCK!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	257930	2	/users/profile/346404	kleiserd	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	I have been on 4 mission trips with XMA and my 5th trip is scheduled next month. I have had an incredible life changing experience each time! Terry and Mrs. Denise are amazing and what they do in Nicaragua is so inspirational. My family loves them so much! Nicaragua is always in my heart!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	257188		/users/profile/345598	Matt91	Board Member	5	09/14/2015	     About 4 years ago, a lifelong friend invited me and a few guys from our church to go on a mission trip he was leading to Nicaragua.  He had recently joined XMA staff and we had a fantastic trip.  We all pitched in a few extra bucks and purchased 200 pairs of used prescription glasses, along with an "eye doc in a box" kit.  We were able to use this kit to measure the vision of villagers in need and give them an appropriate pair of glasses.  At the same time a physician and a pharmacy owner teamed up to run a medical clinic.  During the evening, we showed a film in Spanish that clearly presented the gospel and a member of our team gave a talk about how to have a relationship with Jesus.    It was a great time and soon after I got back, I was asked to serve voluntarily on the board.  Since then, I have been on two other trips to Honduras - one using my skills as a dentist and the other was a pastor-training retreat that we put on for the local pastors of house churches.       If you are considering a mission trip with your family, church group, or just a group of friends, I highly recommend XMA.  A staff member will help you plan your trip and then lead it for you.  They are very flexible to the needs and desires of the group, but also have experience and insight to the local areas that they go.  In short, XMA trip leaders and office staff make your trip planning stress free.  
Extreme Missionary Adventures	256929		/users/profile/345328	Abtynes	Volunteer	5	09/13/2015	I had the experience of going on a mission trip to Nicaragua this year, which was my first trip with XMA! It was an awesome experience with seeing not only God at work but also XMA takes care of all your needs regarding interpreters, meals, and accommodations. I can't wait to go on my next trip!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	256898		/users/profile/345297	Rcrow	Volunteer	5	09/13/2015	I have had the honor of serving  with XMA on 4 trips to Nicaragua, with a 5th scheduled in January.  My first trip was a medical missions with a team from our church.  I remember wondering why I was lead to this team because I am a teacher.  Our first trip was challenging for me as we hiked through mountains and a beautiful rainforest to reach the village of Santa Ana.  I remember how beautiful the stars were at night.  It was as if you were so close to the heavens up on that mountain.  The place was so remote they did not have a school or a teacher.  I was challenged to teach the pastor's son how to read.  Imagine my dilemma, as I spoke no Spanish.  With God as my strength, I worked with the pastor's children as well as other children in the village - and God confirmed my place on the team.  The people of the villages are very poor but grateful and always bless and enrich our lives.  If you feel led to go on a mission - I urge you to do so.  The XMA team leaders in Nicaragua are my close personal friends and will guide you through the entire adventure.  You will love the people of this country.

Extreme Missionary Adventures	256668		/users/profile/345063	Karen355	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I have been on two trips to Honduras with Lucy Clark. It was truly a blessing! Those people have stolen my heart. I plan to return again next summer. 
Extreme Missionary Adventures	256496		/users/profile/344889	spchlngpath	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I went on my first mission trip out of the states in May 2015 with XMA.  I was nervous about going but XMA made the trip there so worth it! They have a true calling to serve God and love people. I now want to go every year. It was a life-changing trip and my heart is more dedicated toward missions. 
Extreme Missionary Adventures	256494		/users/profile/344888	katieomo	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I have gone on 4 trips to Nicaragua through XMA. Terry Parks,our team leader has become like family. I love serving through this organization. It is so awesome to see the heart they have for spreading the Gospel. This is a genuine organization, and I look forward to serving with them for many years to come.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	255417		/users/profile/343809	ran1969	Client Served	5	09/09/2015	Having gone on two mission trips with XMA in 2015, I was able to get to know the hearts of both the XMA staff members and the people of Honduras.  Both impacted me greatly.  What an incredible organization full of people truly pursuing God's kingdom on earth.  Thank you XMA for changing my perspective, my priorities, and my life!  
Extreme Missionary Adventures	254020		/users/profile/342316	JRags	Volunteer	5	08/26/2015	I went on my first mission trip to Honduras in July 2015 and it was a true blessing.  X M A and our team leaders were awesome.  I am looking forward to many more mission trips with XMA!

This was our second mission trip to take with XMA and we also had the same leaders. I feel like the trip was well organized & planned out. I could also tell that the XMA leaders truly cared about us & spreading the gospel. My family is looking forward to taking many more mission trips through XMA. Keep up the good work guys & thanks so much!

Since then, God has opened doors for me to go on trips with xma at least twice a year, and to multiple countries around the world...trips are physically and spiritually challenging, and there is a wide variety if ways to bring tje good news of our Lord to others around the world...highly recommend!!!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	243761		/users/profile/330594	Catherine7489	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	I have known many of the missionaries and staff of XMA for several years and they they are all wonderful people working for an amazing organization.  And having volunteered with XMA several times in the past I have always found that tHey work hard to make sure your mission trip is a life changing experience where you will make memories you will carry with you for a lifetime.   If you are looking for an adventure while changing lives then you should book your mission trip with XMA!
Extreme Missionary Adventures	243283		/users/profile/329981	TD23tad1980	Volunteer	5	05/19/2015	Would highly recommend to go on a mission trip with this organization.  I have been on 10 mission trips since 2001. Each has blessed as much as the people we helped. Very well-run organization with true Christians running it.

I fell in love with people of Octal.  From the city to the surrounding villages, XMA and Full Count are reaching these beautiful people with the gospel.  Loving on them as the gospel says to.  Terry and Denise and their team of interpreters have such a ministry there. Shannon
Extreme Missionary Adventures	233595		/users/profile/297451	Pman	Volunteer	5	11/13/2014	I've made 7 trips with XMA, Randy White, in Peru and Honduras. As a Pastor and carrying other volunteers it is extremely important to be assured of integrity, safety, clarity and spiritual purpose. XMA excels in those areas. We have never had a glitch that concerned me knowing Randy White was our leader. We have more trips already scheduled.  Pastor Gary
Extreme Missionary Adventures	164968		/users/profile/219277	Rayc10	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	This year was our first trip with XMA. We are booked for next year and if we can, we may book two trips. Amazing group of people that are serving at the highest. 
Extreme Missionary Adventures	99384		/users/profile/119245	Brad E.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2011	I've been on two trips with XMA now and our church will be doing more, Lord willing. Had the privilege of partnering with two of their leaders already and both were awesome in leading our team and giving the Lord the freedom to do what He wants to do. If I had ten thumbs, they'd get 10 thumbs up. :)
Extreme Missionary Adventures	89173		/users/profile/24532	fd2211	Volunteer	5	05/24/2011	Extreme Missionary Adventures is just that. It is taking the teachings of Jesus to unreached, unengaged people groups all over the world.  Where else can a person do the things you enjoy doing while sharing the teachings of Jesus. We have done everything from hiking, biking, motor bike, kayaking and camping just to name a few.  Being able to visit villages and mingle with the nationals there is great. Exotic food, beautiful scenery and making new friends along the way, wow, whoever said following Jesus Christ was boring. NO WAY!! ITS AN ADVENTURE WITH A PURPOSE.  
Extreme Missionary Adventures	23440	2	/users/profile/24532	fd2211	Volunteer	5	12/05/2009	I've been to three different Asian countries and have been blessed every time. In two of the countries we have done drops and in the other we have shared Bible stories. Every trip is exciting and very unique whether we are hiking, kayaking, hiking or using a motor scooter.   Everyone that has gone comes back a stronger follower of Jesus. The blessings we receive are unbelievable. The people groups we come across are amazing. There is no way that I can describe all of the experiences I've been through and my only regret is not joining up sooner. Come along with us and see what you have been missing
Extreme Missionary Adventures	48106	2	/users/profile/49029	evelyn2	Volunteer	5	07/13/2010	My first trip through XMA was in 2003 as a group of women from Rayville, LA went to the mission grounds in Olanchita, Honduras to minister to women who were either the wife of a pastor or a village leader. This was the first time women's ministry had been conducted in Honduras.  The women's response to the teaching of God's Word to them was incredible.  I had the privilege of returning in 2004, 2005, and again in 2010 to assist in ministering to the precious ladies of Honduras. These ladies have taught me how earnestly intercede for others, how to love unconditionally, and how women's basic needs and desires are the same wherever you are. We all want to love and be loved and to have the needs of our families met. They have taught me what is truly important in this life--loving the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Also this year I was able to spend one week with Osmany and Jennifer in Pane, Honduras. There a small group of Louisiana ladies conducted VBS to over 200 children and taught the Word of God to 19 women. To see joy in the eyes of children who have known only hopelessness made our own spirits jump with joy. To see women grow from feelings of such unworthiness that they wouldn't look at us during Bible study to clinging to us for individual prayer on the last day is beyond description. Our team also visited villages surrounding Pane to show them a movie about Jesus. The villagers had never seen a movie nor had they ever heard about Jesus. They now have seen their first movie and it was about Jesus. There were some salvations resulting from these visits. Praise God for His goodness in allowing me to share these wonderful experiences with ladies who love the Lord and are willing to give of their time, energy, and finances in order to walk in obedience to their Lord. Each time I have been chosen by my Lord to serve in Honduras the experience has been unbelievable in the natural for only God could do what I've witnessed.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	42386	4	/users/profile/43104	brynacuff	Volunteer	5	06/01/2010	This charity is all about reaching the nations for Christ. The leaders are great people and I built awesome relationships with them. I spent the first week in the mountains around Wiwili with Terry Parks and some translators, David and Raul. We spent time reaching the locals through games and films. We told Bible stories and showed several faith based films. The second week I spent in the town of Ocotal. We went to 2 different churches and did some Vacation Bible School activities by playing games, teaching Bible stories, and making crafts. The ways that we saw God work and the experiences that we had were absolutely amazing and I wouldn't trade it for anything. You may have to rough it a little bit and get a little dirty but the leaders make sure you are taken care of by providing food and lodging so that you can spend your time focusing on God and the work He is having you do. I loved this non-profit and I plan to take a trip with them again.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	26149	3	/users/profile/27187	Tripp	Volunteer	5	01/25/2010	I recently returned from my 3rd XMA trip in 15 months.  I have had the opportunity to work in 2 seperate areas of Honduras and most recently Nicaragua. I first came in contact with XMA in Honduras while leading a team from another organization.  After spending a short period of time talking with the team leaders, I quickly realized these guys had it right.  They were willing to sacrafice all of the comforts we as americans had come to depend on to get the Gospel out to those hard to reach villages.  By putting myself last in my service, I really found myself depending more on God and allowing Him to guide my way. Working and planning trips with XMA has been the easiest of all the organizations I have worked with. Eventhough I have only spent about 24 days working with XMA on the field, my service as a short term missionary has been changed forever.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	23599	2	/users/profile/24711	Rayland	Volunteer	5	12/09/2009	I went on my first trip with XMA in November 2001.  The first village we visited was Quebrada Grande in the mountains of Honduras. I witnessed God's glory falling upon that village and over 100 people were saved. As our team started back down the mountain, we were listening to a song by Third Day entitled "Show me Your Glory". The second line of that song says, "When I climb down the mountainAnd get back to my lifeI won't settle for ordinary thingsI'm gonna follow You foreverAnd for all of my daysI won't rest 'til I see You again" I truly have not been the same since that first trip.  I am hooked on missions and have since been on more trips to Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua, Bhutan and Hackberry, LA. Praise God for the vision He has given this mission organization and their obedience to take mission teams to people who have never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And it does not matter if there is no road to the village. XMA will find a way, by the grace of God, to get there.  If your walk with the Lord is stale, stagnant or uneventful, then contact XMA and they will plug you into a trip where you will see God's Glory with your own eyes. You will experience the Lord working through you and accomplishing only what He can do. It is awesome!"And the King shall answer and say unto them, 'Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me." Matt 25:40
Extreme Missionary Adventures	22078	3	/users/profile/23184	Wally Austin	Volunteer	5	11/10/2009	I regularly lead groups to Honduras and have enjoyed many years of working through XMA.  This is a great way to reach those unreached peoples. The trips are well organized and all travel details are handled so the person going on a trip can concentrate on ministry and know that all the other necessary travel details are done. A trip with XMA will be life changing.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	21637	2	/users/profile/22775	tbarnhillperu	Volunteer	5	11/05/2009	Joined a  missionary trip in Peru up the piches River to share the gospel through bible storying to indigenous people.  The XMA leader, Randy White was an excellent leader in every respect-passionate worker, well organized,with ability to make trip members feel safe while enjoying a very memorable experience.
Extreme Missionary Adventures	21450	3	/users/profile/22574	jenniferhernandez	Volunteer	5	11/04/2009	My family and I are missionaries with XMA ministries in Honduras. I have been a part of XMA ministries since 2002 when I went to Hoduras as a volunteer. I have seen the good they have done. They have used Jesus as an example helping both the physical and Spiritual needs of the people. We are proud to be a part of this ministry. God BlessOsmany, Jennifer, Rebeca, and Lydia Hernandez
Extreme Missionary Adventures	21439	3	/users/profile/22559	Child of God	Volunteer	5	11/04/2009	I can say that I have felt God calling on mine and my husbands hurt to join the mission field.  We had no clue where to start and then we tried to ignore the calling. My husband and I had moved to Missouri and then had to move back home to Louisiana. We felt like everything was crashing down on us. an opportunity arose where we could join a mission team with XMA. This is just not a team, its a family of God. XMA makes everything so easy for those who really have no idea what they are doing on the first trip other than the knowledge of God's love and desire to share with others.  God showed in so many ways with us. This is not just a trip to share faith with others but for your own faith to grow as well. At one point the trip, beloved Maria, broke down. We had no idea what was wrong. We got in a group and prayed will the others worked on the trip. After our prayer, Donnie got back in the truck and moved the gear stick like they had done already and there she goes back to working.  After a few hours we arrived at the village.  The people seemed to be a little closed to themselves. But then slowly after seeing our love for them they began to feel more comfortable and open. We shared gifts which to us Americans is normal items... toothpaste, toothbrushes, blankets, hats, toys... I can go on. The point of these gifts are not to just give someone something but to help allow an opportunity to share our faith of Christ.  We showed several Christian shows and then we showed the Jesus Film.. which allowed us to share Jesus with many others without our language barrier interfering (we do have interpreters, Alex and Raul...great brothers in Christ) We prayed diligently and worked as a team/family. I can say we all feel in love with the people and the area.  We loved what we were doing. We didn't even let things bother us like it would normally...example no showers and no baths. Some people make faces...but man it feels so God to sacrifice conveniences for Christ to do his calling on our lives and showing HIS love for others. That's what this trip is about ...HIM.  XMA makes things happen they put everything together but this team allows GOD to move, lead, and they follow. XMA sets a great example and they let you know without GOD this is impossible. GOD made this trip happen. He helped find the funds for us to go when we thought it was not going to happen. He made the truck work. He protected us the whole trip. There are many cases the GOD was there. Satan tried to intervene and no wonder why...10 people accepted Christ the week we were there and God allowed another trip to the same village with another group and more excepted Christ! This trip and this group is well worth joining and in fact like I said before we joined a family. I love our family in Christ!

The staff and volunteers are dedicated to the mission and passionate about their work.  
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44010	9	/users/profile/44926	carolynlorio	Board Member	5	06/15/2010	I was sold on the concept of NOFHA from the day I heard of the concept - a provider of affordable health care for those who are employed, but not able to afford health insurance.  More important to me was the idea of integrating physical, emotional and spiritual health.  NOFHA not only treats illness, but teaches health and wellness and asks its patients to take responisibilty for managing their own health.  It has been very fulfilling to watch NOFHA grow from mere concept, to a fully operational clinic, but we need financial support to continue our mission!
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	127410		/users/profile/45521	barbaraa	Donor	5	10/20/2012	New Orleans needs places that provide primary health care such as help with diabetes, hypertension and other chronic health problems and since Hurricane Katrina many primary clinics were lost.  New Orleans is still trying to rebuild and NOFAH provides this care to those who work but do not have health insurance.  It is helping so many people and could do so much more with more financial help and volunteer health professionals.  NOFAH is a great organization and is trying to grow to meet more people's needs.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	47655	6	/users/profile/48373	nola09	Volunteer	5	07/02/2010	I was also part of the Kaiser Permanente group that worked on the initial stages of this project.  I lived in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and know first hand how much help the people and city of New Orleans needs.  So many people need help with getting the proper healthcare. I am proud to have been a part of this project.  It will be very successful and help many people and nothing makes me happier then helping to make others smile and feel good.

As a community heatlh worker, I encounter individuals on a regular basis who are employed but have no health insurance.  It is agreat comfort to know that there is a resource available for these individuals that will provide care not just for their physical health, but their emotional and spiritual well-being also.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	46604	4	/users/profile/47434	jay7	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/29/2010	The Faith Health Alliance is a mix of imagination and radical new ideas in healthcare.  It is a holistic approach to health care. Their dream isnt just to take blood and labs and do checkups, but help change lifestyles: instead of sa8ing you need to eat better they want to say come to our kitchen so we can show you haw to cook a healthy meal. Instead of saying you need to lose weight they want to say here is a pass to our gym and an appt with a fitness counselor, let us help you lose weight with exercise. Its a new approach and Im glad I could be at the opening and that I know some of the staff.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	46126	4	/users/profile/47003	volunteercommitment	Volunteer	5	06/28/2010	I was part of Kaiser Permanente's team of individuals who came with Hands On to do the initial preparation of the organization. Meeting with other volunteers as we worked to paint and move furniture was exciting. It was great to see the pictures of the ribbon cutting from our homes and know that we were a part of the process for that building opening. We had a hand on a very positive piece of New Orleans healthcare re-establishment.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	46062	8	/users/profile/46953	nola404	Volunteer	5	06/27/2010	I helped with some of the initial preparation of the space while working with colleagues from Kaiser Permanente through Hands On New Orleans.  I lived in NOLA for 10 years prior to Katrina and know first hand how many folks can benefit from a project like this. I whole heartedly endorse the project, the process used by the project and have no question that it will have a significant impact for those individuals lucke enough to be served by the New Orleans Faith Health Alliance.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45758	7	/users/profile/46640	lew382	Donor	4	06/25/2010	The staff and volunteers of NOFHA are the kind of people who dedicate their lives to the service of others.  They do what we are all called to do - to be stewards of humanity, giving selflessly to the total well-being of others.  NOHFA, if allowed to grow and flourish, can be a place of support and comfort to those patients who work tirelessly without the benefits of healthcare.  It is a place that can give them a bit of ease when it comes to their health and enable then to take ownership of their whole well-being.

New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45580	7	/users/profile/46465	fe	Volunteer	5	06/24/2010	I have been a volunteer for the past year for NOFHA. This non-profit organization is providing much needed affordable health care for uninsured workers. There has been an impressive response to this worthy cause from our community but more financial support needed to service more needy people. This competent and dedicated organization should be backed with the necessities that would allow it to grow and, in turn, allow our community to prosper.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45500	6	/users/profile/46390	kellen1	Volunteer	5	06/24/2010	This clinic has hard working staff that dedicate their lives to the increased enrichment of the individual and their communities.

I have seen it come into fruition in the most glorious, dedicated fashion.  And, most importantly, I am a witness to the effect NOFHA is having in our city and in the lives of New Orleanians.  the clinic staff is caring and professional.  the clinic itself is spectacular and clean and warm.  every doctors office should look so good.

New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45220	9	/users/profile/46124	cc11	Board Member	5	06/23/2010	NOFHA is a wonderful ministry, bringing together various faith groups in our community to serve the common good in providing health care for the working uninsured.  I really like the fact that NOFHA is a comprehensive approach to health, welness and spirituality with a focus on the "working" uninsured.  It's a great model that fosters people understanding and taking ownership of their health and welness.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45212	9	/users/profile/46117	i-care	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2010	Although I've not had the opportunity to directly serve through this organization, I have been able to make suggestions about several facets of their services.  This organization fills a much needed void in medical services delivery in this community.  They not only provide health services but also help their clients with emotional and spiritual needs.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45208	9	/users/profile/46112	linconey	Donor	5	06/23/2010	My husband and I are donors because we feel the NOFHA really fills a niche where health care is needed but not provided.  When I visited the facility I was extremely impressed but the expertise, dedication, and compassion of everyone involved there.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	45067	9	/users/profile/45976	slovera	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/23/2010	NOFHA was started based on a vision on how services should be provided to the community, placing more attention on the quality of serivce than the number of people served. Throug the short time that NOFHA has been up and running it has embraces all that it stands for.  The staff is committed to the mission and vision of its funders and has become an incredible resource for the overall community and an example of how services should be provided.Differnt from all other community health centers NOFHA open its doors taking into account the needs of the immigrant community. Today 50% of its clients are Latino immigrants who have found a real home for their medical needs.The true value of NOFHA is the people that works there and their commitment and devotion to serve the community.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44813	7	/users/profile/45733	rpearce	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/21/2010	I work with the migrant Latino community and have always struggled to find resources for the people I meet that are client-centered and low-cost for people without insurance. NOFHA is both of these. There is a gap in Spanish-speaking medical services in New Orleans and NOFHA's dedication to filling this gap is clear in Luanne's passion to serve people from any background. Similarly, finding low-cost medical services for people who work jobs that don't provide health insurance was next to impossible before NOFHA opened its doors. I am always excited to share information about this clinic and the great service they provide to the people I encounter during my week.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44524	8	/users/profile/45425	nmurray	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/18/2010	IIn my post-Katrina work in New Orleans I have encountered many residents who although holding steady jobs, cannot afford health insurance.  New Orleans Faith Health Alliance is literally a prayer answered for these folks.  The fact that NOFHA is committed to treatment that affects the patient in both body and spirit makes it an extraordinary and unique resource in our troubled area.   Executive Director, Luanne Francis contacted our non-profit, Interfaith Works, to help establish connections with as many faith communities, large and small, as possible, to spread the word that NOFHA is open and available to all.  She let us know that it is a priority to reach those who might otherwise be overlooked.  We are delighted to be cooperating with NOFHA and we are grateful that they are here.

Diabetes care is largely self care, and a lack of health insurance should not prevent someone from achieving and maintaing tight blood sugar control. I am impressed with the passion of everyone I have met associated with NOFHA and look forward to working with them.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44272	7	/users/profile/45187	jwgreen1	Donor	5	06/17/2010	New Orleans Faith Health Alliance is a wonderful clinic that has identified a desperately under-served patient population and is working intensely to meet the need.  The rebuilding effort in New Orleans as well as the culture that is so essential to the vibrancy of my city is dependent upon many of NOFHA's patients: the artists with no steady job, the undocumented labor force, the part-time dishwashers.  These are the unsung heroes that make New Orleans the world-renowned icon of fun and festival: the overworked and uninsured.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44252	8	/users/profile/45160	betty5	General Member of the Public	5	06/17/2010	I am thrilled to have this type of clinic offering medical services to my community.  I look forward to our continued co-operation and future collboration.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44161	9	/users/profile/45077	dalf05	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2010	As New Orleans faces more budget cuts for community health care, the  New Orleans Faith Health Alliance organization is providing critical care to those most in need in the community.  By providing cost-effective primary health care the citys working uninsured population, NOFHA is leading the way in helping members of our community to improve their health and way of living.  Their work ensures that our emergency rooms are not overrun and helps to create effective long-term results for the needs of the city.

New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44136	8	/users/profile/45049	kaiserpermanente	Donor	4	06/16/2010	I am writing in support of The New Orleans Faith Health Alliances (NOFHA). Kaiser Permanente is proud to have been an early corporate supporter of NOFHA. We committed $300,000 over three years to help them with start-up costs. We were attracted to their innovative model to provide affordable coverage and care, as well as their deep commitment to collaboration and community service. In addition to financial support, Kaiser Permanente has shared our health education materials in various languages (our members speak over 120 languages) and have provided pro bono technical assistance in the design of the clinic, sharing what weve learned about patient flow, electronic medical record management, efficient use of space, patient privacy, etc. After Hurricane Katrina, we pledged to help communities affected by the storm to recover and rebuild, with a focus on health. Our support of NOFHA is part of that pledge. Each year since 2007, Kaiser Permanente has also sponsored two community service trips per year for 60 of our employees who are helping to rebuild in the Greater New Orleans and Mississippi Gulf Coast areas. One of last years teams enthusiastically assisted in the demolition of the former administrative space in the church property, so that the new NOFHA clinic could be realized.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44130	9	/users/profile/45045	tpeter	General Member of the Public	4	06/16/2010	What a novel but necessary approach to helping the needy. Not those that are unwilling to help themselves but rather those that, in spite of their hard work and effort, are in need of assistance.I was first introduced to this project by a Bd member, and after attending their open house, at her request,  was impressed with the concept and the dedication of the participants.With sufficient funding this program will fill a void that currently exists in our health care/insurance system and will afford the needy employed with the comfort of care that all Americans deserve.If I were to change anything about this organization it would be its lack of public awareness.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	44129	7	/users/profile/45043	drewjardine	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2010	The NOFHA partially fills a huge health care void in the post Katrina New Orleans community.  The so called "working poor" who cannot afford a regular health care insurance policy are NOFHA clients, and the professionals at NOFHA do an outstanding job of meeting their needs.

This ensures that the uninsured no longer must use hospital emergency rooms as their place of first resort and can now receive the much more cost effective, preventive health care that they need and want.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	43896	9	/users/profile/44802	janet-dileo-wade	Board Member	5	06/14/2010	I am honored to be involved with an organization that offers faith based comprehensive health care to the working uninsured and their families. These are the people who work so hard and yet often "fall btween the cracks." This program offers them a "helping hand," not a handout.What impresses me most about the program is that it is a project of, for and by the faith, health and business communities. It receives no federal or state funding. It offers a medical home for patients, as well as continuity of care and the staff support and education to empower patients to care for themselves and develop/maintain a healthy lifestyle.

New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	43871	5	/users/profile/44781	kgootee	Board Member	5	06/14/2010	New Orleans Faith Health Alliance (NOFHA) is a much needed Health Center established for the working uninsured - a very underserved group.  Our cliets often earn too much for federal assistance, yet too little to purchase health insurance.  One of the best aspects of our model of care is the health coaching. It offers "Health, Hope and Healing".
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	43865	10	/users/profile/44776	grace-pastor	General Member of the Public	4	06/14/2010	In the aftermath of Katrina, New Orleans lost its primary healthcare facility for those without health insurance.  Though there are plans to rebuild the facility, it has yet to be done.  Because of the vision and compassion of healthcare professionals who saw the need of many who could not afford the ever-expensive health insurance, yet could benefit from a holistic approach to staying healthy, New Orleans Faith Health Alliance was born.  It comes at an ironic time that our nation is debating healthcare reform.  Though many of these massive changes will not be implemented for years, this clinic is offering services now.  It is a wonderful partnership with the faith community and healthcare professionals whose primary mission is to care for those in need.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	43740	7	/users/profile/44626	ana3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2010	It is a great pleasure to work with such  dedicated people. Their passion for the common well-being is essential to the recovery and survival of our city. Their unconditional support and service prove their commitment to helping the working uninsured and their families receive affordable and quality health care. There are not enough words to express how influential and beneficial their impact on the community has been; especially the Spanish-speaking community. On behalf of everyone in our program, we want to sincerely thank NOFHA for the unwavering efforts to make New Orleans a healthier and happier place, one patient at a time.
New Orleans Faith Health Alliance	43482	9	/users/profile/44349	elmore	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/10/2010	This is an amazing operation. It is the only clinic in the New Orleans area that serves exclusively the working uninsured. It does so only with donations, modest fees from the clients, and grants. NOFHA does not accept federal funds because it enrolls only people who are working and do not have health insurance. NOFHA emphasizes patient responsibility and helps the patient (and the health worker volunteers) realize the  contribution spirituality and life style make to health. It is a beautiful example of the way health can should be offered in any country.

Their program encourages healthy/wellness practices and health education in addition to the provision of services in an accepting and caring atmosphere.

We have openly shared information between our organizations to improve access, processes and services.

She wants to come back as a volunteer when she gets to old to attend as a camper! This event provides so much information, encouragement and support. We have great friends that we contact through social media and get to see each year. The kids pick up just like they never left each other and are so supportive of each other. The parents support each other. The staff provides rheumatology updates for parents, rheumatology panels, consults with volunteer doctors and family therapists. The whole atmosphere is just wonderful and we've become a very big extended family with one very specific need: a place our children can get support and encouragement and find friends who live with the same diseases they do.

At lunch time the second day, she was already making plans to attend next year's event! The doctors, family therapists, staff and volunteers all work together to make a very enjoyable retreat for children with arthritic and rheumatic conditions and their parents, siblings and extended families. They work really hard to maximize the experience on as little expense as possible, keeping the cost of attendance low.

My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed with Poly-JRA in July 2015.  She found out about the camp last year when she was diagnosed.  She counted down to camp this year.  She was eager to spend time with other children that understood the pain she was experiencing.  As a parent I looked forward to learning more about JRA and also meeting other parents that were experiencing the same issues; not just day-to-day issues, also the emotional issues from dealing with the diagnosis.  The camp was everything we expected and more.  We look forward to coming again next year to spend time with our new family.

Children and Arthritis	293304	1	/users/profile/383913	smoc	Client Served	5	06/19/2016	This is a gem of a nonprofit organization made up of many caring individuals who give so freely of their time to touch the lives of many families from the newly diagnosed to the "old-timers" who return because of the support and friendships we have made over the years.   We have been attending Children and Arthritis' Jambalaya Jubilee since my daughter's diagnosis ten years ago.  She talks about the Jambalaya Jubilee all year and looks forward to seeing her friends at camp whom she sees only once a year.  The weekend focuses on fun, but there is an understanding that they all share something in common and they are not alone.   As a parent, I appreciate knowing that there is a place where we, as a family, can go once a year to hear the latest updates on pediatric rheumatology, ask questions of a panel of pediatric rheumatologists, chat with other medical specialists, and be able to connect in-person with other parents dealing with similar struggles -- and spend quality time together as a family and with other families.   Treatments for juvenile arthritis can be overwhelming for many families so I appreciate how the cost to attend Jambalaya Jubilee weekend is kept incredibly affordable for all that we do during the weekend.     We will be forever grateful to the Presslys and everyone involved in organizing and running the wonderful Jambalaya Jubilee weekend, including George, Sheri, the pediatric rheumatologists, the family therapists, Cassie, medical specialists for "doc in the box," sponsors and the volunteers.

Children and Arthritis	232081	1	/users/profile/295632	cille	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have worked with this organization since it's inception.  The families of the children with arthritis use it as a source for information, activities, support as they deal with the pain/problems of the child(ren).  The children who attend the annual camp enjoy the activities designed to allow them to interact on a "normal" level.  From art projects to swimming... the kids get to be kids.  It is a wonderful experience to be a volunteer and watch/participate in their fun.

The unique ability of this camp to help families to realize that they are not alone in the everyday struggles caused by rheumatic diseases is remarkable. The number of families that return each year to share their stories and learn more about how to cope with disease is what sets this camp apart from others.

Children and Arthritis	183855	2	/users/profile/240770	buffynavy	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Over the past 30 years I have served on numerous nonprofit boards. Nowhere have I found an organization that directs a larger portion of its dollars to its mission. I am responsible for evaluating nonprofit organizations for a large nonprofit corporation, so I have a good idea of what to consider when determining whether or not to give to an organization. Without a doubt, Children and Arthritis far exceeds my expectations for giving...and is actually much better than many other organizations in our community. The founders continue to stand behind the organization which has been sustained for several decades by donors and corporations that see its clear value to the children and families it serves. Other nonprofits would do well to replicate this model!

Children and Arthritis	180868	1	/users/profile/237579	Kimbent58	Client Served	5	10/22/2013	This organization has helped our family for 22 years.  We started attending the retreat when my daughter was 3 years old.  She is now 25 and we are able to pay it forward now.  Our family still attends the retreats and speak with families just beginning the journey.  When my daughter was first diagnosed, there was no internet so by attending the retreat, I was able to learn so much about arthritis from all the doctors available at the retreat.  I was also able to meet other parents dealing with the same kind of the problems.  My daughter was able to meet other children just like her.  Some of these families we met in the beginning have become very good friends even though we are separated by 100's of miles.  As a parent, I will say the best thing about the retreat is the fact that it empowered me with knowledge.  I always felt so helpless because I had no control over the disease but knowledge is power!  As a parent, it also gave me the feeling that I was not alone.  I knew I could call other parents at any time for help or just a sounding board when I was feeling hopeless.  I know that without this retreat every year, m daughter would not be the confident young woman she is today.  Because of the retreat, she knew all things were possible.  She met other kids going through the same thing and they boost each other up.

This retreat is for children with rheumatic diseases and their families. I began attending Jambalaya Jubilee when I was 3 years old, and I am currently 26 years old.  Jambalaya Jubilee has allowed my family and I to get excellent medical advice from some of the best doctors in the South.  I continue to learn new things every single year!  Children and Arthritis gave me to ability to meet other people who have the same disability as myself.  The encouragement that is given to the families and children helped me develop a strong sense of self-confidence.  Thanks to Children and Arthritis I can face the day knowing that arthritis does not control me, and that I am not alone in my disability!

I have made life long friendship s that have turned into a support network and family. The first year I attended I realized that I WAS NOT THE ONLY KID WITH ARTHRITIS! This organization not only gives hope to the families affected but a weekend of fun for each kid and their siblings, where they can forget about doctors, medical treatments, worries, school, being different from other kids, and just have fun! It also gives the parents a weekend with amazing doctors and counselors to learn how to cope with this disease and better care for their family and the challenges faced. Each child with Arthritis gets a weekend to spend with children just like them, and not feel left out but like they belong! This organization truly does CHANGE LIVES, I say this from not only 18 years as a camper but 2 years as a counselor watching it change children and their families right before my eyes! There is NO greater feeling than being able to donate my time as ASN Alumni and Counselor to these families watching it change them for the better and see them smile for 3 days and hug me not wanting to leave! This organization truly does deserve the Top Non Profit Award, it does change lives for a lifetime and form a support network that is and will always be there. The family behind the scenes that started it all 23 years ago is one of the most caring, loving, selfless families I know that do this year after year just for the families affected by Arthritis! They do it and do not ask for a thank you, this truly is the most deserving non profit organization I know.

We now volunteer and I have to say I've seen two sides of their organization and I have to say they are just great. They really care about the families that attend and the volunteers who help. I love that they take such great care of our children and give them experiences that I would not have been able to do all the time and while our kids are being kids they provide some of the best doctors around and great sessions with those doctors. I can't tell you how valuable this was for us as young parents finding out for the first time that our little girl had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. The advise and knowledge they gave was priceless and they were able to do this whole weekend at such an affordable cost to us which allows families to spend time with each other having fun and not worring about the expense and everything we did was covered. Our family many years later volunteer and we just love being a part of this family and think this organization deserves every bit of praise and accolades.

Right at the six month mark her rheumatologists told me about Jumbalaya Jubilee, a camp for the families and patients effected by JRA. The first year was overwhelming, educational, inspiring and all in between.  This non- profit was started by Dr. Thomas Pressly and his wife Tracie, for the love of children and his passion to see those with JRA thrive and remain hopeful. You can tell that this is not just a practice or even a medical interest of Dr. Pressly's but a heartfelt concern for these kids and a desire to serve them and their families.  I don't know what I would do without the support network of parents I lean on throughout the year that I first connected with at this camp. My daughter has a place and a group of friends that understand her and give her hope and a sense of belonging. She has an opportunity to serve and love those less fortunate than her in their struggle with the disease.  I connect on Facebook, text, phone, through the Children and Arthritis Newsletter and more. I am always wondering how Catherine Pressly leads with such style, finesse and patience during this pinnacle weekend called Jambalaya Jubilee. But I am sure glad she has chosen to commit her time and heart to this wonderful organization.

Children and Arthritis provides a camp for children with arthritis and rheumatic diseases. The camp helps families learn to cope with their child's illness as well as realize there are many other families in the same situation. How awesome to not feel so isolated in the midst of a difficult disease and diagnosis, for the child afflicted as well as the parent!There are numerous doctors, family counselors and therapists that volunteer to be at camp in a relaxed atmosphere and answer questions to help the families/kids learn more about their diagnosis. Lots of fun events and activities go on during the 3 day camp each summer. Families travel from all over to be a part of the fun in Shreveport, LA!

This year I was able to attend as a volunteer.  I rode the bus with participants from San Antonio, Texas and acted as the coordinator and chaperone.  The participants were excited, but tired....so, everyone quickly fell asleep.  Since it was an overnight ride ... All was really quiet.  Once we arrived in Shreveport the fun really began!  The children and families were registered and photographed in lots of different costumes.  By noon the Opening session began.  My role was basically that of a go-fer... Which was fun for me.  I taught school for 40 years, so it was fun to be working with children again.  Activity groups by age were formed.  The younger children were each given a teenage buddy from Shreveport, while the older children were grouped with their volunteers.  Let see...swimming, volleyball, a Mardi Gras party, shopping at the local outdoor mall, games at an arcade, art lessons, dinner and a movie at the science museum kept the kids really busy!  It was fun to watch the interaction of former campers and the children and their families.  While we had fun with the children, the parents were attending seminars to learn about ways to help their children learn to live with their particular disease.  The last morning after the closing ceremony I listened to several parents discuss the options they had discovered during the weekend.  One mom said, "I don't feel as if we are dealing with this alone anymore.  I've made contacts and realize I have ideas that might help others.  This has been a terrific learning experience for our family... And, such a special tray for our daughter."  That, I think says it all.  Learning and fun in the same weekend.  I was thrilled to play such a very small part!

She looks forward each year to seeing her friends and she also loves the fun activities that are planned for us each year. We are very thankful for the Jambalaya Jubilee!

But, more importantly, I'll always be appreciative to the chimpanzees for teaching me what cannot be learned in a classroom. If you ever get a chance to visit Chimp Haven during their public days, or even better, can intern with them, definitely do!

Chimp Haven	207276	9	/users/profile/269900	Linda277	Volunteer	5	07/26/2014	I volunteer two mornings a week and every discovery day at Chimp Haven.  I work in enrichment, making treats for the chimps.  I can honestly say this amazing place has changed my life in the best way possible..The  employees here are truly special people.  I have never heard one word of disdain for any chimp or any other person.  They are educated and cheerful, and I have never seen anyone work as hard as they do!  I have actually become friends with some of the chimps!  They are intelligent, funny and sweet beings.  They have excellent medical care from a first class staff of professionals.  They are fed high quality food and their living quarters are cleaned daily.  I had been through a lot in the last few years when I discovered Chimp Haven.  I also had just retired and found myself with a lot of time on my hands.  I was really feeling useless and without direction.  Not any more!  I wish I had known there were such places years ago.  That is where my career direction would have gone.  I am so happy being around these wonderful people and animals.  I will volunteer here as long as my health allows.  Please consider volunteering here.  There is a lot to do and you will love it. I promise!!!!
Chimp Haven	207271	8	/users/profile/269896	Tess3	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2014	Chimp Haven is heaven on earth to these chimpanzees who have been through so much use and abuse most or all of their lives. They have access to trees and outdoors where they can climb, forage, build nests. It is up to them when they would rather go inside or out, and they enjoy hanging out with their friends in grooming and play sessions together. The staff and volunteers do an excellent job of making sure the chimps are well taken care of, and pay close attention to medical needs, and sanitation of their areas. Creativity and work go into the enrichment activities they provide. This is a wonderful sanctuary.  I am so thankful for Chimp Haven.
Chimp Haven	206872	8	/users/profile/269359	Gena M.	Donor	5	07/21/2014	Chimps that were once used, abused, and treated as "test dummies" are welcomed here with open arms, to live out their lives as naturally as possible.  They are so incredibly well cared for!  My husband and I were privileged to be able to visit this amazing sanctuary in April 2013 for the Chimp, Chat and Chew event, where we took a tour of the grounds, and got to see so many beautiful chimpanzees - young, old, and in between, enjoying their days "foraging" for fruit (the staff places treats out in the open spaces so the chimps can find it), scaling trees, lounging about, grooming, playing...  There's also a "termite mound" that the staff fills with jelly or other yummy treats, and the chimps find the right twig or stick to pull out the rewards!  How awesome!!  There are plenty of interior spaces and exterior spaces for these loves to live a good life.  May God bless Chimp Haven!
Chimp Haven	153110	6	/users/profile/174787	dhendry	Donor	5	04/07/2013	These wonderful people take in the chimpswho suffered from years of lab research and rehabilitate them in top quality fashion. Kudos to this fine charity.

Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	295405		/users/profile/386205	curiousgeorge	Volunteer	5	07/11/2016	Volunteer Health Corps of Baton Rouge is an amazing place to volunteer!  My first volunteering experience with them was through my school.  After my required shifts were completed I asked if I could come back and volunteer on my own.  The staff was very excited at my request and they said they would be happy to have me back!  It also seems that the clients that they serve are extremely grateful and excited for us to be there.  I am very thankful that we have a nonprofit organization that is consistently able to deliver high-quality healthcare to a population that has been historically underserved here in my hometown.  If you like working with knowledgeable medical professionals who genuinely care about their clients then you will like the VHC.  If you are interested in improving your clinical acumen, then know that the staff will take the time to help you better your understanding of the medical profession including accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and overall well care of their clients.  I highly recommend volunteering a shift or two so you can form your own opinion.  I promise, you won't be let down... and you never know, maybe I'll see you there!
Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	294213		/users/profile/384940	Writer	Volunteer	5	06/29/2016	I am a Registered Nurse and have volunteered for VHC several times since 2015. It is a wonderful asset for the uninsured population of our local community. Patients are able to be seen and followed by a physician for their chronic problems like diabetes and hypertension. Nearly everyone who is working there is a volunteer. There are doctors, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, radiology personnel, social workers and medical students. Although everyone does a wonderful job with very limited assets, I hope that someone is able to help donate supplies and/or medicines this this great cause. Many of the people who go there work, but just don't make a lot of money and cannot afford health insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid. It is a great organization and helps many people in our community!!!
Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	294099		/users/profile/384820	bwitty2	Volunteer	5	06/28/2016	This is a great nonprofit foundation.

They help fill an ever increasing gap in the medical system and reach local people who may otherwise fall through the cracks.

Even if you have no medical background, there are always ways to help. I would highly recommended volunteering here.

Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	120095	1	/users/profile/163296	Trenton James MD	Volunteer	5	08/06/2012	To assist needed patients with multiple co-morbid health conditions is rewarding. These patients express appreciation for the care we give as noncompensated diagnosis, treatment, and just caring. These patients truly appreciate our listening and inquiring about their illnesses, complaints, pain and dealing with abnormal findings of blood pressure, blood sugar (glucose), and ordered lab tests results. Bringing them uptodate on needed mamograms, pelvic exams, screening tests, wellness and preventive measures that hey would not get preformed any other way until a crisis. To see that these at-risk citizens get their annual flu shots free when they would not any other way is a good feeling for the patient and for the provider. Refilling medications  and explaining their need, use, and adherence is essential for control and prevention of stroke, heart disease and kidney failure in this neglected population. To explain to them why smoke cessation is essential for their health and prevention of worse disease then they already have.   I feel our work as physicians caring for these un-insured, uncared-for patients, our local citizens, is far more important and critical than traveling to other countries to do mission work on their citizens and not others. Our work makes a greater different here at home and lessens the workload in local ERs and Hospitals, both charity and public. I firmly believe that this is God's work and it is giving of our minds, hearts and hands that are accomplishing it.  I feel real good about it every clinic I attend.
Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	118909		/users/profile/161683	rubinpatel	Volunteer	5	07/19/2012	I have been fortunate to be part of volunteer health corps for four years.  I have seen the VHC grow from a primary care clinic.  The VHC now helps the Baton Rouge community in orthopedics and rheumatology, as well.    The clinic allows me to help those individuals that are most in need of medical care or services.   Volunteering at the clinic has helped me  to remember the roots from where I started my medical training. 
Volunteer Health Corps of Batonrouge	118733		/users/profile/161446	sscafide	General Member of the Public	5	07/17/2012	What a difference these health care clinics make in the Baton Rouge community.

Wounded War Heroes of America	282597		/users/profile/372754	Writer	Client Served	5	03/17/2016	You know in a time when I was down and out, feeling as though the world was against my dreams and aspirations. And that everything I worked so hard to obtain was gone by a simple explosion.  When a humble wounded SF soldier convinced me life wasn't over , but a new book was to be written. And it's not the events this organization runs for the wounded veterans . It's the time and duration of the events that's so humbling and rewarding. To be in the presence of such heroic men and women of our armed forces. Each have lost and gave  and yet they're determination to live life and not sit on the sidelines , and display the intestinal fortitude and the personal courage to make each day count. It inspires those around that we may have not paid the ultimate price for our freedoms, but it's not fair to those that did to just sit and feel sorry forselves, but to continue living and share our story and be that wounded war heroes that this organization is seeking to help. Cause without heroes there's no hope, and when there's no hope, there's no tomorrow. And if that's the case then why live today. So cheers to the wounded war heroes organization and the team they have running Thier operation reminding us that just cause our wings are clipped, doesn't mean we are hopeless, for we are to rise to that nations calling continuing to display the army values and be that soldier that continues to carry the weight of the world on their back, and realize we took a oath to defend our Constitution foreign or domestic, and just cause we may not wear the uniform doesn't mean we surrendered our oath. So thanks for reminding me who I am, and what it means to say that "I'm an american"

Family Missions Company	230107		/users/profile/293765	abollich	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	Family Mission's Company has helped my wife, our five children and myself to understand what it means to be a missionary. We have seen countless people transformed by their experience on short-term missions. Our lives have been enriched immeasurably by having the honor of working with the poorest of the poor, visiting the forgotten and feeding the hungry. And now they are being blessed with a huge influx of new missionaries wanting to be a part of this great organization. Is a wonderfulLife to live and a great cause to support. The world needs missions and FMC is responding to that need. Andrew Bollich 
Family Missions Company	227686	1	/users/profile/291417	Ben_38	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	The Spirit is ALIVE at Family Missions Company.  This is a nonprofit that practices what it preaches!  I have been so blessed to be a part of what they are doing for the greater good of all humanity, both here in the US and abroad, on a few occasions.  I have never been surrounded by more faithful and JOY-filled people than when I am with FMC.  When I give to non-profits I worry about them spending money in extraneous and superficial ways, but because of the spirit of gospel poverty of the missionaries, staff and directors I know they are discerning in how they spend money and it is not frivolous to them.
Family Missions Company	226932		/users/profile/290658	lawlessrl	Volunteer	5	10/26/2014	What a joy it is to serve others in deed and truth. This is what FMC does. They do exactly what Jesus calls us to do, to enter into the lives of the people we live with, and to be powerful witnesses of our faith in Jesus Christ by our loving actions and words. Jesus is alive and desires a relationship with each one of us! This is what we share, a loving and merciful God.
Family Missions Company	226644		/users/profile/290375	LoveNeverFails	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	FMC is a great organization. I have personally volunteered with them and cannot speak highly enough about them. These guys really practice what they preach and that is why they continue to grow as a company because people are naturally drawn to their authenticity. FMC has left their footprint all over the world and has positively impacted thousands of lives - not every non-profit can say they have worked in countries all over the WORLD. Whether it's helping out in their own backyard (the swamplands of south Louisiana) or serving deep in the Amazon jungle, one thing is certain: FMC is an authentic, trustworthy and mission focused organization that embraces love and stands by their beliefs.
Family Missions Company	226602		/users/profile/290332	tec6778	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	WOW FMC is doing what Our current Pope is calling the Church out to do, in fact They are doing what every Good pope has called the Church out to do, but far more importantly they are being what Jesus has called the Church to be, that is they are being missionary. FMC has been the avenue that my family and I have taken to realize our true potential as sons and daughters of God. Our call as baptized Christians to take the gospel into all the world is an awesome and great responsibility that FMC is helping singles and families embrace and realize. They are indeed a great nonprofit.

We have found that Family Missions Company provides numerous opportunities to do this.  Not only do they preach the Gospel, but they also live it in a radical way.  When we donate to FMC, we rest assured that our donation is going to help the poor and those in real need.  I challenge you to  see for yourself how this non-profit is empowered by God Himself.  May God continue to bless FMC!
Family Missions Company	226019		/users/profile/289770	Genie S.	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	Pope Francis is challenging the Church to a powerful missionary response. Family Missions company has based its work in Evangelism and Service to the Poor on a missionary impulse since 1997. With a global outreach, the model of the family, with Jesus at its center, is essential. The people served by FMC find new lives, spiritually, hopefully, and faithfully. Materially, they find new floors, new roofs, new homes, new amenities, new friends, new purpose for living.  Lives and communities are dramatically changed. FMC as a non-profit is a great non-profit!

And in our local community, their outreach to inspire Catholic teens through Faith Camp is a highlight in our summer!  We love being a part of the mission community through donations and prayers, as not all of us can be global travelers spreading the good news, but we can all be instruments through which God travels.

If you want to have a genuine experience in helping others and spreading the word of God, then you need to connect with this group!

This company serves the poorest of the poor all across the world in so many countries.  The thing that sets this company apart from all the rest is the send whole families (and large families at that -- anywhere from 2 to 11 kids per family!!!) to be a light and a challenge to those they serve.  If a family of 11 can still live the faith with joy and peace, then surely everyone else can as well.  What a powerful witness.  We LOVE Family Missions Company!!!!!

Any information, questions, concerns, etc. she can guide you! Not to mention she is so active in the community to help her rescue and others.

I've made several product donations to FTLORR to help them raise money to keep the rescue going. I've also participated in their fundraising online auctions by bidding on and buying items. I know my money is going to the food, shelter, and veterinary care of the animals in the rescue. Running a rescue takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Fundraising to support the rescue takes even more effort. The volunteers at FTLORR make it all work. I'm happy and confident to be a repeat donor to FTLORR.

Although rats are their specialty, they also rescue and care for OTHER ANIMALS INCLUDING RABBITS, SUGAR GLIDERS, GUINEA PIGS, AND POTBELLY PIGS. There is much more to this organization than the name implies, and they need more resources. Please consider helping them, as they help animals no one else will take in.

The Life of A Single Mom	201851	3	/users/profile/263406	Angelica C.	Client Served	5	06/04/2014	The Life of a Single Mom Ministries has truly changed my life. I was lonely, depressed from the loss of losing a daughter in 2006 due to stillbirth and afraid to admit my pain. When I had my first son, I had already read Overwhelmed the life of a single mother by Jennifer Maggio and immediately I felt a sense of connection to her. When I learned of the support group I joined in 2009. When I learned of my second pregnancy I felt stupid and lost and Jennifer and "the girls" were there for me. There were days I had to literally eat bread and beans so I could have gas money to get to work! I would miss days of church so I could buy food for my babies. It was hard...but the life of a single mom ministries improved my mood...taught me that there were other people who were going through the same things that I was going through and helped me to mentally prepare myself for the days to come so that I would not fall into a deep depression. I believe in GOD I trust in GOD but I learned to LEAN on GOD and have a deeper more intimate connection to GOD. I have learned that I am not alone. I do not have to feel alone. All I have to do is ASK. There are people with IDEAS and PURPOSE who can give me ideas so that I can fulfill my purpose. I have a life changed because GOD put all these people in front of me in order to help me fulfill my walk with HIM and give my children a GOD BASED foundation for living and not become a statistic. I have learned to dig deeper into my faith...and prayer life....to teach my children how to claim the promises that GOD has for them. I have seen improvements in my life and in my children's lives and I truly owe it to the Lord and the Life of a Single Mom Ministries and their CEO Jennifer Maggio because God shaped her so that she could help others and she and her mission has helped me and my family. I thank GOD for her, her organization, people like her and for anyone who supports the Life of a Single Mom Ministries because no matter how one became a single mother you are telling us that we have worth, we are beautiful and no matter what no single mother has to walk alone.

I'm sure all moms can appreciate a moment to ourselves to enjoy, network, release, and get replenished. But my memories are more of what I took away from Mrs. Jennifer and the team.

I always felt so out of place when going to church because I was a single mom and I eventually stopped going to church.  Going to the meetings inspired me and taught me that no matter what I've done in my past God still loves me. They've also been a HUGE blessing to my daughter and I.  I always seemed to make Christmas special for my daughter by the skin of my teeth.  However, there was one Christmas where I just knew I couldn't afford to get anything for her.  TLSM volunteers stepped in and purchased Christmas presents for her and even got something for me.  I just couldn't believe their generosity and the fact that there were people who wanted to make sure my daughter didn't go without for Christmas!  I cried happy tears and no matter how many times I said "thank you" it just didn't seem like it was enough.  I now give back to the ministry through volunteering my time and I absolutely love it and all the friends I've made as a result.

I defiantly would not be this far along without the help of TLSM. Thank you for giving us single moms a place where we feel we belong. The world just doesn't understand how hard life as a single mom is. God Bless
The Life of A Single Mom	201294	2	/users/profile/262761	srepak	General Member of the Public	5	05/29/2014	I have actually recommended TLSM to two different people.  I am in Charlotte, NC and was happy that the TLSM had resources here in Charlotte.  Jennifer and her staff have a genuine concern with the people they serve.  
The Life of A Single Mom	201285	3	/users/profile/262751	lonisha.black5	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	I crossed paths with TLSM early last year and immediately fell in love with how closely the mission aligned  with my own core values. I am not a single mom, however, I was raised by a widowed mother. I quickly learned that TLSM truly operates in the spirit of kindness and compassion. I've witnessed so many women who felt they were alone find friendship with women in similar seasons in life. This ministry is Heaven sent and I'm thankful to serve.

The Life of A Single Mom	201265	2	/users/profile/262732	MelanieStone	Advisor	5	05/29/2014	When I lived in Baton Rouge I was on the TLSM Board of Directors, and since moving to Ohio, my involvement has been on the TLSM Advisory Board. I am a Co-Pastor of Freedom House Church and I am Co-Founder and President of Grow Churches, Inc. I have grown in a relationship with Jennifer Maggio and her leadership team. While reading Jennifer's book "The Church and the Single Mom," I often found myself overcome by both emotion and inspiration as I read through the pages. Not only did my heart connect with Jennifer as I read her story, but my eyes were opened to what many single mothers experience. It is a shared compassion for God and a united passion for people that has connected my heart with The Life of a Single Mom ministries. Since starting Freedom House in Cincinnati, we have connected with several single moms. We were able to help one single mom with repairs on her car. This woman told us her story of physical abuse and her escape to protect her son. Jennifer tells us that you don't have to look very far to find a single mom who would welcome a sincere relationship, information on finances and child rearing, resources to help them get their education or job training, and someone to confirm their value as a child of God. We have researched and learned that 55% of Cincinnati homes are single parent homes. This is a large percentage of our city, showing us that a ministry to single moms is an enormous opportunity to help strengthen our communities. TLSM is supplying us with support, resources, and information we need to serve single moms in need and to make a positive impact in our part of the world. TLSM is making a tangible, meaningful, and lasting difference in people's lives!
The Life of A Single Mom	201262	2	/users/profile/262730	Tonya03	General Member of the Public	5	05/29/2014	I have been attending Healing Place Church off and on for the past 8 months and I finally realized it was time to commit myself fully to the Lord, so I went on the website to see about groups that I could connect to and I found this one. Immediately after I requested information and prayer I was contacted by someone and just felt so much love! I will be attending the meetings starting in August and I am so excited to begin this journey and be able to relate to other single moms out there. Not only did I get an immediate response but I was sent a list of many organizations out there that help single moms such as myself. I literally had tears because I didn't know there were so many resources out there that are willing to help. Again I can't wait to be apart of a group of strong spiritual women.

The Life of a Single Mom has impacted me on so many different levels because they have a real,  personal, intimate relationship with the people who they are helping.   This ministry strengthens the lives of the people they touch which makes a huge difference not only in the life of that person, but when their lives are better and more at peace, that happiness and peace reaches into society.  I'm very honored and feel very privleged to be a part of The Life of a  Single Mom Ministry.
The Life of A Single Mom	201245	3	/users/profile/262711	Beth101	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	This was the first group that I felt like I belonged in whole heartedly.  Not only were they Godly women, but they were women like me.  There was no judgement made against me because I was a single mom, instead I was welcomed with open arms.  I knew from the first meeting that I was where I was supposed to be, that God brought me to that group.  Just when you feel like people don't understand what you are going through, you go to the group and find women with the same struggles and feelings.  We are taught to rely on God for ALL things.   If you have not gone to a meeting because you were afraid, know that I was afraid too.  But I will be there with a smile and open arms because The Life of A Single Mom was there when I was afraid.

They are the only no kill shelter in the area. Their dedicated volunteers work miracles. Best place to donate to to really help the animals!

Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	191671	1	/users/profile/250172	Chameleon720	Client Served	1	12/27/2013	I have donated annually to the SPCA since 2000.  I noticed that this was a no kill shelter and thought I would do some research. In doing my research, I came across a beautiful cat that I wanted to adopt. I filled out the application and the person reviewing the application said that I was denied because they could not locate records to the animals that I recently inherited this year (May and August) due to loss of my mother AND my brother. I have no idea where these records would be, but I have taken responsibility for their animals and given them a loving home. I wanted to adopt a cat and had to call back to find out the status because nobody called me.  The woman I contacted was incredibly rude telling me that they sent me an email because she was copied on it. I asked what it said and she didn't want to tell me. I asked if she could resend it or tell me about it since I was supposed to have received it anyway. She then told me that I was denied. I asked why and she told me that she was at work and would not discuss it. So I asked her to call me back when she had a chance when she was not at work. She said ok, and about a month later, I'm still waiting on my phone call... I'm not holding my breath on that. Her name was Cathy...  (Ginny in the shelter was very kind and seemed to genuinely love animals and treated people kindly as well. She was the only person that wasn't unpleasant in my experience. ) It breaks my heart to see animals sharing a cage with other animals for MONTHS and this organization begging for money to fund their building and care for these animals when they won't allow these pets to go into a loving home and won't take the time to understand each individual case before deciding whether it not someone is worthy of a pet.  I do not recommend doing business with this organization because my application for a pet was handled poorly. The employee/volunteer that I spoke with was very disrespectful and condescending. She had also never heard of pet armor (same active ingredient as frontline), and she said that I needed records of using frontline on the pets that I inherited. Frontline and pet armor are two over the counter treatments that I would have to keep receipts for in order to adopt a pet... Ridiculous!
Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	191490		/users/profile/249986	nolapearl	Donor	5	12/25/2013	I became aware of ARNO when I adopted a dog from this organization.  ARNO is an all volunteer no kill facility.  I donate dog food on a regular basis.  Every time I arrive,  there are volunteers taking the dogs for walks, others cleaning out the cages.  Every time I go to a festival, ARNO volunteers are out there with pets to adopt.  I am constantly amazed at the dedication these people have on an ongoing basis to care for the animals at the shelter.

I stopped in with hopes of looking for him and was told to leave flyer, but I couldn't go in to look at cats. The person I spoke with was less than friendly. Another person I know also had a bad experience with a less than friendly comment that was made to them when they were also searching for a lost pet. And even another when they were trying to find a place for a lost dog they had found.

Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	191287		/users/profile/249711	Dawn73	Volunteer	4	12/20/2013	I started my saga as a rescuer of cats after Katrina.  I can't tell you how many wonderful hours I spent at ARNO is ungodly hot weather cleaning the kitty cages and talking to all the babies.  It is certainly some of the best times of volunteering career.  With little or no money they take as many animals as possible and try to find them homes.  The surroundings are not perfect, but this is not a perfect world.  If it was, there would be no strays and the shelters would have unlimited funds.  ARNO does what it says "Saving one until there are none".  
Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	142025		/users/profile/188445	an2688	Client Served	5	11/21/2012	We have ARNO to thank for our beautiful pup Penny, who was abandoned and left on the streets to fend for herself when her previous owner moved away and deserted her.  Thinking she was someone's lost dog, I posted numerous messages on various shelters' Facebook pages as well as Craigslist.  ARNO contacted me and worked tirelessly to trap her, nursed her back to health, gave her shelter, and provided her with medical care.  It is truly incredible and absolutely touching to see that they do this for many other animals, as many as they can reasonably and possibly care for.  It's important to remember they are a volunteer-driven, no-kill shelter that relies on the kindness of devoted animal lovers and charitable donations for their cause.  I don't know if I've ever seen a more selfless group of people; they truly love these animals and work around the clock to provide care, comfort, protection, and love for these poor babies.  On any given day at the shelter they're washing blankets and towels, scrubbing kennels and floors, walking and offering human kindness to their animals, and that's not to mention their tireless campaign to help each and every pet find a loving, forever home.  Of course, we asked to adopt our Penny and every day we are thankful to ARNO for bringing her to us.  She is such a joy and now lives happily with us and our four other dogs.  Thank you ARNO, for ours and Penny's happy ever after.  We are so humbled by everything you do.
Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	141728		/users/profile/188109	Callie Fitzgerald	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I decided to volunteer at ARNO one day thinking I had nothing to do that Saturday.  That one day got me hooked.  I have been there almost every Saturday since then for the past year and a half.  ARNO is the only no-kill shelter in the area and it is clear that everyone really cares about the animals in our care (even the little field mice that come around).  Some of our animals have been at ARNO for a couple of years but they don't even know they are missing anything.  They get all the love they could ever want until they find their forever home.  Although ARNO cannot always take in dogs and cats that are brought by, we still do what we can to get them to a home safely (ask the person who found them to foster until we can find them space, post pictures of them on facebook letting others know where he is and get him seen).  Over the time I have been there, ARNO has taken in an emaciated bull dog/pit mix found by my sister's job, a lab mix and her 8 newly born puppies found under my head start center in New Orleans East, and 2 pit bulls I found in New Orleans East.  All have been adopted except for the last two pit bulls, which will hopefully be adopted soon as well.  ARNO was unable to take in the last two mentioned dogs right away due to a lack of space, but everyone worked with me to post them on facebook continuously until we found them fosters and we could pull them from the kill shelter they had to be left at.  ARNO has rescued many dogs and cats and will continue to rescue many more with the help of you, the volunteers and the donors.  Noone can ever question if the volunteers at ARNO care about and love these animals.  ARNO is also one of only a couple places in the U.S. that takes in and rehabilitates feral dogs to trust the humans they never knew.  In the past 6 months, at least 3 feral dogs were adopted into loving homes where they know more love than they would have ever dreamed of.  These same dogs would not have made it out of another shelter alive, as they are the ones hiding in the back of their runs and getting overlooked because they are just too scared.  I honestly can't say enough good things about ARNO.  ARNO is always looking for more donations and more volunteers so they can keep it going and if you can't donate money or time or food and can't foster, sharing the word about ARNO and their mission will help us to find more of the animals homes and save more lives.
Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	141438		/users/profile/187744	Vicki26	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	ARNO is a no-kill, volunteer-driven charity that directs 100% of its monetary proceeds to animals.  Some resident dogs & cats have lived at ARNO for years & more show up on their doorstep daily so the facility is bursting at the seams. Incredibly dedicated volunteers are scheduled to work 3 shifts a day, 7 days a week, to care for their overflowing population (walking dogs, cleaning cat & dog cages, bathing animals, doing laundry, sorting clothing donations, washing dishes, etc).  The vet bills are staggering, some of which are for animals that were so injured or ill when they arrived that it was considered unlikely that the dog or cat would live.  I can't say enough positive things about this charity & the volunteers who work tirelessly for their furry residents.  ARNO needs your help in the form of volunteer hours, providing foster & adoptive homes, money to keep the lights on & food in the bowls, supplies & much more.  But don't take my word for it - please visit their facility to learn more.

Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	141391		/users/profile/187692	Marcela Z.	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I've always loved animals. They make me smile. They make me happy. I learned of ARNO after Katrina because I was so upset about everything that happened and I was so concerned about all the animals that were left behind... I wanted to help even a little. So I volunteered then, but only for one day, I'm sad to say. But a year ago I went back and have been going there as a regular volunteer. I love those babies. ARNO is a no kill shelter, we need more places like that, more safe heavens for the lost, the unwanted, the abused. The people at ARNO are wonderful, and everyday I'm amazed with their spirit, their kindness, their love for all those creatures. Every day I wish I was more like them, more like Kathy, more like Lise, more like Charlote, more like Ginnie, more like Laura. Everyday I keep trying to be better and help them save lives. ARNO IS A HOME FOR THE DOGS AND THE CATS. ARNO IS A FAMILY. WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE PLACES LIKE ARNO. Love you guys, thanks for all you teach me :)

I've never met people who work as hard as they do for the well being of the animals.  I am grateful that they take in and care for feral dogs as well as all other dogs and cats in need. I adopted two feral dogs from them five years ago and they have been the most wonderful additions to our family.  Please support this group.
Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	141378		/users/profile/187678	Monica28	Client Served	5	11/19/2012	I contacted ARNO about a pair of pair of (what I thought were) stray dogs that I would see every other morning on my way to work.  They responded to me right away and asked me to provide specific information such as the dogs' physical condition/appearance, exact locations, times, etc.  The next time I saw the dogs, they were wearing their tags, and I determined that they were not strays.  I contacted ARNO to let them know about that and they were very appreciative of the news. They also told me that if I ever saw the owner, I was within my rights to warn them about letting their dogs roam the streets without tags. Although ARNO did not physically get involved with this situation, I was very impressed with their responsiveness and willingness to assist these dogs. I have never met any of the staff in person, but based on this experience as well as their Facebook posts about their work, I believe that they are some of the most selfless and generous people I know.  ARNO is the epitome of a GREAT nonprofit and they deserve all of the success in the world.

Animal Rescue New Orleans Inc	141372		/users/profile/187674	sharonemma1216	General Member of the Public	2	11/19/2012	Contacted ARNO and spoke with a lady through email about six months ago (last message received on July 18) when my husband and I took in an olde english bulldog puppy rescued from a puppy farm by a friend. Although she is adorable, we weren't really planning on having a dog at the time, and didn't really have the financial ability to care for the dog's health problems. I was just starting a small company after being out of work for months. I contacted ARNO about possible adoption or even if they could just lend a helping hand in directing us to discounted services (the bulldog was not fixed, needed flee/heartworm, shots, and had a rash covering her belly and hind legs). I was asked to send pictures which I did, and to this day have yet to hear back from the service or receive any help. I would have been more than willing to give money to this organization in the future for any services rendered and continued donations as well. The situation as a whole is just frustrating. We still have that bulldog and have grown to absolutely adore her, and she has come a long way with my husband and I from the skittish, abused dog that walked through our doors. I would still love to hear from the organization in some way just to know that they actually care.

Louisiana School for Math Science and the Arts Foundation Inc.	30888	4	/users/profile/31830	lilla	Donor	5	02/25/2010	LSMSA was the best decision I ever made in my life.  I came from a small town, small school, where my perfect scores and mastery of standardized testing bored me to tears.  LSMSA gave me an environment filled with new expectations, new challenges, and healthy intellectual competition.  Also, the classes taken at LSMSA can be articulated into college courses, so not only does it prepare you for college life, it can give you a head start on your college education!LSMSA also gives you a new family, people you will be close to for a lifetime.  It builds connections, because it's an instant friendship if you run into any other alumni from the school.
Louisiana School for Math Science and the Arts Foundation Inc.	30743	4	/users/profile/31687	stacelab	Client Served	5	02/24/2010	I attended LSMSA and it changed my life.  It may sound dramatic...it is!  Though I, unlike some of my classmates, had attended a private school all of my life, including the first 2 years of high school, LSMSA opened up a new world for me.  I was able to truly learn how to study, how to be independent, to develop my talents and intellect.  When an individual is surrounded by other individuals who strive to be their best on a daily basis, it stands to  reason that that individual will raise the bar for themselves, thus creating a highly motivated and successful environment in which to strive.  LSMSA provides THAT kind of an environment.  The faculty and staff are a group of the most accomlished educators and they work hard to ensure the success of those students who wish to be successful.  Because I was often considered an outsider/"teacher's pet" in the schools I had attended prior to LSMSA because of the fact that I was a student who did well, I thrived at LSMSA because I was surrounded by some of the most brilliant students in the state of Louisiana.  It actually felt GREAT to no longer be on top and to have to WORK to get there.There are so many criteria that must be met to be eligible to attend LSMSA and so many programs offered at the school to hone students' abilities - both intellectually and creatively - it is a hidden treasure.LSMSA deserves every dollar of support and, in my opinion, a TON more, to continue this legacy of turning out some of the most intelligent, most talented, and well-rounded students in the state of Louisiana who then bring those talents elsewhere in the state and the world.The only thing that could possibly make LSMSA better is additional funding to allow the school to offer even more specialized programs and attract even more faculty talent.

They are truly a one-of-a-kind school in our nation. If only there were more schools like this one. LSMSA fosters not only a high level of creativity, but they also nurture those students who have a strong proclivity for math and science. It is an extremely well-rounded school and challenges the best and the brightest to go as far as their aspirations may take them. If students complete all levels of a certain subject matter, they are allowed to take college courses at the neighboring NSU campus. The faculty is very involved with helping students in reaching their academic and creative goals.  I remember the evening tutoring sessions available to all students. I was an actress at LSMSA. I got to perform as the leading role in several productions as well as sing and dance in the jazz ensemble. LSMSA helped me get theatre scholarships to college and today, I am a director in San Francisco, directing plays. Please fund LSMSA. The students there will be your future.

After graduation, wherever these students go, they bring a rare combination of creativity, rationality, and intelligence.As a student, LSMSA offered me a formal introduction to dance and I loved performing for the first time ever as part of the Spring Ensemble Concert.  Also, the school helped me develop photography skills through dark-room access.  Involvement in the media club and was one of the best opportunities I have ever had to be able to use the tools that are so necessary to be an artist.As an alumni, I frequently attend student art showcases and am constantly amazed at the high caliber of work that LSMSA students are able to produce.

The process of leaving home was laready two years behind me and I was able to focus on my matriculation.  Again, WOW!!  I am already planning my 4 and 2 year olds for an experience like it.  I also have friends who are mother's of children ready for such a school and always provide them with the needed positive feedback to move forward with their decisions.  Thanks MOM and DAD for letting me go.  I'll never be able to repay them for that tough decision.
Louisiana School for Math Science and the Arts Foundation Inc.	28894	5	/users/profile/29943	arussell	Volunteer	5	02/18/2010	The Louisiana School caters to students pursuing every interest imaginable, from modern physics to sculpture. The unique atmosphere allows young academics to have a chance to further their knowledge in subjects that are VERY different from one another. At other high schools, a student interested in the arts and science would have to choose one or the other, but the Louisiana School allows us to continue with both.While I attended LSMSA, I was able to specialize in advanced biology courses while pursuing a love of black and white photography ( I got to work in a REAL photo lab, developing and printing my own works). No other place in the state would allow me to enjoy both. ANYONE wishing to have a quality education, whether you have narrowed your studies to a specific field or if you wish to sample many subjects, should consider the Louisiana School. It has been the most rewarding experience of my entire life.

I can honestly say LSMSA has been a significant reason for the successes my children have had in college and life.  They learned to live, think, and write independently and creatively.  I have continued to volunteer for the school because I feel so strongly that it offer the best education anywhere and requires all the support I can give.

LSMSA enriched my life in many ways when I was a student, and the connections and lessons continue to be a significant part of my life 21 years after my graduation. I was not an arts major and honestly don't have any artistic talent. However, the arts program at LSMSA gave me a foundation for more informed appreciation of the arts. The artistic environment helped me think more creatively. I was also exposed to people who have gifts and world viewpoints that are different from mine. It's amazing to consider that 21 years later, some of those same people are still challenging me to grow beyond my comfort zone.

Her talent in dance was enhanced far more than I ever expected.  She left with a much broader view of the world.  She was well prepared for the university programs both in academics and in dance.  While dance is not her career it continues to nurture her soul.  LSMSA is responsible for laying that foundation.  I can't encourage others enough to take advantage of the opportunity to attend.

How can you not love a school that offers a chemistry class where you learn about acidity through art preservation and get to make your own pigments?Or how about a class in which you learn where history and art collide? Leonardo da Vinci painting The Last Supper some time around when Columbus is setting sail for the Americas. Nothing sticks with you more than making connections like that.Or how about having not just a one period art class, but having sculpture, painting, printmaking and drawing? These were all the classes I had at the Louisiana School for Math Science and the Arts.I don't know what's a better testament to how well the school provided a solid arts education: the fact that I remember so many lessons 23 years later or that 23 years later, I am still a working artist.

Louisiana School has been able to create an environment uniquely suited to its role within the state of providing largely underprivileged gifted and talented students with the education they deserve. Were it not for Louisiana School, not only would my high school education have been very different, but my life path overall.

Southern Heritage Air Foundation	302020	1	/users/profile/393142	Bobbie14	Volunteer	5	08/31/2016	I grew up around airplanes, lived on a small grass airstrip south of Atlanta. I met my future husband at an aerobatic club dinner, and who wouldn't be thrilled with my wedding present from him,  a Dehavilland Chipmunk! After many long years, I found myself a widow and moved to Mississippi to be near family. Longing for the sound of airplane engines,  the rapport with people who could speak ailerons and rudders, and the joy of hanger flying, I discovered the Southern Heritage Air Foundation. This was the warmest, friendliest bunch of aviation enthusiasts I had met in years, and I quickly became a volunteer. The museum itself, dedicated to WWII and heroes from MS who served,  is a plethora of information, a place  where one could learn something different with every visit. The static display of airplanes and the thrill of the P-51 when it gets fired up takes me way back in time--home again.

Southern Heritage Air Foundation	245565	2	/users/profile/332743	SAMSG	General Member of the Public	5	06/18/2015	This museum is always adding new memorabilia and hosting unique events! I am never disappointed when I visit, and I refer others to this hidden treasure too!
Southern Heritage Air Foundation	242265	2	/users/profile/329033	ashgatian	General Member of the Public	5	05/06/2015	I think the Southern Heritage Air Foundation is a wonderful organization. They do a great job organizing events for the public and provide a much needed service for the area. The Warrior Bonfire Project is presented very well by the organization and is much needed for our veterans. The hangar luncheons are always well done and the field trips are very much enjoyed by school children from Louisiana and Mississippi. Keep up the good work!
Southern Heritage Air Foundation	242089	3	/users/profile/328820	sBell11	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2015	The Southern Heritage Air Foundation is a unique and wonderful place. They have the ability to fully serve the community, from the smallest of children with their ability to customize field trips and tours, to the oldest of honored veterans with a free lunch to all present and past service men at their monthly lunch "Hangout at the Hanger." Families may visit the museum and get a hands experience of what their families went through in the Armed Services. The museum even allows people to get up close and personal with a variety of their aircraft. The Southern Heritage Air Foundation is able to serve the community like no other non-profit. If one is ever passing through North Eastern Louisiana, it is definitely worth the stop. It is highly recommended by all that have visited it.   
Southern Heritage Air Foundation	242076	3	/users/profile/328801	vlmekus	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2015	The Southern Heritage Air Foundation is a great non-profit organization, aimed at education and commemoration. They have a unique collection of memorabilia, with stories that will make you laugh and cry. On top of what they offer on a daily basis, the foundation does an immense amount of work with veterans and active military by hosting luncheons and once in a lifetime events. Through the foundation, I have met individuals from all over the world and heard both famous and untold stories from the generation that sacrificed so much for this country. On top of the history, they also offer rides in their airplanes, some of which are vintage! Their work is truly inspiring. 
Southern Heritage Air Foundation	242073	5	/users/profile/328797	PatMek	Board Member	5	05/03/2015	The Southern Heritage Air Foundation and Museum is a unique place that brings history to life through their WWII and Vintage aircraft that still fly, features local and regional WWII Veterans and their stories, offers a rides program in their planes, and hosts a number of events such as a bi-Annual Air Show, group tours, monthly hangar lunches where all veterans eat for free, and various programs of living history such as visits from the Colling's Foundation with their B-17 and B-24, A Holocaust survivor coming to tell her story, visits from Jan Thompson and Loretta Swit featuring their documentary "Never the Same: The Prisoner of War Experience and more. You never know who you will meet when you stop by! History, Planes and Heroes! They've got 'em!
Friends of Cantera Inc	323168		/users/profile/417405	Camv	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2017	I had the opportunity to visit CANTERA in Nicaragua in 2011 as part of a high school delegation. The impact that CANTERA has on the lives of children, adolescents, young adults, and adults, women and men, in their rural and urban programs is tangible. In only ten days, I visited various urban community centers and rural communities and witnessed how the people received that CANTERAs accompaniment provided access to resources and tools that empowered them to take charge of the development of their communities. Friends of Cantera, in the US,  has an active role in helping CANTERA complete its mission by raising the financial support and creating the human relationships and solidarity that bring sustainability to the on-the-ground work in Nicaragua. I am proud to continue to know and support Friends of Cantera in their mission to support  CANTERA and the Nicaraguan people
Friends of Cantera Inc	272252		/users/profile/361258	Mary401	Volunteer	5	11/17/2015	I traveled to Nicaragua with a service trip in high school.  We were welcomed by Friend of  Cantera, some of the greatest, friendliest, most wonderful people I have ever met.  They made us feel at home and welcomed.  Together we traveled to different communities around Managua, creating relationships, and making connections with the people in those communities.  Although we were there to play a small part to help the communities, I felt far more rewarded by those that we met.  They shared with my their joys in the simplicities of life.  All this thanks go Cantera.
Friends of Cantera Inc	224543		/users/profile/288306	maggie_hardman5	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	Cantera was an incredible experience. it was the first mission work I had done that taught me to stop trying to fix everything by what I could give or donate, and to truly understand the people first. Although i was not part of the program when it first began, I was able to learn about it. Instead of trying to temporarily fix the problem the creators of Cantera worked from the ground up. They took time to learn about the people, and to understand what they truly needed to make their lives better. i was able to meet some of the people who had been helped by Cantera from a very young age, and they were great! By starting to help children young, they steadily instill good qualities in them, that they will hopeful instill in their children. The youth centers give the kids a way to express themselves in non-violent ways and it also teaches responsibility.  The rural area that was helped by Cantera was also incredible! Instead of giving the hungry families food, they taught them how to farm vegetables. The way of Cantera fixes problems for the long time, and not for the short term.  Overall a great great program! I loved it and I loved all the people I was blessed to encounter along the way! 
Friends of Cantera Inc	223526	1	/users/profile/287276	KimHardman	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	I was led to Cantera through my stewardship at St. Aloysius Catholic Church.  The Cantera Mission Trip to Nicaragua is a ministry that is part of our Social Responsibility Commission at our church.  I began to hear more and more about the Cantera organization  through the chairperson of the Nicaraguan Mission Trip.  I felt called to serve through his passion and personal testimony and  through the workings of the Holy Spirit.  As a long  standing steward for local organizations such as St. Vincent de Paul, stepping outside of my  comfort zone into an international mission trip in Central America, was a REALLY big step....but one of the best steps I ever took in my life!  I immediately felt comfortable outside of my comfort zone and knew right away why God had sent me there.  I am most grateful and blessed that I was able to share this everlasting experience with my 20 year old daughter. I can't think of any other trip with my daughter throughout our lifetime that was more meaningful and memorable than our mission trip together to Nicaragua. We were wowed by Cantera - the organization itself...its extraordinary and dedicated leadership and staff... the loving and humble  and hospitable Nicaraguan people we visited in both the rural and urban communities... and the everlasting fellowship that came to our church group and to our friends of Cantera from one week together. I hope and pray that we touched their hearts and lives as much as they touched ours.  I also hope and pray that we in the US  can learn from the successful workings of the Cantera organization and bring this back home to our own youth and family. It is truly a God thing....how this place came into being and has existed for nearly 25 years in spite of so much strife...it's purely and simply a God thing.   The Nicaraguans are so blessed to have Cantera to empower them, to save lives, to build better lives, to provide comfort and security and fellowship and and a future filled with light and love. These are our brothers and sisters in Christ, and as such, it is our blessing to reach out and to help them through donations to sustain this great organization and also to go there and be in their presence and get to know them.  The rest of your life will be better because of it.  I wholeheartedly encourage anyone, and if possible with your children,  to make this giant step across the border and into another beautiful part of God's great kindgom.  You will be blessed beyond measure and forever grateful.   
Friends of Cantera Inc	213148	1	/users/profile/276294	mfbergeron	Donor	5	09/03/2014	I have been involved with the Cantera organization since 1998. I have personally witnessed the effectiveness of their programs in serving Nicaraguan youth. On my recent visit in August 2014, I was able to see the fruits of the program as I re-connected with young adults I originally met many years ago who had just become engaged with the program back then. Over this 14 year span, they have grown and matured and become community leaders. They continue to be engaged with Cantera and give back so much to the youth who are now involved. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Cantera's programs over time and that the model of popular education it embraces really works.  If Cantera was only a youth program, it would still be a wonderful charity to support, however, IT IS SO-OO-OO MUCH MORE! It provides community health programs, rural assistance programs, leadership development programs, spiritual development, women's programs, and programs to combat violence. If we had an organization is the U.S. that did half of the things that Cantera does, it would cost billions of dollars to operate. Yet, this Nicaraguan-led organization continues to do the most unbelievable work, making every penny donated count. I think it is very important that the Cantera organization is organized and led by Nicaraguans who know the needs of the people, what works best, and understand the reality of the situation. The Friends of Cantera provides fundraising support to Cantera and  financial accountability to donors. A donation made through Friends of Cantera will help ensure the continuation of the amazing work Cantera is doing in Nicaragua. 
Friends of Cantera Inc	211103		/users/profile/273963	rcostellonic13	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	As a Jesuit Volunteer for CANTERA in Nicaragua I have had the incredible opportunity to learn from the ground-up work, educational styles, and methodology of a phenomenal organization which helps individuals transform their reality and personally and communally achieve their dreams. CANTERAs work is done by generous dreamers who live to empower others, most of them doing so voluntarily, but it goes without saying that financial backing is required as well and this is why Friends of CANTERA is such a vital support for our organization--they support the needs that Nicaraguans see, no strings attached, as the saying goes. We are blessed to have recieved this kind of support and are lucky Friends of CANTERA has the vision for such support to increase.
Friends of Cantera Inc	210932		/users/profile/273747	RNRosalyn	Volunteer	5	08/16/2014	I have served as a full-time volunteer with Cantera's youth program for the last year.  During the year, I have witnessed time and time again the difference that Cantera's support makes in the life of young people.  The youth and young adults who get involved in Cantera become markedly different people through the formation, empowerment, and opportunities they receive from Cantera.  Just to give a few examples, there are workshops and programs on personal development, violence prevention, gender equality, and the environment.  The participants then use what they have learned to benefit their whole community, for example, forming an Ecological Brigade in a primary school and giving violence prevention workshops in secondary schools.  Cantera's work, both with youth and with other sectors, is indispensable to individuals, families, communities, and Nicaragua.
Friends of Cantera Inc	210701		/users/profile/273489	Andy TY	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	What can I say about CANTERA? I have been a volunteer here with the organization for almost two years and through those two years, I have fallen in love with the accompaniment and work that CANTERA provides to the most poor communities in and around Managua, the capital city. I work primarily with the immersion and exchange program as a delegations coordinator, receiving groups and visitors from outside the country who come here to work and learn more about Nicaragua and CANTERA. I have personally seen the transformation in myself as a volunteer with the organization and also in the people that have come down on week-long trips based on the relationships that they have created and developed over time.  Along with the work that CANTERA does in the communities with children, adolescents, youth, men and women, CANTERA promotes building inter-cultural relationships, creating links between people here in Nicaragua and those from other countries. I am a strong believer that in building these relationships can we then together dream and then gradually transform our own society - a better society for all people.
Friends of Cantera Inc	210672		/users/profile/273457	Meg2457	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2014	I was able to visit Cantera last November and let me say, it was truly life changing! It far exceeded my expecations.  Cantera is more about teaching individuals to help themselves, rather than giving, giving, and giving.  It gives them resources and teaches them how to use it to better themselves and their everyday life.  The mission of Cantera is amazing and I wish it could be implemented in the U.S. I highly recommend learning more about the Cantera mission and visiting and observing how it is implemented. Observing a mother and father who built their home, floors made of mud, and blankets hanging to seperate rooms, proudly stand with a grin from ear to ear, and welcome you into their "dream home", they built as a family, was truly life changing, and a moment I will cherish forever. 
Friends of Cantera Inc	210671		/users/profile/273455	thesummit	Board Member	5	08/14/2014	I have been a board member for Friends of Cantera for the last year. I have also visited/worked with Cantera, the Nicaraguan NGO it supports 5 times. This a life changing organization. Cantera has a proven track record of working with communities from the individual up by first helping individuals exam themselves by looking their past, then looking at the present, all while using growth and forgiveness to help empower the person to make the best decisions for themselves and their future. People that have been through the program have consistently shown a genuine and sustainable stewardship for their family, community and nation. Cantera puts on workshops in gender equality, violence, health, environmental action, and much much more. Their reach throughout Nicaragua has been tremendous and unique.  The most important thing to understand about Cantera is that they are helping to empower the people so that they themselves can create a healthy, sustainable future for their people. Simply pouring money into the nation is not a long term solution. The money donated to Cantera is used to put on workshops and work closely with communities of all ages to create that self-made sustainable culture of success.
Friends of Cantera Inc	201963		/users/profile/263563	Guardabarranco	Volunteer	5	06/05/2014	I volunteered with Cantera for over two years, and I think that it's a wonderful organization!  Cantera truly empowers adults, teenagers, and children in Nicaragua.  I worked in rural areas, and it was clear that Cantera had a history of working with the community for sustainable development, economic opportunities and gender equity.  Friends of Cantera provides financial support to Cantera's programs in a very important way - unlike money from grants, money from Friends of Cantera can be used to address  community needs and initiatives as they arise.  There is a relationship of learning and solidarity between Cantera and Friends of Cantera.
Friends of Cantera Inc	192990		/users/profile/252062	Butlererin	Volunteer	5	01/23/2014	My mission trip to Nicaragua through Cantera was an experience that changed my life by giving me a whole new perspective. Cantera focuses these trips on immersion and service in the form of building relationships with others. Other areas of Cantera focus more on service in the form of giving to the poor and needy. We saw and worked with some of these areas of service, but our trip mostly focused on immersion by learning about and with the people of Nicaragua. It has been almost a year since the mission trip and my life has been changed, in both large and small ways. Every day of my life, I have lived a life with education, food and water, and a home. Every day after my trip with Cantera, I have noticed these blessings. I have become exceedingly grateful for the opportunities and lifestyle that I have been given after seeing the comparative poverty, and yet overwhelming happiness, of the people of Nicaragua. In the larger picture of my life, I have realized the huge need for service in our changing world, where the gaps in the global community are closing but the gaps in equality, in rights and in wealth, are as far apart as ever before.  I have decided to focus my life on this great need. I am going to study social justice in college and hopefully go on to make a difference in the world with my work after college. This work may be in a third world country or even in my own hometown. In Nicaragua, I saw the similarities between Managua and my own city of Detroit. Both of these cities have histories of and difficulties with gang violence, poverty, and gender relations. Seeing the work done in Managua by Cantera has shown me possible solutions to Detroits obstacles. I hope to work in Detroit and with Detroit to solve these problems to see my city grow and flourish once again.  My dreams and realities have been altered by my experience with Cantera and for this I am eternally grateful. I know that Cantera will continue to have this impact on many others for years to come, in addition to having a huge impact on Nicaragua through the other branches of its organization.
Friends of Cantera Inc	191361	1	/users/profile/249805	melanie209	Board Member	5	12/22/2013	I chose to dedicate my time and financial support to Cantera after making a personal visit to Nicaragua several years ago.  I cannot express how touched I was by the spirit and determination of the people who have so little to live on.  A donation of even $100 goes 10 times further down there than it does in the US.  Sisters Anabel, Mary and Dianne are amazing leaders of the organization.  They have done so much to bring hope to the barrios and rural areas of Nicaragua.
Friends of Cantera Inc	189083	3	/users/profile/246818	Amy Pizzolato	Volunteer	5	11/22/2013	I want to share with you something that has transformed my life, Cantera. This organization is full of warm hearts and loving people and I am so greatful that my path lead me to be a part of them.    MY STORY; I am not the typical mission traveler. I am a wife and mother of 3 children, a nurse and the most daring thing I had done prior to traveling to an unknown country for a mission was snow skiing and horseback riding in the mountains. I am not in this as a risk taker. I am in this because I prayed one day to God to give me a deeper since of myself to share with my family. I understood scripture to know that we are here to do good for mankind but I just had not found it in my life to really believe I was carrying out God's wishes. Within 24 hours, I was aware of this mission to Nicaragua with an organization called Cantera and I took a leap of faith and joined the mission trip that was booking flights within 48 hours. I was nervous but I believed God was leading me, and boy was I right! I have now been on 3 mission trips and hope to continue 2 times a year. These trips have change my perspective and I am now a better person, better mother and better wife. I have a lot to learn and a long way to go but I am so thankful that I took that leap of faith to go out of the country to become a part of Cantera. I return from my trips with a love that I have never before seen or experienced. The youth that Cantera work with showed me a love that is stronger than anything our daily culture shares. It is without judgement, without bias, without strings. I saw this and brought it home to my household to try to emulate it and I want to share it with my friends and community as well. I have never felt so much in God's hands as when I am at Cantera experiencing the people of Nicaragua sharing their struggles and ending up in grace. I hope that many of you decide to support Cantera in its beautiful efforts to enhance the lives of the people of Nicaragua!! Thank you Cantera and God Bless each of you every day!
Friends of Cantera Inc	188940	3	/users/profile/246599	JMillsBR	Volunteer	5	11/20/2013	What a week of witnessing and experiencing transformation through community and empowerment!!! Perhaps the only way to explain what I love so much about Cantera is to explain what I have struggled with in other volunteer groups, both informal and formal.   I have witnessed first hand instances where well-intentioned people actually hinder or hurt the individual in need.  The helper/volunteer seems to consume the interaction with the busyness of "doing" and moves their own agenda forward.   In those instances, the person in need almost becomes a bystander in their own life as the helper consumes the interaction.  I walk away from these interactions frustrated, deflated, and ultimately disappointed.   At Cantera, however, what appears to be at the core of their volunteer efforts is the fundamental belief in the power of each individual; and that as individuals, we are the best authors of our destiny.  As such, volunteer efforts necessarily shift from a "doing for"mindset to one that encourages, builds, strengthens,  and develops that which is innate in each one of us.  This shift is life-giving and gives rise to self-sustaining communities instead of dependence on the helper.    LOVED LOVED LOVED being a part of this!!  
Friends of Cantera Inc	188679	2	/users/profile/246236	Margarita2	Volunteer	5	11/15/2013	CANTERA for me is much more than an organization, it is an energy that moves through all of us who have had the opportunity to be touched in some way by its mission.  I have been part of the CANTERA team since 2009 and have witnessed firsthand the beautiful transformations that occur through CANTERAs approach to community organizing.  It is a unique approach which I have yet to find in another institution, viewing each individual (no matter age) as an integral person with not only rights, but dreams.  Through harvesting the energy behind those dreams and working alongside community members, real transformations occur.  Transformations such as: youth from rival gangs coming together to play soccer and through that space becoming leaders on a variety themes such as non-violence and gender equality in their schools and neighborhoods; formation of community committees in rural areas leading to the creation of wells now bringing water to families who before walked miles every day to get what has always been just a few steps away for me; adolescents using social theater to raise awareness in their neighborhoods about discrimination, HIV and early pregnancies; healing of trauma through art therapy and holistic spirituality; organic family gardens providing fruits and vegetables to supplement a diet of rice and beans; and the list continues.  I have walked with the people that CANTERA accompanies for over four yearsI am a witness to the transformations they have experienced and the dreams they have for a new tomorrow.  At the same time the people here are witnesses to my own personal transformation that has occurred through my time with CANTERA.   While CANTERA was originally founded to contribute to a more just, equal and sustainable society in Nicaraguait has become an even larger international movement.  At first glance I was in awe experiencing personal transformations among Nicaraguans leading to positive changes at the family, community and even national level here but now I am equally in awe of personal transformations from those who visit us from abroad and collaborate with our mission.   It is our hope that this energy, which I call CANTERA, will not only lead to social change here in Nicaragua but systemic change worldwide.   
Friends of Cantera Inc	188538	1	/users/profile/246042	Sandra JB	Donor	5	11/14/2013	Friends of Cantera supports the NGO (non-governmental organization) called "CANTERA" that operates in Nicaragua.  The work this organization does is life changing and life enhancing for the people who participated it its programs.  Cantera offers people a "helping hand up, not a hand out".  Their programs begin with the operation of pre-schools for young kids and reach into every age group.  Perhaps their most important work is with the youth of Nicaragua - encouraging them to continue with their educations, to get involved with and stay involved in their local communities, and to work for a better neighborhood, community or city.  Nicaragua, with its climate, is full of beautiful plants.  I am reminded of the expression, "BLOOM  WHERE  YOU  ARE  PLANTED" because Cantera helps it participants to do just that:  to take their reality of their lives - be it in a city, barrio or rural farm - and to make the very best of their opportunities.  Cantera encourages them to create a dream for their world, and then gives them the skills and tools needed to fulfill those dreams.  The concepts of Cantera, applied in Nicaragua, are having a very positive "ripple effect" across the country.  If applied to the world, we would have a much better world!  This is a remarkable organization!
Friends of Cantera Inc	188373	1	/users/profile/245782	GREGB	Volunteer	5	11/12/2013	I have been involved with Friend of Cantera for a number of years as a volunteer here in the United States. While I had heard of the many good things that they had helped to start and continually support in Nicaragua, I had never experienced there works first hand until recently when I went on a mission trip to Nicaragua. This trip brought home to me loud and clear that the people working with the program are top notch individuals that are making a real change for the better in the lives of the Nicaraguan people that they work with. They do this not by just giving, but more by enabling these people in Nicaragua to take charge of their own lives and better them. Those Nicaraguans that work with the program learn the virtues of education, family values, sexual responsibility and gender equality as well as many other values that allow for a fuller life. I met many young people that will certainly help change the Nicaraguan society for the better. Nicaragua is a very poor country economically speaking, but its people are rich with the spirit of kindness. By its works, Friends of Cantera is helping to change lives of the Nicaraguan people for the better. It is providing the opportunity for these people to achieve their full potential in life. I am amazed at how well the organization uses it limited resources for the benefit of its important mission
Friends of Cantera Inc	165649	4	/users/profile/220158	raetzsch	Volunteer	5	08/21/2013	I travel twice a year to Nicaragua to work with Cantera. Cantera has been working in Nicaragua for over 20 years. It's mission has been to help the people they serve develop a new way to live their own lives: a way where they play a role in determining their own futures; develop their own dreams and, with Cantera's assistance, gain the skills to make their dreams a reality. Cantera is as much about building people up and giving them dreams, rather than just building physical structures. The two major areas of society that Cantera is directly involved with are rural community development and urban youth formation. Present in all of Cantera's programs are core principals that promote gender equality, spiritual formation, human growth, recognizing the talents of each individual, whether they be in art, music, dance, sport...whatever gifts they have, Cantera seeks to help those in their programs develop those gifts. Canteras youth centers have taken hundreds of children from gangs and abusive family life to a place of healing and spirituality. Through my work with Cantera, I have experienced my own conversion and transformation. Transformation comes when something inside us shifts, and, despite ourselves, we find that we are no longer the person we used to be. Cantera provides a mission experience in a way that will also transform the lives of those we meet, and even those we love back home. I have experienced a deep transformation through my work with Cantera. It was so strong that I vowed to carry it back home with me and share it with those I love - my family, friends, anyone I encounter. It is as though I have become an extension of Cantera here at home. That is the true beauty of the work Cantera does: not just changing Nicaragua, but changing the world.
Friends of Cantera Inc	160379	2	/users/profile/212652	sjbfox1	Volunteer	5	06/11/2013	I have been to Nicaragua 4 times since 2005 and have observed the oustanding work that Cantera does.  This is an amazing organization!  "Friends of Cantera" is an organization in the US that supports the work in Nicaragua by Cantera.  They begin working  with your people of pre-school age in inner city barrios.  Many of those children are still in the program in their teens and early 20's, helping to train the next generation of younger children.  The many programs that Cantera operates on a limited budget is mind boggling!  They help farmers in rural areas; created a bee-keeping cooperative among women to raise funds by selling honey;   provide access to text books for school children (schools are free in Nica but the text books are not);  teach classes in art, music, folk dance, karate & other activities to keep teens out of gangs; provide scholarships for promising students to take university level courses; foster a concern for the environment among their participants in order to help protect the natural beauty in Nica.  The concept of gender equality runs through all of the programs, beginning with their youngest participants, so that the plight of girls and women is better. Perhaps best of all is that they work to develop the SPIRITUAL  SIDE of their participants, so that they come to believe in themselves and are willing to create a better life for themselves; come to respect themselves and other people; have hope in their abilities.  Cantera intentionally chooses to work among the poorest people in Nica, and helps to realize what they dream of for their communities and families...and then they help equip them with the tools to achieve these goals.  They have received some grants from foreign countries but as international funds dry up, the Friends of Cantera in the US are working hard to keep their programs fully operational.  Many people in the US and in Nicaragua volunteer their services with this organization because it touches the heart and soul of people in a unique way.  
Goodwill Industries of North Louisiana, Inc.	27530	2	/users/profile/28614	diana1	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	Over the past several years, I have worked with Goodwill and found that they are an excellent community resource.  Their staff members not only provide great services that help mainstream their clients back to becoming productive members of community, their staff also provides support for numerous other community nonprofit and for profit organizations.
Goodwill Industries of North Louisiana, Inc.	27462	3	/users/profile/28553	besselder	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	My experience with Goodwill is rather unusual.  I am working with another nonprofit in the area and we are in the process of working towards certification through a state program of excellence.  We have turned to Goodwill Industries of No Louisiana as a model and mentor.  The incredible lengths the staff and board have gone through to establish thoughtful and well written policies is commendable.  They have also thoroughly researched and established clear and concise written procedures for their operations.

They are very passionate about the job they do. Their heart is in their work and they truly care about their staff and those they serve - no matter which program they may be working at the time.

Goodwill Industries of North Louisiana, Inc.	25505	1	/users/profile/26508	Glenda	Board Member	5	01/13/2010	I had the opportunity to serve as a member of the Goodwill Industires of North Louisiana Board of Directors for six years.  All I really knew about the organization was their ability to accpet donations of many varieties and place those donatiions for resale in their stores.  I had been among those donors for many years, but had never visited their retail stores.Having served on several commuinity non-profit boards and working as an administrator in public higher education, I was unprepared for the depth of learning I was about to encounter along with a true education of how to run a true non-profit that is totally dependent upon it's own operations -- no government handouts.Without hesitation, I state that Goodwill Industries of NW Louisiana is the most efficient, effective and ethical non-profit I have ever been associated.  Their staff is professional on every level, yet they also possess the compassion needed to help the people they truly serve -- challenged individuals who want to restart their lives and find a job.  Being a part of Goodwill changed my life forever.  Being part of a hands-on experience of helping others less fortunate than I introduced me to individuals with courage and pride, people seeking dignity through work and independence.  Goodwill is so much more than operating a retail store and providing bargains to people on limited budgets -- which it does quite well.  It truly changes people's lives through the power of education and jobs.  The organization is a local and national treasure.

Martin Luther King Health Center	199678		/users/profile/260677	Christina70	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/06/2014	WOW, this is just a great place to work, volunteer and to be a patient. The staff are so friendly and genuinely caring. The volunteers love learning about patient care, how to take vitals and learn how to chart properly. Our patients, that have chronic health conditions that need to be managed, such as diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, etc, can get the care they need and prescription medication for free. The services we provide are vital to our patients that can't afford health insurance. This care is provided by volunteer health care providers (doctors, nurses, NP's), grants to fund staff positions, volunteers, pharmaceutical companies and donations from the community.  I personally love sitting down with patients and helping them one-on-one learn about resources available in the community and at the MLK Health Center. I also love getting hugs from people who have been referred to so many other places before us and we are finally able to get them the help they need. It's a very rewarding position and I am truly glad to have the opportunity to work there and meet new people everyday.

I have never witnessed a healthcare agency able to do so much with so little!  The patients definitely touch my heart and serving them gives sustenance to my soul.  Whenever I encounter a "challenging" need in one of my patients there, I take it to Janet and her staff who all work to get that need met.  I am constantly in awe of the impact that we have on patients so in need.  I am honored to be part of the solution to that problem!

Organizations such as the Martin Luther King Health Center will continue to fill the void.  Thank god for the physicians, nurses, and other health care workers willing to donate time.  Considering the MLKHC provided over  $1.5 million in medications for free last year,  where would these individuals be without us.  As the MLKHC moves forward in its new facility the work of many volunteers will continue to be needed,  and as we look forward to providing more services.   What organizations gets more 'bang for its buck!"

Martin Luther King Health Center	192740		/users/profile/251700	angelicav40	Volunteer	5	01/17/2014	I have volunteered at this clinic for three years so far, and the work that they do is great! I'm a college student trying to make it in to medical school, and the quality of care they've exposed me to is excellent. Their organization is definitely one that makes patients comfortable, educates others to be healthy, and fills a hole in medical care that is often forgotten about. Five out of five stars, for sure!
Martin Luther King Health Center	192739		/users/profile/251698	dialanae	Volunteer	5	01/17/2014	MLK provides a much needed service to the community it serves.  Most, if not all, of the patients do not have insurance or an adequate income to pay for health care.  Not only does MLK meet their health needs but it also serves as a place to train future health care professionals.  As a nurse practitioner student, I have received tons of priceless experience at MLK.  
Martin Luther King Health Center	192726		/users/profile/251677	Pamela61	Volunteer	5	01/17/2014	MLK serves an important role in our community, making a difference in the lives of so many.  This clinic reperesents access that many would not have to health care.  It represents a learning environment for students and patients alike.  It represents a place for volunteers to feel welcome to give back to the community.  It's legacy continues to grow.  Sr. Margaret would be proud!
Martin Luther King Health Center	192721		/users/profile/251670	sswiger	Volunteer	5	01/17/2014	I started out at the MLK clinic as part of a school assignment, but I stayed at the clinic for the patients, other volunteers, and full time staff.  The clinic is an amazing place that is filled with hope and love. Every time I work I get to meet someone new and I get to hear their story! The staff at the MLK clinic is absolutely wonderful and a great joy to be around. They are so welcoming and caring for the volunteers and the patients. What I got with my volunteer was defiantly not what I expected and I can't wait to see what the future hold for the clinic and the patients we see. 
Martin Luther King Health Center	192700		/users/profile/251640	Jordan.ring42	Volunteer	5	01/16/2014	The MLK Health Center has created a unique model that threads community into the very fabric of their organization.  Patients are considered friends. Doctors are cheerleaders rallying for patient success. Volunteers are part of the family. Every member of the organization comes together to fill a desperate need in our community:  chronic care management for our uninsured and underinsured.  In addition to generating outstanding returns on investment the clinic offers real success stories. I volunteered with the clinic for over a year. In that time I was not only giving back to my community, I was building community too. 
Martin Luther King Health Center	192595		/users/profile/251491	Chris141	Volunteer	5	01/15/2014	Review  I started working with the Martin Luther King Health Center when I was looking for a project for some of my students. I didnt know much about them when I started. Theyve impressed me at every turn. The center runs very smoothly. Patients get a chance to talk with each other while they wait to see the doctor. Since many patients have chronic conditions, they see each other regularly. The doctors and nurses can take their time with each patients. They get to know each other see the progress everyone makes. As a result, the center feels more like a community than many health care facilities. Because of this environment, the patients follow their doctors advice and they get better.  As my students and I worked with the center, weve learned more about the details. The Martin Luther King Health Center provides an amazing return on investment. For every dollar spent at the center, they return $23 in value to the community. Weve talked with patients who were injured, so they couldnt work, and because they didnt have a job, they didnt have health insurance so they couldnt get treated. By providing the uninsured with free health care, the center enabled the patients to get healthy and return to work. The care the Martin Luther King Health Center provides can keep people from having to choose between buying their medicines and paying their rent. The service they provide is crucial for the patients and good for our community.  Id highly recommend working with the Martin Luther King Health Center in whatever way way you can. They have plans for expansion. They have many joint programs working with different populations, such as HOPE for the Homeless and St. Lukes Episcopal Mobile Medical Ministry. There is definitely a place for you.
Martin Luther King Health Center	192592		/users/profile/251487	NicolaSilvana	Volunteer	5	01/15/2014	As a volunteer at Martin Luther King Health Center, I have had the opportunity to see first hand the quality care and education patients are receiving. Healthcare volunteers are able to take their time educating and answering any patient questions. Written information and handouts are available upon request and provided as needed. There is a volunteer who specializes in diabetic dietary teaching and those sessions are available to all patients who come through the door. Families are welcome to come and sit with their family member in the waiting room. There is an on site translator so that language barrier is not an issue. MLK welcomes all patients with open arms and the staff is constantly working to obtain and provide for the best health care opportunities for its patients. Volunteering at MLK is truly a life changing experience as I have always left at the end of the day feeling like I have made a great difference in someone's life.

I met some amazing people with interesting stories, and I knew that the staff and volunteers who spent time at the Health Center were making a tangible difference in the Shreveport community. The staff at the Health Center showed dedication and passion in all facets of their work.  They are an outstanding nonprofit, and I expect they will continue to do great things for Shreveport citizens.  
Martin Luther King Health Center	192563		/users/profile/251450	cjhaas1986	Volunteer	5	01/14/2014	The Martin Luther King Health Center is by far the best clinic that I have ever volunteered at. I tried different places around this area when I moved here, and it didn't take me long to find which was the most organized, instructive, and efficient for the patient population. This community is very lucky to have the MLK Clinic and would be greatly benefited if there were more around. Not only is the healthcare top-notch, from local physicians and nurse practitioners volunteering their time, but also, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians also contribute their time, during the clinic, in ensuring that no mistakes are made with the patients' medications, which is very important. Furthermore, each patient is thoroughly-instructed on how to take their medication and the schedules which they should keep, also very important, especially in this population of patients, where literacy is lower than average. Patients are also instructed on their diseases and lifestyle changes they should pursue to ensure sustainable health.

I remember my uncle used to talk about them since we have ancestors buried in Lafayette cemetery #1. I came back to town a few weeks ago and decided to take a cemetery tour with them and I'm really glad I did. The tour-guide (I forget her name) was very knowledgeable and entertaining. I learned things about the cemeteries I never even knew, and I grew up here. No ghost stories, just history and facts. I learned a lot!  I recommend taking a tour with Save Our Cemeteries for anyone who really wants to learn about our cemeteries.

I miss you all and I am very pleased to write this review to thank you for helping me with my thesis about disaster recovery.  You are doing a wonderful job and I am proud to have studied with you. Thank you for letting me observe your work and for taking the time to help me understand what a disaster Katrina was and continues to be. You are to be commended for your ongoing efforts to help those who are still struggling to recover.

The Community Center helped my family so much back in 2006 and 2007 when we were trying to get FEMA and Road Home to work with us to get our house gutted and rebuilt. I don't know what we would have done without the computer lab and the free phones and faxing and the legal aid you all had there. I'm in Chicago now finishing up my degree in pre-med and I hope to get into Tulane med school so I'll be back in NOLA next year this time. And I'll probably come by with my sister to volunteer at the toy give away in December so I'll see you then. Thanks again for everything that you have done ever since Katrina.
Community Center of St Bernard	130182		/users/profile/175642	CassellaT	Volunteer	4	10/27/2012	Love the community center. Hate this website that lost my review so I have to retype it. But the Center is doing good work so I'm willing to try again. Anyway I worked there for week during alternative spring  break and the center was almost overwhelmed to the point that some people had to stand in the waiting area because there was no room. But the staff do a great job in spite of being short-handed and they really care so if you are in NOLA and you want to make a difference go there and help for a day. They need the help and you will really know that you've done something that made a difference. Not just a slogan, but for real.

Anyway this is a great group who do good work in spite of no support and sometimes active antagonism. Keep the faith!

Manners of the Heart	229751	2	/users/profile/293396	zangx	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	My wife and I attended a parent seminar of Jill's around 5 years ago.  We were blown away by the sheer simplicity and powerful truth of what she presented.  So much so that our two children soon became beneficiaries of her character-centric message.  Fast forward to my daughter, who graduated from middle school from St. Aloysius School in Baton Rouge and received one of two Kiwanis "Courtesy" awards, which is given by a school staff vote for the male and female "most courteous, kind and respectful" graduating students.  When I was invited to serve on the Manners board, I didn't hesitate, as I truly believe that what Manners offers, is what current and future generations need to regain from what was lost in this country following a worrisome string of "me" generations.

Their school programs are bringing the results we would all hope to achieve. In the school year 2012-2013 the Manners programs were in 5 East Baton Rouge Parish schools. Of these schools, 4 achieved recognition of being Top Gains schools. In school year 2013-2014, under a different grading system, 2 schools with Manners of the Heart programs made the same great improvement. The children love the classes and respond to the teaching. The stories are their favorite part of the curriculum. I would like to see more schools use the Manners of the Heart programs.
Manners of the Heart	227011		/users/profile/290736	SbrownLBA	Client Served	5	10/26/2014	Manners of the Heart is a great program that teaches kids to be  kind and considerate to each other and to adults.  It doesn't assume that kids will know these things already.  Each lesson is a well though out "burst" of explicit instruction on how to help your heart grow in "kindness".  I enjoy watching my students become transformed into purposefully caring individuals. 
Manners of the Heart	227005		/users/profile/290730	jhowardlabelleaire	Client Served	5	10/26/2014	The Manners of the Heart staff educate our students on anti-bullying strategies that help them to deal with peer pressure.  Their journal topics help students to reflect on the lessons and write about their personal feelings.  With all of the challenges our young people face, Manners of the Heart is a much needed support system that our students really benefit from.
Manners of the Heart	226779		/users/profile/212275	teachercesille	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2014	I have seen great changes among my students because of Manners of the Heart. My students are always anticipating their kind instructor every week.  I thank them deeply for creating a change in my students' lives.

Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area, Inc.	121362		/users/profile/165130	cdsteiner	Volunteer	5	08/24/2012	After a lifetime of living in New England my husband and I relocated to Baton rouge for his work.  I left behind a career in elder services to make this move and have wanted to connect with an agency to continue to be of service to elders and their families.  Of all the agencies I explored, Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area does their work with much heart and sincere attention to the families' needs.  It seems to me that  from the first staff person encountered at the front door or the first difficult to make phone call the family member is greeted with respect and full attention.   Charlie's Place is an adult day social program for respite care they have developed to be a wonderful atmosphere for folks with dementia.  So much thought and care has gone into this program it is a salvation to many families using it.  As a volunteer I aspire to be as welcoming and helpful as I can be to help Alzheimer's Services achieve their agency goals.

Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area, Inc.	120890		/users/profile/164490	Hollier	Volunteer	4	08/17/2012	I volunteered this year for Alzheimer's  Services of the Capitol Area. I wanted to be of service to someone and I saw an article about them speaking at a Rotary meeting in my town. It brought back memories of my grandfather who had suffered and passed away from Alzheimers many years ago.  I remember my grandmother always saying that the medical people would find a cure. She said it all the time and kept the faith till the end.  That was 30 years ago!!! No cure has been found and the the number of Alzheimer's patients is growing and growing.  I wish we would have had a Charlie's Place for my grandfather to attend and give my grandmother very much needed rest. Also, all the resources this organization provides is invaluable especially when one is reeling from the diagnosis and doesn't know where to turn.  The staff is very knowledgable and above all so caring! I enjoyed my time there last Spring and I am returning this Fall to help with their Walk/Run to Remember and other tasks as needed.  They are a great organization! They are making a difference to so many people!!
Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area, Inc.	120367		/users/profile/163711	crchaney	Volunteer	5	08/10/2012	After I retired, Charlie Valluzzo asked if I would be interested in volunteering at Alzheimers Services.   I knew little about Alzheimers, since no family members or friends had this dreaded disease.  But, it didnt take long to realize that I was going to be a long-time volunteer when I saw how Alzheimers affected families, and the caring and commitment of the staff.   I have been the Volunteer Coordinator for Alzheimers Walk/Run for the past ten years, and this entails enlisting approximately 200 volunteers each year.  I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting so many wonderful people, as well as helping to promote awareness of Alzheimers Services.

The growth has been a testament of how important our work is to the Capital Area.  Our Organizations mission is Teaching, Caring and Connecting.  No one person or family should face this devastating disease alone.  I encourage all those who need our services to please give us a call.

I have been nothing short of continually impressed in being able to observe how this organization responds so adeptly to the needs of the community - one of the true bright spots in the world of non-profits in Baton Rouge.
Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area, Inc.	113731	1	/users/profile/154741	Shivermetimbers	Board Member	5	06/04/2012	My review is likely quite different from others.  I was asked to serve on the Alzheimers Board primarily to attempt to create more knowledge and interest in the organization from one of our outlying parishes.  At the same time, however, I have friends who are caretakers for spouses with the disease, and other friends who are adult children of people with the disease.  They clearly wonder what will happen to them as they grow older.  Being a baby boomer myself, I understand the absolute need for additional information to get out there about it all.  This is basically a situation where we as citizens will need to rely on each other as we battle the onslought of Alzheimers, and together, with pertinent information and expertise, we can make life better for everyone.  Our organization is a wonderful conduit to that goal.
Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area, Inc.	89824		/users/profile/102319	khorcasitas	Volunteer	5	06/07/2011	The Alzheimer's Services of the Capital Area (ASCA) agency is a lifeline for individuals and families coping with the direct impact and struggles related to dementia.  As a professional, I have benefited greatly by expanding my own knowledge base, treatment modalities and access to community resources per ASCA's programs and services.  As an individual, I benefited from their services per my own family caregiving experiences about 5 years ago when my father needed caregiving and respite assistance; their staff provided a sorely needed shoulder for me and my family to lean on!  Through community venues like the monthly Lunch/N/Learn sessions, Caregiver Support Groups, Charlie's Place, the Annual Memory Walk/Run and others, ASCA has improved the community health status for all of us.  Also, through the many collaborative efforts and partnerships that ASCA has made in the community, such as with the Pennington Biomedical Center, it has innovatively found new avenues for improving and expanding services.  I look forward every year to helping ASCA and many other volunteers for the Memory Walk/Run when I get to help set up the booths for the vendors who come to the event, which is so educational, fun and health promotional!

I've worked as a volunteer and donor to help them in their mission.  Since my family is deeply affected by the disease, I feel the need to give however I can.  We host a big fundraiser called "A Time to Remember" and donate ALL the money raised to Alzheimer's Services so that they can continue to serve any who need them.

The club had a solid reputation for community service and fellowship when I joined and it has built upon that reputation over the years and become even more successful in its endeavors to serve the young people of our community.  We are fortunate to have a fundraising event that is a long-standing tradition that the entire community looks forward to each year - for the past 62 years - in the Lafayette Kiwanis Football Jamboree.  Those who attend see the Kiwanians at work and see the results of their support of the event throughout the year.

Kiwanis Club of Lafayette Foundation	111389		/users/profile/151669	johnastj	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2012	The Lafayette Kiwanis clubs are a vital part of the community. Their projects pop up wherever there seems to be an unmeet need of children. It is particularly the "hole-plugging" that really impresses me. If you've got a good idea for a project whose need is obvious but seems to fall between the cracks I'd say that you'd be wise to think of Lafayette Kiwanis earlier rather than later.

We have truly impacted our community in positive manner in all that we do.  I had the privilege of serving as the lead member on Parc Independence, the first handicapable and adaptive playground in Lafayette.  This was a collaborative effort by Kiwanis Club of Lafayette and Lafayette Consolidated Government--Parks and Recreation Department.  To date, we have spent Kiwanis monies in addition to monies from Lafayette Consolidated Government to continue to expand our development of this playground.  I take great pride in visiting Parc Independence on a regular basis and questioning the parents and children who utilize this playground only to hear of the appreciation that someone or some organization took the time to address this need in our community.  As a parent of a special needs child I am most grateful that our organization, my organization accepted this challenge and committed to see this project through and further commits to address the needs of all children in our community with our efforts in the past and those yet to come.  I highly recommend Kiwanis Club of Lafayette and support all we do to positively influence our community.   Kemper Bowen

Shir Chadash Conservative Congregation	265604		/users/profile/354342	Writer	Client Served	5	10/20/2015	The epitome of loving kindness:  I drove my daughter, Ari, down to New Orleans from Chicago to move in with her older sister.  Through a hometown connection we heard about Shir Chadash.  After we got settled we made an appointment with the Rabbi.  He was very warm and attentive when we all met.  Afterwards, the Executive Director, Bruce Yaillen went above and beyond to welcome Ari into the synagogue community.  He matched Ari up with a very outgoing and energetic member who took my daughter under her wing.  Since then Ari has attended religious services ( no small accomplishment) and will be attending a social retreat this weekend.  I highly recommend Shir Chadash looking for Jewish southern hospitality and a positive religious experience.

Shir Chadash Conservative Congregation	254847		/users/profile/343211	EWKessler	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2015	I am a long time member but not an active one until recently.  After Katrina and some years in Arkansas, we returned to an invigorated congregation with a fabulous rabbi who welcomed everyone with enthusiasm and warmth. The congregation and staff are egalitarian and open to a diverse group of people, and everyone is urged to participate in services, activities, and learning. As a result, services and activities are unique, warm, and inspiring.  But that's not all: the onegs following services are social opportunities to make friends from acquaintances. I love to see the young parents and small children who come together to services and activities; seeing the children eagerly run to the bima and close the ark is a glimpse into the happy future of the children and this congregation. I love to see the participants in the service, especially the Rabbi and his wife, pick up their children as they are chanting. I  try to participate in all the educational opportunities which are offered to congregants and the community at large. Everyone is truly welcome at Shir Chadash; it is a happy and intellectual refuge.  Despite my secular background, I hate to miss a shabbat service!

Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	320562	3	/users/profile/413239	Ray_35	General Member of the Public	1	12/28/2016	Over more than a month Iattempted to donate $10,000.00 in stock to Villalobos. ( To my wife and me, that is a lot of money) They said they were not set up to accept stock but they would check into it and get back to me. Days past and I did not hear from them.  I emailed again and they said they would get back to me. This repeated for about five weeks when they said " problem solved we will get back to you"Once again  no response. (They claimed they had tried to contact me.  Not true)  I waited a few days more.  Then, in frustration, I wrote saying the business end of the operation appeared to be operated by incompetents and non professionals.  During this entire time  Tia never entered the picture.  After my last letter, she wrote a nasty letter accussing me of being a unthinking, nasty,  person.  Her final shot was to call me an ass. Until this experience I would not,have believed the negatives in other reviews.  Today I would question the validity of the entire Villalobos operation.  My suggestion: don't donate.
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	301642	3	/users/profile/145405	Rivka I.	Donor	1	08/27/2016	I was going to adopt a senior dog from Villalobos Rescue Center, by the name of Joan Rivers.  My understand was that I would adopt her and they would pay medical expenses.  Although there was mention of transportation costs on their adoption page, I was under the impression that I would not be required to provide said costs because she was a senior dog and I would be providing her with a home for her final days.  Initially I was told on the phone that I would be getting her sometime around the end of July (2 weeks).  I called one more time and emailed about 3 times asking for progress on her transportation.  I even offered to donate as much as I could to defray costs but  only if the money could be earmarked for her transportation.  The response I received back was that the donation could not be earmarked and they were not coming up with the money.  In essence, I am supposed to donate money to transport a dog I wanted to adopt but there was no guarantee that the monies would be used that reason.  I was told in an email that getting her out to me suddenly was going to be over $600 but there was still no guarantee the  money would get earmarked for her transportation.  I felt like this had turned into a hostage situation where I would get the dog only after giving up $600 now and who knows how much in the future for 'transportation costs'.  Once they had deemed that I had given them enough would I still not have the dog?  I started to question the motivation behind this so-called adoption and my previous donation for a memorial for my dog, Sister.  It was obvious the dog was not coming.  I requested return of my memorial donation and gave up the idea that I would ever getting this dog.  Well, today I got a nasty gram from Tia Torres herself telling me it would cost $1,500 to transport this dog!  Tia also threatened me with criminal charges and civil litigation.  She is claiming that the publication of my protestations is illegal and further postings on my part will be followed by communication from their attorney.  Since she lives in one state and I another my criminal violation would have to be federal and while I am no expert on federal statutes, I doubt if there is precedent for criminal charges.  Civil litigation would entail her probably retaining a lawyer in her state and mine.  I find it interesting and curious that she has enough money to sue someone on disability but not enough to transport a dog weighing under 20 lbs.  This is beyond ridiculous to be treated this way and I want others to know about it so they don't get victimized too.  Therefore, I am making extra effort to publish my experience in more venues than I previously planned because I really feel this is gone beyond the pale.  
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	150579	9	/users/profile/145405	Rivka I.	Donor	5	03/05/2013	I have recently had reason to interact with this organization.  I had become a fan through watching their series, "Pitbulls and Parolees" so after watching for awhile I ordered some merchandise; specifically some sunglasses.  Although there was a slight glitch in getting them, I did get them and all was made right about the mix up.  I have my sunglasses now which I enjoy wearing when I take my dog outside.  They fit very well and block out our high altitude sun quite nicely. I am now on good terms with this organization.  So much so that recently when they had an influx of puppies and had other unforeseen circumstances a plea for help went out to the general public.  I answered this call by purchasing and having shipped to their facility in New Orleans, LA a few items on their wish list. Although I traced the shipments step-by-step from my end, it turned out that it was unnecessary because Becky contacted me via email the moment the articles arrived. So I thank you, Becky, for the updates.   Mariah, a big thanks to you for making things right about my sunglasses.   Tia keep up the good work.   Greetings to all.
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	278977	6	/users/profile/368996	GinaMarie	Advisor	1	02/03/2016	How can you rely on donations but not share with your donors how much you are getting and where it goes? Very shady.
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	215004	12	/users/profile/278331	teddyalexis8	General Member of the Public	1	09/13/2014	They refuse to provide any financial information since 2008.  A BIG red flag.  Even that info was NOT enough to determine if it is a well rated charity (spending >65% of revenue on program activities and not staff housing, travel, etc)...a HUGE RED FLAG.   Nice that there's a caring show for the cameras but if there was nothing to hide, why not disclose your financials like all responsible charities do?  Refuse to supply financial information and you stay off the "worst charity' lists. On camera there are lots of comments and pics of staff housing that appears to be provided by Villalobos donation money.  Look up property ownership by Villalobos and you find houses that were purchased for staff before they did renovations and roofing to the building housing the dogs.  WHOPPING BIG RED FLAG.   Follow the timeline of "explanations" of the staff housing from "to provide retirement homes for older dogs" to "we are animal control in rural areas and need sites to serve those places." Funny they have NO kennel licenses other than Villalobos itself, no posted hours of operation for these supposedly necessary sites and their addresses are not posted.  How can you be "animal control" if you hide your locations?  Why would you need to purchase homes to house supposedly non-adoptable dogs (and all your family) when you have a large facility in New Mexico specifically for long term housing of dogs??? One of the homes for Tia's kids is waterfront on the bayou.  They showed 2 dogs at the home provided for her sons and surprise!... neither of those dogs were up for adoption.  Other reality tv stars provide their own housing, utilities, etc. You can't do anything there without signing a complete confidentiality agreement, yet Villalobos staff are free to publicly comment on anything they please.  why legally silence everyone with whom you have contact if there's nothing to hide? They talk about massive increases in their expenses in NOLA but provide no verifiable explanation.   By their own minimal and very rare reports their adoptions haven't increased much, which means your animal intake can't increase much.  Yes they now have to pay for heartworm preventative like most animal shelters do but that doesn't cost that much when purchased in bulk.  They also get large donations of food and medication directly to the shelter and don't have to purchase all of their supplies.   So where is the big increase in expenses?  Buying numerous properties to house family and long time staff is very expensive.  
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	213274	12	/users/profile/276445	Eviluncovered1	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/04/2014	Donors beware!!!!!!  Villalobos is a huge front for criminal activity, misuse and abuse of donation dollars and merchanise.  The fact that they have not posted tax returns for years with guide star should tell you something,.  It's a fact that they don't pay income tax when paying their "employees" and only pay in cash or screw them by not paying them at all ,should get the IRS involved.  I've witnessed donations being stolen by volunteers and used for personal use by villalobos employees.  I've witnessed a desperate plea for food although their storage units were full and food was being given out to volunteers and employees for their own dogs.... There are numerous RV trips across the county that they justify by bringing a few dogs on board to give away to other rescues even though their are qualified applicants waiting for them.   Tia often uses these trips to visit her aryan brotherhood husband in a norther California prisonwhile instead if doing dog rescue business...interstate fraud is rampant. The storage and warehousing of hundreds of dogs in un air conditioned warehouses through out Louisiana has been photographed And videotaped by volunteers and concerned employees who are concerned for the dogs welfare. We stood mortified as Vans of dogs we're being loaded up and taken to be killed although they claim to be a no kill shelter...they have and will attack anyone who is onto their scheme...I have witnessed and experienced burglaries, trespassings, gun toting felons, aryan brotherhood tagging a and just plain fearful dogs and employees who are intimidated into keeping things quiet or "pay a life altering price" according to Tia Torres for any bad publicity Into their shady enterprise.  Do not support this organization in any way.  Many of us speak from experience. 
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	202801	10	/users/profile/264551	mema312	Donor	2	06/13/2014	After reading about their situation on Facebook I ordered about $125 value of items on their "wishlist" with a commercial website.  I had difficulty contacting the organization to let them know some of their list with stores needed updating and also requesting an acknowledgment for tax purposes. I used the web "email" available on the web site but only received a "forwarding" message several days later.  My order has not been acknowledged even though the pet company said it was sent to them directly. I am also concerned about the lack of  financial records provided to Guidestar and that the founder and three other females are the "board".  I am sure they all work very hard but according to their web page they also are operating a restaurant/bar and small hotel. All things considered, there is room for questioning the accountability of monies, services and donations received by this agency especially with the TV program revenues.  I won't donate again until I feel more confident.
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	164357	15	/users/profile/218429	cstreet	Donor	5	08/07/2013	My daughters and I visited Villalobos in NOLA  to drop off some donations. We were greeted immediately, signed in and given a tour by both volunteers and staff. Everyone was incredible friendly and open. I was amazed and impressed with the cleanliness and organization of the kennels and facility. In the middle of summer with 100= dogs there was not one dirty kennel or dog and not a SINGLE dog smell. Each dog area was immaculate.   PLEASE consider making a donation!!!
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	84736	11	/users/profile/94071	starfishprinciple	Volunteer	5	04/04/2011	I've been involved as a volunteer for over five years and feel I know this group and their achievements very well.  Their mission is pit bulls, a breed that is in the greatest need of human compassion and rescue.  No breed is treated worse and has less voices speaking up about it, and thank dog for Villalobos Rescue and other groups who do not give up even when they can't save them all, they save the ones they can.   VRC is not just about taking dogs in, they have a comprehensive adoption program, screen adopters carefully and match them with dogs that fit their lifestyle. Adopted dogs are given support and resources for their lifetime, if the adopters can't keep them then VRC always takes the dogs back. VRC is also about changing the stars for the people who care for these dogs, another "disposable" group in society, the parolees.  These guys are able to get their second chance at VRC and work with the dogs where they are judged only on their work, not the color of their skin or the number of tattooes they might have.  The parolees learn compassion and love as they build strong relationships with the dogs and each other, it's just sad there are not more programs available because the need is huge. I don't volunteer my time without knowing it is making a difference and Villalobos Rescue Center makes a difference, every single day, and even when they can't save every dog it certainly matters to the dogs that do enter their doors.
Villalobos Rescue Center Pets in the Hood Inc	84723	6	/users/profile/28410	nonebob	Volunteer	5	04/03/2011	This nonprofit is a wonderful group of dedicated people who go beyond the call of duty to help dogs and sometimes even cats. They live and breathe for these animals. The breed they choose to help is a breed that is terribly misunderstood. They also help rehabilitate parolees which is also a group of people who are terribly misunderstood. This group has always had an "A" on their kennel inspections. They have had a valid kennel license in Los Angeles County for 17 YEARS. The are the gold standard when it comes to helping animals and the care they provide. In California, they are one of ONLY two groups who rehabilitate people who have been in prison. There may be new groups who help, but to my knowledge, they are few and far between. This is despite getting NO government funding to run their programs.

Every activity is important and appreciated. The patients look forward to either participating in a painting project or  listening to music. The organization has brought "the arts" our patients would not normally have an opportunity to enjoy.  The volunteers are talented.

Central Louisiana Arts and Healthcare, Inc.	38539	1	/users/profile/39419	jothompson	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	The Arts - visual, dance, music, and such - are universal languages that "speak" to us emotionally, and sometimes spiritually.As a visual artist with the Arts and Healthcare organization, I am able to use my art form to communicate messages that hopefully promote positive feelings.  As a cancer survivor, I realize the importance of the mind/body connection in the healing process, with patients at the Cancer Center where I volunteer.When these people get involved in doing art, looking at art, talking about art and artists, talking about what moves them -- I witness a difference in their state of mind.  The despondent will lighten up, the frightened will become more relaxed, the frustrated will have a diverson, and a child who is bored will be pacified.  Many times the "artist within" will be awakened, and the opportunity to create art can empower someone who has felt he's lost control of his life.These same effects were seen with the Arts and Healthcare program in the Red Cross shelters after the Katrina evacuation.  The Arts are very powerful in changing attitudes and lives.

Those who don't realize another show is about to go up always protest when they see the walls bare!

Through BRYC, I got to get to know two amazing young ladies and future leaders. I also got to experience the sheer joy of college acceptance letters and new open doors all over again.

I enjoy everything that BRYC has to offer such as the community service opportunities, leadership discussions, mentoring and more. BRYC became a place where I could get away from my troubles at home and in the process became my family. They showed me that I deserve better and encouraged me to get away for a better education. With the help from BRYC I received a full scholarship to Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT. What I like about BRYC is that the support does not end once we graduate. They will follow us through out the process, invested in our futures. I know I have the support and motivation to make it at a elite university like Wesleyan because of BRYC.

I was surrounded by other fellows and mentors who always uplifted and motivated me. The two years I have been in BRYC they have become a second family. I can honestly say that BRYC is a life changing organization they helped me reach heights I thought I would never reach. This fall I am going to Clark University in Massachusetts on a full ride with the help from the mentoring I received at BRYC.

In a city that is rife with violence, poverty, and failing schools, top tier colleges and elite scholarship programs seem completely out of reach for even our brightest most successful students. What BRYC does is closes the gap between the talents and brilliance of our students and the opportunities and resources that are available to them. As a mentor, I had the privilege of guiding one young woman through the college process and watched her earn admission to Clark University in MA and earn over $35,000 in merit based scholarships, fundamentally altering her life path. I am inspired daily by the work BRYC does to level the playing field for Baton Rouge's students and by the students themselves as they accomplish remarkable things.

The GRN is the only organization I know of that has been doing this work in every gulf state for so long - before Katrina, before Rita, before Gustav, before Ike and before the BP Oil Disaster, the Gulf Restoration Network was there. They've working to care for the Gulf and it's coastline for 15 plus years and really know their stuff.   I've volunteered with them since before the oil disaster, back when the big issue was wetlands loss.  My role has been to let folks outside the region (in my case the Boston area) know what's REALLY going on in the Gulf and how folks can help to advocate for and protect it.  Since the BP Oil Drilling Disaster, the GRN has been the eyes and ears of the gulf - flying over to get aerial views, having photographers out on the water, and letting us all know what's really going on.  This has been very important because the media is not reporting the true extent of the damage.  Through the GRN, I've been able to become a better-informed citizen and have been able to show others the importance of the Gulf Coast ecosystem. Thank you, Gulf Restoration Network!

It has also been a pleasure to see the organization evolve over the past seven years.  As I continue to receive the GRN's action alerts and newsletters, I am astounded by the network's growth.  The GRN's effectiveness continues to improve in leaps and bounds and they are bringing national attention to a regional issue that has such wide-reaching implications.  I believe that the GRN will continue to be a leader in preserving one of our nation's greatest natural treasures and I look forward to continuing to play a role in their success.

I will never get another animal from here, and I will NEVER tell someone to get their future pet from this greedy "supposed" animal rescue. I got my baby from them everything was all cookies and cake. A few months down the road I decided to join the Navy, contacted them like they're contract stated asked if I could find my baby a new home. They agreed to let me all I had to do was email them my intentions, which I did. After emailing them I the find out they intended to change another adoption fee for my baby, to which I replied I was going to ask a fee but NEVER FORGET INTENDED to take just wanted to make sure my baby went to a good home. With all this I returned my baby to this place agents my better judgement, I walked away crying my eyes out. The only reason they got a star from me is cause I had to so I could write this review.
Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	161052	1	/users/profile/213536	H.Soos	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	The review just below this one is wrong on so many levels.  First off, 90% of AAVA's rescued animals are in foster homes of volunteers, most of whom have full time jobs and families.  All sick dogs or cats pulled from the shelter are nursed back to good health, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped,  and treated by a veterinarian for every possible ailment prior to being offered for adoption.  Where AAVA differs from many other rescues, and why their financial situation may be on the critical list, is due to the fact they don't just pick and choose the cute puppies or purebred dogs whose adoption fees will more than cover what it costs to have them vetted.  I foster for them and everything that I need for my fosters is always responded to.  If having 3 fosters, (all of whom are treated the same as my own 2 dogs; well fed and allowed to take up space on furniture) make me a so-called "hoarder", then so be it.  Potential adopters are screened and follow-ups are done by volunteers.  A small percentage of healthy rescued dogs are boarded, but only because there is a lack of available foster home space.  Those in boarding along with fosters are taken to pet adoption events weekly.   
Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	148075	1	/users/profile/196008	Dog Lady	Donor	1	01/15/2013	Is see that five reviews were submitted on one day. All glowing.AAVA has fallen so far from their heyday. They are glorified hoarders, keeping dogs in boarding, some for years. They have mismanaged their funds so badly that they cannot pay for the care of the animals they have in boarding and the quality of the care the animals are getting is substandard.They are so desperate to unload the animals they have, that they are placing them without any reference checks or follow-up. If you want to help the animals of Vermilion Parish, adopt or rescue the dogs yourself. Do NOT sponsor dogs who will end up in the appalling "care" of AAVA.
Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	126505	1	/users/profile/171523	Dawn31	Client Served	5	10/17/2012	Day after day, this organization fights fr the lives of animals destined to a horrific death by gas chamber.  It's non-stop.  Everytime they manage to take pictures of anumals, get them posted and literally beg for fosters, adopters, rescues, for any one to help them out in any way imaginable, they SOMEHOW pull it off.  I understane they have a great following and many prayers are sent to help them save all those beautiful animals, prayers are often not enough.  And yet....they struggle and fight ti make it happen.  And just when everyone breaths a sigh of relief knowing what they have accomplished.  The sheltters are full again,  There isn't a days rest.  Animal Aid for Vermilion Area are an AMAZING cohesive group of people that are undaubted by adversity.  I am cannot begin to tell you the lengths they went to, to make sure the 2 dogs I adopted from them arrived safely from LA to CO.  Because of their dedication I am blessed everyday with two funny little dogs from Louisiana.  May God continue to Bless their endeavors!!

Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	126408	1	/users/profile/171436	plantworksgal	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	This charity is amazing.  They save companion animals from a high kill gas chamber facility that allows no public adoptions.  The only hope for these animals is through rescue.  They are an extremely hard working group of volunteers with families and jobs that devote every spare minute to fight against this horribly inhumane form of euthanasia.
Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	126364	1	/users/profile/171400	Ginny9	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	Animal Aid for Vermillion Area (AAVA) a 501(c)(3) animal rescue organization that saves dogs and cats from the gas chamber in the high-kill shelter in Kaplan, Louisiana that offers no adoption program to the public. Pets who are brought may be killed within 4 days in an gas chamber where it takes 45 minutes or longer for the dogs to die. AAVA has rescued over 1,600 dogs and 500 cats from the shelter, sending them to other animal rescues, foster homes, adopting them to the public and maintaining the remainder themselves -- covering all vetting and transportation charges. They work very hard to promote the animals and find families for them and they've gained the trust and respect of the shelter in Kaplan, which makes an effort to work with AAVA. We are a foster home to one of the dogs AAVA saved. AAVA desperately needs more support from the community to continue doing the amazing work they've been doing.
Animal Aid For Vermilion Area Inc	126347	1	/users/profile/171386	Roxanne B.	Board Member	5	10/17/2012	Animal Aid for Vermillion Area (AAVA) is a 501(c)(3) animal rescue organization that saves dogs and cats from the gas chamber in the high-kill shelter in Kaplan, Louisiana.  Of course, all high-kill shelters are abominable places, but the one in Kaplan is its own kind of hell:  the facility is only about animal and rabies control, it has no adoption program to the public, and pets who are brought there are killed within 4 days unless reclaimed or rescued.  And they aren't humanely euthanized -- they are tortured to death in an archaic gas chamber where it takes approximately 45 minutes for a healthy dog to be killed, even longer for puppies and pregnant, senior or sick dogs.  In the past 18 months, AAVA has rescued over 1,600 dogs and 500 cats from the shelter.  Of those, approximately 400 dogs and all the cats were taken by other rescues; AAVA took the rest.  This means that seven completely focused, devoted, determined, amazing core volunteers rescued 1,200 dogs.

Capital Area Family Violence Battered Womens Pro	57116		/users/profile/59992	Audrey	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2010	Capital Area Family Violence Intervention Center (CAFVIC) provides a variety of services to victims of domestic violence in a seven parish area surrounding Baton Rouge. CAFVIC offers shelter, legal services, education and children's services at both its main office and outreach offices. As a survivor of DV, I wish this program, and others like it, would have been in place 40+ years ago. Women, like myself, would have benefited greatly from these services. Maybe if we had been better  educated, we could have done more to break the cycle of violence by now.

Our oldest and largest program is the 24-hour emergency shelter for battered women and their dependent children. In addition to physical safety, the shelter provides personal advocacy, information and referral, support groups, and education for the larger community about violence and its effects. Community support is critical to the success of our events and we greatly appreciate your participation!

Being apart of this organization has made me more aware of all the resources so that I can inform other females about this organization. Being with the LCWIC has really shown me the affect as well of what women go through with Domestic Violence and how it affects someone not just physically but emotionally as well
Capital Area Family Violence Battered Womens Pro	41005	9	/users/profile/41904	vdhasah44	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	Having first hand knowledge and experience with domestic violence, I understand the physical,emotional,finicial and mental support needed to begin to address the challenges and hardships assoicated with domestic violence. From my first encounter with this organziation I was convinced that not only was the staff fully trained and organized but the staff had compassion for the women and childern and were passionate about what they did everyday. This is truly an organization committed to meeting the needs of those who have been victimized. Simple things that we may take for granted like toothpaste, a comb or a towel may be the one thing you can give to lighten the load of a person that is is need. Multiple everyday basic needs by 365 days a year times the number of women and childern serviced through this agency and the results are simple, we need every penny you give and every minute you volunteer. Lives are changed forever through this agency and new life can begin. SAH

I preface the following statement by saying that I have the utmost respect for all of the other nonprofit organizations related to women's issues in Baton Rouge but there is not an organization more hard-working, passionate, and dedicated to helping women in East Baton Rouge Parish then this group.  From the Executive Director and fearless leader, Martha Forbes, to their selfless hotline volunteers, these folks are highly trained, highly motivated, and compassionate people that will go to great lengths to help anyone that steps through their doors.

Audubon Nature Institute Inc	208144		/users/profile/270824	Tedleclercq	Board Member	5	07/31/2014	Audubon Nature Institute Inc. (ANI) is an extraordinary nonprofit entity.  I am happy to comment on a few highlights of its work in our community and its extraordinary  impact across the state. ANI brings the wonders of nature, through it many programs and exhibitions in and around New Orleans, to families from this state and the region.  Through the zoo, the aquarium, the butterfly garden and the Imax theatre, the children of this state, and our visitors from all over the world, learn about the world around us in an exciting and educational way.  Our children are the better for these fun and educational experiences.  ANI reaches out to our community in many ways which demonstrably makes New Orleans a better place.  For instance, in its partnership with the Taylor Scholars, ANI  awards admission to students from across the state who maintain their grades at a 2.5 or better--it teaches the life lesson of hard work, persistence and success, and it brings a tangible award/encouragement for good performance,. It also exposes our children to more educational adventures at the different ANI programs and exhibits.  ANI is a great community asset as New Orleans works to grow family tourism, providing many of the highest quality family related attractions in our area.  Finally, ANI is also a good steward of its resources, both from admissions fees and from donations.  ANI has a proven track record of thoughtfully putting these resources to work to create exceptional value through its programs and exhibits.Thank you.  Ted

Audubon Nature Institute Inc	205458		/users/profile/267626	cececolhoun	Board Member	5	07/08/2014	The Audubon Nature institute strives continually to improve it's facilities and it's programs. It's a leader amongst other institutes of the same caliber and helps to drive the education in the arena. Ron Forman has turned the zoo around almost single handedly and made it an example for other top zoo's around the country to follow as a model. In aaddition, the preservation and restoration of the Olmsted Audubon park has been if recent note and the facilities there are becoming more and more state of the art to the public with the inclusion of a golf course and many other mind and body enhancing experiences. The Awuarium and Insectarium provide joy and education most importantly to our youth and all others that are consistently welcomed each day. I am an honored and oud to young Board member and will continue to use the same resolve set by example by Ron Forman to continue to be a good steward to the institute. 
Audubon Nature Institute Inc	205455		/users/profile/267623	carolwise	Board Member	5	07/08/2014	I live very near Audubon park(3 blocks away). I have been a member of the zoo and have had the pleasure of being able to use the park as a walking and biking path for very many  years. In the the last 20 years , the Park and all its myriad of facilities has gone from "good to great".  The park and the golf course are a joy to behold and use.  It is rare that you can walk in a public park that is exceedingly well used and find not one trash can that is stuffed , not one shelter that has litter, a children's playground that is constantly used and clean and well manicured.  The zoo, the Aquarium and the insectarium are always full of children and adults(me too) enjoying these facilities.  It makes me so proud to see the numbers of out of town visitors who take the streetcar to the park, walk thru the park to the zoo.  I am amazed that no matter when you go to the zoo(I have 5 grandchildren) that while crowded at times, the litter has been picked up, the animals appear to be comfortable-- even the petting zoo is exceptionally well managed.  I am very proud of New Orleans and Audubon Nature Instiitutei! I believe,that Audubon is the reason that the quality of life in this city is so satisfying.  Come walk with me in the park one morning at 6:30 am and you will understand!

There were a couple actual christians that i trusted & tried desperately to be in close proximity of. There was a precious very older widow. Rainer we called her rainy. There was a young woman known as Miss Diane. It was the woman who I believe really trying to help but her "hands were tied" so to speak. But she followed Fords orders with strength but was too young to realize the pain & absolute physical abuse. if you couldn't quote the chapter, verse, and so on. YOU didn't get to eat. the scars from that place were welcomed when u were trying to stay away from a child abuse molester called ur father. u had to choose between the evil u knew & the evil before you. This was better upon 1st look. The horses, piglets, won me over. i chose to stay at 1st glance, but once they  checked u in, you couldn.'t check out OR call anyone you know

New Bethany Home For Girls	96159	5	/users/profile/111920	Simone Jones	General Member of the Public	1	08/20/2011	The New Bethany homes for boys and girls opened in 1969. During its many years of operation, it was closed down by the state for abuse once in Louisiana, at the boys home Longstreet location. The director, Larry Rapier was arrested for child abuse. Immediately, Mack Ford opened another boys home in South Carolina, that was directed by Olen King. It was closed as well for abuse. Olen King was arrested for kidnapping and neglect. (for locking boys in cells, handcuffed to a pole) Olen King now runs another home in North Carolina under the name of King Family Ministries. Mack Fords daughter, Penny (Ford) king, is married to Olen Kings son. The girls home was raided countless times, Mack Ford was caught sexually abusing children, more than once. His staff members wich include the housemother, the director as well as the principle of the school, have all been accused of molesting/raping children while employed at the home. The New Bethany home for girls/boys was 'legally' changed to New Bethany Baptist church in 2001. However Mack Ford continued to run it as a childrens home until 2004. When he was finally shut down. One of the 'house mothers' Nora Carter Shepherd, has had four different homes opened, under the name of 'Faith Ranch', and had Mack Ford sending children to her until 1999. She was aware of the sexual abuse, and did everything she could to cover it up. Please see a detailed staff list at heal-online.org.
New Bethany Home For Girls	96148	1	/users/profile/111907	kiko53	General Member of the Public	1	08/20/2011	There must have been some serious kickback going on in that parish because the townsfolk of Arcadia should have stormed the place with pitchforks and torches thirty years ago and rescued the imprisoned children.  Eventually they did--shut it down, but not soon enough to prevent the untold damage that it did to God's most precious gift, our children, our future. It's an embarrassment to the good citizens of Louisiana who need to set the record straight.

Anyone donating to this organization needs to be made aware that: 1: IT'S CLOSED. 2. Any proceeds donated go to a man who has been publicly called a child abuser and pedophile. 3. If this organization is on your church's missionary list, you need to notify your pastor that the church's tithes are going to an organization that NO LONGER EXISTS! Thanks you!

It is a very positive organization that is truly done out of love for other women in the world battling cancer. Working in the hospital setting and actually witnessing what some of these ladies have to go through, I am more than proud of my mother for what she is doing. I'm so proud of her for not only beating breast cancer, but also that she is caring enough to share her story and knowledge and pay it forward. Sistaz With Faith also does a  Hope Bag Project, which consists of different goodies in a bag(free of charge) given to ladies currently in treatment.   I think that its such a great idea because it really brighten up their day and just let them know that they are not alone. For many women have beat cancer and it just encourages them to stay strong. My mother had the worse stage of breast cancer and the doctor's didn't believe that she was going to make it, i'm proud to say that she is now almost 5 years cancer free. She is definitely a living testimony and the will of God will continue to give her the strength to keep up with this organization. Pray for Miracles, Hope for a Cure, and Pay it Forward is what Sistaz with Faith is all about!

These children have a great life ahead of them and I am glad they have camp as an outlet to have stress free fun!!
Camp Bon Coeur, Inc.	285594		/users/profile/375598	Writer	Donor	5	04/11/2016	My son Cooper was born with a congenital heart defect (CHD) and my family has first-hand experience and knowledge of  how great this organization is.  CBC has made a profound impact on the lives of so many children born with CHD.  They provide an environment for these kids to not only experience life equal to their peers, but to excel in it. CBC, and its entire staff, is truly incredible. 
Camp Bon Coeur, Inc.	285558		/users/profile/375560	Writer	Client Served	5	04/11/2016	As the mom of a child born with heart disease, it's always a concern that your child will be left out or excluded  because they are different. Camp Bon Coeur is a place where our "heart kids" can feel like "normal kids." My daughter first attended camp when she was 7, and we are planning to return this summer for her second year. The staff is so caring and supportive, and they are all highly trained. Some of the camp nurses are heart patients themselves, and the camaraderie between the staff and campers is awesome. My daughter is looking forward to seeing her camp friends again, and I know that this is a place she will make lifelong friends and wonderful memories.  
Camp Bon Coeur, Inc.	285542		/users/profile/375543	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	As a former camper and staff member who has been involved with Camp Bon Coeur since 2000, I can tell you the place is life changing. I started camp at the age of 13 and it was a real turning point for me. Camp taught me what I was capable of and to have a voice. That I was allowed to say yes I can. To push my boundaries in a safe and loving environment. I can without a doubt tell you that camp has helped shape me into the woman I am today. (I even met my husband at camp! He too has a heart defect even though he was never a camper himself.) 
Camp Bon Coeur, Inc.	285536		/users/profile/375535	LHMom	Client Served	5	04/11/2016	It's hard to go through life being different and having some limitations.  As a boy, it's hard not to be able to play sports, especially in Texas.  Camp Bon Coeur is a camp for kids with congenital heart defects and made a huge impact on my son's life once he began attending every summer.  It was well worth the 6+ hour drive.  He was surrounded by kids of all ages who had a heart defect just like him!  He could see kids with greater limitations than he had as well as how they dealt with their issues.  The camp is full of fun activities all monitored by health professionals, so parents could feel at ease that their kids are in the best possible care away from home.  Many of our kids can't attend other summer camps because the level of activities exceeds what they're capable of handling.  In addition to regular camp fun, they're also blessed with education opportunities to learn about their hearts and specific defects.  My son loved dissecting the pig heart!  He returned home every summer with more confidence, more understanding of his defect, and a true sense of camaraderie with others like him.    Camp Bon Coeur isn't just a summer camp.  It's a place that makes our heart kids belong and feel special - but in a good way!   The camp staff and volunteers are amazing.  They put their heart and soul into making the experience a blessing to all campers.   We personally will always feel connected to Camp Bon Coeur and the impact it has had on our family.  My son has reached the age to where he can be a Counselor in Training (CIT), and he can't wait until this summer!     Countless non-profits exist, and I know they're all for a good cause.  But, Camp Bon Coeur stands out!   Their mission and their passion are like nothing I've seen in other organizations.  They're a life changer for these kids.  They truly make a difference.   The uniqueness of having a camp just for kids with heart defects allows them to fit in, to gain an appreciation and a new perspective for life because for the length of the camp, they're surrounded by others just like them.  As a parent, we will never know fully the hours, the devotion, and the work that goes on throughout the year to make Camp Bon Coeur happen, but I hope they know the impact that it has for our kids!   We love Camp Bon Coeur!

Because I know the CEO personally, I know she has a heart to help others and possesses the creativity and motivation to strive towards completion of any assignment despite the obstacles that a set before her.Face to Face Enrichment Center has grown beyond all expectations and can easily serve as a blueprint for awareness organizations that are dedicated to issues that plague women.  In my opinion, Face to Face Enrichment Center has such a solid foundation that it has the potential to expand services beyond the Ascension Parish border.  It has proven to be a worthwhile service which has educated, encouraged, enlightened, and exposed women who may have otherwise been unaware of deadly diseases which are prevalent within the Ascension Parish Community.

I later found that we shared like interests in helping those in need whether young or old. She moves about like a quiet storm, slowly seeking out life disparaties that have touched her life and the life of those around her. In a desperate attemt to address and annihilate problems such as; HIV/AIDS, STD, teen pregnancy, domestic violence and low self esteem that have affected and effected this community, Gabrille have devoted countless hours of dedicating herself through providing education, motivation, and awareness. I am proud to be mentored by her and working on this great team here at Face to Face Enrichment Center.

She has served as a supervisor to me, a mentor, and in so many positive capacities until words cannot express how much she has assisted my family and me. As a domestic violence survivor, I had to relocate to Louisiana for safety reasons. I left with only what I could stuff in a suitcase and take on the plane. I managed to find an apartment but had no funiture whatsoever. Mrs. Johnson, and her organization, was so kind to not only donate furniture and supplies for every room in my apartment but she and her family took time to deliver and set up the funiture. I was so overwhelmed with joy until I cried for two weeks after I received the unexpected gift. I am so very pleased to have met Mrs. Johnson and the work that she is doing through her organization. She is truly and inspiration and serve as a mentor, confident, and is an agent of change. SincerelyDr. Tonja "Tee"  Lee, PhD

The entire event was well planned. The Exective Director, Ms. Johnson was organized and prompt.  She faciliated the flow with the speaker and the question-answer period. She made everyone feel that their response was just as important as the the next person. We received gift bags and refresments as a complete program package. Face to Face Encrichment Center is a place that I have invited my friends and family to experience to enhance their lives on various topics and to receive needed services.

Armed with this vision, partners were sought to bring things into fruition.  One of the organizations that responded was Tipitina's.  Through the relationship, kids in our band have played on stage and before professional musicians and the public taking away a real sense of self worth and pride.  These experiences have been priceless, but the care and concern for the band's ability to grow and florish surpasses any expectation or reality I had about the Tipitina's Foundation.  Their generosity and genuine desire to help musicians makes them a community anchor that we are proud to know.

The impact that you make on these peoples lives by doing something as simple as changing their light bulbs is tremendous. One woman we changed light bulbs for was crying because the new light bulbs were going to save her hundreds of dollars on her monthly energy bill. This nonprofit is truly making a huge impact on the environment and economy of New Orleans.

I worked with an awesome team of 4 high school students and we were given four addresses to visit.  Three of the four families were home, invited us in, and helped us replace all the incandescent light bulbs in the house!  Once finished, we tallied the # of bulbs replaced and calculated up the total savings in wattage, carbon, and $$ saved on an average electricity bill!  I loved talking with the homeowners and fellow volunteers, and will be donating more time to GLNO in the future!

It was an amazing learning experience; not only did I get to work with a staff of dedicated and inspired individuals, but I also learned a lot about the process of becoming a more energy-efficient community. In my opinion, part of what is so great about this organization is that by providing free energy-efficient light bulbs to homes in the greater New Orleans area they are helping in three ways: by reducing the carbon footprint, educating others on energy efficiency, and providing energy-efficient light bulbs to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Out of all the many organizations I have had the pleasure of working with in New Orleans, I had the most positive experience at Green Light New Orleans.

The goals of this organization are to change every incandescent light bulb to compact fluorescent bulbs with 75% energy savings and carbon emissions. With 10-20% of the total energy used in lighting this country, this is a first logical step and easiest to implement to reduce our carbon output. Much more needs to be done in a very short time (within one decade), but this is a significant start! GLNO and GLSC is unique in that we actually go into the homes and install cfls primarily in homes of lower income and elderly.

Given that I have been "spoiled" by hearing these great orchestras, I remain amazed at the quality of the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra (BRSO).  For a small city, Baton Rouge, Louisiana is blessed to have such a fine orchestra.  I have taken European visitors to the BRSO and usually warned them that Baton Rouge was a small city so they would not be hearing one of nation's major orchestra.  On every occasion, the international guests were delighted by the performances and very impressed our small city boasted such a fine orchestra.  I recently returned to Baton Rouge, and the BRSO is better than ever.  I remain impressed with the quality of the performances, and I am now even more impressed with the programming - in terms of variety works and the caliber of the guest artists, including especially some of the "newer" guest artists who are, quite frankly, just as exciting and inspiring as some of the "older", more famous virtuosos who play with the BRSO.  Bravi BRSO!

Christian Community Action Inc	24775	1	/users/profile/25780	Nancy Beals	Board Member	4	12/22/2009	I continue to be impressed by what Christian Comunity Action accomplishes with a staff worth significantly more that they are paid, and despite recent cuts in state support. Ninety percent of the families completing CCA's Stepping Stones transitional housing program move on to permanent housing, well on their way to self-sufficiency.
Christian Community Action Inc	24741	9	/users/profile/25752	gerbil	Volunteer	5	12/21/2009	Christian Community Action is an excellent organization in providing food and shelter, along with counselling and guidance for those unfortumate souls, usually young families, who are poor in New Haven.  I am a recently retired surgeon, and I got to know about CCA  some 38 years agothrough my church and my medical practice where I and my partners took care of some of the people who were being, or had been helped through CCA.  I came to know some of the directors, and have been greatly impressed by the dedication, commitment and hard work ethic of Bonita Grubbs, who has been the Executive Director for over 20 years.  Some of the people who have been helped there and have put together their lives with CCA's help include a young man and his son (aged 4) who works now at Yale's Calhoun College Dining Room, where I am a Fellow.  When I retired from my surgical practice three years ago, I have gotten also to know a number of the people who work at CCA.  Some of them have come to work there after having been helped by the agency out of problems of homelessness, and indeed one out of destructive drug addiction to put together lives that are productive.  CCA's Stepping Stone program (that is one of three apartment houses which are owned/managed by CCA for families who have lost their jobs, and subsequently become homeless) is able to offer these families a place, and also counseling, guidance, job training.  And CCA has a 90% success rate in getting them back, employed and in their own homes.  Right now in this economy there are waiting lists for all the apartments what we have.  William B.

Christian Community Action Inc	24381	1	/users/profile/25451	Bigal	Former Volunteer	4	12/17/2009	I have been involved with Christian Community Action for more than 30 years.  I started as a bilingual volunteer and then served on its Development Committee and then the Board. What I like most about CCA is that requires the families it helps to work hard to regain their economic independence.  It basically says to these families, "If you want to improve your lives and are willing to work hard to do so, we are willing to do all we can to help."  It also has evolved from an organization focused on immediate needs, such as food and shelter, to one that seeks to address the underlying causes of hunger, poverty and homelessness
Christian Community Action Inc	23320	1	/users/profile/24396	oneofmanyvolunteers	Board Member	5	12/03/2009	Volunteered bagging food for Thanksgiving distribution for at least 15 years.  This has expanded and been organized to become almost effortless the last few years.  But still fun!  This year, volunteer groups were able to switch off on tasks so the work continued... packing about 1200 bags of food in about 5 hours, and more on Sunday.I have also been a board member for ten years.  CCA has continued to meet the needs of the area residents while maintaining its core mission.  Over time this has expanded from emergency food and housing, to 2-year transitional housing, to advocacy training of transitional housing and neighborhood residents.  All on a relatively small budget and staff.

I have pounded nails, blessed newly completed homes and attend many functions that supported their ministry. I am the Rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Minden, LA and our parish has actively supported their ministry financially many years.  Members have volunteered in the building and rehabilitating of properties.  We have hosted dinners for workers, especially those college students who come to Webster Parish for their spring break to volunteer to help provide affordable housing. This is an outstanding organization working tirelessly to assist people who can not afford to live in decent housing any other way. The Rev.

Webster Parish is a rural community in which the vast majority of citizens are low-income families.  This organization is the only agency building homes that are affordable to these citizens.  It has affected the lives of many families over the years and just recently completed the 3rd annual Millard Fuller Legacy Build in which 8 new homes were constructed and 7 existing homes were rehabilitated.  This organization works with families and volunteers to provide decent, affordable housing for families that have been mentored in home ownership and home maintenance, thus taking the first steps in lifting them out of poverty.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/22/2011	I've been the executive director of this local housing ministry for 12 and a half years.  Beginning life in 1991 as North Webster Habitat for Humanity, we were able to assist only four families in eight years to move into simple, decent housing.  Realizing the need to serve people throughout our parish (county), we became Webster Habitat for Humanity in 2001, and in 2007 we followed Millard Fuller (founder of Habitat for Humaity) as he built a new housing ministry - The Fuller Center for Housing.     Through our 20-year history, we have now been able to help almost 70 families to move from substandard living conditions to simple, decent housing.  We have built a total of 46 new houses and rehabilitated 20 existing houses.  Almost 200 lives have been improved by the efforts of our non-profit housing ministry.    We have been blessed to be able to see homeowner families who thrived in their new living conditions.  We have been pleased to see children of homeowners who have completed high school, gone on to college and received degrees, and have established a firm place for themselves in society.   We have been blessed to see some of our homeowners themselves  reach for higher goals and achieve them - at least in part because of their improved living conditions.   And we have been blessed to have involved literally thousands of volunteers - from teenagers to senior citizens, college groups, church groups, prison partners, and teams of people who did not even know each other - who have discovered or reinforced in themselves the profound satisfaction that comes from helping someone else to improve their life.

As a guest of the caf, I am delighted to watch the training of the young people who are committed to doing the work to change the course of their lives - whether it be within the hospitality industry, as future university students, or as entrepreneurs.   From the moment these young people proudly bring you to your table, one can tell that the depth and scope of the life and employment training that goes on behind the caf scene is successful!  The support offered by the training staff seems extremely respectful as they guide the youth.  Even as a customer, one can tell the pride that the students have in their efforts.  Well done! Oh!

Recently visited as a guest, and lunch for 2 came to almost $40.  Second - not sure about "life skills", but teaching young black New Orleanians to be restaurant waiters and servers -- give me a break!  This is a joke.  Heard these kids are considerably under-paid and NOT allowed to keep their tips.  What a shame, especially with ALL the money that appears to be pouring in each day this place is open for BUSINESS.  Just walk in and take a look around.  Want to know how to get rich running a non-profit?  My guess is these guys have the answer.

Common Ground Relief, Inc.	196728	1	/users/profile/257145	Clevelandnonprofitprofessional	Volunteer	2	03/30/2014	My background is in nonprofit administration and I have spent several years managing volunteers on service sites, particularly in the south and in regards to Katrina recovery. I recently spent a week working with college students at Common Ground Relief. I was largely disappointed with the lack of organization and respect for volunteers. We showed up in the morning when asked, but would spent easily 1-2 hours each day waiting for staff to eat, figure out the plans for the day, get the tools together, and finally get our students working to the appropriate site to begin working. At most, we would work 4 hours each day, despite our communicated desire to work about 8 hours most days. A majority of our work wasn't focused in the Lower Ninth, despite the obvious need there - although days spent working with partner organizations were the only days our students legitimately worked. We spent most of our time with Common Ground moving plants and repotting plants that didn't need it. We were largely unsupervised at Common Ground (which was fine considering the basic level of busy work we were asked to do), but if we were supervised, our site supervisor spent a large amount of time playing with his dog and rarely interacting with the volunteers - or even checking in with the students. I was also disappointed that Common Ground staff, in their introduction to their organization, bashed other local nonprofits trying to rebuild the community, using unfortunate (yet rectified) incidents from 2011 or earlier and blatantly lying, claiming these organizations never took responsibility for their actions, which is untrue. If you are looking to volunteer in the New Orleans community, I would recommend another organization while this one sorts through their transition nine years after Katrina, as exemplified by their decreased funding, extremely broad and unwieldy mission, and inability to manage volunteers.

Common Ground Relief, Inc.	47750	3	/users/profile/48502	zorro	General Member of the Public	1	07/04/2010	Apparently school children are not a protected class of people because Common Ground has partnered with UNITY and the Gulf Coast Housing Partnership in New Orleans to place 42 junkies, alcoholics and transients across the street from John McDonough High School in New Orleans.  The neighbors and parents of the children of the school have told them several times they do not want junkies, alcoholics and persons with crimial records across the street from their homes, church and school.  The only focus Common Ground has is to increase the number of paychecks it can generate for its own organization.  They place people who need a lot of support in a situation in which they have no real support.

I have been a volunteer and mentor with them since it first launched in 2009. The persistence and dedication of the founders is incomparable. They go beyond the call of duty to make sure the kids in the community know and pursue their purpose. They teach the kids about identity, achieving their potential, relentlessly pursuing their dreams and making a difference in the world, starting with their families and community. They challenge the kids to go beyond their comfort zone to achieve their dreams. They expose the kids to national and international leaders who are making a difference in their communities. Every mentoring session, they feed the kids and provide them with transportation as needed eliminating any excuse keeping the kids from participating in the leadership sessions. They also help the kids with admission into technical college or universities post high-school graduation. Overall, I can say they are dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to make sure these kids grow up to be history makers and world changers, not letting their current circumstances limit their growth. If you are looking for an accountable and effective organization to support and be a part of, you don't have to look any further. As a volunteer and mentor here,, you will also be challenged and grow tremendously in your leadership ability.  I recommend them 100%.

Our youngest of 6 children was 2 years old and had cerebral palsy.  The Center introduced him to an intensive weekly program of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  Therapies continued until he was 20 years old.  Today, at the age of 42, he is able to live alone with some attendant help.  He works part time at a local hospital and enjoys the independence and opportunities afforded him by those years of therapy.  He is very much indebted to the CPA of GBR.

The Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission is truly a blessing for men, women and children and families.
Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission	162078		/users/profile/215098	LeeandLisa	Volunteer	4	07/05/2013	My Husband and I have been volunteering at the Shreveport Bossier Rescue Mission since August 2012. We work in the kitchen, the help desk, and with the children during chapel. There is always something to do there. There is always an opportunity to help those in need and make a difference in their lives and it is very much appreciated. The staff is great and they truly care. We love our time there and we will continue to go and serve for many years to come.
Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission	162022		/users/profile/214950	ZHC 0512	Volunteer	4	07/03/2013	I have been associated with the Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission since June, 2012.  I have found the residents, employees, and other volunteers to be very welcoming and helpful.  I have enjoyed the interaction with the residents and value what I learn from each and every one of them.   It is very important to learn each resident's name that I will be meeting with and to give smiles and hugs to those that want them.   I've seen how the ladies blossom when they are acknowledged, respected, listened to and recognized.   I am very proud to be associated with such a great organization.

Lafayette Animal Aid	246241		/users/profile/333519	melindafalgout	Board Member	5	06/24/2015	I am currently the Board President of Lafayette Animal Aid and could not be more proud of the direction that we are growing in. We have the ability, the potential and the obligation to make a chance in regards to animal welfare in our community and we will certainly do so. Our save numbers have jumped from 385 in 2013, to 605 in 2014, and we are currently at 700 lives saved this year. We are very open to our community and also like to give back to our community by partnering with other organizations that are focused on inspiring a healthy community for Acadiana through compassion for animals. We are tackling the overpopulation problem through a multi-faceted approach that is going to actually get to the root of the problem. We have been around for 40 years and will be here "Until they all have a home"
Lafayette Animal Aid	164971	1	/users/profile/219280	HopeForAll	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/14/2013	For thirty years I have been associated with non-profits and I am very thankful that my experience led me to this outstanding organization.  I feel extremely fortunate to be connected with an organization where literally everyone is passionate about what they do for the general welfare of domesticated animals.  Lafayette Animal Aid is an organization that cares for it's cats and dogs on all levels.  They receive the very best of medical care, nutrition, exercise, play, social interaction and human love.  At this wonderful organization each and every animal has an amazing opportunity to heal and begin its journey to find a forever home.  Lafayette Animal Aid adopts its animals to loving homes in its local community and out-of-state.  Their adoption process insures that every animal is adopted into homes that are perfect for the needs of that animal.  Lafayette Animal Aid is a "no-kill" animal shelter that has served its community well for over three decades.  Everyone and anyone is invited to visit this amazing shelter - I promise you will leave with a huge smile on your face.   H. Paterson
Lafayette Animal Aid	141375	4	/users/profile/187671	Bunches M.	Volunteer	1	11/19/2012	Don't bother. They refuse to adopt ANY dog to ANYONE living below the Mason Dixon line. They don't serve the poeple or the pets of the area (Lafayette). The staff says they are no kill, but if its a dog that they think will be there for a while, they refuse it. "give it the pink needle" even when its a dog they adopted out!  They would rather have flat screen tv's for the paid staff to sit around then actually put the money to the animals. There are many worthy organizations in the area...go with one of them.

Louisiana Art And Science Museum In C	28670	6	/users/profile/29714	pam-sills	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2010	LASM is a wonderful place to see quality art exhibitions.  I have especially enjoyed the current still life exhibition by contemporary Louisiana masters.  Other exhibitions that were outstanding included Starry Messenger, Chuck Close, Howardena Pindell, Sam Gilliam, and Faith Ringold.  My grandsons love to visit LASM's hands-on galleries.  They come regularly and always have to spend time making their own creations.The First Sunday program that allows lower economic groups to visit the galleries at no charge and the just added Kids Saturday program that allows chidren 12 and under to visit LASM each Second Saturday of the month are both great ways to introduce LASM to new audiences.  LASM is also a fabulous place for school and camp group visits.  A steady stream of yellow buses drops off youngsters thoughout the year. The Baton Rouge community is indeed fortunate to have such a wonderful family orientated resource! and

This organization has been around for several years but has definitely started from the ground up.  So many people are now being helped in east Houma through its after school and summer programs and the difference is being felt in the local schools as well as the community at large.  Thanks for bringing radical change.

Hope Extreme Inc	100702		/users/profile/124178	mamafabre	Volunteer	5	11/16/2011	I worked as a teachers aid in one of the nearby public elementary  schools in the Hope Extreme area. I saw first hand what an impact Hope Extreme had on providing not only after school tutoring but love and compassion to at risk children in East Houma. The area these children live in is riddled with crime and infested with drugs. It's not their fault and they deserve a chance to make it in this world. Hope Extreme is giving them this chance. I saw faces full of pride and most of all hope when they started this program. It's like they finally belonged to something BIG! Not only are they provided help with schoolwork, but a snack, a safe place to stay and most importantly, people who care! God Bless Hope Extreme!

HIV/AIDS is not commonly discussed in the community. Power of Teens reaches out into the community through partnering with others and creating various events. Its a pleasure to be apart of a organization that cares so much about the community.
Wishing Well Foundation Usa Inc	153604	4	/users/profile/204413	suth	General Member of the Public	1	04/08/2013	this organization keeps calling and becomes argumentative when you refuse to donate.  it's too bad they are not required to check the do not call list. .  Also, if you check them out on Charity Navigator, you will see that their expenses were higher than income.  I really wonder if they are legitimate.

Now they keep calling and I can't get them to understand that I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM MONEY!! Almost all of their money goes into fundraising. They are probably hoping that people confuse them with the Make a Wish Foundation. 
Wishing Well Foundation Usa Inc	92552	4	/users/profile/106206	Samantha W.	General Member of the Public	1	06/28/2011	There is nothing good I can say or find about this organization. Hard sell telemarketing. Few stories of 'Wishes' available online. They say they do the exact same thing as Make A Wish, but judging from this site, at least in 2008 80% of income was spent on fundraising, with 5% of expenses going to the co-founder. That's not charity and good-works- it's a scam to make money while likely getting the locations such as Disney (specifically mentioned in the phone conversation) to pay for the hotel/admission- many airlines will poney up the airfare- so occasionally they probably do put together a 'Wish' to quantify what they do.  I prefer to stick to a more reputable organization. There are limited $ for donations these days- I'd like to know it's going where it's supposed to. They wanted to start at $1500 level of 'giving'- for $1500 I'll go to the nearest Children's Hospital and pick out a deserving child myself and pay direct out of pocket. All $1500 spent on THE CHILD.

PAWS of NE Louisiana is the ONLY group in our area that is truly working towards a solution to the pet overpopulation epidemic. I have worked at their fundraisers, at their adoption events, fostered dogs, transported dogs across Louisiana and Mississippi, and walked the neighborhoods handing out fliers. You won't find a more dedicated group of individuals working so selflessly to end the suffering of the stray, neglected, abused, and unwanted pets of Northeast Louisiana.

Katrina Reconstruction Resource Center Inc dba Beacon of Hope Resource Center	103177		/users/profile/137185	mscrac	Client Served	5	01/11/2012	We came to know of the incredible and selfless Denise Thornton after Hurricane  Katrina.  We live in Lakewood South where all of  the houses flooded , including Ms. Thornton's.  While the entire neighborhood was in shock and unsure how to proceed, it was Denise that led the charge.  It was amazing to watch her work to help all of her neighbors come back when she was in the same dire straits as we were. While most of us were crying, frozen and unable to proceed,  Denise immediately began to help us to organize and get thru the maze involved in attempting to reestablish our homes and neighborhood that Hurricane Katrina had wiped out.While the  people of the neighborhood were scattered and forced into other living situations, Denise slept in her flooded and ruined home. While others were only content to sleep to shut out the reality of Katrina, Denise stayed awake and gathered the information on what we needed to do and how we needed to do it. She opened her home to ALL, to share what she had learned thru her sleepless nights and  diligent research . Denise not only gathered info, but reached out to those more fortunate  and unaffected, asking for items that all could use to begin the process of gutting houses and cleaning up their properties.Denise  was tenacious in communicating with people to initiate the process of returning home .  Her work efforts in this recovery process were amazing and inspiring, and caused a great deal of positive momentum in accelerating the return of families to their homes. To do this for years as a volunteer, pouring her heart and soul into rebuilding our community, was one of the most selfless and charitable efforts we've ever seen.She has  continued on with these efforts and established the beacon of hope in so many other neighborhoods that have also known the wrath of catastrophe. We are very proud of and thankful to our neighbor, Denise Thornton and the organization that she found, The Beacon of Hope. 
Katrina Reconstruction Resource Center Inc dba Beacon of Hope Resource Center	97205	1	/users/profile/113863	marisimo	General Member of the Public	1	09/06/2011	Founded after Hurricane Katrina, the Beacon of Hope was touted as a neighborhood gathering place.  The home of the founder, which is in a very affluent neighborhood, was stocked with gardening tools and office equipment which were supposedly there for anyone in this enclave to borrow.  Having gardening tools of our own and cell phones, we never had the occasion to use any of these things.  The first experience I had with them was the press conference at the original office of the Beacon on Bellaire Drive; it was to be a fair of sorts, providing contracters from all over, experts in all phases of rebuilding, and agencies to give advice on getting utilities back up.   In attending the news conference, all I found were two tables---one half-hearted tile contractor, and something to do with the Sewerage and Water Board.  The main event was the founder's press conference in which she tearfully recounted the drama of her rebuilding efforts.  No help to me at all.....but great publicity for someone who has come up with a non-profit from which to draw a salary. There was a Red Cross organization set up in the driveway of this home and free meals were served at lunch every day for quite some time after the storm; this seemed inappropriate to me since this was one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in New Orleans.   The main gist of the organization at its founding was to get people to get their lawns replanted and kept up so the property values of those that had already rebuilt would not suffer so greatly.  This was impractical for those rebuilding since construction of a home included much wear and tear on the lawn.  It was more efficient to rebuild the home then replant the lawn and landscaping, but many neighbors capitulated to avoid the criticism of the Beacon's leader.  This person used public humiliation to get neighbors to do something with their lawns.  She sent emails to large groups and would single out one family in the email about their lawn not being kept up, when many of these victims of such bullying had extenuating circumstances such as illness or divorce or financial hardship after losing their homes in the flood.  In addition to policing neighbors about their lawns, the Beacon of Hope was supposed to be a resource for information. Our home was flooded by the levee break after Hurricane Katrina and we went to Beacon of Hope twice for information regarding rebuilding snags we had run into.  One of those times, the person answering the phone said they didn't know how to handle that problem and she asked if we would research the issue and find out so she would have that information in the future.  The other time we called they just flat out could not help us.   The neighborhood association meetings in the affluent neighborhood of the Beacon of Hope founder have now become a stage for solicitations for donations to the Beacon of Hope, even though the neighborhood association itself is in need of funds.   My conclusion regarding the Beacon of Hope over the 5 years of familiarity with this organization:  Charity is of minimal value.  Money could be spent more wisely elsewhere.

Baton Rouge Christian Education Foundation Inc	11316	1	/users/profile/13260	bailey	Volunteer	1	09/29/2009	For several years, my children have attended the Dunham School, but recently I removed them from this school for a problem that is widespread, and has been going on for years - bullying.  This school has no written policy in the student handbook, and the Head master was not willing to speak with us or other parents regarding this problem, and did NOT pursue enforcing the school rules on student misbehavior by dismissing the bullies.  This school and the BRCEF are misguided from the top down, and have left the school exposed for legal actions.

I have three dogs and two cats that I have rescued and adopted over the past two years. I just went to them to have them fix them and give them rabies shots. It was very affordable and they were pretty friendly and very busy. You can tell they are dedicated to their work and very helpful. I could never have afforded to have my animals taken care of like that if they would not offer their services so cost friendly. Most people that adopt animals usually can't afford to keep them healthy. Thank God for this place and the people that work there.

Living in a very old part of Baton Rouge we were over run with feral, free-roaming and homeless or lost cats. The population was literally exploding, new kittens were turning up at least twice a year. With the low cost of Spay and Neuter and help from a TNR group that is no longer functioning in Baton Rouge, 13 cats were trapped and brought to BRSN, two weekends later 27 cats were caught and BRSN and all were returned healthy and altered and not one kitten has been born in my yard since. Two other older kittens that did come no doubt in search of food were once again trapped and brought to BRSN. I am so happy and relieved to hear Baton Rouge Spay and Neuter is planning on doing TNR in the Capital City where it is so desperately needed. Mine is just one case, and the impact has been amazing, nothing brings me more joy than seeing all those tipped ears at the food bowls, bright eyes and healthy beautiful coats, no spraying and the cats are so much friendlier. When we got a new puppy last spring once he was old enough we brought him to BRSN to be neutered  and could not have been happier with the service and professionalism of the staff, and loving care our puppy was given at the clinic. This is one wonderful place, I cannot say enough about how happy I am that we have Baton Rouge Spay and Neuter offering the services they do here in Baton Rouge.

Lott, Ph.D., who has Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) requiring her to use a wheelchair and a ventilator, is awarding scholarships to people with physical disabilities pursuing education beyond bachelor's degrees. Few scholarships offer financial support for people with disabilities in their pursuit for certification and degrees beyond the bachelor's level. Since students with disabilities face extra expenses related to personal care that other students do not, the scholarships can help severely disabled scholars defray such costs. The three 2011 scholarship winners are Park McArthur, who has Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD), holds a Master of Fine Arts in Sculpture from the University of Miami, and is in her second year of study at the Whitney Museum in New York City; Rebecca Parten, who has Multiple Pterygium Syndrome--Escobar Type and is pursuing her Masters Degree in Social Work at the University of Michigan; and Philip Soen, who has Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) and is working toward his Masters of Divinity (MDiv), with an emphasis on Biblical languages, at the Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, MS. The three winners received scholarships between $750 and $1,500. CMMS Deshae Lott Ministries Incs Outreach Program increased this years total scholarship award amounts by $1,250.

Childrens Cup	148698		/users/profile/198078	dustinande	Donor	4	01/30/2013	My experiences with Children's Cup truly exceeded my expectations. I was introduced with the opportunity to volunteer after meeting it's representatives at a conference. Their mission was clear to me: comprehensively care for children who were either terribly poor, orphaned by AIDS or both. The facts they shared impacted me, but it was the stories of first-hand experiences that engaged me.  Their genuine desire to change the lives of children in Africa inspired me. I needed to see this comprehensive process of change first hand.  During my first trip to Swaziland, a nation where one in two people are HIV positive, I experienced just how influential this small organization had been. I expected mediocre impact due to its low relatively low revenue and small staff structure, but what I saw were tens of thousands of children being fed, educated and discipled -- a key element in which Children's Cup believes brings true change. Moreover, I saw not only children being cared for, but also an emphasis placed on youth and young adult development. To my surprise Children's Cup offers an internship to develop and train those who could not afford college. Although character development was the essential focus, I saw much emphasis being placed on the skills training, thus helping them acquire employment after graduation. Interns live in arranged housing, which offered better living conditions than the homes from which many of them came. The King was so impressed, supposedly, with Children's Cup's commitment to Swaziland and its youth that he donated the large property on which the academy lies.  Furthermore, its collaboration with other organizations operating in southern Africa was impressive. There was no competitive attitude, no turf war. It was a strong commitment to alliance rather than antagonism. This help me realize that Children's Cup's motivations were clear -- make a lasting difference regardless of who gets the resources and the credit.  I've since returned to Africa with Children's Cup multiple times, totaling 12 weeks of on-the-ground service.  Children's Cup surprised me. It's not a large organization in comparison to the many multinational, globally influential relief organizations available. But its impact is much larger than its size. And for that I plan to stay committed to Children's Cup's endeavors knowing that every dollar spent is making a large and lasting difference.

I wish more people would go outside just for an hour and pick up some liter. It makes you healthier by walking and makes the city look good. Thanks everyone for helping out!

Lower Nine Org	194256	1	/users/profile/244649	smwrld	Volunteer	1	02/13/2014	This review is for Lower Nine.org in Arabi/New Orleans. Not Boothbay.  Having been involved in a number of volunteer experiences, both locally and away on sites, I set out to New Orleans to try to contribute my efforts to help out with the continuing relief efforts post-Katrina, ending up with my joining the organization, Lower Nine.   While their intentions were good, my experiences with them left me somewhat frustrated, as I felt that my time spent there was not as productive as I would have liked.  Having recently spent some time doing similar volunteer efforts in Long Island post Hurricane Sandy, I was fortunate enough to have worked with an organization that I felt really represented a very high standard (NECHAMA),  - as it turns out, they are an award-winning non-profit, so perhaps direct comparisons may be a bit unfair.   Nevertheless, having that basis of comparison leads me to suggest a number of constructive criticisms that Lower Nine could and should consider. To begin with, while I understand that many improvements may be dependent on budgets, some changes  both in terms of work productivity as well as the housing/living environment -  could be made very easily.   During my 10-day stay, I had some issues with how the volunteers and the work itself were managed.  Group leaders were very hands-on, but not as helpful with delegating tasks.   Having spent a considerable portion of my life doing physical work outdoors, I was eager to get started, but was frustrated with the lack of direction and appropriate supplies available.   As a result, too much time was spent unproductively.   As a volunteer, my overriding goal was to end each day exhausted, but fulfilled that my work made a difference.  Unfortunately, that wasnt always the case.  Perhaps I should have voiced my frustration a bit more while I was there, but the organizational hierarchy didnt seem to be readily available for this. As for the living situation, our housing was located near where we were working in the ninth ward.  While I certainly wasnt looking for anything close to luxury accommodations, I was expecting something similar to a cheap, but welcoming youth hostel  a basic and clean environment.  Instead, the house and the yard was unkempt and in disrepair, much of which seemed to be because of neglect, not because any lack of resources.  Costly tools were left out to rust in the rain. Since I left, I understand a deteriorating couch was replaced, so hopefully other improvements will follow. For me, the difference between a rewarding experience and a disappointing one can come down to very little, so I hope Im not coming across as negative.  Volunteering is hard work, and should be.  I feel the role of the organization should be to make the work the focus, and do everything it can to facilitate it by minimizing the difficulties associated with everything that ISNT the work itself.   I will continue to seek out volunteer opportunities, and encourage others to do the same.  At the same time, I hope that Lower Nine strives to improve their standards.  From my time in New Orleans, its clear that the people there deserve as much help as we can spare, and volunteers should have numerous positive opportunities available to choose from.
Cat Haven Inc	27291	1	/users/profile/28339	john-cathaven	Board Member	5	02/07/2010	General InformationCat Haven, founded in 1999, is an all volunteer, non-profit organization devoted to:(1) rescuing abandoned cats and kittens for adoption into loving new homes; and(2) reducing the cat overpopulation problem by actively spaying and neutering cats.  Adoption ProgramSince its beginning in 1999, Cat Haven has rescued and found permanent homes for >5,000 felines.  All requests for intake are handled by our Kitten and Adult Coordinators.  Once intake has been authorized by the coordinator, cats are housed in volunteer foster homes and the shelter, provided medical care and put up for adoption at area PetSmarts (Saturdays 104) and our shelter.  All Cat Haven felines are tested negative for FeLV/FIV, spayed or neutered, tested for feline gastrointestinal diseases and brought up-to-date on age-appropriate vaccinations.  Potential adopters complete an application and sign a binding adoption contract and agree to provide indoor only homes.  Cat Haven will take back any of its adoptees at any time upon request by the adopter.  The adoption fee currently is $90.Feral Cat and Fix-A-Feline ProgramsIn less than 10 years, Cat Haven assisted area residents and felines with spaying/neutering >5,000 felines.  Sadly, in 2009, despite the best efforts of Cat Haven and other small animal rescue organizations, ~10,000 animals were euthanized by East Baton Rouge Parish Animal Control.  This is why we are working to create a spay/neuter clinic for feral cats and cats cared for by low income residents.  The generous participation of area veterinarians and the LSU Vet school helps us spay/neuter ~2,000 felines.  We ask residents to make a donation of $25-35 but appreciate any affordable amount.Shelter Program In 2008 we remodeled half the building to provide a temporary safe haven for homeless felines rescued by Cat Haven and awaiting adoption and to offer spay/neuter services for feral and stray felines under the care of lower income area residents.

Shepherds Farm Child Development And Learning Center	162718		/users/profile/215975	SS. Nugget	Volunteer	1	07/16/2013	The first day I arrived the Executive Director was fighting with her son about gas money in front of everyone. I felt like this was off to a bad start. The place was a mess boxes everywhere and kids running around while the staff was working. The director was always too busy to talk and never come out the office.  Then the bad thing about the center is most of her staff is related to her so if you had any type of issue or concern they would not listen to you at all. So that why I didn't return to the center for 2013 year. Please look into her operation. This is a mess of a camp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was a good experience for him and me as well. This school year that great experience is not the case. The staff is rude and have no peoplr skills, they cant tell you anything you need to kniw about the school or its programs. Every time I go there they are all in a huddle gossiping about something and act as if if you dont existing until they are done socializing. I've had 2 app this year trying to enroll my youngest son and they call and cancelled one and the othe the lady  gave me the wrong date and rescheduled it then gave me another for 3 weeks away  .

By doing so, has raised the  community's awareness of what strengths and resources it has. It has an amazing and loyal Board of Directors and an equally amazing professional staff, led by Tom Harmeyer, who fortunately (for us) lost his home during Hurricane Katrina and evacuated to Alexandria and stayed to become our outstanding executive director of this outstanding organization. He has grown the assets of the Foundation from thousands to millions.  Non-profits invest excess funds, to be used when they need them. Individuals set up personal accounts for the Foundation to distribute as they are directed by the donor to any non-profit. the Foundation also solicits grants and has helped with projects as varied as education,  science, the zoo, the museums, the symphony and other music events, plays and other entertainment, a Holocaust Memorial Park, and more.

New Orleans Women & Childrens Shelter Inc	286617		/users/profile/376687	Lisa_K2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	How Two Med Students Accepted What They Couldn't Change--and Changed What They Couldn't AcceptNew Orleans Women's Shelter Outreach Program, NOWSoutreach.orgI'm inspired by the two LSU Med students who ran for various class officer positions---and lost. They ran for various positions with organizations that limited the number of their volunteers--and lost. They soon accepted the fact that volunteer positions were filled--by others. They couldn't accept not being able to volunteer in some way, so they founded a new organization in 2014 and named it the New Orleans Women's Shelter (NOWS) Outreach Program. In the spirit of inclusiveness, anyone who wants to volunteer with NOWS Outreach can do so. The two med students, along with over a hundred volunteers from the dental school, School of Public Health, Xavier Pharmacy School, LSU Nursing School and other schools provide health education and health care for the women and children residing at the shelter. Programs range from providing flu shots to teaching little kids how to brush their teeth. Every penny of every donation goes to providing health care and education. Med school in and of itself is incredibly time consuming, and I am in awe of the two med students who saw a need in the community and took action to establish the NOWS Outreach Program. Along with their army of volunteers, they provide vital health services to the women and children residing at the shelter. There is nothing more meaningful to me than supporting an organization that relies 100% on volunteer efforts and spends every cent of every donation on health care (e.g. PAP smears, medications, mammograms, health exams, etc.). I get goosebumps when I see the photos of the children at the shelter smiling and when I hear that they're now immunized and protected from getting the flu---something that would not have been possible if not for NOWS Outreach. It is an organization that I whole-heartedly support.

St Martin Humane Society	106804		/users/profile/144411	apc2126	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	I moved to Louisiana two years ago.  From the very first week of living here I was devastated by the unbelievable number of cats, dogs and horses that were abused, neglected and abandoned.  I have lived all over the country and have never seen a community where domestic animals are so disposable.  My first inclination was to run - just leave the state and move back to where I had previously lived.  Then an inner voice directed me to a decision to become involved in the solution.  I decided to volunteer my time to St. Martin Humane Society.  I originally met some of its members at PetSmart where they were hosting an adoption event.  I was struck by how compassionate and organized this group of individuals were.  The key players in this organization are primarily women and they are primarily individuals who have grown up in Louisiana and recognized the need for active animal rescue.  These wonderful individuals came together, and with almost no resources, decided to form a group of foster homes where they could take in rescued animals.  These dogs, cats and horses are rescued from the streets, from people who surrender them, and from shelters where they are slatted to be destroyed.  They care for these animals in their homes and on their property, forming a network to provide each other with support and service.  This wonderful humane society has become well organized and has rescued hundreds of animals each year with very little resources available to them.  I am proud to be a volunteer and to be associated with such a fine group of people.  I am currently a foster parent for rescued dogs, and I was recently elected to their board of directors.  It has been an amazing and rewarding experience.  Heidi Paterson

H O P E Ministry Of Pointe Coupee	195562	1	/users/profile/255670	gloriatutt	Volunteer	5	03/12/2014	I have volunteered and been a donor with HOPE for several years.  I am amazed at what is accomplished with the limited amount of funds they receive.  Pointe Coupee is a very poor Parish and HOPE tries to meet as many of those needs through grants, donations and help from local churches.   I began working with HOPE as a volunteer following a change in leadership at HOPE.  I wanted to be sure that we (myself and my church) were being good stewards of our money and felt I could only do this by being involved..  I have worked the food pantry, uniforms for kids, prom dresses of HOPE, a homeless shelter and anywhere asked as I believe the current leadership has a heart for those less fortunate and often spend their personal money to be sure no one is left on the street on a cold night.  Sure, HOPE has situations from time to time ... all companies and organizations do.  What I have observed is a commitment to make necessary changes and a desire to stay in compliance with the multitude of agencies they work with.   This was my first hands on experience with a non-profit, I had always just sent a check.  It is very different when you are involved and see what goes on.
Happy Trails Therapeutic Horsemanship Center, Inc.	99595	1	/users/profile/120178	Merry Me	Client Served	5	10/22/2011	Happy Trails is a definate God Send. I wish we had known about this therapy a little sooner, but I can't help but to feel it was just in time. Our son Brian was born with Cerebral Palsy and required a lot of physical therapy growing up. One added complication was an area of fluid on his spine that could have either stayed the same, changed for the worse or disappeared. Doctors had to keep an eye on the condition by putting him through an M.R.I. each year to be sure the area of fluid wasn't getting larger, since that possibility would have caused great trouble resulting in an operation to insert a drainage tube to drain the fluid to another part of his body. Every year it looked the same until the M.R.I. that was performed AFTER he started the hippo therapy at Happy Trails when he was four years old.  That was the first reult showing that the fluid on his spine had DISAPPEARED!! And that was only the first miracle. The doctors were also concerned about Brian's hips. Because of the spasticity in his legs, and weakness in his trunk, Brian would tend to want to sit on his calves with his feet facing outward (scissor sitting) - a big no no. He had more stability sitting that way and it was very difficult redirecting him from that sitting position. Also, when standing, his tight tendons were causing his knees to pull inward because of the weak muscle tone. These combinations were wearing down his hip sockets in a bad way in spite of all of the dedication to common but beneficial physical therapy. Then he started therapy at Happy Trails and within that same year the doctors were still certain that he would need hip surgery, however, upon closer examination during the pre-operation M.R.I., it was revealed to them that Brian's hips were in better condition than they had expected, so the operation WAS CANCELLED!!! Now these two miracles may not seem that much to some people, but for Brian, they were huge milestones in his early life. Happy Trails saved Brian from surgery on his hips, and the "unknowns" of what could have arrisen from that fluid that used to be on his spine. And that's just what we have proof of. There are more unknowns that were prevented no doubt, but they didn't materialize since Brian stayed with the Happy Trails program for thirteen years into adulthood, and has since maintained his own therapy as an adult. The clients there at Happy Trails don't just sit on a horse (although just being up there sitting on a horse has it's own mental benefits), they work - even when they're playing they work, like when they throw a squishy ball through a basketball hoop over and over, or turning around to try to reach the horse's tail - it's like they thought of everything possible to get every benefit from that horse. I just can't say enough about the benefits of their program. I still voluteer there when I can. Thank you God for Happy Trails and for using those horses in such a powerfully healing way.

Family Service Of Greater Baton Rouge	100542	2	/users/profile/123051	Coonass	General Member of the Public	2	11/11/2011	My concerns for this organization are financial.  Previously FSGBR had great integrity in their financial statements and provided excellent service to the community of Baton Rouge and several parishes surrounding.  However, the last three years, their quality of service has decreased.  Now I also believe that their financial statements are not very truthful.  A number of employees there have warned me that there has been a problem with payroll taxes and retirement benefits not being paid over the last year.  This should concern all those who donate to this previously fine agency as well as those clients being provided service.
Club Twelve	133898		/users/profile/179660	posey	Donor	1	11/05/2012	I was on the Board of the non-profit for the last year.  I got on the board because of my knowledge of NPOs in the same field as Club Twelve is.  However, shortly after doing this I realized that this organization thought they were Alcoholics Anonymous (which is in direct violation of AA's tradtions and principles).  I found out that they use the name Alcoholics Anonymous to solicit donations.  This NPO does rent space to 12-step groups such as AA, NA, MA, Al-anon, etc., but they legally can't solicit donations using the names of these organizations.  However, they do.  When I repeatedly told them about this I was told they are AA.  However, I know after speaking with the AA state delegate and doing some research I found out I was completely correct:  Club Twelve Inc, is not affiliated or allied in any way, shape, or form with AA.  So if this organization tries to solicit donations using the AA name or AA lingo (such as alcothon) please do not donate.  
Cultural Crossroads Of Minden Inc	191802	2	/users/profile/250327	1mrs.chris	Board Member	5	12/29/2013	Cultural Crossroads owns and manages a four acre estate called The Moess Center for the Arts & City Farm.  They utilize this lush, green food forest by providing the city with it's only Farmers Market. Spring and summers are spent sharing gardening experiences, providing workshops on gardening and offering up space on the four acres for a community garden. We also offer summer art camps for kids called "Earth Camp." While the main mission of Cultural Crossroads is to Unite ALL people through the arts, we have found that the mix of arts and agriculture was a natural for us. Our annual Spring Arts Festival "ChickenStock" is held on the grounds every April providing exposure to the arts in a variety of disciplines. With no arts curriculum in our elementary schools, our arts festival provides many of our local children with their first 'real art experience.  We are a 501(c)3 and are governed by an all volunteer board of directors and executive director. With no paid staff, we give 100% of our donations to projects and programs that support the arts.

Seems that they promise to make payments to Landlords, but fail to tell you that the funding isn't available for a month or so.  Then they tell the Landlord the check has been mailed or that they will have to put a stop payment & re-issue the check.  I waited 9 months for a check from them & was told that the City of New Orleans promised them the funding & failed to do so.  I will never do business with them again.
NEW ORLEANS SPEECH & HEARING CENTER	141735		/users/profile/188109	Callie Fitzgerald	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/20/2012	I have been working with NOSHC for a little over four years.  I have grown to know and love many wonderful children and their families.  We provide screening at many public and private schools.  We provide therapy at several schools and many Head Start Centers.  We have a psychologist located in our building who provides a parenting boot camp and that we can refer parents who have further concerns about their child's development.  We recently opened a new satellite location in New Orleans East so we can better serve the clients in that area.  Additionally, we have audiologists who provide hearing evaluations and hearing aids.  It has made all the difference to me to see some of the children who come in with speech and language delays leave, after time spent with our staff, a more well rounded and confident child.  This past summer we also started an Autism Summer Camp that was a great success and that I think will only blossom more over time.

Humans by educating and lending support to them for a better understanding of the character traits of pigs, their behavior, diet and health and the overall care and needs of pigs as the increasing homes pet across America.   As important with education of society regarding pigs they have also put force enormous efforts to rescue, foster and find forever loving home for those pigs that were abuse, neglected, starved and left alone to die.    Forgotten Angels has given of their time, money and engeries to provide loving and caring support for animals in need.   Rescue work helping pigs is most times a thankless job, appreciated by only a few but the pigs that have been touched by Forgetten Angels will never forget the care they were provided.   Pigs clearly understand what happens around them, the at times cruelty, anger, abuse and hatred for their kind.  The people connected with Forgotten Angels restore the faith, compassion and respect that pigs understand very much as well and from their efforts pigs come to trust and believe not all human are the same.

Unity Housing Inc	47749	3	/users/profile/48502	zorro	General Member of the Public	1	07/04/2010	UNITY moved in with Katrina and it has done more damage to New Orleans than 10 Katrinas could do.  It soon partnered with Common Ground and Gulf Coast Housing Partnership.  These three organizations have "profited" by growing their organizations in the distressed, disorganized state New Orleans was in after Katrina.  They are gradually turning my once peaceful working-class neighborhood into a skid row.  They suck up tax dollars and place addicts, alcoholics and the chronically homeless (a quarter of which have criminal records) unsupervised into my neighborhood.  UNITY/Common Ground's latest scheme is to place 42 of their socially problamatic clients into a building that was donated to them by Gulf Coast Housing Partnership who reportedly got a $2.5 million tax break for the donation.  This building is across the street from a historic high school in a neighborhood that is fighting to preserve itself. UNITY is unwanted in every neighborhood they enter and the neighborhoods let them know it.  Our protests fall on deaf ears because UNITY/Common Ground is focused on increasing the number of people it can hire and pay. UNITY has bought up Google and if you google "UNITY of New Orleans" all you will see is UNITY praising UNITY. This group is a sham and has our tax dollars to use to ruin our residential neighborhoods. By the time UNITY/Common Ground are exposed, no law-bidding people will be left in my neighborhood.
Holy Cross Child Placement Agency Inc	69228	3	/users/profile/75652	Joelle Ziemian	Client Served	1	02/16/2011	Under no circumstances should anyone use this agency.  I contracted with Holy Cross to conduct a home study, and was then informed by my agency out of Chicago that it was suing Exective Director Sally Minshew and asked that I find a new home study agency.  Because I had alreay paid, I was permitted to finish the work with the agency, but with a warning.  How I wish I had listened.   My experience with this agency was one of missed deadlines, glaring mistakes, excuses due to continual health problems and computer problems (the agency's system is so outdated that Windows will not even open attachments), lack of responsiveness, and the most unprofessional attitude I have encountered in my 25 years in the workplace.  "I will get around to it when I have time" is one example of an email I received from the Executive Director.  Time on the phone and interviews at my home included Sally Minshew gossiping about her peers in the field.   Ultimately, because the agency took offense at my frustation with yet another missed deadline, Holy Cross refused to submit two standard, ordinary forms to accompany the home study, resulting in two months of lost time and additional costs.

A program for the slow-minded and slow-witted. Usually if your going to a rehab your mind is open to anything. They are good at what they do, but so is a time share sales person. You'd be better off having someone lock you in a shed for a couple of months. And cheaper!After 4 years I'm still reeling with problems this place caused me. Multiply the price I spent for Narconon Louisiana by 10, and I'd just begin recouping my costs. Majority are legal fees. Their statistics for successful rehab people are very inflated, plus they are derived from their own algorithm. Save yourself grief down the road, don't even consider Narconon.

Access Health Louisiana	274270		/users/profile/363646	shadley02	General Member of the Public	2	12/11/2015	I have mixed feelings regarding AHL. The mental health services are good but the medical care is below par at this point. I understand needing to use a free service comes with some sacrifices but the medical treatment has me greatly concerned. I can't see a doctor in my town's clinic b/c they aren't accepting new patients. I have to travel an hour away to get basic medical care and slightly further than that for tests such as x-rays and lab work. However, after the tests, the results were communicated to me in a less than reassuring manner. The physician's assistant called to tell me that I could stop taking a medication completely but all research indicates that this is extremely dangerous, so I don't know what to do. The second test, regarding a kidney stone, when asked she said, "No stone. Wait, let me look. Yes, it does say there was a stone present." She didn't even look at my results, lied to me, and then looked to make sure she was correct, which she wasn't. The doctor treating me didn't even address the stone issue. She called in a medication that does absolutely nothing to ease the pain of kidney stones. I need a referral to an urologist, urgently, but that was on a Thursday and apparently, all AHL services are closed on Fridays. If you have ever had a kidney stone, you know that it is not something to be taken lightly as they will take you out of commission for days at a time. I need medical care but quite honestly, this level of care or lack there of, concerns me. All of this involves the Slidell office, Hammond office, and Lalli Kemp Hospital. At this point, I sincerely doubt the AHL physicians will be of much help regarding my chronic kidney stones or chronic pain.

Robinsons Rescue Inc	50733	1	/users/profile/51287	horsepuppy	Volunteer	5	08/19/2010	I recently semi-retired and wanted to volunteer somewhere that addressed the problem of unwanted cats and dogs in our area.  After more than a decade of assisting several groups with pet adoptions, I decided to work on the prevention side of this issue and began to volunteer at Robinson's Rescue low cost spay/neuter clinic.  I am completely impressed by the staff, their skill and efficiency, and the care the animals receive. I would not hesitate to bring my own dog or cat there. There is not a wasted moment or penny in the day...everything is focused on the owners and their pets and toward helping our community save lives through prevention.   Our parish shelter euthanizes approximately 1000 animals a month.  If you were to tour that facility you would see that the volume of unwanted pets turned in is horrific. There is simply no where to put them and even though they do have an adoption program, it is a drop in the bucket. The availability of low cost spay/neuter services and community education are the key to ending the senseless euthanasia of so many homeless pets in NW La.  RR serves the public, animal welfare groups and area (NW La.) shelters. The board is superb and many of them have been involved in animal welfare in our area for years.  I just can't say enough good things about RR and the need they have begun to fill in our area. I am so proud to be one of their volunteers.  I would not hesitate to take my own dog or cat there.

Looziana Basset Rescue Inc	136987	2	/users/profile/182940	Basset	General Member of the Public	1	11/11/2012	I never thought I would write a negative review about a non profit but here I am. Recently my husband and I were declined for the adoption of a basset hound from this group.  We were denied for two reasons, one was our age. The adoption counselor felt at 28 years old we were too young. The second reason was that when vet checked, although our current dog was perfectly up to date on his visits our cats were overdue for two shots. I let the counselor know that we would be taking the cats in that same week to get them updated, because although they are healthy happy indoor cats I understood the oversite and was more than happy to be a diligent pet owner and get them caught up. We still had weeks before the basset we were interested in would even be healthy enough to adopt. The counselor found our age and the cats history , even though they would be caught up within a few days to be unacceptable. Now I understand that rescues need to do their research and ensure they are placing pets in the best homes possible and certainly agree with this, however they did not do their research but rather made a rash and un informed quick decision. We spoke to the counselor on the phone once for ten minutes and were never even given the opportunity of a home visit prior to being denied.Had we been we are positive the decision would have been different. There are plenty of animals needing good homes and I know we will find another pet in need that is a good fit for our family, but I am just so dissapointed that now this dog, who is very sick with heartworms, will go even longer without a home and that by doing so the rescue will have less room to take in another dog in need. My family thought long and hard about adopting a new dog, what breed and what type of life we could provide this dog. We intended to bring this new pet to a wonderful doggy day care most weekdays with our current dog, we have a work schedule and resources to provide the best of care for our new dog as we do with our current pets. I can only imagine what other great families are declined like we were. It breaks my heart to think of the circumstances these pets come from and this being my first adoption experience, it greatly dissapoints me to know that good families are being passed up without so much as a meeting. I know it takes time and resources to run a non profit, but I would think that with a little more effort more families could be properly screened and more pets could be quickly placed with terrific loving families, which I assume is the goal. I would also advise that if someone was going to be discriminated against due to their age the organizeation should put an age requirement, higher than my age of 28, on their adoption application. The reasons we were given for our age being an issue were that we may chaneg jobs, start a family or move. Not once was I asked about my job history or my future plans for residency or employement. Had we been they would know that both my and my husbands jobs are very stable and that I have been with company for five years with a great outlook for the future with the company and my husband has run his own business for 10 years since the age of 18. So, while I apreciate the hard work non profits like this do, perhaps there is room for improvement in the system for which they screen potential new families and make their decisions as to who is and who is not fit for adoption. I felt that my experience should be shared and hopefully used as a tool for the group when doing future family screenings. 
Red River Film Society Inc	29157	1	/users/profile/30193	charity	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	Robinson Film Center is a gem!  For years after the closing of Joy's Quail Creek Cinema I longed for a movie theater that showed more than just the Hollywood Blockbusters in a generic corporate environment. The Centenary Film Society provided some relief but I wanted a more consistent (and comfortable!) venue.  Then along came the RFC. I loved being a patron so much I became a staff member! Shreveport-Bossier is lucky to have an organization like this.  Educate yourself about what they do and then support them however you can. The arts matter.

Learn To Live	286751		/users/profile/376821	Amanda_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Volunteering inspired me to be a Nurse!www.learntoliveglobal.orgIt all began with a phone call. When I first talked to Yanti, a woman Id never met, she asked me over the phone if I wanted to go with her to a place Id never even seen on a map, to film an organization Id never heard of. The unrelenting enthusiasm in her voice had me to saying yes before I even knew what I was volunteering for. I was as excited as she was from that first phone call to when I actually met her in person for the first time on the ground in Sapa, North Sulawesi, Indonesia in 2012. I had just flown 30 hours to arrive 2 hours after she had just helped deliver a baby.Working with LearnToLive is a human experience I share with the world through film and photography that I have captured in the remote village clinics run by the LTL clinicians. On the first trip, I was inspired daily by this crew of medical professionals doing everything they could to improve the health and well being of each patient they saw, taking time not only to bandage their wounds, but to ask about their living conditions, their families, and their lives. To say that my time with LearnToLive was an amazing experience would be putting it lightly.In my pre-LTL life, never had I been witness to such waves of compassion, been so moved while filming, or found myself in the midst of so many dedicated individuals. As a documentary film maker, it is my job to follow my subjects and find the story. After volunteering with LearnToLive, I came back with so much more. A renewed sense of optimism for the human condition and the knowledge that goals of this nature are achievable being just a few of the things I gained from the trip. I can say with the utmost confidence that LearnToLive has made a real change in peoples lives, not only in the patients lives, but the volunteers and mine as well.Since that first trip I have grown from Artist in Residence to Creative Director, a position which is a full time unpaid volunteer job. In 2014, so inspired by the doctors and nurses I've worked so closely with, I returned to university for a second degree  this time in nursing. Through volunteering, I discovered that I wanted to be the one to create change in people's lives, to improve their health, and give them the opportunity to live long, healthy, and happy lives. By this time in 2016, I will be a registered nurse and volunteering annually with LearnToLive not only as a filmmaker, but as a health professional as well. To say volunteering with LearnToLive changed by life is a massive understatement, especially when you consider that I met the man that just became my husband on the second Indonesian Health Initiative in 2013!

Community Christian Concern Of Slidell	192764		/users/profile/251730	jcopel	Volunteer	4	01/18/2014	CCC of Slidell has counselors, who listen to their clients' crisis situation, without judging. The counselors often collaborate to give their clients the most effective workable plan to get out of their situations, as well as prayer, additional resources, food and clothing. Our counselors are truly compassionate, as demonstrated with our largest group of clientele, the single parent. Most find themselves and their children in a helpless situation and have never asked for help; we make them feel comfortable about seeking encouragement, advice and assistance. Additionally, we have the Miramon Center, a transitional home for men, for men trying to get up on their feet again. Our  issue with homelessness in Slidell are that we have no shelters. With Slidell at the intersection of I-10/I-12/I-59, we have transient homeless.
Wayfinding Foundation Inc	286944		/users/profile/377016	Tina_H2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	When I was growing up, I knew that I was supposed to go to college. My Mom was the first in her family to graduate with a four-year degree, my Dad was a lawyer. They both took me on numerous college visits and helped me organize the onslaught of college catalogs that rapidly multiplied my junior year of high school. I applied and was accepted to a small, liberal arts school in Burlington, VT where I had a truly wonderful college experience. I loved every minute of it - I did well academically, I was involved on campus and in the community, I studied abroad. I was incredibly lucky. However, when I graduated the economy was in the dumps. I left with a double major in psychology and theater, a minor in English. I wasn't exactly the most employable person. So I spent two years as an AmeriCorps VISTA member as a staff member in the service-learning department at two different universities, one in the Midwest, one in Oregon. There I watched my students struggle through school in ways that at first made me anxious and then made me angry. Students who didn't understand how to fill out loan paperwork signed off to receive tens of thousands of dollars for an education they didn't know if they wanted and that they would have to pay back for 15, 20, 25+ years after school. Students who desperately wanted to stay in school but couldn't afford the cost. Students who weren't receiving any personal attention and just dropped out with no idea of next steps. Students who learned their junior year that they hated their major when they final got to experience an internship but didn't want to change majors because they couldn't afford to keep taking classes. It was terrible. After my AmeriCorps experience I spent four years working with colleges in Oregon trying to provide support to students and staff. I wanted to create real change, however, despite the good my job did it equated to trying to put a Bandaid on severed limb. So, when my good friend and professor Michelle Jones told me that she was starting a new kind of college to address these issues head on, I was 100% in. I've spent the past year volunteering hundreds of hours of my time in support of the Wayfinding Academy. It's a new kind of college - small cohorts of 24 students start by spending their time asking big questions such as 'Who am I?' and 'What do I want to contribute to the world?' in rigorous but adventuresome classes. There are no majors. There are no checklists. The focus is strictly on the learning. And no one waits until their junior year to try something they think they might be interested in - it happens right away. Internships, apprenticeships, travel experiences, and community workshops are 50% of the curriculum. After two years students will understand what they care about, what they are good at, and how to put those together to create a life they love. And all this while paying a cost that's equivalent to a community college. The Wayfinding Academy promises that no student will leave without clear next steps, whether thats a job, an internship, more schooling, or something else. I choose to volunteer my time and give my dollars to the Wayfinding Academy because I think it has the potential to change higher education, to offer a solution for the dozens of students I saw who felt like college was their only option (even when it wasn't their best option) or who graduated and now work jobs they hate all while paying off debt that they can't seem to get out of. I cant imagine doing anything more meaningful for a cause I care so much about. Last month I was hired on to work at the Wayfinding Academy as one of our first full time employees. I'm honored to continue my support to this organization in this way and excited for the future. Thank you!
River City Repertory Theatre	27791	1	/users/profile/28839	charityschubert	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2010	I have worked at River City Repertory Theatre as an actress in three shows: Stepping Out, The Member of the Wedding, and Doubt.  The opportunity to work in professional theatre in Shreveport helped me beef up my resume and gain even more acting experience. I have also been an audience member for many of their productions.  It was always a pleasure to take my mother to see RCRT shows as they are high-quality, entertaining, and thought-provoking.  I am proud to have a professional theatre company in Shreveport.  The people of Shreveport-Bossier deserve access to the arts and RCRT is one more (outstanding!) path to culture, education, and employment for artists.
